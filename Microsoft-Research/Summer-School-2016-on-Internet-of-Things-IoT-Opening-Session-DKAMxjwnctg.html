hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
so I'll not take too much of your time I
will quickly get onto the agenda what we
have to start with is a quick opening
session by phanindra from ISC and I'll
ask yogesh women who is one of the
program committee members for summer
school to invite phanindra good morning
all I'm yogurt symphony from the cds
department and you'll be hearing and
seeing more of me today later on today
and through the rest of the summer
school so I'd like to start off by first
of all welcoming you all to this summer
school guys en tus EDS and I'm going to
invite phanindra a lower thee who's the
chair of the department of competition
in data sciences and he's also a faculty
who's heading the medical imaging group
over here to come and talk to you a
little bit about our department and we
are really excited to be having this
summer school and you might also get to
know a little bit about the kind of
research is going on over here as a
precursor to the rest of the summer
school so funny okay so let me welcome
you all to this department department of
competition and data sciences and I'll
give trick overview of the serious
before i do that i just wanted to
acknowledge the the Microsoft Research
India which has put up the summer school
here and it happens to be that this is
the first time we are organizing as a
new department the summer school earlier
summer schools has been organized in
coordination with GSA and easy but we
are the new kid in the block so we are
very glad to do this once again I would
like to thank iasc I would like to thank
you gauge has put a lot of effort into
making this summer school come to our
department and as well as do all the
things as well as all of you at least in
this part of Bangalore we get up late I
know 934 is easy early so generally
night is it gets up at 10 right so I'm
sure all of you have come with great
enthusiasm I would like to thank you all
for that once again it is also hit early
for us so if it so happens that I sound
a little bit sleepy please excuse me
I again I would like to thank all the
staff of CD s who have put up a lot of
effort into making you good
accommodation as well as taking care of
all their arguments they'll be around
here so at any time you have any queries
anything you want to know about the
department are you want to see around
the department are you want to know
anything please feel free to ask any of
the staff so having said that I will
start off on my introduction to the
serious so the completion of data
Sciences is a part of the
interdisciplinary research division of
my AC if you see iasc structure the
organization as such has about six
divisions and the interdisciplinary
research division is one of the new
divisions which is out there which is
part of the new initiative is embracing
the interdisciplinary nature of the work
I'm sure Internet of Things is one of
that interdisciplinary nature and we are
part of that division and we are one of
the two departments which is a
full-fledged department actually we are
the only department which is under the
interdisciplinary division so that means
that rest of them are more like a center
in nature they are like what your
programs they they they do quite a bit
of you know services kind of a thing we
are full-fledged academic department
which offers economic degrees which have
academic faculty full from lunch and we
are just formed in December 7 2015 and
so we have barely six months into
existence so now you can see some of the
new faces some of the new things that is
going on and again where we were earlier
they were all part of academic wing of
the the CRC which is the building which
you are in so as he also has a lot of
facilities including the case of a
computer which you are seeing they offer
super computing services to the
Institute so the facilities has been
separated out we became the economic
department and I currently share that
economic park and obviously we come
under the faculty of engineering so if
you look at IAC the out of the degrees
doesn't have any departments either it
is awarded in faculty of Sciences our
faculty of engineering so in some sense
we are you know it's good and bad
because no department is there so you
can claim that you're part of any other
department which is out there or which
is doing good so anyway we come out of
the Faculty of Engineering just to be
make sure and we offer mainly three
dance one is a PhD which is a doctoral
program in engineering other one is
ametek research Edler it was called as a
messy engineering again it's a master's
program with pieces so there is a
rigorous thesis which gets done part of
the mpec research we also offer an
interdisciplinary mtech by course work
which is in competition science I'll go
over it little bit more as we as we go
along currently if you look at the
faculty strength of serious we have
about four professors six associate
professor sub highest and purposes and
by an astute standard we have very large
Department 16 faculty members is a
fairly large department average faculty
strength of each department is about 12
so and students wise I'm the comp
national science as I told you has about
26 students including first year and
second year and we have masters by
research which is M Tech Research is
about 80 in PHP we have about 24 and we
are we do get quite a bit of funding
from the government obviously from MHRD
as well as all government funding
sources including DST die pdb TCS ER and
then obviously we also received quite a
bit of funding from the MNCs a lot of
the faculty members do consultancy for a
lot of these including microsoft
research IBM Google Yahoo Boing TCS am
the Intel you name it we have faculty
who are consulting for that and
fortunately we are the only department
which offers admissions in two separate
streams so every department in the is
your offer submissions under its
department stream but we are the one of
the we have the only department which
has two streams which offers admissions
as a two separate entities so one is we
call it as computer systems which data
sciences come under another one is a
compressional science which is
traditionally the computational
mathematics or more injured ones and
obviously all the students at sirius's
are the happy people so you can we can
find them around here right and then if
you happen to see them please do talk to
them and then if you want interested in
more about the programs more about why
they are happy here please do talk to
them right so having said that I will
just get into the little bit of details
about what happens in each of the
programs such that
hoping that at least I'll inspire one or
two of you to be the students here so
the empty competition science is a
unique program it has been around for 10
years and it is a combination of both
computer science and applied mathematics
and numerical methods and as well as one
of the science disciplines we call it as
and it is it is truly interdisciplinary
are combining the numerical methods of
numerical techniques or competition
mathematics with the application of the
high performance computing RNA in a
traditional computer science kind of
computer system serious and then people
get trying the students get trained in
this program and they go through a
rigorous coursework by the way you can
see all the way from numerical analogy
brag to all the way till high
performance computing data analysis
visualization so they get trying truly
to be the conditional experts so the
computing experts which we call it as
and again they have they have to go
through a rigorous eligibility criteria
as well as the admission test coming to
you we do this so they have to have a
valid gates code we take people from all
be b.tech disciplines as well as all
masters of science disciplines in fact
this is the first year as far as i
remember we have just admitted in MSC
chemistry for this program so you can
imagine the versatility of the program
so we expect people to be good in their
discipline have little bit play too much
mathematics and programming and then
they would welcome them we don't expect
them to have a particular background but
we would expect them to have a little
bit slate which you know computing in
general and again we conduct a written
test we have a into you I goes for about
two days period and then not the
interview but the rich industries of the
first day the entry the interviews I
this happens to be on the second day and
essentially they get through this
program and by the way in terms of
acceptance I don't think many of you
realize this we are one of the few
departments in IAS you which has very
high acceptance rates so for example
just to give a number we have about 12
seats where we have offered to about 17
people and all of them have accepted it
generally the acceptance rate for the
emetic program in general for IAC is
about sixty percent so we are well above
the cut-off saw
is considered one of the very good
programs which is doing well in terms of
IEC standards and again they good they
get good placements I have never heard
in my past eight years of being here
that the substrate not being placed so
again so they get placed in very good
MNCs including Google IBM Yahoo they
also go to financial firms like my
concede boston consulting group to do
some financial consultancy as well and
obviously there are few students which
has been the recent trend who are very
much interested in doing for this very
see either at our department are going
into some top universities abroad so
either way so people do have a good a
good play for that and that is turning
out to be about fifty percent of the
students currently are aiming for doing
a PHP either in the Institute are
outside this year has been exceptionally
very good here for the PhD program of
the Department because five of our own
empty competition science students have
become PhD students here so which is a
very good sign and again I told you that
in the research admissions we have two
streams one we call it as computational
science another one we call it as
computer systems again computational
science has the same interdisciplinary
nature computer system is more towards
company systems kind of related areas
and they essentially take electrical
sciences including computer science
conversely our computer engineering
information technology people whereas
computational science doesn't expect you
to be from only from electrical sciences
but they will take everybody who is
having a good amount of domain knowledge
again cambria systems expect you to have
a good amount of programming background
and so this is the in the computational
science we expect that both math and
programming is good again this is for
the PhD and MPEG research and if you are
interested in really knowing about the
program are getting to know what kind of
things get that gets happen hopefully we
are going to have in the after two days
some kind of a poster session by our own
students by each and are so that you can
get to know more about what kind of
research goes on in this department
again we do have a rigorous training
program so we got to do some
screaming based on gate score and then
we have some written component plus
interview just to give numbers they're
not to brag about our own Department
currently there are the conditional
science we have selected about 17 as i
told you that is out of 100 applications
we received and for research we are not
it got the number of seats exactly fixed
but roughly the numbers i can tell you
that we have out of about eight hundred
people we have selected about fourteen
of them so you can imagine that the
selection Rachel gray is really small
and then it so happens that you have to
be really chill towards it and as I told
you it's a good time for you because
anyway you are going to be here for the
next five days or so so please do
interact with the faculty please do
interact with the labs get to know if
you are interested in the department and
as I told you because we are new kid in
the block we do have quite a bit of
exciting things to offer to the students
again just talking about this experience
the unfortunately Microsoft stop the PHP
fellowship but then it was offering the
Microsoft TCS i bein paged affiliates
were won by out our students and we
received even international fellowships
including spie kind of things and again
I I don't want to go into this but there
are numerous best paper award there are
numerous Travel Awards which the
students of recipients of CDs have
received one many challenges again I do
not want a less time just to list the
recent one which is the G Edison
challenge and again after graduation
they also want prestigious fellowships
Mike Humboldt fellowships which is
offered in German again just to talk
about one challenge this is G Edison
Challenger this is about 350 teams have
participated in this challenge that is
mainly about smart things and smart city
so and the person who is closing his
eyes with the French bird is our shrewd
so he doesn't like publicity like us so
anyway so this the team what has done is
that they said bagalur is really bad for
traffic so how to solve this problem so
how to make bamboo learn more smarter so
that we can operate the traffic signals
matter and then make sure that the
go smoothly and in fact out of the 350
teams they have been the runner-up and
including the winner come runner-up they
receive about 25 lakh rupees to
implement this in real time and then see
how what happens in the next three years
and that's so that's a huge thing for
the you know if you are a student you
are receiving your own grab that is also
from a travel agency which he has no
strings attached I think it's a good
time and especially I would like to
thank the faculty and as well as the
students who are doing tremendous job
with this again as I told you there is
going to be some poster session where
you can really see what's happening in
the serious but just to give your
overview as I told you we have complete
systems on completion signs they have
various things that goes on starting
from Mehcad for vlsi a traditional
company-sized discipline like computer
architecture then again we have like
cloud and sorry cloud and distributed
computing machine learning database
systems on the comp additional signs we
have medical amazing scientific
computing so you name it we are a mini
iaac inside our department so right we
all the faculty work and really diverse
areas and really interesting problems as
such so with that I will stop I think I
have taken a slightly over my time I was
given only about eight minutes so I took
them much sorry for that but again I
would like to welcome you all I hope
you'll have a you know fruitful and as
well as product you are somewhat school
here and learn something new and I used
to thank you all thank you very much
good morning everyone can hear me happy
to be here primarily two of us are going
to make your next six days but while
many of you have come from far away and
most all of the speakers are spending
the personal time to come and share
their experience and passion for this
area with you so it's very important
that we take the best out of this and
that's the reason why we said we'll take
some time to give the context of the
workshop and for you to navigate all of
the activities that are going to happen
in the next six days make the best of
the workshop
ok so the content it's all with you you
will see a whole set of lectures guess
tox panel discussions hackathon slight
semantics lectures or more in depth
where it's supposed to go from the
fundamentals about a particular area
guest stocks are by speakers who are
solving a problem today and they are
sharing overview of how and why they are
solving the problem that they are
hackathon is your hands on session
culminating with a project demo and we
also will have panel discussions which
is not the usual thing where the people
on the stage keep talking it is to get
you an additional opportunity to
interact more with the speakers of the
day ok because the speakers have fixed
time slots and the question time I run
over and at the end of each day you will
get to meet them again ask your
questions clarifications and so on
that's the intent of the panel
discussion will also have a present
under hakama director of the Institute
giving you a keynote or tomorrow or he
is also extremely excited about this
area and he actually he has extremely
busy schedule but he said I want to give
a full 45 minute clock ok we said please
come and inaugurate and go away said no
no no i am not going away i want to
share my expertise with this workshop so
too many speakers from diverse places
researchers and industry academics
entrepreneurs are going to be with you
the next six days but this unites all of
them i OT 4q oil any guesses perfect you
will find that that's the reason that
drives people to do what they do and i
want to spend a few minutes as to what
is this quality of life and how I wotty
can presumably impact improves the
quality of life I think that's hopefully
understood world is around us we want
when I say improve the quality of life
there are people who want to have things
better world is a crazy place so are
humans world is analog and before I can
make a change the world I need to
measure the world I need to see what is
there before I can transform the world
the way I want so
essentially I need sensors which read in
analog and B are happier to deal with
the digital so you need to add on with
each of these sensors a bit of
electronics and a bit of processing that
takes this analog values convert sent
does some cleaning up if necessary and
sends it up to to some way some other
some connectivity because what we want
to measure may be far away from where we
are trying to decide things with and I
need to send that across through some
network infrastructure collect this data
have some applications and models which
use this data and in which humans decide
what you want out of this and send it
back digitally which then again use some
electronics and processing you convert
into analog because the real world is on
a log I need to have actuators which
worked with the real world take a simple
example air conditioner human say 23
degrees is what I like so you probably
have a thermal sensor temperature sensor
somewhere which converts that into some
digital in this case the 23 degrees is
probably set with some infrared remote
ok so the network infrastructure the big
name is for using an infrared to set the
temperature that I want and the
computation the data infrastructure all
of that is some cookie thing sitting
there which takes the value from the
sensor and the number from your infrared
and if it is one way or the other starts
activating the pump of their conditioner
to cool the place right nothing really
knew about this and why would you jump
up and down and talk about this IOT such
a solution has existed for how long
probably 5,000 years ago the Pharaoh
finding himself too hard said 15 slaves
come here blow till I feel cool and if I
feel hot we're going to kill off or two
of you and
get by more people right all of it
analog but the essence is the same
comfort whatever i have i will use the
improve my comfort so the nothing here
is new what makes it exciting and why we
are having a workshop is the sheer scale
of things I Ortiz Internet of Things the
scale is that of the Internet what
happens when I have millions of the
sensors from all over the world coming
together with complex things which what
human life has become today and how do I
take decisions and send it back to maybe
thousands of actuators to make the
change that I want this is really the
reason why we are we believe cusp of
something dramatic that's going to
happen and I would tease everywhere if
you read the business news you will see
it is already there but it is far from
it usually hype precedes actual
deployment and scale sometimes the
actual deployment may not happen but the
business news goes on to hide the next
thing okay but most of us feel that
really there is something dramatic that
is going to change and that's the reason
why this whole workshop is set up
because we brought together a lot of
people who are making you know working
on various aspects of it and want to
share it with a new generation of people
who will then become researchers in this
field that's the reason for this
workshop what I wanted to do is as we go
through this workshop it's a huge area
as you can imagine if you look at you
can spend you can actually run maybe
c.d.s will start m.tech in IOT maybe two
years from now it's such a large
interdisciplinary field that in six days
you will not you just have a sample so
it's very important for you to put
whatever lecture or the talks that you
are going through in the context of this
big picture where is this fitting why is
this talk in this workshop what aspect
of it is not covered which I need to
look at so it is now
is called a workshop as summer school
because it is not a seminar where you
come and listen to people and go away
you have to be actively involved in
extracting value and important notion
that you have to remember is levels of
abstraction engineering and computer
science in particular has made such huge
strides because we abstract things out
because otherwise is extremely complex
so you take a topic in this big picture
for example the first lecture after the
tea break is going to be by Chaz is
going to talk about something called a
programming language p ok so we have
presumably come from a all the way now
we are at P the idea of that language
programming language is the highest
level of abstraction we can think about
why do we need it you have if you have
three sensors one here one there I can
act somebody wire it up connected w pair
if I 100,000 sensors I need to be able
to model it I need to be able to specify
it I need to be able to verify that this
thing does what it is supposed to do
formerly through that this thing is safe
formally declared that I am building
this complex system which consists of
thousands of asynchronous entities
hundreds of services there is
concurrency at scale there's no way you
can use the traditional CC sharp etc and
say I'm going to build a system you can
build a prototype and say I have done it
but when you put a system of this scale
out in the world it's like the medical
dictum please don't do harm right first
you can do good things later but to show
to convince ourselves that the system is
not going to do harm it is not enough to
show three pieces and saying this work
this works I run it for 24 hours no
problem what about 10,000 of them
there's no way you can run 10,000 of
them for 24 days and then conclude you
need to have started with the model
which that is where this word
cyber-physical system comes up right
physical things and alone
is digital we are combining them the
world you can model them with partial
differential equations of complexity and
but you are computing in the discrete
world and the scale how do I model this
argue about it and then program it so
that I can then deploy large systems
like i am going to deploy programs in
today say 50 years ago writing a single
program as a task when we are talking
about 5 processors 10 processors then
you're talking about multi-crore
multi-core 300 core 500 how do i
efficiently extract parallelism from
this now we are talking about systems of
hundreds of thousands of end devices
which are autonomous a synchronous and
mostly concurrent so you need a new
paradigm so if you go to this talk when
you start after tea what is this
programming language talk doing here and
with this aspect I'm sure showers will
clarify this but I want at every lecture
look at this and say where is this
fitting it another example if you go I
think run weed is going to talk about
network infrastructure from this set of
devices I have what are the options for
me to connect to the next level what
kind of technologies exist today which
is good for what cost performance
battery life maintainability all of that
will be digging into this particular
block in this diagram your hands on is
going to I think the yogesh will take
you some more details about why there is
a hands-on you will go all the way from
connecting one sensor two one Raspberry
Pi making it work all the way to
thinking about cloud-based Hadoop
program which will manage all this data
from 10,000 sensor you need to
experience all of that history we are
greedy we want to compress all of this
in six days and it is possible to do so
provided you have this that i am going
to be on the bottom
any other speakers are going to talk
about not particular blocks but their
attempt at faking IOT to solve a real
problem to improve the quality of life
okay there is as I know maybe tomorrow
day after who is going to talk about
health care in particular ECG how do I
deliver accurate ECG reading to people
anywhere in the country within five
minutes assuming there is a ECG machine
that we haven't come remote diagnosis
across the country assuming there is ECG
machine in chattisgarh no doctors in the
neighborhood I want a doctor in
Bangalore correctly diagnose send a
diagnosis to the patient within five
minutes which task it has algorithms it
has machine learning it has huge data
connectivity lot of societal issues
medical care so they have a start-up
which is attempting to do just this she
is going to take you through the journey
but on the background you think about
has he solved this problem what has it
done for this how do you know this is
going to work these are the questions
you have to ask and this hopefully will
be the framework it can be one more
example there is a lot of work on
everybody complains about pollution in
bangalore pollution is a huge problem in
Delhi everywhere on all the major cities
and everybody thinks okay if I can sense
pollution effectively then at least I
have data to tell people that we have to
take action so there is a company for
India spend which is trying to do just
this collect pollution data presented to
the decision makers that hey here is a
real problem and by the way this is
where the most of the pollution happens
this is the source of the pollution and
can we do something about it all right
so each of this is designed with one the
scope of the vision that these people
have the problem that they are trying to
solve and their interest and passion in
sharing it with you
ok so I would recommend that you be
alive active so I'll just this is what I
want to emphasize that it's up to you
because all of you are here because you
want to learn and learning happens where
you ask questions and I keep saying the
stupider your question is the better
okay which is a smart question everybody
knows you are smart probably but nothing
else you have not learned anything
yourself the stupidest question gives
you maximum learning not for yourself
all those people around you are afraid
to ask that question right so strongly
encourage you this is not your regular
class this is an opportunity that you
will not get very early and easily
maximize it but what we will not cover
specifically or huge issues by
themselves security of all aspects
security of the data security of people
who are going to be control or impacted
by the systems that you put in place
privacy is another extremely large issue
okay silly liberties that's again a much
bigger thing if I know what everybody is
doing all the time can government misuse
it to spy on you to have big data help
Big Brother Watch you obviously we this
session we this week is not for those
questions but you should keep that in
mind we are talking about IOT for qil
quality of life includes all of these
but by necessity we will not be able to
spend time but should not stop you
asking questions through the speakers
about these if you think that's relevant
to the talk similarly the environmental
impact in particular disposing of
electronics is a huge problem now if you
are going to spray 10,000 sensors on our
field and one of them don't work you can
spray another pie thousand if you have
the money but what happened to the five
thousand which is sitting in the field
who is going to collect them back we is
going to disperse them off
these are huge problems battery
batteries are going to be the biggest
challenge in Iowa th scale one of just
recharging I mean imagine recharging
10,000 units across 10,000 acres who is
going to do that but more importantly
batteries run out of life very soon and
they become poisonous who is going to
get them out who is going to dispose of
them properly in a small Network build
is not a small it's a significant is the
largest network building in the
department making sure every machine is
connected up and running the right piece
of software is a task you have system
administrators to do it but if you are
going to have so many internet-connected
device has spread all over who is going
to maintain an updated run software
that's a different question which you
have not even talked about ok because
these are large scale system things
sustainability is the other question so
most of the talks will be about speakers
sharing their experience but you need to
keep this in mind and I hope you get the
best of it is this in the next six days
ok I ask because yogesh to talk about
the hands-on session and put the rest of
the station in context ok thank you all
the way so I'll start up from where
manohar left all right so this sort of
the big picture architecture you had a
look at so you start for communication
sensing of the environment around view
networking and communication to get the
data out from the sensor to some place
where it can be collected and processed
and since we are looking at large scale
data sets from large-scale i or ii
deployment you have to think about big
data platforms for processing these and
finally I only take some decision making
that actually drive applications and
potentially drive actuation all the way
back to our entire inventory another way
of looking at it and this is something i
feel is intrinsic to iot is that one of
closing the loop right so i RT is only
as imply cuse phul as your ability to
observe and also do something based on
your observation right so this is more
of a functional view that I have where
they essentially observe the system you
orient so that you understand what the
observations really mean so you put it
in context and you take decision
based on that using both the current
data you get as well as maybe historic
data that you have and then you take an
action right that you apply back under
the system and then you repeat the whole
thing all over again and again this oh
da loop it's been around for decades
it's originally came out in the context
of military strategies and so on but
very well applies to not just IOT but
pretty much everything that we do as
human beings also so if you see
something you actually take it in you
process you sort of set it in context
and then you take an action based on
that and to me most interesting iota
applications do follow this kind of sort
of loop so effectively you are trying to
apply this loop on top of the
architecture that you have and in some
senses diod stack of IOT fabric helps
you connect the functional requirements
along with the architectural
capabilities that you have along the
various layers of abstraction right and
are the usefulness of thinking about it
as a stack rather than as a custom
application that you're building for a
specific domain is that it makes the
whole stack the user right so you take
something like pretty much take this is
a networking stack right so you have
your standard five layers back out there
and everyone sort of uses that it's not
sort of specific to a particular
application so you could go ahead and
invent your own networking protocols and
so on but you don't want to do that
right because you sort of want to reuse
something that's already out there is a
standard it's a such IIT fabrics and
stacks help you leverage the same stack
of multiple applications and this again
helps users span different physical and
logical domains be it sort of small
scale deployment of a sensor within a
small building or something that might
work across the entire city scale or
even worldwide right so when you think
about such IOT architectures and stacks
so there's been multiple sort of
reference designs out there so this is
one from the World Wide Web Consortium
this is the group that actually decides
on things like they should EP protocol
and so on and they have simply come up
with that notion of web of things right
it's goes beyond just the internet of
things but sort of web of things where
they talk more about web driven
applications so where you have sensors
that that are connected through device
divers to this kind of a layer over here
it's
gives you a virtual view of what that
sensor is and then you can use a
standard such as gas co / Jason to
actually push some of these sort of
hosts some of these things in the cloud
has virtual identities and then you can
also have sort of either going directly
accessing the sensor or going for other
gateway or bridge routers and so on and
then it's actually store how various
api's are exposed by these things in the
cloud well and you can essentially
access these sensors or actuator pond
them through these ApS rather than
directly talk to the sensor talk to an
API that's hosted on another cloud and
then have that API behind the scenes
talk to the sensor or the actuator right
so there's one kind of a model that w3c
has proposed there are also other
reference models from other sort of
vendors and providers so this one is
from Amazon's AWS they are a nice
graphic so I thought I would pull that
in so here again you have sort of things
that are essentially you have
applications that come in using your IOT
device is the case these are sort of EPs
exposed by various proprietary vendors
you go through sort of things like
authentication authorization and the
device gateway essentially use a
standard protocols like impurity web
sockets and HTTP some of which you'll
hear about later on during the tutorial
and then the data itself might be
processed the stream of information that
you get might be processed as messages
by things like rules engine or even
processing engines and so on and then
you take decisions based on that so this
is effectively your observation and your
decision-making that takes place over
here separately in terms of enactment
you can necessarily have this notion of
virtual entities or entities of device
shadows where they actually have
information about the environment that
they are observing but as a service that
you can that expose on the cloud that
you can query and sort of actuate
through various applications that you
have right so this is the couple of
examples of how IOT stacks work what I
will do in the next few slides is
actually talk about IOT in action right
so the IC camps itself has been having
an IOT project running for about a year
or so right now called the smart campus
project funded by the day T which is the
communication technology ministry as
well as the robert bosch center over
here where we are trying to sort of
prototype a sort of medium scale IOT
deployment at the scale of the campus
right it's larger than just the scale
for building but not as big as a smart
city which is hopefully going to come
down the pipeline right so I'll just
talk to you about what how I RT itself
has some practical value and how it's
deployed in the feet right so that you
can relate some of the abstract notions
that you heard the last half hour with
it's a practical implementation and one
of the goals for us as part of this
project is to actually see how you can
leverage IOT and Big Data technologies
to make things better on campus right
because at the end of the day the
quality of life is what matters right so
can improve the quality of life right by
having this iod fabric work across
campus and a racial target domain was
water management right as we all know
water is a scarce resource the next oil
so who knows what's are going to be
fought a decade from now over access to
water so understanding water consumption
within campus water delivery what a
quality and so on on campus we felt was
important not just for campus but number
on a scale as you scale out into maybe
even a cityscape and as part of that we
want to get a sense of what are the gaps
in technology what are the technologies
available what are the gaps and what are
the practical issues that you face when
you start doing an IOT deployment and
looking at it a bit from Indian context
but because there are unique issues that
we deal with over here so you can't talk
about self-driving vehicles over here
when you can barely get people to sort
of stopped at the red light right so
there are very unique Indian issues that
we have to deal with and there is also
issues of the cost and sustainability
that's involved right you can't go and
will buy a billion dollar solution for a
city when it's not proven in any other
sort of environment such as developing
countries such as outright so you're the
sort of two other goals for us and what
do we mean by spot water management one
of the goals for us it'll actually
understand how water gets accessed from
our local municipalities of BWSSB and
how we actually pump it up two different
overhead tax if you get a chance to walk
around campus you will see this huge
tanks right so that
can have about maybe a lakh or so cubic
liters of water as well as sort of
underground some so these are
essentially the buffers on campus where
water comes in and I'll initially pump
up or down and then from there there's a
little tribute across various buildings
and how do you actually manage this
pumping operation is actually an
interesting problem because if you do it
if you don't do it properly either
they're going to run out of water you're
good are you going to be having too much
water in which case you actually over
pumped and pumping operations take
energy so it's not just water that you
are wasting but energy also or
electricity as a part of that you want
to understand if we can we are
delivering safe water some of the icy
water networks are decades old which
means that you might have leaks it might
have contamination and so on and that's
something that we'd like to understand
as part of this IOT fabric and can also
be more aware of or water usage and as a
result be more sustainable you know what
the usage right so is actually has a
higher three times more than the global
average of water consumption partly
because we have a lot of labs and so on
that use water for cooling or for sort
of chemistry and so on but still we
don't have clear visibility in terms of
which buildings are taking how much
water and if we did know that so we'd
actually be able to figure out is this
400 uniformly distributed or are some
buildings more sort of wasteful than
others right and lastly can be sort of
lower the cost not just for water
consumption but also for Alexis so these
are the broad goals and these are
typically what you would find even if
you scale do a city network right so if
you want to think about a municipality
delivering water to its customers across
Central City these are going to be
similar goals that they have instead of
sort of large tanks in a campus like
this you'll have large tanks that are in
various communities around the city
itself so this gives you a set of this
sort of the ISE campus map so if you get
a chance walk around it so we are
somewhere over here and you have these
various overhead tanks spread across
campus and you also have a bunch of
underground sums that are present and
water itself comes from sort of these
four inlets from within the municipality
and from these four inlets they are
pumped up to the old
tanks and then buffer onto the Psalms
and then pumped up to individual
buildings in terms of the overhead tanks
right and we are looking at a campus of
about 10,000 people 50 buildings of very
diverse uses everything from offices to
hostels to restaurants to health centers
to campus residences and news about 40
lakh litres per day of water which is
fairly large and we use about ten
megawatt of power over all not just for
water pumping but that again is a lot of
energy or electricity bills that we are
paying for mine and this is the
environment within which we are working
so we are mini Township if you want to
think of it in that way and these are so
very various tanks on campus you can
look around you spot any of them in the
next week or so and these are the
underground thumbs where the water is
buffered also right so the goal over
here is to see if we can instrument some
of these pumps and overhead tanks and
get a sense of what the water usage
pattern is and as a result do something
meaningful in terms of actuation also
but this is our view this is the IOT
stack that we have on campus is actually
putting specificity to the earlier
abstractions that you saw earlier on so
we have various types of physical
sensing such as sort of flow meters that
actually measure the water flow through
big pipes that come in from the
municipality and across campus what a
level sensors are actually measure the
height of water within a tank or a sump
so you know how much if you know the
sort of these dimensions of the time you
know how much of water is there you're
also looking at things like crowdsource
sensing that you can use smartphones and
get endless people to actually get you
data in terms of water quality and let's
say this water dispensers and so on and
then you say we have the networking and
communication layer where we are looking
at a mix of various communication
technologies some of which you which
you'll actually hear as part of the
tutorial later on today and tomorrow
where we are looking at things like
zigbee sup kilohertz Bluetooth Low
Energy 3g 2g Wi-Fi so you name it
there's a mix of these heterogeneous
technologies and we're not doing this
just because we can but you need
different solutions for different
environs right so you got we've got a
lot of wooded area a wireless sensor
network is not going to be very
effective right so we got long distance
to cover right
zigbee is not going to work you might
need things like sub gear so they're
looking at so this is given our campuses
in savvy diverse we want to actually try
out what are the right communication
technologies for individual environments
so that when you actually scale out you
are sure that at least these
technologies will satisfy a large subset
of the real world problems out there we
also look at data big data processing
both real-time data processing looking
at archive data processing using things
like Hadoop looking at online analytics
or events looking at machine learning
algorithms and so on and these again and
since we have this feed like feedback
loop going on sometimes you might have
the luxury of waiting for maybe a few
hours or a day to do the analysis and
give a feedback right but other times
you might actually need very low latency
so for example if you are if you want to
control your air conditioning thermostat
right and he said that hey give me the
data I will process it for two days and
two days later I will tell you what the
change to a condition is going to be and
that's obviously got not going to work
right likewise if you want to sort of
control the traffic signals on the
street right you really need real-time
traffic flow information and use that to
immediately change the traffic lights
right so you latency and sort of fast
data processing is fairly important and
this is again something that even guys
will be learning about in the Pretoria
and lastly you have domain specific
models and analytics right so here's
where maybe the specialization
individual domains come in so the
sensors oftentimes and the application
such analytics are going to be
customized to let's say the water domain
or the power domain or the traffic or
you name right but oftentimes everything
in between it is probably going to be
quite gentle right so you're not going
to completely change your big data
platform just because you go from water
to power to track right so these are
more generalized right and then you
actually have visualization and so on
and here's really where the
domain-specific decision-making takes
place right so where you see that hey
maybe the water level on the spherical
tank is low based on these sensor
readings the let me sort of send a
signal to the pump saying that hey why
don't we start pumping water over here
and by the way the moment you start
pumping water the water level in a
different tact the big overhead tank is
going to go down which means i have to
schedule next time water comes to the
municipality i have to make sure that
this big overhead tank is pumped up
first before others so
that's the kind of decision making that
happens over here then it sort of fed
back all the way down here to various
kinds of whether it's two pumps for
water water pump pumping water or it
might be to human beings saying that hey
the water quality in this particular
expense is bad so go put a notice board
over there saying that not to use the
water and change the dispenser over
there right so just to give you a few
examples of the different layers over
here there's an example of a water level
sensor that we have on one of these
underground thumps so they certainly use
ultrasonic signals decision like like a
radar kind of thing to measure the depth
of the water from the rim of the pump
and based on that you'd actually and if
you know the depth of the entire tank
also you sort of calculate the amount of
water over here and not just that by
doing a sampling periodically you
actually get to know the rate of
consumption of water as well as rate at
which the water comes in to the entire
tank itself like in this more
professional version of this over here
right we are also looking at flow meters
proficiently are things like these that
are attached to your big pipe and these
measure what the rate of flow what are
this across these various pipes this
tell you how much water is coming
through the various parts of the water
network and these again have different
there are different types things that
you can actually couple around five
whether actually physically intervening
in the pipe and things the better you
actually have to cut the pipe and put it
in and again there the day and sometimes
sometimes these things cost as much as a
lakh or two per pipe so we can typically
refer to put it only in the main inlets
to the municipality right and here's
where things like crowdsourcing comes in
right so all these meters like all these
pipes have a analog meter right but
analog meter is not good enough to
actually get the data out in a digital
form right so you can either install a
flow meter that costs a lakh or two
right are you can think of a solution
which actually use crowdsourcing right
so some of these meters are by the gate
so when someone comes in through the
gate and they take a picture of the
analog meter and do some automatic image
recognition and have it converted to
digital data that's pushed out there how
you replace one or two lakhs of an
instrument with hopefully getting ten
people in a day interested so they can
take pictures of it spread out during
the day
and voila you actually get reasonable
sort of reasonably periodic data and
reasonably high quality data for real
application while not having to spend a
lot right that's where things like
crowdsourcing really comes into play
especially in the context of India where
sustainability financial sustainability
of context this is another example and
which might be one of the projects that
some of you might be working on if you
choose to is one of what a quality
sensing and water quality especially in
terms of measuring the chemicals in
water is fairly costly to do
automatically using instruments and so
on like a physically deployed instrument
but everyone over here who has taken a
chemistry lab knows that you can
actually have these reagents tips that
you dip in water and things shaped like
a pH strip right and these cost maybe a
couple of rookies right and you have
these kind of strips for different types
of chemicals right so simple alternative
to an instrument that cost center tens
of thousands of the please just actually
give up these trips to people students
on campus you dip it in water may be in
the water fountain that you use
frequently the color changes you take a
picture of that you normalize that
against the lighting conditions and so
on to see what the chemical level is on
the water and then you sort of push it
out of the cloud or wherever where you
take a decision saying that do I need to
notify someone is the level bad enough
that it has to be sort of taken care of
immediately or are things not right so
these are these and other ideas of
crowdsourcing are really relevant in the
Indian context and I encourage you guys
to think about that in terms of
communication we are looking like i said
at different types of both physical
infrastructure networks such as Wi-Fi
and 3g as well as ad hoc network network
such as wireless sensor networks and the
other of the deployment plan for various
wireless sensor networks across campus
so that when you have a underground
sampur overhead tank and you have what
what a level meters installed on them
they can actually communicate back to
the nearest Wi-Fi hotspot and in order
to do that and since these tanks might
be 10 hundreds of feet away from the
nearest hotspot you actually need ad hoc
networks to bring them through right so
these are various Network designs that
we are looking at in terms of deploying
these and these this is an example of
one of the modes which again you'll hear
about as part of the tutorial where it
helps you essentially build your own ad
hoc network using zigbee as well as sub
gigahertz this is a more
like a long-range communication protocol
right and these are simply used for
communicating data from the sensors to
your border gateway and this is an
example of one of the deployments that
we have in the EC building where you
have this overhead tank that's being
instrumented with water level sensor
that comes to various modes it jumps
across all of them through the spearing
network and finally comes to our Border
gate with deserve as berry pie from
where you essentially sort of push out
data to the cloud for processing or even
do on the edge analytics over here and
some of the things that you'll hear
about later on this week is also in
terms of how they actually do a network
design right some of you guys might be
from an EC background where you made all
of this might be fairly familiar to you
but the key is that you essentially want
to do you have to do a fabric of on the
site measurement of signal strength and
so on and here again there's a lot of
interesting research going on in terms
of can you do that just based on the
vegetation cover so just based on this
measurement of the distance between
various locations on campus or in a city
as well as a type of presents a building
or a vegetation or it's open roads are
so on any actually build a model in
terms of what the signal strength is
going to be without actually going and
doing physical measurements because
that's going to be family costly and
unsustainable so there's a lot of
interesting research to be done over
here and like I said crowdsourcing is
not something too restrictive just a
sensing but even for communication can
we actually replace a wireless sensor
network to get data from the old hit
tank all the way to the news building
which might require maybe ten sensors
and maybe each of which costs between
the ten modes which cost between five to
ten thousand rupees each with let's say
a Bluetooth Low Energy sort of
broadcasting mechanism that other the
base of the overhead tank that just
sends out the current set of data that
is collected and the data jumps onto
your smartphone if you've got your
Bluetooth turned on and you use your 3g
or Wi-Fi when you have access to it the
push data so effectively you we pasted a
physical network that which you have to
maintain with a crowdsource network that
you don't have to really worry too much
about so that's another sort of
interesting idea to explore and lastly
look
at analytics itself and does a big data
processing we have to look like I said
not just at the volume of data in terms
of Hadoop and MapReduce processing over
archive data but also high velocity data
coming in terms of streams so that you
can do real-time analytics and low
latency decision-making so you can
actuate back onto the actual IOT
deployment but at the same time you
might want to look at historical data to
build models about how two different
systems work so that he can actually
build and a virtual model of different
kinds of behavior patterns so that they
can actually pull out the signal from
the noise because you made just because
you get a lot of data doesn't mean all
of it is useful you're really looking
for the outliers things that are not
normal that you want to detect and for
this you need historical data so that
you can figure out what's normal and
what's not right and clouds are sort of
common infrastructure on which you can
host some of these big data analytics
platforms but at the same time since
things like pies are becoming common
raspberry PI's and our dinners are being
common as your border routers these
actually have non-trivial computing
power as do your smartphone for that
matter right so a lot of the analytics
could very well be done on these edge
devices without actually having to go to
the cloud and looking at how do you mix
these two things together becomes fairly
interesting and this is sort of a quick
picture of the kind of big data fabric
that's deployed for the smart campus
project they have all these modes these
sensors using modes to get data to this
raspberry pi which is your bridge border
gateway and from here sort of things get
pushed onto the cloud using a pub sub
protocol and within their you actually
do things like real time stream
processing using apache storm part of
the data might be archived part of it
might actually be used to drive
real-time decision making analytics and
when we pushed out either as a
visualization to a dashboard or
decision-making back to the campus
environment itself and these themselves
could visualizations or notifications
will come back either through your app
which is which in this case is Android
or your web browser where they can
actually look at how the status of the
entire network is right so I've talked
about crowdsourcing so this is what we
have managed to do on campus again this
is a working project all
progress in terms of using hi OT for
water right and the question one of the
questions for you guys over here as you
learn all these theories and talks
during the next six days is to actually
think about how the this can be put into
practice also and for that we've
arranged tutorials on the first today
and tomorrow in the oven at 300 or so
and part of the goals for us though for
us and in this tutorial is to get you to
understand what tools technologies and
standards are out there if you want to
start building your own coyote
application right and these span two
seconds and standards for sensors for
communication for data processing and
for using edge or cloud resources right
so we're going to try and cover all
these layers in the iot architectural
stack so that you have enough raw
material to actually put an application
together if you want right and we and
besides just teaching you how to sort of
integrate all these pieces from first
principles will also introduce you to
existing integrated platforms for IOT
because some of you guys might say that
here I'll do everything from scratch I
will sort of go by my own sensor I will
take my own protocol and I'll pick my
own Big Data Platform and tie them all
together some of you might say that hey
I am only just in the application just
give me a platform that will do all of
this for me so we'll give you a brief
introduction to some such integrated
platforms that are available also which
meant accelerate your time to a solution
right so both of you are going to get
covered and one thing you're going to do
is given this is a very bad fairly
diverse space right one of the other
interesting things about IOT is that
it's very interdisciplinary thats one of
the reasons why video I oth CD as
basically a part of the industry a
division also right so you need people
with different skill sets so it's not
just a someone computer science
knowledge or EC knowledge or e knowledge
it was going to be able to do you
actually need people complicate right so
one thing we are doing for these
tutorials here because there's a lot of
you and be because we need to cover a
lot of topics also is to have two
separate tracks
so you're going to be partitioned into
two and one set of students and
participants will go to the sensors and
communication track another set will go
to the software and I will extract right
and the goal is to essentially bring you
back together right to actually do
something as a tea right so for people
with maybe ECE or a background might
choose to go to the sensors and
communication track and people with a
CSL IT background might choose to go to
the software analytics fact or the other
way around if you choose to it is really
your call so following this following
these two tutorials up about three hours
each today and tomorrow we're going to
open up the entire set of school for a
hackathon that's going to be running for
the entire week like literally starting
from today afternoon right and the goal
is for you to form teams preferably two
from the sensing and communication track
two from the software analytics back
from teams of four and pick an
interesting IOT application to come up
with and actually implement it
potentially from first principles and
for this will give you a standard set of
sensors there's going to be a little bit
earlier an intuitive sensors will give
you so you can look at those sensors
figure out which ones you want and see
what an application you can design using
that and we give each of these teams or
raspberry pi also so that you actually
have something as a bridge gateway and
hopefully you'll be able to get some of
you some wireless sensing modes we want
to do ad hoc sensing networks you guys
have smartphones and laptops you can use
those will give you a virtual machine on
the cloud so we will try to give you the
basic building blocks and the training
to use them or putting their in IOT
application and we leave it to your
creativity to come up with cool ideas
too I 8804 a direct applications that
you can put together and on Saturday
will actually have a demonstration of
the outcomes for various teams you will
be giving as a presentation and we will
choose which ones are really top notch
right so you'll be competing amongst
yourself
also as a result of it we will also have
mentors to help you out if you run into
any specific questions we'll have a
mailing list which I'll sort of show in
the next few slides where you can ask
questions and team of very enthusiastic
students here at CES and from ECE who
will try and answer your questions
besides also leading the various
tutorial so in terms of the schedule for
the tutorial today and tomorrow so today
it's going to run from three to six
thirty the schedule says six we have
triggered to try and push it a little
bit later than six-thirty so but it is
going to be a very evening it's not just
active learning but it's also going to
be an intense learning that they're
going to have for the next six days so
which means that some of you guys mean
if you really are there like like
thrilled about it and if you want you
might be a play til ten o'clock 11
o'clock every day of the week
participating is hackathon so it's
really up to you in terms of how much
you want to engage and I want you want
to take away as part of this school
right so as part of this today's
tutorial in the sensing and
communication track first we'll start up
the joint session in terms of what the
tutorials have will cover in more fine
detail than what I'm giving you right
now and then Ashish is going to talk to
you about how they actually pick sensor
what are the different types of sensors
how they actually read data sheets for
sensors understand how their how they
work how do you interface them with ADC
controllers what protocols to follow and
so on and how do you actually get the
data from the sensors on to your
Raspberry Pi or through your mode both
directly or through things like Kentucky
and these are going to be hands-on also
so hopefully at the end of this session
you actually played around a few sensors
and maybe a pie or a quantity motor so
on and be able to get data out of that
that you can read and take take it
forward you'll have a brief session on
Android and bluetooth low energy based
on a project that has taken place
earlier on just so that you have some
context in terms of smartphones also
acting as the edge we'll have a couple
of talks on specialized devices for
energy model so one of which is called
jewel water from with an IAC that came
from PE Ibaka's lab here and another
called J plug which is available
commercially that can be used for smart
energy metering so that he can real-time
data about energy loads in
on and we will have tanuja from Declan
also talked about pre sort of pre-canned
kits for IOT which you can go and
purchase if you choose to later on which
give you a set of bread boards and
sensors and so on and integrated with
the IOT back and platform can data Glen
to actually play around with and lastly
we will have both the sensing and
communicate track as well as the
software analytics back come back
together at the end of the today's
tutorial to actually start forming teams
because we want you to get started with
forming teams or the end of todays
tutorial hopefully you have enough
information that you can actually start
matchmaking amongst yourself and start
thinking about project ideas in terms of
what you want and will be here to answer
questions in terms of what resources are
available for you and following that
again tomorrow afternoon you'll have
another tutorial so that we go through
so give each of you guys pies and access
to us your VMs and this again will be a
joint session in the 3 30 or so across
both the tracks and you guys will your
teams will get to know how to access the
pie how to access the azure resources so
that we can get started with your
projects themselves so we'll break out
again for the wireless networking and
communication sort of talks where you
hear about various types of internet
protocols ipv6 RTL protocols using co-op
and impurity which is again ietf and
Oasis protocols for transferring data
things about wireless sensor networks
6lowpan there's a bunch of interesting
standardization going on and the support
IOT specifically right and you hear a
lot about that and hopefully you guys
will also be able to put together a
small wireless sensor network so that he
can pull data from the sensor which you
heard about today and actually get it
onto the pie using a wireless internet
which is about your hands on session so
that's for the sensing and communication
track and the software analytics plaque
which is going to be the other half of
you again we will start with a joint
session and then you will essentially
get a quick overview of accessing the
gate
and a lot of these things are actually
pushed on this tub I will get to that in
the next slide or so and then you'll
hear about various iot fabric software
fabrics that are out there and how even
based architectures are critical for
some of the low latency and streaming
processing that's necessary for IOT give
you hear about upset protocol such as
and QUT data formats and representations
such as sin ml so that when you send a
temperature information from point A to
point B the recipient actually knows its
temperature data and what the units are
and so on without you actually having to
invent your own set of custom standards
we'll talk about complex even passing
where you can actually detect look for
patterns in events that you are
receiving so that if you want to look
for let's say water level suddenly
dropping from a level up maybe maybe 100
centimeters to 80 centimeters within a
very short period of time that
effectively is a pattern you're taking
from a series of events and that way i
send you tell you maybe someone turn on
the tap and product on a top right so
these are interesting patterns that can
help you decide and take action right so
CEP engines help you with that and again
the end of today you guys will join with
the sensing team to form fields and
tomorrow for these software analytics
again once you have the joint session in
terms of using the PI energy or we will
talk about stream processing or
distributor stream passing where you can
actually compose building blocks because
typically if you want to process data
and take decisions you might have to do
some data cleaning data parsing you
might have to do some data aggregation
might have to look for patterns beyond
that you might have to sort of do too
denoising and so on you might look for
predictions and trends to see how the
let's say the water level is going to be
to watch from now so all of this
requires you to compose various building
blocks together and things like stream
processing engines help you propose
various building blocks to get and we
will talk about apache storm which is a
fast data processing platform on the
cloud for this and i will also briefly
talk about using of the edge device this
your smartphone itself you guys have an
android phone in terms of using it as a
platform for collecting data and
publishing into the cloud and so on will
have a sort of catch-all session in
terms of analytic
and visualization so we'll briefly take
you through using are using Becca
machine learning library using rickshaw
for visualization and so on so hopefully
at the end of all of n and lastly we
will talk about the data Glen IOT
platform which are apprised to combine
all of these things into a freak Rand
the proprietary platform that you can
use out of the box right so this is
going to be your schedule for day two
for the software we'll have extract like
so let me read past for a moment and
take any questions if you have at this
point in time okay so I simpler saturate
you guys so how many of you are
connected to the internet right now
through through the is a campus Network
sorry you're waiting for okay so here it
is right I wasn't sure if it went out as
part of your registration packet if not
make a note of this we will make sure
this is written outside in the
whiteboard also in case you don't have a
pen and paper handy so try this out
meaning i haven't tested tested it out
this morning because this is a guest
Wi-Fi icon that's been set up so if you
run into any trouble catch me or vcp
have large group and ravi back there so
you guys want to raise your hands okay
so they are all volunteers from CD s so
if you have any questions i'm getting
access to Wi-Fi or any sort of
technology rated matter you can have a
word with either of 10 and they will
help you with this and as is obvious
this is a campus network which means
make sure you use it family reasonably
don't do things that you wouldn't you
shouldn't be doing okay let's say i'll
leave it at that and there are a couple
of things action items on you right and
that that's this is something that we'd
like you to start doing in preparation
for the tutorial hopefully by lunchtime
or so or over lunch okay so one is we're
going to have we set up a Google Group
is really amazing this for all
participants especially to sort of
answer questions on the hackathon and
tutorial and so on right so make sure to
subscribe to this so just go to this
link and essentially say subscribe and
Raj loop will get requests for
subscription and you'll approve you guys
immediately okay and second get
connected to Wi-Fi here at I
which I give you their society if it
doesn't work talk to me you'll fix it
third if you have a laptop and I'm
hoping many of you do try to get a git
client install learn it as well as an
ssh client and those who are in the
software analytics lack make sure you
have some kind of a Java developing
environment such as eclipse or so on
installed JDK so but some by the way all
of this actually listed online so the
link over here so you don't have to
memorize it this is just as a recap so
that you can look to what's online and
do things on your own and if you choose
to you can also sort of install some of
these additional optional stack so that
it will help you guys both using your
tutorial as well as through the rest of
the hackathon and for the sensing and
communication track there are some
dependencies on ubuntu OS you actually
want to interface directly with their
laptop if not the pie is always there if
so a good 20 s is preferred and if you
don't have it installed don't don't
freak out about it at all we don't want
you to be remaking your partition right
now so just to stencil oh maybe a
virtual hypervisor or something like
that like VMware or Zen and just install
a VM image of ubuntu that should be fine
right lastly everything that you're
going to be going through in the
tutorial are hosted on github so this is
one thing that you might want to
remember github.com / green black which
is the lab I head / coyote school or
just search for github and dream lab and
that will get you to the link and
everything that you are going to be
listening or hearing in the tutorial
including slides codes documents URLs as
well as all these slides are available
in this location right so this is really
starting point as well as internet
connection and laptop that you need to
get all this information so try to get
all of this done by lunch time and
within here you have something called
the common folder like I see if I can
actually pull it up quickly
alright this is really where we are
right so common is really where all the
stuff that we are providing you guys is
going to be over there which means that
those are familiar with get if not just
get a quick crash course online you just
need to go and sort of clone to the
entire folder onto your local laptop and
keep sinking it periodically in case we
keep updating it so this has everything
what you'll be learning in the sensing
tract communication analytics and big
data the slides that we're going to be
presenting all of that is over here
including things like setup for
connecting to the ice in network and so
on it's all posted over here right so
come on this way a local laptop and keep
it handy like the second is this folder
over here and here's where all the cool
stuff that you guys are doing going to
be doing for the rest of the week is
going to be posted right now it's empty
because it's going to start getting
filled once you start forming teams once
you start forming teams create a folder
for your team with your team the team
name and as you develop scripts and
software and so on start pushing it over
here right including your final slides
for the presentation so we want to make
sure that whatever you guys build is not
just available in this hackathon or for
this summer school but it's available in
the public domain for any one of their
to come and use which means that you
guys are actually going to be building
at a possibly of really interesting IOT
applications for the rest of the world
to start using okay all right so I'm
almost the end of my slides so some
other things for you guys to do tomorrow
and later so a former team by hopefully
end up great and drop us a note with
your team name create a folder in get
under the themes folder with your team
name and a list of members that you have
so that we know who are the teams and
how we can reach you and by tomorrow
morning will also give each of your
teams a raspberry pi which you can set
up and install and also access to one of
your vm where you can host things on the
cloud and run things like even
processing engines or stream crossing
and so on like and by the end of
tomorrow you guys should have finalized
your project topic right and that way
we'll know whether we have all the right
senses for you and
we'll also try to assign you to a mentor
so that you can sort of work with a
mentor through the rest of the week as
you start working in your hat all right
any questions before we wrap up this
session
so we so the question was the comment
was a lot of you guys are interested in
both sessions but honestly speaking i OT
is so broad right so for example the
water management project which it seems
fairly small it actually has six
different faculty working on it and each
faculty has over three stores so you're
looking at about 15 or to a team of 24
looking at a single applicant from four
different departments right so i OT is
intentionally into this entry which
means that you have to sort of assume
that a single person does not know
everything right so if we are actually
forcing you to go through these two
sessions so that you learn to compare
various teams and talk to each other not
talk across YouTube satish shall be
recording everything right so but 202
doesn't have the recording setup right
so it would only be over here but all
the material that they're using codes
crib slides references everything is
online right and if it's not online
right now it will be by the end of the
curatorial same sets right so this is
our that online another question
yes so we already have the data sheets
for the sensors online so we just need
to do a sanity check to make sure all of
them are working and instead of ready
process so today during the tutorial the
last session for today will actually
walk you through some of the sensors
that are available so that you can help
design your sort of project around that
so that will be covered as far as you
know that that's how you posit because
we actually want you to be working on
your sort of projects on day three four
and five and a little bit of six right
so so hopefully you'll be spending 3 24
hours after all these lectures working
on your project or maybe before the
lectures start so we want to set aside
time for that and don't want to repeat
the same but all the material is going
to be available online okay so we'll
wrap up with that and satish</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
