you
so it's my pleasure to introduce your
yield to the packed audience here McGill
and I work together in live labs in 2007
and we did a bunch of work with paid
search and so your gills going to talk
about pricing display ads now he's from
he's in our research lab in Israel Thank
You max I will talk about posted prices
exchange for display advertising
contracts this is joint work with Mucha
tenant holes from MSR Israel display ads
are those banner ads that are shown on
web pages and more and more own name on
their apps what they let us do is
effective segmentation of the target
audience according to criteria that are
some subset of large number of available
criteria which can be demographic they
can relate to the browsing history of
the user and they can relate to the
current content content that the user is
accessing I will start with some
preliminaries about the current display
advertising market with motivation and
some basic notation and afterwards I
would get to the actual description of
the market that we propose equilibrium
and how we calculate demand and supply
the the atomic good in the display ad
market is called an end an impression
which is one view of one user of one ad
impressions are sold in roughly two ways
today either through a spot market which
takes place while the user is browsing
or through contracts for future
impression the contract specifies a
quantity of impressions of of specific
segments and a specific timeframe in the
future in which those those contracts
should be delivered those impressions
should be delivered and the market today
of the of contract is very the sparse
very decentralized contractor soul
by bilateral negotiation between sales
force of the publisher in our case our
salespeople and and and the advertisers
the problem with this is that beside
efficiency in terms of economic
efficiency that is of course not does
not exist in this market at all it is it
will also not scale to a large number of
publishers so today we are selling our
own inventory and and the inventory of
some large publishers that that are for
which we are providing these sales as a
service like Wall Street Journal but it
will not let us take a bite of them of
over all of the larger market where lots
of little publishers of apps or web
pages are are selling their own
inventory looking at the literature we
see they are I know of two kinds of
works one is talking about the pricing
of contracts under the framework of the
current of the current decentralized
market these are works that came from a
yahoo and google and there is also work
that came from yahoo which we can say
today that came from MSR that in which
publisher is selling fixed inventory VN
in an auction our goal is to introduce a
market that is at the same time
continuous so trades can occur at any
time not as an as an auction event that
to which advertisers and publishers have
to wait but but something that exists
all the time but on the other hand it
also brings the the economic efficiency
into into this picture so we can achieve
some global optimality of a location at
the end and it is also two-sided so many
advertisers many publishers can
participate easily and the approach we
chose for that is that of
posted prices which are based on supply
demand so prices that will equate supply
and demand on each impression type
beside the advantages that I just
mentioned it will also let us elicit the
demand in response to prices rather than
asking advertisers to report their
willingness to pay for various types of
impression we give them prices and they
tell us what they want to buy in these
prices and this lets us do effective
utility elicitation even if the utility
structure that we assume is pretty
expressive and the second thing it let
us do is to assume it lets us be sloppy
on the incentive side by assuming that
that the players the advertisers in the
end the publishers are price takers
which means that they are not aware or
they just cannot affect the price by
their behavior because there are just
too many players so one pair cannot will
not have any incentive to change his
behavior not to be high to not to behave
optimally because it would not change
the price anyway so they will just
optimize their behavior with respect to
current prices the challenges with this
approach is that first how do we define
the prices we cannot be price every
atomic good because there are just too
many of them we have thousands of
criteria so the number of type of
impression types is exponential in the
thousands we also don't want to take
some subset of the atomic Goods and
price them because then it will be too
specific the chances that we'll get
trades on those exact goods are are slim
and
and the third challenge is that in order
to find prices that equate supply and
demand we have to do some kind of demand
elicitation and we have to consider how
we are going to represent supply
technically our approach would be to
price will solve this price structure
problem by pricing sets of impressions
sets that the demand does not be
distinguished between various items in
this set and this will the actually the
set of prices that will have is is small
enough to be polynomial in the input
that the system gets in the demand that
the system gets but will still be
expressive enough so that so that the
demand cannot distinguish between
between elements of the same price the
same set the problem the technical
problem with this would be that those
sets of impressions that have the same
price overlap and then we'll have to
think about what to do with the
impressions that can fit into 2 into 2
sets I hope this will become create a
clear later and then we will obtain
demand quantities with respect to
current prices so if we have some
initial set of prices we elicit demand
based on these current prices from that
we will be able to extrapolate the
demand or the utility functions as as as
functions of any price so we will be
able to to assess the demand that is
going to be in any other price and this
will let us calculate demand and supply
for any price and with this we can
calculate equilibrium prices okay so a
little bit of notation we have a set of
attributes which are those segmentation
criteria and for example gender income
sports location the space of impressions
is the Cartesian product of the domain
of these attributes the size of the of
this domain like I said is the size of a
is exponential in the thousands so what
we do and we have a size that is too
large to deal with we we define an even
larger space and this is going to be
this space f which includes not only all
the fully specified depressions but also
partially specific all the partially
specified impressions so for example
high-income male would be a would be a
statement in in F because it is a
partial assignment to the attributes
actually F is not that larger than a
it's just we can think about it as
adding the null value to the domain of
each attribute and then taking the
Cartesian domain of those new on those
new attribute to make the Cartesian
product on those new attribute domains
but what this means is that every
statement in F refers to a set of 22 a
set of atomic impression types for
example a high-income male will refer to
all the all the impression types for
each I income is high and the gender is
male and it also gives rise to a
satisfaction relation where we say that
F prime satisfies f double-prime if all
the impressions in the set F prime are
also in the set F double Prime and
here's an easy example if F prime is
high is high income male then then it
satisfies the statement high high income
because any high income L is also just a
high-income person
yeah maybe this should have been domain
prime so this is so I define a new
domain which includes for each attribute
ID define a new domain which include the
original domain of the attribute plus
the null value and now i take the
Cartesian product of this new domain and
this is it so any so f includes all the
full the full specification of so all
the all the impressions that are fully
specified but also impressions that are
partially specified like like high in
camel I'm only specifying the value of
this attribute end of this attribute
Saudi so this refer to any full
specification for which G is a is male
and is a high
okay so these were the preliminaries now
I will define how this market is going
to look like what are the market goods
the demand-supply in equilibrium so we
have some n advertisers a 1 2 a.m. and
we assume that each a that each other
ties AJ cares about some set of demands
statements those are those statements in
F so one other tiser wants to advertise
to high-income females and two male
cyclists and the second advertiser wants
to advertise to high-income females and
to cyclist and two males and the third
advertiser wants to advertise to female
cyclists then we will just take all of
those statements and define them as the
set of market boot so the set of market
good here would be high income females
male cyclist cyclist male and female
cyclist and this is of course linear in
the size of of those of the input that
the system gets from advertisers which
are those which are those the demand
statements and we will just price those
goods so the market will assign a price
vector prices by that they assign the
price to each good indeed now these are
somewhat non-standard market goods like
i mentioned each market good is actually
a set of atomic goods cyclists refers to
all the impressions in which in which
sports equals cyclist in males refers to
all the impressions in which gender
equals male and the the problem is that
we might have male cyclists and which
one of those goods a demand or supply of
male cyclist will refer so this is
something we'll we'll have to answer in
the for now we just say that the
semantics of this good is that if we are
purchasing
male cyclist then we are getting a
guarantee to get an impression or the
male / male cyclist if I'm just
purchasing an impression in which in
which in which sported cyclist then I
don't know anything about the gender for
example so it might be a male or female
or so it's not going T to be random male
or female it's just what it is so it
just provides me the guarantee on those
on those attributes that are mentioned
in the statement that I'm purchasing
we'll see more more examples so it will
get it might be more clear what does it
mean in terms of demand so we have this
set of market goods which we call f1
through F amiga this is d and we know
that that advertise AJ gets utility from
sub sub set some subset of these goods
those goods that he actually mentioned
in that he that he cares about which are
let's say it will index them f1 through
F on a J so he has the utility function
that is defined over quantities of those
omega j goods so it has utility function
u j that is defined over q1 through Hugh
Omega J so some of the market goods are
not mentioned in the utility function of
this advertiser AJ which normally this
is okay because we can just assume that
if the market good is not is not
referred to by by consumers utility
function then it's just getting zero
value from that from that good but this
isn't but this is not the case here
because maybe advertiser AJ wants to
purchase cyclists for example so he's
his utility function refers to cyclist
but then there are other market goods
which are cyclist for Michigan or high
income cyclist and they are also cyclist
so they are part of this market good
that is called cyclists so it's not an
end and we assume that advertise AJ will
get
utility from getting a cyclist for which
michigan is also specified or high
income is also specified because merely
because they are also cyclist so it's
not true that is getting zero value from
those other from those market goods that
I'm not mentioned by the utility
function but what we will do will just
refer to the economic definition of
demand and we'll just leave it at that
for now and we'll show later how this
can be easily overcome so the demand at
prices PI prime given some budget
constraint that each advertiser has so
AJ has budget constraint WJ it's just a
vector of quantities of the market goods
so the so we just stick to the economic
definition of demand it's a vector over
the market goods which maximizes the
utility of that advertiser utility that
is defined over this subset of good
under prices by prime and budget
constraint WJ and and we'll just have to
we'll just assume that the utility
maximization procedure will know how to
deal with with those market goods that
are satisfying the goods that appear in
our utility function we will see later
how it is done and will also define the
aggregate demand as the sum over over
the demand of all the advertisers on the
supply side we are we have an analogous
problem in which supply one supply
impression type may satisfy multiple
market goods so for example a supply may
have high income cyclists and there is
one market good which is high income and
one market good which is cyclists so to
which of these we assign that good well
this is actually completely falls into
the what's called in economics
production market because this
advertiser just it it can be seen as a
production choice whether I produce with
what I have I can either produce one
unit of the market good that is called
high income or one unit of the market
good that is called cyclist and it's
actually a very simple production
problem because we don't need any inputs
and now we can define this the supply at
PI prime as as a profit maximizing
production plan so we'll have SJ PI
prime will be the the the quantities
would be also a vector of quantities
over the market goods which maximizes
the the profit of the of the supplier
and it and we what we what we actually
do we are also pushing here the question
of how to assign the goods we also we
are pushing it into this problem of
profit maximizing production plan and
the aggregate supply is also is again
the sum over the sum over the the supply
of all the publishers so now we can
define market equilibrium which is that
just a vector of prices that equate
supply and demand and what we can also
do is easily show that an equilibrium
exists in this market because we can
take the market model that we just
defined and easily pretty easily reduce
it to what's called an arrow the bra
production economy which is a model
where we have
we have consumers we have producers and
they also there are a few things that we
that we do not need from this more
general model but theory but but but we
can easily we can easily make the
reduction so an equilibrium is
guaranteed to exist under some wild
assumptions like convexity and
continuity of the of the of the of the
advertisers utility and we are going to
have that and and in addition there are
previous results previous literature
that that showed that the equilibrium
prices can be computed in polynomial
time under some additional assumptions
mainly on the utility function and we
are going to make those assumptions to
later but will also have to show in
order for this result to hold that we
can calculate we can actually find out
what is the demand and what is the
supply in polynomial time for any given
vector prices so this this will be the
key here to to be able to calculate to
find equilibrium in polynomial time so
this would be the next section where
we'll describe those demand and supply
Oracle's
so the in order to be able to describe
how we calculate demand we need to first
come up with some model for the utility
function of advertisers how this utility
function looks like so we have this set
of market goods d and we know that
advertised AJ cares about some subset of
this good which is called DJ and these
are f1 4 4 4 Omega J and so we have a
utility function that is defined over
quantities q1 through Q Omega J and
there is some budget WJ to this
advertiser now the first assumption that
we are going to make it's what is what
caused in economics constant elasticity
of substitution I the next slide will I
in the next slide that will describe
what this assumption means in the
meantime I will just give the
mathematical interpretation of that
which is this the under this assumption
the utility function that must looks
like that which is a summation over
weighted quantities where each quantity
is also taken to the power of Rho which
is a constant that is related to this
elasticity of substitution and those
weights sum up to 1 now what what
elasticity of substitution means is
elasticity of substitution is denoted by
Sigma which is actually 1 over 1 minus
Rho so this is this is how these two
parameters relate to it to each other it
refers to how flexible the budget
allocation of or how flexible the
advertiser is in his location of budget
between impression types so on one
extreme if Sigma equals 1 meaning that
the elasticity very small is the
smallest and this happens when Rho is
taken 20 at the limit what we get is the
cobb-douglas utility function and under
cobb-douglas the the budget is firmly
allocated between the goods which are
impression types in this case
so if we have some budget of 100 0 100
thousand dollars and we decided to spend
in given one set of prices we are
spending twenty thousand on cyclists for
Michigan and eighty thousand on on
high-income females then even if prices
will change of any of these goods it
will not change this budget allocation
so if the price of cyclist for Michigan
will go up we'll just we'll just
purchase less of these and we will not
transfer balance it will not cause us to
transfer by a budget between those
impression types and this is actually
completely not how advertisers behave
they substitute all the time between
different impression types when price
according to the to the prices so this
is very limiting and on the other
extreme if the elasticity is infinite so
Sigma equals infinite and this happens
when Rho equals 1 what we get is the
linear utility function and you can see
if we replace Row here by one we get a
linear function and with the linear
utility function there is no notion of
allocating budget to two goods so it is
we'll just get we'll just look it will
will have some utility from each from
each impression type and we will just
get the the combination of or the
collection of goods that maximizes our
linear utility function so if a price of
one good becomes really really low then
we'll just purchase lots of lots of this
of of this impression and and and when
we might not purchase other in person
types at all so we might allocate all
the budget to that cheap impression type
and this is also not how advertisers
work they do care about some the some
balance between the types of audience
that they did they are
a exposed to so what our what our
structure means is that we cover all
this spectrum between those two extremes
so we can take sigma anywhere between 1
and infinite or roll anywhere between
zero and one so the elasticity of
substitution can be anywhere can be
anything as long as it as it is constant
so we only assume that this elasticity
is the same for any pair of goods but we
do not assume a particular value and as
you can see it is much more lean general
than the linear tility function which is
taken as an assumption in most of the
previously of the previous literature at
least when we are talking about such a
huge space like the the display
advertising space the second assumption
that we take is that is that the goods
are gross substitute what this means is
that is that we do not allow advertisers
to express complementarities between
different impression types which means
so we will never saw another ties that
will never be willing to pay for two
forgetting two types of impressions more
than he will pay more than than more
than the sum of what you will pay for
each one separately and none of this
assumption will strictly hold in
practice but what we believe is that it
is close enough what this ghost artistas
assumption let us this is exactly the
assumption that is required to to
achieve this polynomial computation in
in previous literature I will also show
where why this is why this assumption is
required for four
for computational purposes in terms of
the mathematical structure what this
assumption means is that row is between
0 and 1 if rho is less than zero then
then what we get our compliments so the
constant us kissin is a forever either
afraid it doesn't have to be the same
elasticity for everybody
um
so so next is the actual elicitation of
demand how we figure out what is the
demand of an advertiser and let's first
assume that we know the elasticity of a
given advertiser raw and we assume that
the input that we get is a demand vector
at some price vector so we have prices
PI prime out there and an advertiser is
coming and purchasing q14 through q
omega some quantity of each market group
and so now we use what's what's called
first-order condition meaning the we
take the derivative of the of the of the
utility and equate it to 0 so this must
hold at the at the at utility maximizing
demand and it can and in this equation
can be pretty easily obtained it's
called the tangency condition of all the
constant elasticity utility it tells us
about this ratio between prices and the
weighted goods and we are getting we
have Omega minus 1 equations like that
so when I equals 1 and K equals 2 and
and equals to K equals 3 and so on and
we also have we also know that the
better sum up to 1 so what we have our
Omega linear equation equations with
Omega unknowns so we can solve it and
get and get the betters remember that
that what the knowns here are the pies
and the ques because we are getting the
demanded price at price by prime
actually we don't even have to solve the
system of linear equations we can just
start with any better and instantiate
the rest of the bettors and then
normalize it so the so those those
betters sum up to 1 and we also assume
that we have the budget now because we
assume that the advertisers are
exhausting their budget but
by by stating their their demand vector
so the budget is just the sum of the
expenditure of the advertiser in these
prices now initially we do not know the
elasticity raw so in order to be able to
calculate it we need to demand vectors
at two different prices and then and
then what we can do is some binary
search over the values of row between
zero and one for each one we can find
the betters fast and and we'll actually
have too many equations when we come to
solve the to find this vector bettors
and most likely will not get an exact
solution but we'll just find the best
the best set of bettas and and find the
the road that gives us the the smallest
arrow over the battles so um and how do
we get to demand vectors at two
different price points this is going to
be a market which is dynamic which is
prices are out there prices change and
and even though so when another ties it
comes in and gives us the first demand
vector we will not have a very good
assessment of the utility function
because we'll have to guess some
elasticity may be based on other
advertiser's elasticity but then once
price change and we get another demand
vector we can get a much better
assessment and yeah how important is it
so so patient that you can solve or
pit row if only a subset of the question
you change just a few of them you're
gonna get the evidence of this yeah
because actually all we need is one more
equation so even if one price changing
this should be no but we can't I mean we
do not want to assume that only brought
one price change right so the demand
Oracle now first will show that it's
actually not a problem that we have
those overlaps that I showed in the in
the beginning so we have several market
goods that may satisfy single demand
statement will will define the status
Delta F so for example if a statement is
if an advertiser wants to wants to
advertise to cyclist from California and
then there might be two market goods one
is cyclist from California and the other
is female cyclists from California they
both satisfy this demand statement and
what we what we want to do is just
minimize sorry so first remember that we
are looking for the demand set of an
advertiser given the prices this is
completely greedy thing so the
advertiser wants to in equilibrium the
demand set of each advertiser must be
must must give that advertises the
highest profit or the highest game so
what we want to find is the set of
impressions that satisfy the demand of
that that provides the highest utility
to that advertiser at the lowest price
or what I'm saying is that we can safely
pick the cheapest impression type of
this set Delta F and we call this f F
head k for so the the impression type
that is the cheapest way to satisfy the
demand statement FK is f k hat and now
we can get utility maximizing demand
vector in the current prices which means
that we'll we'll just do a maximization
of this utility function given the
budget constraint and this is also
pretty easy to solve again we take
first-order condition we get that that
equation from from from a previous slide
this tangent sync edition now the now
the the betters are known and the pies
are known and what we're looking for are
the cues but we can find it exactly the
same way that we did before instead of
the the last equation the normalization
will not be the sum of betters because
the weather is unknown but will be that
that budget constraint so will after we
instantiate the Q's will just normalize
it according to the budget constraint
suppose I'm the producer so and I have a
female cyclist from California
if dropping the female is cheaper aren't
any never going to drop the ship you
will but this is first of all this is
the demand side we'll talk about the
production in one in the next slide but
you will definitely the answer is yes
but will we just didn't get there yet
this is on the demand side if I'm if I
want to advertise to a cyclist from
California and it's cheaper to advertise
to a female cyclists from California
then i will pick female cyclist in
California because it satisfies my
demand this is on the on the demand side
what you said is true for the production
for the publisher side so when you're
thinking the cheapest is probably the
case that female is gonna be cheaper
because of the word wouldn't be right
not in equilibrium yes so this can
happen on the way to the to the
equilibrium prices in the equilibrium we
will will not even have to it will be a
yeah now I see where you where your
question came from so now looking at the
supply side the problem that will have
here first is to match the supply with
the market goods the market goods came
from the demand this so they supply can
look very differently and what we what
we need in order to answer this question
is some way to represent the supply the
first representation that we considered
is the proposal that came from MSR to
represent supply by asian network i
think i will skip the this is a very
technical part that for which the result
is that we do not we can't we don't know
how to use Bayes networks in this
context in this context so I will
I will skip this part and I what we what
we need in order to to be able to match
the supply with the with with the market
good is what we call the more explicit
that I representation as opposed to the
Bayesian network which is very which is
a concise representation then with an
explicit representation a publisher will
submit a set of of triplets where each
triplet mentions an impression type the
quantity that he has from that
impression type or in and the person
type is in F right it can be a statement
it doesn't have to specify all the
attributes so the impression type the
quantity and and and the minimum price
that you want for these for these
Russian types for this aggression type
the reason I think that meet that
minimum price is needed here is that
it's not true that the cost of putting
an ad is completely zero by the very
least we have to consider the
disturbance to the user so and the key
about this representation is that those
quantities are assumed to be disjoint so
we'll say that the total number of
impressions that in the inventory of
that supplier is the sum over those
quantities we can see it in order to
understand it we can look at that tree
we have at each node we have we are
branching on one of the attributes so at
the top here we branch over the location
and now we say that
and and and for those impression types
that are from Michigan we branch over
the income so we have hundred thousand
impressions of high-income people from
Michigan and in addition we have 300,000
impression of lower versions of low
income people from Michigan then in
addition to that we have hundred fifty
thousand depression for which we don't
know the income 50 thousands of which
have our cyclist and another hundred
thousand we do not know what whether
they are cyclists are not or what kind
of sports they like so so here we have
those 150 and and actually here we have
another hundred thousand for which we
know they are from Ohio but we but but
we don't know anything else and in
addition we have two hundred thousand
for which we don't know this the state
but we know that they are female so you
get the point it's a each leaf here as a
quantity which is Justin which is joined
from the rest of the quantity so we can
just sum up over all the quantities that
we have and this is the total number of
impressions now the the key whether this
is a valid supply representation or not
is whether supplies can even can come up
with such a representation and we
believe they can even though I forgot to
mention that this is work in progress
and some things are not completely
nailed down yet but we believe that this
is that that this representation can be
learned from data this is this actually
looks like a decision tree and it can be
learned like a decision tree when where
the class that we are that this decision
that this decision tree is classifying
on is the price because this supply
actually doesn't care doesn't need to
distinguish between different goods if
they have this the the same or roughly
the same price
so we can assume that we are going
through the logs of the of the type of
impressions that the that the advertiser
have seen in the in the in the past and
we can obtain a price for each such type
of impression just like worrying our own
price structure or if we don't have it
yet we can look at law at bids in the
spot market so we have a price for each
type of impression and we learn this
decision tree and I was thought that
this is because the class is continuous
it is the price then then what we are
getting is actually a regression tree so
we learn this tree from from these from
this past data and what we get is that
we only distinguish between different we
only expand the tree as long as it can
provide the supplier more more revenue
to do so you will not expand it more if
it doesn't if if it doesn't have the
potential to give to give more more
income if at some point we are we will
it's possible that then that some that
some some advertisers will not get the
type of impressions that they need even
though such supply exists because it has
the same price as a different kind of
impression but in that case the price of
that impression type that that the
advertiser really wants would go up so
there will be difference in the price at
some point and then the other tidy the
publisher will have reason to
distinguish between these these are
impression types it's a this makes sense
the this is this is pretty new the idea
to build this as a decision tree so
might this pacifiers more thought
last point was the question I had in my
head so as I understand this is you're
you're you're representing all of the
inventory just moved in a concise way
and the claim is that you don't ever get
the soup that the supplier doesn't care
about distinguishing inventory that
means that neither that there's no
demand that virat assume ourselves alone
yeah well initially it's possible that
you have two types of different goods
which are which have the same price and
somehow so let's say that one advertiser
wants wants wants high-income people
from Michigan and and another advertiser
wants low-income people from Michigan
and they have but but they have the same
price so what the supply does it that so
if they have the same price the supply
does not need to branch here but then
prices will go up because one of these
goods will be in over demand so at least
in the next round hopefully the supplier
will have reason to branch over those
over the income thank you but you need
to know you need to know q for these two
distinctions I don't care about in order
to catch other neck
uh
well what will happen in the scenario
that I that I described is that you will
have some quantity of people from
Michigan you will not have high-income
people from Michigan and then there will
be a demand statement for high-income
people from Michigan which there will
not be enough supply for so the price of
that of high-income people for Michigan
will go up 0 from this from this
publisher you have lots of publishers
maybe maybe the supply 0 yeah yeah so
how do you soon are you gonna need to
take the m into account your split
criterion I don't think so no this is a
M will come will be used in the next
slide but the fact that i have in
different minimum price for these two
impressions types I don't think in
really matters because I will I will in
any case I would only sell an impression
if its price is at least em but maybe
make sense it will it will make sense to
branch so I will supply those
impressions that are but it's not M if
it's considered costs then maybe yeah
because I would want to supply the
impressions that have that are cheaper
for me but at least in our current
cymatics we don't assume that M is cost
we do not we do not in the optimization
here the profit maximization you just
take maximum price we do not take price
minus M if we do which might make sense
then then yes then we should maybe we
should branch instead of the price we
should branch over price minus minus
cost so for each so the supply Oracle
when we have this explicit
representation would be pretty simple
again we find a set of matching market
good for each supply good
so this this is Delta F here this is a
reverse to what we did in the demand
here we're looking for all the market
goods that are satisfied by our supply
goods so if we have a female cyclist
from California then we might have a
this satisfies market good like cyclist
from California or someone from
California and so on and of these we
pick the pick the one with the highest
price and here we have the reason this
is so simple is that our our utility
function is linear here we just look for
the the will we'll just assign the
quantities of our good you know of our
inventory in a way that will maximize
the sum of the prices that we get and we
assign a good to to a market good oh we
assign an inventory impression to a
market good if the current price of that
market good this cheapest price that we
got here is at least our minimum price
now what's left is finding the
equilibrium and I already mentioned that
there is a result that that there is an
algorithm for finding the equilibrium in
polynomial time and we have the supply
Oracle and the polynomial supply and
demand Oracle's and we have the growth
substitute assumption so we're fine
there but the problem is that that
algorithm is relying on the ellipsoid
algorithm that is known not to perform
well in practice so we're also proposing
this simple the tournament like
procedure to find equilibrium it's not
strictly polynomial it's
pseudo-polynomial but it it might be the
case and of course it has to be tested
against the ellipsoid algorithm it's
possible that this one will actually
perform better we start with with zero
prices then we iterate we query over the
these the in each iteration would query
what is that what are the demand and
what is the supply in the current prices
and and once we hit a good for which the
demand exceeds supply then we increase
the price of that goodbye by an epsilon
the reason that this will work is that
first of all when we increase the price
it will never reduce the demand of
another good this is actually the formal
definition of growth substitute so we're
fine there because we assume raw
substitute this is exactly the
definition it roughly means no no
compliments but but not exactly this is
this is a definition that is exactly
exactly came to help computer scientists
when they try to find an algorithm for
for calculating equilibrium and this
exactly matches this definition exactly
matches the this range of elasticity
between bit of overall between 0 and 1
and the second observation is that when
we increase the price of one good it
will never increase the supply of
another good because if a price increase
will cause any change in supply it will
be for more supply of that good of the
the good whose price increased it will
never cause it will never cause any
publisher to to to to move his supply
for to increase the supply for for a
different good so these two together
means that prices never have to be
decreased so because we are only
increasing prices it will never be the
case that we get that that the supply
somehow that will never be the case that
the demand will suddenly that the demand
was higher than the supply and
suddenly it is the other way around and
we need to decrease prices so it's so
it's possible to show that we that this
will converge then do an equilibrium so
I have one more slide which is very not
technical and this is the part of the
work that that we believe we can do
better but for now this is how we
propose that this market will will work
in practice we divide the time into into
into steps into periods and the the
contracts are sold throughout the period
for the next period at these periods
prices and then prices can be
recalculated at the end of every period
according to the supply and demand of
the of this past period so we have some
assumption here that the demand and
supply will be will not change that much
from one period to another so we can use
the prices that we calculated based on
the period that just ended now this is
not going to be exactly the case there
will be excess demand or excess supply
the way to handle excess demand is we'll
have to we'll probably when we calculate
equilibrium prices we will ignore some
fraction of the of the supply so it's
like we'll set aside some some of the
supply and we will compensate
advertisers for unsatisfied demand so if
they if they purchase something in the
in the current prices and we actually
don't have supplied with that for that
they will get some kind of compensation
and if we have excess supply then we we
can still sell it in the in the spot
market but like I said this is probably
too simplistic it is probably the case
that we want more flexible periods not
fixed periods but this is what we have
for now to summarize what we are what we
are trying to obtain is the market in
which we have posted prices for
impression types so
this will give us both continuity and
efficiency it will accommodate two sided
markets where any advertiser any
publisher can join at any time it's
completely transparent everybody knows
what are the prices there are no it's
not we do not need the effort in which
is done today in in to close the
contract for each advertiser step
separately we propose a compact price
structure that is based on the actual
demand and we show that in this market
there exist in equilibrium and if you
can be computed in polynomial time we we
allow rather expressive demand in
comparison to previous literature and we
can elicit this demand just by observing
the behavior of advertisers we do not
need to explicitly ask advertisers for
or go through some kind of demand
elicitation process with advertisers
still have some open points with respect
to the inventory to the representation
of inventory especially whether we can
or cannot use Vasia networks and some
acknowledgments and i'll be happy to
take if there are if there are
additional questions another question of
the Safari so suppose that you suppose
that the
the goods are all atomic right so I have
something one cyclist someone wants
Michigan someone wants income right so
as well so it's not how I use the word
atomic oh I mean they're all as singular
yes like I go one dimensional the man
okay but I have to man for all of the
dolls and bangs and they all have
separate prices just as different prices
oh they all have different plans this is
a tree level
it's interesting question i need to need
to think about it so you will have a
first branch over state and you have you
have some some states that people
mention and then you have the unknown
and then actually i don't think so
because you so you will first branch on
state but then any of the other bruh the
only branch that you will need to keep
expanding is the unknown because for
once you know that someone is from
Michigan you don't need to know you know
anything else this is only sold to this
to this advertiser that wants to
purchase impressions from Michigan now
advertiser that cares about about gender
that would fall into the branch under
the unknown state so you so so you
always hate that have the branch for
each attribute where we say that the
value of this attribute is not known
right there's a what if I what if I have
a Michigan high-income impression and
interested in high income
don't don't have to follow the I mean I
know it's not unknown because I know
what it is I see
you know what it is but it's also
satisfies the other branch the under
branch of unknown so the question really
is how would the decision tree or
regression tree algorithm work whether
it will try to blow up everything or it
will do the right thing and I can't tell
that I thought sufficiently about that
in order to tell you that it will do the
right thing but it's possible to express
it with a compactor II just whether they
the algorithm will actually achieve that
or not I need to anything about because
it does the right thing then you love no
longer have the property that we sum the
leaves you get the total in employee
rights when you get it if you have a
Michigan high-income it's kind of depth
at impressions gonna appear to know no
you will
Wow if you have if you if you extended
both well if you expand it both then the
Michigan higher income will appear under
Michigan high income will not fear under
the unknown high-income question is
whether it so but but what what I was
saying is that you can assign those
Michigan high income to to a branch
where you where you don't know the state
because no one cares about Michigan high
income but but it's like but I'm really
not sure that this this is what will I'm
just saying that you can represent it
through a compaq tree where you don't
even expand Michigan further the cause
no one cares whether someone for
Michigan has his high income or not
so it doesn't have to appear in the tree
but but but but it's at one point I will
have to see whether whether the
algorithm will do the right thing or not
all right okay thanks for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
