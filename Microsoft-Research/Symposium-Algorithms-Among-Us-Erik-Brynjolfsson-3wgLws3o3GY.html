you
so I'm next up it is my absolute delight
to be able to introduce Erik
Brynjolfsson who is the shizzle family
professor at the MIT Sloan School of
Business director of the MIT initiative
on the digital economy as well as the
co-author of the second Machine Age book
which many of you may have had the
chance to read and which is a New York
Times Wall Street Journal and Washington
Post bestseller on the impact of new
technologies unemployment so thanks very
much re okay thank you Michael and it's
a pleasure to be here you know there are
some strange things that have been
happening recently as you guys have all
helped see and contribute to cars are
beginning to learn how to drive
themselves people are talking to their
machines and expecting the machines to
be able to answer back intelligently
machines are beginning to beat humans at
games from chess and space invaders to
tasks like legal discovery diagnosing
diseases reading x-rays and MRIs and so
these are in unusual times but I'm an
economist I also see some interesting
things happening in the economy we have
record levels of wealth there are more
millionaires billionaires than ever
before trillions of wealth have been
created in the past decade at a record
pace productivity is at an all-time high
right now but we also have lower median
income if you look at the person in the
United States who's at the middle of the
income distribution that person is
poorer now than they were 15 years ago
same thing is true for other advanced
countries in Europe Japan Canada the
share of the population that's employed
the employment to population ratio is
lower now than it was a decade or two
ago so there are some indicators that
are puzzling going in different
directions both on the technology side
and in economics and I believe that
these are related that these facts are
not coincidences but that we are in the
midst of a big
transformation of the economy and I
think the the biggest societal and
economic challenge and issue of our
generation and that is the way that
digital technologies and in particular
machine intelligence is going to affect
work and employment in the economy more
broadly so I'd like to talk a little bit
about that now and just to step back and
give a little perspective on things I
first like to ask who here would like to
be able to have the power to change the
world have the power to change the world
anybody any bouquet we got a yes looks
like majority there okay that's good so
so what does it take to be able to
change the world well there's many
different answers to that question I'm
going to take a kind of an engineer's
perspective and argue that changing the
world requires quite literally two
things a power system and a control
system a power system because the world
is mostly made of atoms and held in
place by powerful physical forces and
you need to have physical power to to
change the world but you also need a
control system to decide how to arrange
those atoms how to organize things and
that's at least as important now you
look at the broad sweep of human history
a really seminal change in living
standards occurred in the late 1700s
before that most humans had pretty much
the same miserable living standards and
in the late 1700s that was the when the
steam engine was developed and that
ignited the Industrial Revolution and
since then there have been other
powerful general-purpose technologies
electricity the internal combustion
engine and they all could be thought of
as providing more and more power for
humans to manipulate the world but of
course you still need the control system
and that meant that humans were a
complement to these power systems a a
locomotive without a an engineer
wouldn't be very effective more recently
we're in what Andrew McAfee and I are
calling the second Machine Age and this
is an era where machines are beginning
to also be able to do some of the
functions of the control system to to
augment and odd
made some mental tasks and we all know
the technologies involved in that and an
open question is the extent to which
these technologies will be a compliment
or a substitute for human labor through
most of history machines have been a
compliment and we know that because the
price of human labor went up it was
became more and more expensive to hire
human humans became more valuable but
recently as i mentioned wages have been
stagnating even falling suggesting that
we may not have technologies that are
complementing labour the same way as
before well I want to argue that none of
this is going to be inevitable we'll
talk about that a little bit more in a
while in particular at this conference
we should zoom in on some of the
progress in machine intelligence and its
role and I've seen three big categories
of tremendous change and I'm sure as I
spend more time at the workshop and
today I'll hear about some other things
I should be up to speed on but there's
been enormous progress in interacting
with the physical world things like
vision there's been tremendous progress
in language and in problem-solving just
briefly give you some examples most of
you are more expert on this than I am
we've seen self-driving cars going down
the highway we've got the DARPA Robotics
Challenge where some robots are able to
pick up objects turn dials in some cases
walk up a set of stairs without falling
down in some cases not but there's
definitely been a very visible progress
in terms of some of those basic kinds of
physical tasks and of course a very
quantitative way to look at that is
what's happened with the image net tests
and how much that has improved just in
the past five years or so from thirty
percent to less than ten percent error
rate now i can give you lots more
examples of those categories another big
category is in language many of us as i
mentioned now speak to our machines Tom
Mitchell at Carnegie Mellon has said
we're in the midst of a ten-year period
we went from machines mostly not being
able to understand us to machines mostly
being able to understand us of course
they're far from perfect their
frustrating at times but it's really you
think about it it's a big
milestone in human history to be able to
to talk to your machines and have them
understand what you're doing and even to
speak in different languages and have
them translate it to other languages
like Skype does now or to generate news
stories as many of you know there are
tens of thousands of news stories if you
pick up a newspaper today or yahoo be
careful with who the the byline is often
it'll be someone like narrative science
or automated insights that has written
the story about stock reports or sports
scores that's another something we
didn't see 10 years ago or even five
years ago and last but not least it's
the ability to solve many kinds of
problems that couldn't be solved before
there are call centres now where people
call in and there are machines that are
able to answer most of the basic
questions you take some of the
technology that was in IBM's Watson for
instance can't be used just for
answering questions in game shows like
jeopardy but also all sorts of questions
that you might get in a call center that
of course arm and currently by millions
of men and women but increasingly
machines will answer some of those
questions legal discovery software has
gotten much better and more and more
legal tasks can be done by them in
banking investment advice often more
accurate and more personalized than what
humans can provide many categories of
medical diagnosis if you go out to the
poster session next door you see
hundreds of examples of medical uses for
neural Nets so what does all this mean
for the economy and it's really there
are two broad lessons the first is what
we call the bounty that there's just a
lot more value created than ever before
machines can create enormous wealth and
we've been seeing this for some time now
in with digital technologies for
instance this ad hears from the
mid-1990s at Radio Shack and someone
pointed out to me that virtually every
item for sale hundreds of thousands of
thousands of dollars worth of goods and
services from computers to cameras and
video cameras answering machines if any
of you remember what those who are
telephones of course calculators they're
all available for no additional cost
a bed in a in an iphone or android phone
they're basically apps now and there are
apps that do things we never could have
done before back then there was no GPS
for civilian use the military had some
systems that cost millions of dollars
later there were GPS that cost hundreds
of dollars now I have five different gps
apps on my phone that give me directions
that are far better than anything those
other devices did they include traffic
and other information there are systems
that will help diagnose cancer and
protect skin moles a number of new
things that couldn't have been counted
before what's interesting is that all
those free goods that are available for
zero cost apps or on the web with things
like Wikipedia they don't are counted in
the GDP they aren't part of our economic
statistics because they had zero price
and GDP measures the value of all the
goods and services bought and sold and
so there's a big shortfall in the way we
measure our economic statistics and
economists are beginning to recognize
that we're missing more and more of the
value of our are the real value that is
being created by new technologies and
the GDP statistics ripple into mission
measurement in the productivity
statistics which are also based on the
same national income accounts and going
forward there's a lot more valued that
could be created if you just do a one
percent better match in terms of skills
to jobs that's works out to be about a
trillion dollar opportunity globally for
improved welfare and so there's that's
that's just scratching the surface of
what could be done but the other thing
that's happening in addition to the
bounty is that there's been a decoupling
of wealth from work and there are a
number of economic indicators here I
list four of them that used to be
tightly coupled productivity GDP per
person private employment and median
family income and for most of the
century those rose in tandem there was
literally you could think it was a
rising tide that rose that lifts all
boats as productivity went up
automatically it seemed income would go
up along with it but the past decade or
two they've become decoupled
and in fact as I mentioned earlier
meeting income now is somewhat lower in
the United States than it was in the
late 1990s and that's also a worldwide
phenomena lease it in advanced countries
so that's something that's increasingly
concerning this decoupling of wealth
creation from what's happening in the
middle and bottom of the income
distribution now how is this possible
because I used to think that if you just
made the pie bigger I think the rest of
it would take care of itself but now
it's clear that that's not true in
particular digital progress while it
does make the pie bigger there's simply
no economic law that everyone will
automatically benefit it's possible for
some people to be made worse off even as
the pie gets bigger and thats group of
some people could be quite large
centuries ago it was maybe a few percent
of the population recently it may be
fifty sixty seventy percent of the
population that isn't in the winner's
category economist called the skill bar
is called as a biased technical change
and there are three categories of bias
technical change that are relevant that
is technological change that helps one
group and hurts another group the one
that's been most studied and most
documented is called skill bias
technical change the fact that
technology may make some types of skills
more valuable and others less valuable
in particular more educated workers have
often benefited the expense of middle
and less skilled workers you can see
that with certain technologies that are
introduced that automate some very
routine simple and often lower paid jobs
you can see it in what's happened to the
wages of different people different
levels of education in the 60s and the
earlier than that all groups had rising
wages even if you were a high school
dropout your wages were rising in the
70s there's sort of a knockdown with oil
shock and since then they've fanned out
with people with more education on
getting substantially higher incomes and
wages than people who have some college
high school or high school dropout and
just to calibrate this for you most most
Americans most Canadians are in the
category of some college or less so
they're in the green line or lower in
terms of their
they're educational background and in
particular as we zoom in further the
recent years it's been the middle of the
income distribution not the bottom
that's been especially hard hit both in
terms of wages on the right and in terms
of employment on the Left we see that
middle income jobs have had a big drop
in demand and that has been affecting
both their wages and their employment
and going forward you can see that more
and more types of jobs are going to be
affected so different types of skills
are going to be affected lawyers are not
immune doctors and I'll mune not sure
whether economics professors are immune
we'll find out the second big category
of biased technical change is capital
versus labor people like Thomas Piketty
have written a little bit about this and
for most of history there was sort of a
dance where capital labor that the
shares bounced around a little but they
mostly didn't change too much in fact
this was called a kaldorf act when I was
in graduate school that the labor share
of GDP was essentially a constant but as
you can see there in the past 15 years
or so the labor share of GDP has begun
to plummet while the share going to
capital has risen and this is true not
just the United States but even in
developing countries like China and
other developed countries like Japan and
Germany it also seems to be a worldwide
phenomena and it's only just in the
early stages as you can see from this
chart on the right there the number of
robots in in use is beginning to grow
much more steeply than it did previously
and many of them are going to replace
people like the workers there on the
left there are plans for entirely
automated robot based factories going
forward so that will have a big change
in the capital labour ratio in those
come in those particular companies and
factories now there'll be jobs created
in other locations and the real question
is whether or not that which will be
enough to offset the capital labour
change in the specific places where
these are implemented and you can
imagine not just in factories but travis
kalanick and this is how he really does
talk he pointed out that there's no when
there's no other dude in the car the
cost of taking goober anywhere becomes
cheaper than owning the vehicle and as
you know those plans are well underway
here in the panel about how imminent
that may be and last but not least the
third category I would touch on is
superstars versus everyone else in
particular the very top of the income
distribution digital technologies are
different than other goods and services
in particular once you take a process or
a good or service and digitize it you
can replicate it and make a copy or ten
copies or a hundred million copies and
each of those copies has three
interesting properties they can be
replicated at virtually zero cost they
are exact replicas of the original
indistinguishable and they can be
transmitted anywhere on the planet
almost instantaneously at the speed of
light free perfect and instant are three
adjectives we haven't used for goods and
services as economist most of history
but their standard their automatic when
you have a digital good and that of
course leads to some very different
economics in particular it can lead to
to a power-law distribution of income
and winner-take-all markets here's a
distribution of not the one percent but
the the one percent has their own one
percent and that is the point 0 1
percent and as you can see the share of
income in the economy both the United
States and other countries that goes to
the one percent has been trending upward
quite steeply and there again a number
of reasons for this but one of them is
these digital and network technologies
lead to power laws and much more
concentration in that or they can lead
to much more concentration at the top of
the income distribution so what's going
on well we're having some tremendous
advances in our digital technologies but
our organizations our skills or our
institutions are not keeping pace we're
having a bigger and bigger mismatch
between them in some ways we this also
happened in the industrial revolution
that I alluded to earlier and right now
there are a lot of people who are not
participating in the bounty that is the
the biggest first-order impact of these
technologies and so what is to be done
well I points it to a couple of grand
challenges in the technology side
inspired by those we are putting
together a new grand challenge at the
initiative on the digital economy and
it's inspired by the fact that
digital technologies will continue to
accelerate our skills and organizations
and institutions are not changing nearly
as rapidly and that means that business
as usual will not solve this particular
problem so we need to think hard about
how we can reinvent our economy and our
society to keep up with these changes we
can't use the same institutions that
worked in the industrial age these are
very different fundamentals of the
economy going forward and we have to
think about how to adapt those kinds of
new skills what kinds of new
organizations are going to be needed to
be effective going forward let me just
leave you with one closing thought which
is that technology is a tool and I'm
often asked whether this tool is going
to make us better off or worse off is it
I'm an optimist or pessimist and I think
that's the wrong way to think about it
the right way to think about it is it's
a tool and that means it all depends on
what we decide to do with the tool the
tool doesn't decide for us it is
something that we can use in many
different kinds of ways just as earlier
tools work and we have to think about
how we want to use this particular tool
the good news is we have a more powerful
tool at our disposal more powerful set
of tools at our disposal than we ever
had before and now it's up to us to take
advantage of that in many ways we have
more choice than we ever had before as
