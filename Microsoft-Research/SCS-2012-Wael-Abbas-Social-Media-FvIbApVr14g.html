but I've never risk my life to you
unlike our next speaker why all this
very graciously been asked to be
introduced as a journalist and blogger
which I will have the Arab Spring wow I
am not sure what that means but we have
to look I'm just alone I will I will
talk about our experience in just using
social media since 2004 october
revolution and how and why we needed to
use a social media this is your lecture
can really compete on what I will try to
be as brief as possible but we live in a
country that we are being told and we
have freedom of expression and real
speech and we convinced us that we have
political parties that we have
newspapers independent and talking to
work with the parties but at the end of
the day we found out that they're not
being told the movies and they are
hiding a lot of stuff and in the
tradition we they are not covering
everything in the particular in 2004
they're starting to be moved in spoiling
for change in Egypt opens like a fire
for example other people's campaign for
change and they were calling for the
water to be impeached and the world
warning is Amanda Warrick following his
father as president this movement we're
not getting enough coverage of the
tradition
in addition India even and they were
they were getting converging in foreign
media are just here like the BBC but we
cannot depend on that because the
coverage is not enough to reach all the
people inside inside Egypt I was
blogging mainly in Arabic in Kyrie
Arabic slang because I wanted to reach a
certain target audience which is usually
use the students of university high
schools because I believe that these are
the ones who are going to make a change
so I used a language that they are
familiar ways I even use profanity a lot
which we are using every day with your
daily life i abstain from using
expressions of scholars and
intellectuals and John wrists and I
believe I was successful in drawing
attention to my work I was doing stuff
anonymously on the internet before 2000
for using a big thing I was doing stuff
on the forums or meeting groups in chat
rooms but with a little bit like a
failure i decided to take my camera and
to go out to the street and take
pictures and videos of what's going on
and sure that evil what is really
happening
instead of the three lines that the
elite and the newspaper every day about
that there was some opposition to
station in downtown Cairo and he would
not teach people what ever do this is an
example of one of these demonstrations
it took place in another mosque in cairo
it was during the war on gaza i think
around Evelyn I think we'll never in
2006
what did he start here police abuses are
using soldiers were playing home too so
there is any foreign
nigga healthy he would think that the
visitors are fashionable one another no
to the signals people who have signed up
as cart ruts and distance are run more
to the inside of business
one of the biggest movements calling for
change in Egypt was the judges movement
they were calling for independence from
the authority and supporters of this
movement this is the station supporter
judges including a bit and as you can
see the police is using force ghost
this is really one of the
disorganization of the katana or the
enough movement which is our heart I
don't wanna give us stuff like that to
me it wasn't only about the activists or
petitions but we also covered workers
strikes because we believe that strikes
and sit-ins they have a big rule in
voting for change these are the garbage
collectors Zach Holden estrogen because
in
of course garbage letters going on
strike maybe you heard about the honda
cobra and the general strike of 2008 but
this video was taken before the general
strike mahana and it shows the daily
life one of the workers of my Honda poor
life conditions is damaging with his
family and children so this helps people
realize what it was like a test again
what do the happiness
the bloggers were also part of the
movements they stopped movements on
their own or they were part of movements
voted for change and this video is from
a demonstration organised by the use for
change movement in 2005 this this
demonstration is like something you do
were unexpected it's a flash mob and it
was never told to never told the media
that we're going to have something and
the bloggers were the only ones trusted
to cover such events and show people
that they are taking place the bloggers
also covered some international issues
like the interest in ian's who were
trapped inside and sinai the borders
were closed with Garza sometime English
with those festivities will cap
all the conditions of intense we are
dealing with both of our and I had to
solve disability and then the situation
exploded dramatically and the porters
were broken and i was able to enter Gaza
and take some footage of the conditions
inside casa no decision
50
and the work in the borders were home is
lovely Mississippi's
user
we haven't suffered the electric
presidential elections
this guy is an american mexican
immigrant and he's happy obama is what
you have is adept and is either to both
this old song to celebrate this
I am Groot okay one thing that I
remember very well is that he is happy
because now he's Sun and water have a
chance to run for president of America
there were events that were organized
entirely blockers and this is
I guess that's when they started feeling
that we are dangerous workers when we
started organizing stuff instead of
being our bedrooms where you might think
that addressed sit in a tiny square was
under 26 of genuine to South this one
was on the sixteenth of marsh 2006 this
is the same square that we square and
the same circular garden and they are
welcoming us by spreading waters we
cannot see the garden but we managed to
organize the evil intent of the lights
and square and finally despite of the
cold and the harassment we were able to
organize it was successful two people
joint and for the first time that means
you can disappear it was an act
back then but I think they were
commissioned for Asian African tlds belt
we reset we spent the mind the dark
this was organized and I be also what
the purpose
and we made fun of them to this is video
about it's a traditional sharpie same
only talks about how sitting on the
floor is lovely and sitting on chairs I
used it to make time of work and bad day
because it was believable of quarks
health and the Jewish Messiah jail
because be exported about president so
in position
and I made the soldiers that his back
was too long
they used to scare us back then and tell
us that talking about the president is
health is affecting these stock exchange
affecting the economy and not something
that you should talk about the
exclusivity of our videos also made them
good material for traditional media so
some TV stations forward our material
and there this is a holics America and
Canada music this is a video that I shot
during a judge's office again this
effect cassidian analyst is so bogus is
in CN source of information laconic 4g
vision but
newspapers too so some some of them
borrow our material and others just
stole the material this is a promo for
Al Jazeera and you will recognize one of
my videos in this role which they would
not suit themselves
you've seen this one already so it's not
a material they never paid me for this
video but the didn't air mobile because
of the success we make people started
sending us their own material the
materiality shot using their mobile
phones and digital cameras this is a
number between crash in demand for
services available you wanted to be seen
as this happened before seen on
introduce there are they thought and
here's where the computer center winners
I'll be there for them it was a train
crash well yeah yeah what you are I
remember us any closer to solving
systems so
some of the videos were of the whole
nature that they cannot be aired on
traditional media but ensure that
there's a problem this is a problem
Washington and they work we have
eyewitnesses on the region of the
elections because no matter how powerful
a blogger is that he cannot be
everywhere
Mission schools
one guy mystery not aware that somebody
is taking video XD
that was 277 sure are short on
situations and how that changed between
I'll talk about that when I got to
torture because we all heard from Egypt
about to action happening stations so
it's still a lot of controversy people
posted videos of torture and you started
asking questions and started asking for
interrogations and trials of those who
are responsible because it also
coincided with the photos and videos
that were leaked from Iraq and run rate
yeah but these videos at work Egyptians
torturing Egyptians so who were started
asking questions why this happen
and also all these videos have been
available for like years but nobody had
to put in television or newspapers will
talk about them because of their nature
and because it was a commission either
the mountain I get in 25 mins DNT even
started getting videos for other
countries this video is torturing a
police station in height this is an
Indian worker in creative station and
thank God we were successful to break
the district in Egypt and we managed an
officer for the first time on trial this
is his land repeat business passport
supervising and filming
the West Drive are we using a glue stick
to the station and
without the least possible alternate of
the incident
and only sentenced to three years but it
was a precedent after we managed to stir
the public opinion in Egypt we starting
receiving threats on phone calls this is
what we were happy it wasn't only lets
on the phone that nobody else can hear
but please try to destroy our reputation
on TV this is the assistant of the
Minister of Interior for legal affairs
we are giving us 20 autoshow and you say
that what our best was a tram has and
this spread rumors about me being a
homosexual over the group participants
Jersey and Hispanics don't know that I
my name is that but in our society is
surprise your reputation well thank that
one for this video I was able to post my
criminal record on my own blog I have my
own media so I you posted my criminal
record and it was empty because people
wife and I group that this guy was a
liar this is a problem his YouTube Sam
mentioned you tube removed some of my
200 videos he's like torture watchdog
who documented pieces in his own country
and posted them on YouTube for the whole
world to see but now he's offline her
Middle East correspondent eat ramen has
been looking into this part of a
nation's report may be disturbing one of
Egypt's most probably activists tonight
says he has been silenced not by his
government by YouTube YouTube claimed
that I was not providing enough context
for entities that I was posted and that
my my videos were not Gruber the content
was over for YouTube audience we got
into a huge argument
a lot of support from American blockers
to against with you and CNN as you can
see that Fox News also did the same lots
of people talking white why do you have
to post these on YouTube why didn't you
take your own house and put your videos
in a house that can protect them and
what I believe that YouTube get you is a
platform work everywhere and post
everything according to it Nana's cute
cat theory people don't go to youtube to
watch funny videos of cats and babies
and stuff like that but let's get their
attention with something else if they
are watching this you can also watch
that and videos of torture like this can
get more audience on YouTube that 50
work on website specialized about
torture choice for torsion so I think
this is helpful to our course to get the
attention
suspected people didn't know that
something like that exists
so
I what conditions for English
did you buddy wish to make it more
discoverable maybe i'm not sure what
what was in my mind back then when i use
works like sexual harassment reports and
regret one hundreds of thousands of
views when i use torture our community
photo she will find a way to find that
but we're their exclusive ok
you sailor youtube people are God what I
wanted to reach as much audience as I
wanted and the problem is this video
that they were not one traditional media
we're not in traditional TV that
everybody can see so I wanted to be
medium them are specialized human rights
depending I don't even want actors in
our lawyers or warrant reserve units to
be the only one thing that would people
to have I wanted to instill the public
meaning to create something that mission
of the government's make changes to this
phenomenon of torture the previous
question is how do we post a youtube do
anything else to the video yeah I
thousand very good and hanging back then
but I try to use that
the videos of oxygen harassment I don't
know why but i think it's obviously
because the world sex
because of the stuff that the most able
to never this is a very horrible you
being stopped at the airport and the
officials going through one luggage this
video was shot by a fellow blogger he
gets totally for all mostly for more
than a year and going through my other
stuff and I wasn't allowed to travel for
laptop I
it was allowed them to travel or some
idea my phone I also do allowed to
travel DVD or senior machinist or emily
park I
curiously know your takers with this
controversy of the how much social media
have to do with the success of it the
Arab Spring people said it's been
overblown whatever your perspective how
hydro goal was social media to our Arab
Spring the social media is a tool and it
was created by people but the revolution
is a decision that has to be taken by
equal to the social media was like a
catalyst it helped us it wasn't that
thing behind the devotion of revolution
was taken by people who decided to
remain in Tahrir Square and stay there
and face this and harassment until you
are leaves and his regime of the social
media made things happen fast miss able
to organize things to talk to each other
to order to form for lawyers arrested to
call for medical help for food supplies
or stuff like that but other than that I
don't give all the credit to the social
media and I will not also take all the
credit from
so what happened within the explaining
not only is the elections to what degree
are you able to use those media to
connect different populations across the
country can go if you try to find
unfortunately we haven't reached this
stage of rebuilding the country because
we haven't gotten rid of the old regime
yet we have a little honda at the moment
which is more worse than one or more
dangerous than people are now getting
killed bluntly in front of the cameras
in the streets getting shot in close
range pyoo-pyoo play army officers who
are defending their interests the army
is controlling forty percent of our
economy and they are protecting American
and Israeli and Saudi interests in the
country and they are not letting their
own interests they are receiving
1,000,000,000 point three dollars of
matter of military aid from the
attestation we have no idea how this is
being spent besides the about paying
taxes the ARCIC is building factories
and building roads and bridges and
tourist villages and hotels and stuff
Adam you are making driven you out of it
but they are not paying taxes they have
been interesting about being paying more
and the neighbor in these projects are
soldiers or slave labor you don't be
what's happening a ways in which you
could actually shall use the technology
to communicate across the country of
other citizens where we are trying to do
to do that as much as possible but we're
not successful because there is a war
now inside social media itself we were
in control before the revolution but
after their encryption and when they
realize that we are dangerous he decided
to go there too and just reading online
and you'll find that there are campaigns
going from the work to be back and
supporters of the military and people
are attacking the revolution and how
it's affecting to resident affecting the
economy and he want stability and the
one security and we want the revolution
to end so we were fighting this battle
in our own social media and we were all
so Frankie traditional media which is
still central and in the hands of the
regime and the media that is all by
businessman over alive with energy they
are all attacking the revolution and
making our image look bad and tell you
that this should stop or the digital
find us and from unfortunately lots of
people are following that
oh you know how well I tried doing that
using the liens that I know I never
studied how to do that but when I
started my blog first for example I
started putting links and for discussion
forums and sending links to really
groups that I was using the checklist on
my yahoo or msn I used to send them
whenever I had a new post I when that
was before Facebook and Twitter and
after that I started posting stuff on
Facebook and on Twitter and I think that
when people get that this is something
interestingly send it to others to come
and turn to see my blog I feel have it
but how dangerous is it for people in
your audience to come publicly
in Egypt and even if not publicly like
even liking your videos are connected to
your pure social media although it might
seem dangerous and some people told me
that they were clearing the cache and
moving when you are out from their
browsers and feeling the history and
stuff like that but it's not believe
that dangers they are after us don't
after the people who are watching our
material but the unit works time they
gave orders to internet cafes for
example not to allow the users in the
cafe to open certain websites that or
blogs that are talking about politics or
torture any of these issues but it's not
as dangerous it's only interest when you
take to the street when you join a
demonstration when you join us it end or
stuff like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
