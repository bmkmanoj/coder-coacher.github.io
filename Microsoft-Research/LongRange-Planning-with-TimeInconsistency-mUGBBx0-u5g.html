hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
uh sure
to introduce a speaker jon kleinberg
who's a professor of computer science
and information science at Cornell
University somewhat to my surprise I
think this is the first time I've ever
been introducing John for a talk um he's
a great speaker and I don't want to
delay his talk for as long as it would
take to list all of his awards but I'm
in the unique position of being able to
tell you that his first award was a tee
ball trophy in the year nineteen seventy
eight or 79 I'm also in the unique
position of being able to tell you that
he's gotten so many other awards by now
that when I get an email in my inbox
saying that I've won award the rational
response for me is to assume that it's
more likely a person who gave John and
award and mistyped the email address
he's a for almost 20 years now John has
been really setting a course for our
fields in terms of exploring the
relationship between algorithms networks
and you know what happens in the region
where humans and computers meet up with
each other and you know I think a lot of
us have been influenced by his papers
his book on networks crowds and markets
with David easily which has now become
MOOC and you know I i always find and I
think I'm not alone in feeling this way
when I'm working on a paper the moment
at which I know that I've sort of found
the right way of formulating the
question is when my mind says oh that's
the way that John would do it and so you
know without further ado let me give it
over to him and you'll see the way that
he would do behavioral economics from a
computational perspective Thanks are you
wearing values is Mike okay alright
thanks for uh thanks for coming so good
so let's see so I want to start by
talking about
so I want you start with sort of how we
ended up looking at some of these
questions so what I wanted to get to was
some work that sigil and I have been
doing and segal was my former PhD
student incredibly talented person she
and I started working this right toward
the end of her PhD in a way sort of a
post PhD project and you know we've
continued think about along these lines
I want to sort of start with kind of
what were the issues we're thinking
about when we we got into it ultimate
I'll talk about some of these
intersections between behavioral
economics in particular and computation
the way people think about planning for
the future um but I guess one place we
started from was the fact that there are
these online systems where users
increasingly have these very long and
visible lifetimes in the system right so
rather than a website that you go to and
you have a kind of one-time engagement
with or you know other things where you
have maybe a long-running but maybe
memoryless and engagement with it these
are systems where you keep coming back
you have a stable identity the rest of
the community perceives what you're
doing also and it as well it becomes
sensible to actually set long-range
goals for yourself so in various
contexts and pass work I've with the
things like Wikipedia where people can
have very very long running histories in
the community and there even is by the
time you've logged around 10,000 edits
something akin to a sort of tenure and
promotion process and wikipedia where
you apply to become an admin who has
special privileges like you can lock
down articles you can resolve disputes
you can do a bunch of things and there's
actually like a public discussion and a
public vote on that process you know and
you could say similar things about
online courses and online question
answering sites like stackoverflow and
so the things we thought about is you
build up reputation these systems as you
try to achieve these milestones like
becoming an admin or achieving you know
a certain status how is it the people
you know set these goals and how do they
try to attain them now one thing that's
actually been you know powerful here is
that in these systems you can actually
try to design incentives that will lead
people to try achieving goals that you
might think are good for the system and
one kind of
structure the people have used is
systems like badges and related
incentives where I say if you do this
much of an activity i'll give you a
badge you know or you'll have some kind
milestone will confer some status
looking for reputation points on you and
the interesting thing about some of
these systems is they're quite simple to
define you know if if you do a certain
amount of this you will get a certain
prize but they can induce relatively
complex behaviors and probably that's
because badges are sort of multifaceted
you know so on the one hand you know
badges are a sort of form of identity
building for a system right so if we all
have badges in the system we all feel
more part of the system we all feel more
engaged in it it also you know much more
concretely creates incentives and I
think you know the sort of first line of
work that i really was aware of that
that sort of thought about this was some
work that Jason and others were involved
in sort of thinking about your outlay of
effort in a system and I'll say my take
on and then Jason can agree or disagree
as a almost a sort of form of all pay
auction which allow people put effort in
you know only some people are going to
actually actually receive the prize and
you're basically paying with your effort
subsequently a bunch of us including
others in the room like like Nicole and
Greg at and some joint work I did with
Ashley Anderson Dan huh block or near
I'll escovitch thought about you know
they I just where you know I'm trying to
Steve a certain level of status they may
be some milestone I'm trying to reach ok
again this kind of long-range planning
we actually looked at this in a couple
of domains where it really felt very
compelling that this really is steering
steering people's behavior I mean in
particular when Ashton Danny ray and I
were looking originally its stack
overflow the question answering site
which was one of the early and heavy
users of badges you would look at
people's trajectories through the system
you'd say I'm imagine there's some kind
of state space and people are you know
asking questions and they're answering
questions they're up voting and they're
down voting and we try sort of map out
the trajectory is doing it we found
they're almost like they're being
deflected in certain weird ways that we
couldn't understand right it was also a
good thing was sort of moving around
some kind of gravitating body and then
you discover that grafting body was
actually a badge and people are actually
sort of responding to it and until you
knew the badge was there you couldn't
figure out why people were sort of
bending in certain ways and once you saw
the badge noticin was going on in some
cases it was extreme
we concrete so here are two examples we
saw on Stack Overflow where it sort of
really jumps out at you this this was a
bad it said if you vote 300 times
someone things stack overflow head was
there's asking and answering but voting
is often a kind of people don't vote as
much as Stack Overflow would wish
because voting is crucial for the
feedback mechanism so they try to reward
voting right so this said if you vote
300 times you'll get a badge so this is
so in this was the amount of activity
averaged over all users who won the
badge day 0 is the day they won the
badge and these are the days before
these are the days after and this is
their amount of activity per day average
or everybody on asking questions the
answering questions voting in questions
and voting on the answers right and you
know you can see something that's going
on here now here now in this case we
knew about the pan so we aligned
everything on day 0 so you can really
see it but you know both of these are
going up and then the instant they get
the badge you notice they say ok well
that's done with and the you notice and
then it drops really rapidly this is a
badge it says if you vote right you can
sort of tell what this is a badge on
it's obviously on the green thing if you
vote 600 times on a question then you'll
get a badge and that one induces this
gigantic change of behavior ok so all of
these are instances where it's clear
that people are aware of these
milestones right it's not like they
somehow accidentally got the badge and
then even know it it's clearly you know
the behavior is changing right around it
we looked at other cases we looked at
this also on Coursera where we
introduced badges into Coursera on the
forums because again there wasn't enough
forum activity so again Ashton dan
you're and I worked with them to put
badges on the forum and although I won't
get into be able to get into any of the
details here there actually were
different presentations of the badge and
we did a bunch of randomized tests a
bunch of a B test on the bad
presentation we saw that actually
changes in how the badge was portrayed
can actually increase the amount of
engagement on the forum so in particular
if instead of just saying here are your
badges you make progress toward the next
level more more salient basically
showing a ladder than going up that
actually led to increased engagement of
the forum
way if you show everybody else's badges
that led to increased striving for
badges right so if you create a social
signal that you know you see this user
and you see they have two bronze bad as
the silver and a gold then that sort of
just that also and again it's very
inserting to contemplate what are the
mechanisms by by which all this is going
on but we got to about this point and
we're starting to develop some models
for what was going on and we encountered
this very very interesting literature in
behavioral economics on the ways in
which the goals that we set for
ourselves and the way reason about them
I can often lead to counter intuitive
behaviors okay so that was that was also
i want to talk about and and the point
is this is not just something in the
online world it's true in the offline
world also right so you know you look at
something you know as basic as
graduating from high school you need to
take this many courses you need to you
know make sure you get electives and so
forth and you know you're making plans
and some of these courses might be
difficult the plans you know as with the
online world or multi step and so you
know you imagine these situations that
there's an agent and they're sort of
planning and they're trying to reach
reach this milestone and what the
behavioral economics lecture we talked
about was the fact that you often get
the situation when people make a plan
but then don't actually follow through
on it right so they've fell about the
costs and benefits they start doing
something and then for some reason they
sort of stopped doing it you know Andy's
school systems like this tacoma public
school system sometimes takes their you
know very tabular description and shows
how actually graduate high school can be
quite tricky you know there's quicksand
and there's pitfalls and there's a
treasure chest at the end and this sort
of seems to get it sort of right that
there are a variety of reasons why you
might not end up following through on
the plan you made some of them can be
for completely you know reasons that we
don't really need to stretch our models
whatsoever so for example it could be
that something happened you know so
you're in high school but then you know
your parents both lose their jobs and
you didn't plan on that and now you have
to like you know take a part-time job he
gets hard to complete high school that
that's really case where the costs and
benefits that you anticipate the
beginning we're not what you experienced
at Ewing but other times it doesn't seem
to be that way it seems like nothing
really changed and yet you didn't follow
through and that's this this this notion
of time inconsistency
we say Tommy consistency lots of places
i think probably you know the sort of on
you know page 1 of any textbook
description of this you would have gym
memberships right I mean this is sort of
like the canonical example you know at
the start of the month you say this will
be great i'm going to buy the gym
membership and you go every down and get
in shape you paid the money you know and
will excuse people who then spring their
ankle badly to 22 days in and their cost
structure actually changed but for
everybody else nothing actually changed
it's just when the day came you just
didn't feel like getting up at you know
630am to go the gym and so you didn't
and so you spent all this money and
nothing actually happened right and
that's sort of where you ask yourself
okay what is going on such that people
are not following through on their plans
because the point is you know why is
this in the domain of you know lines of
work and economics like sort of question
rational optimization it's because
somewhere along line you were you were
rolling if it made sense to buy the gym
membership then the been fearing get
from the gym you know outweighed the
cost having to go the gym but somehow
that's not what you thought the next day
after you'd already okay so work on
trying to build models of this goes back
actually relatively far in in the
economics literature so you can find
references to this notion and how to
model it in the 1950s 1960s may be the
most picturesque description of it in
which i'll start from is actually in
this paper by the Nobel laureate george
akerlof in 1991 and so i'll talk about
that story because if if we get this
story then we'll get how the models
going to work and then i'll try to sort
of take off from there so this is the
story of how george akerlof failed to
make it to the post office so he was um
so here's what here's what happened so
he was a sabbatical in india and he had
a box that he had to ship back to the US
and each day he didn't ship it back
there was a kind of loss of use cost
from it not be it was actually for a
friend of his but let's say he truly
felt his friends utility also so every
day his friend didn't have it that was
we have you know he was incurring costs
the problem is actually getting the box
the post office you know in where he
wasn't india you'd have to travel the
post office you have to stand in line
fill out lots of forms waiting another
line so for its gonna take half a day
he's gonna lose an entire half David
he's got have to do that sometime
because he's not going to abandon the
box the box will get sent back he must
infer that cost
some point and every day he doesn't do
it you know the friend is losing the use
of it so so what should he do so he said
it was very very clear to him every day
there was something very pressing that
day such as he couldnt do but he was
sure he was gonna do it tomorrow every
day the plan was tomorrow I'm gonna do
it right this is procrastination he was
procrastinating now and of course you
know he did what everyone you know what
we'd all do that situation to just drag
dad alone earlier he honey and did
something that not all of us we do in
that situation which was he then tried
to model his own behavior and figure out
what was it that was actually going on
so you know if you think about it he was
faced with the following you know not
very challenging optimization problem so
so there's a one-time costs eat and then
there's a cot loss of use cost xvj
hasn't been shipped and so if he ships
it on day tee has caused his c plus T
times X and he wants to minimize over
all values of T and if you think about
it you wanna make tea as small as
possible we should ship on day one okay
so that was his his problem okay but you
know as I said he didn't do that he
procrastinated and empirically I wasn't
asleep real estate every day he planned
he would do it tomorrow he didn't just
have a generalized plan that I'll do it
later tomorrow okay um and of course the
effect is that you end up waiting all
the way at the end and you ship it in
you to the higher costs and of course as
with all these stories the story has a
slight twist which was halfway through
this period some other friends of his
were also in India took pity on him and
said we'll do it as part of some
shipment we're doing so it turned out
right he turned out and of course
actually i'll put off to the side that's
another anything about sort of
mechanisms for something malls i'm
talking about you can argue that hope
that the cost structure will change is
of course you know something which could
be could be implicit in this absolutely
okay but for right now let's let's eat
it okay so here was this proposal for
what was actually going on and why he
wasn't doing it and i'll i'll start this
and this actually he was drawing on as i
mentioned earlier work from the 1950s
1960s that you know let's just start
with something sorry the simplest thing
that would give us this behavior and
then we'll sort of try to go with that
and that is that cost incurred today are
simply more salient right if you incur
the costs today you feel it more
strongly and any future day you don't
it's important to distinguish this from
discounting because the point is
counting means every day the cost is
diminishing by you know point nine nine
but that means you know you're aware
that two days out is different from
three days out is different from four
days out which actually can be
completely rational for example you know
on any given day you know you might fall
over dead and then you won't have to do
all that work so you know it is true
that there's a fixed probability every
single day by which things are
diminishing so but this is not that
because this is the much less consistent
view that today is special every other
day is gonna be the same any if you want
I could slap a discount factor on to
this and say it's really you know B and
then there's going to be but they just
kind of had to be completely separate
that's my point okay so now he's saying
all right on daty some cost is in the
past let's not worry about that but
what's the cost going forward well he
sends it today he pays B times C if he
sends it tomorrow well the loss of use
costs today is salient that hurts but
that's a small number but the waiting in
line at the post office that's not
multiplied up and so tomorrow is
preferable as long as B minus 1 times c
is bigger than B times X I just
rearrange the equation and that can
easily happen if C is big and small and
so note that the actual optimal solution
here really is not just delay but
actually wait do it tomorrow x is the
lawsuit yeah the cost your friend
encouraged by not having it or how much
that cost means exactly because any cost
that you incur now so today I'm going to
either feel the pain of wayne line most
of us are going to feel the pain and my
friend is experiencing from not having
the box now really if i want to be it
pedagogically this would be completely
not worth it but of course there's you
know the week in transit and so I mean
like even if I so this is a model where
the post office has a teleporter so when
I be in the post office it'll disappear
there but it's a fax it's you know
whatever okay so all right so this was
um so this this was his model and I want
so people question about this because
this is sort of we want to take this
inside and say what can we do with this
right now this grew into a big
literature in behavioral economics are
all sort of call one paper which is
often the sort of you know root of a
bunch of this work which is David liebe
sins 1997 paper and quasi hyperbolic
just
counting and you know in the sort of
more general framework as I mentioned
you would also have traditional
discounting that it costs or reward see
that's realized T units into the future
is going to have a present value that's
like a one-time discount and then this
delta the tea I've rearranged the story
to first of all have no just have
discount factor one just to make things
easier and because I somehow find it
easier to picture as with a curl off
story Cosmo flight up not down will say
there's this number B that's bigger than
one so this is all just kind of for
those you who are connoisseurs of this
literature that's my translation but
everyone else just you can think about
the top half of the slide um now this
has been used in a lot of ways for
modeling different things I've been
telling a story about procrastination
but in a couple slides I will mention
how it can be used also to model things
like task abandonment like you start
writing you know a book or a monograph
because you think it's a good idea and
you got two chapters in and then you
just sort of stopped doing it not cause
anything change but just because you you
know and then obviously you know either
you were correct to have started it and
now wrong to be stopping it or you were
wrong to have started and written two
chapters that will never actually see
the light of day um similarly a bunch of
people both in the psych literature in
the behavioral economics literature have
noted the benefits of choice reduction
that if I actually take away choice from
people they can actually become more
efficient and more effective which
obviously if you're you know completely
rationally optimizing that should never
happen because if you have more choices
you should just ignore them if you don't
think they're a good idea but in fact we
as we know it's not what happens alright
i'll come back to these what's
interesting though is each of these is
sort of their own paper and their own
ingenious sort of one-off construction
where they sort of say here's how i
would achieve this and one thing you
know when sagal may begin look at this
way we thought you know wouldn't be nice
if we could just sort of talk about all
these simultaneously and some sort of
and not have to sort of make each one of
several it's right maybe you should
designate one day a week that is called
tomorrow I know right is probably useful
okay so because here's here's
effectively you know what we ran up
against which is you've got a lot of
stories the attempt to graduate from
high school the gym membership shipping
the package and you know you can imagine
in the spirit of you know analyzing
algorithms if I think about sort of you
know thinking about this as
sort of you know in the context of
traditional analysis algorithms you
often say all right I have a situation
where I have agents behaving sub
optimally i'd like to quantify the
amount of suboptimal tea you know so in
the spirit of the competitive ratio and
the approximation ratio on the price of
anarchy i might want to say you know how
bad is the ratio of the costs incurred
by a present biased agent or what I mean
one who has this factor be compared to
the minimum cost achievable and in some
sense you know what is it you do in
these situations you say what's the
worst case but so far I haven't really
given us a framework for doing it
because what would my question be
exactly would say like across all
stories in which present bias hasn't
effect what's the worst ratio soar like
the max over all stories s of but I
don't know how to quantify over yeah so
that's also true if I just keep loop so
if my system has a self loop right it I
never do it I could have an infinite
cost ratio will end up with some kind of
structure that's finally it's sort of
it's impressive one wonders if this
story is exactly how it happened because
the story builds in a bunch of ingenious
fetus as escape valves for these things
right so for example at the end of n
days he was gonna go home from
sabbatical in the box would be abandoned
so what do I know this store was gonna
come to an end but yeah so we're gonna
picture structures where there's some
endpoint and something's gonna happen
but I do have this issue that I want to
be able to quantify for something right
like each of these stories is its own
one-off thing what's the common language
in which I can express stories well this
is about people making plans and if we
thought back to the you know I thought
back to the work we've been doing on
badges and there we adopted this graph
based planning framework as you would do
in you know in sort of traditional
artificial intelligence tile planning
there's a graph you start at the start
state you're trying to get to the goal
state you incur some cost as you move
through states and that would be a way
that we could try to sort of code up a
bunch of stories so let me talk about
graphs this basic structure to represent
stories then I'll try to argue that a
number of the things I've been talking
about have representations using graphs
including a curl off story but many
others so here's the idea the agent
starts at s that's the start state and
then trying to get to the goal state t
and let's say they must get to the goal
one
whether they will get to the goal
possibly just because time is just
integrally moving them forward their
hand up there one way or another but
they were like the cheapest path from s
to T and so they're just solving a
shortest path problem now we know how to
solve shortest path problems in this
graph for example it would be to go over
the top and you'd have a cost of 16 22
is 20 instead of 24 and instead of
whatever that is 26 okay um shortest
path problem uh but the and sometimes
the unique twist I'm going to put on
this is that the cost of the outgoing
edge is going to be multiplied up by a
factor of be greater than 1 and so this
has some interesting effect and so in
some sense for most I'm going to talk
about I mean I sort of take this
literature and try to translate it into
this interesting twist on the short path
problem shortest paths when the
immediately outgoing edge has been
scaled up by this factor of B and ask
what that does let's ask what does here
so in all my level worked examples be
will be too so without any further
annotation so the agents standing here
saying all right if I go this way that's
32 16 times two things are scaled up by
2 plus 2 plus 2 36 I goes straight
through its 32 and if I go this way it's
34 so the agent is going to go here
expecting to follow the path to t cuz
it's 32 and that makes sense I mean this
is the best path but it requires some
real discipline to incur this gigantic
asteroid oh alright so I mean that's a
focal attempt to be clear you're
assuming that the agent always thinks
that you know right now they're
multiplying by B but then oh yeah
excellent point yeah yeah actually
you're right i forgot to say this clause
this is important yeah agent does not
even got their own bias actually i'll
come back to this at the end just as an
open question this literature and
actually the line of work by toad on
whom that Raven really calls it there
are different levels of sophistication
all of which are great great questions
but here we're just gonna talk about
complete naivete you sort of you know
you have this issue now i would i will
say segal i thought a fair amount of
sophistication and never quite got a
model in the graph theoretic language
that we were totally happy with so i
think it's a cool question
that we feel like there's something
there and we could never quite get
something that we were happy with so
yeah it's a great question but right now
this is in the naive part of the space
as its texana mais body by people to
lurch you okay so yes so the agent
thinks you know I'll get through this
and then it'll be whatever cost it is I
should mention that the bulk of the
behemoth nomics work is sort of on naive
end of the spectrum because
sophistication is hardly reason about
but it all of it is interesting so but
okay so they they go to see but of
course once they get to see the world
looks different now this looks like 2
times 8 plus 8 is 24 this one looks like
20 so they actually end up going this
way and then from here they have no
choice they just go so note that
actually two things about this example
both of which are going to be sort of
these are the point sort of keep two key
points one is they've been suboptimal
they paid 26 instead of 20 so they
encourage this ratio or whatever that is
the other is they didn't actually do
what they expected they went here
expecting go there but they actually did
something different once they got
underway and so this very simple
shortest path just scaling up the
outgoing edges actually achieves a bunch
of the things that we would ideally like
to achieve for this they only see it
locally right only see it look I mean
they see the whole graph right because
they were where they were able to
compute these numbers they're able to
compute these numbers what they weren't
what they were naive about was there was
themselves they're naive about
themselves but they were aware of what
the graph of the other thing I'll
mention and this is also an issue that
comes up in these models which we don't
try to touch on these costs are assumed
to be real as in the black numbers are
the actual at the end when you evaluate
what effects of this have on this
person's utility hits the black numbers
as opposed to their perceived numbers
you can imagine other situations where
actually the perceived numbers reflect
something that's all you know also real
but here we're just taking the black
numbers is absolute okay good so this
was sort of fun to play with and what so
then we said well can we actually encode
stories this way and one thing that was
reassuring is you can encode the
afterlife story using a Grail so you
draw this I'm gonna claim this is george
akerlof story about the post office and
what it means is that here's the start
state v sub i is the state in which
you've reached a
I without sending the package alright
and T is you've sent the pic so you have
the option of just sending it right away
or you could pay this one time loss of
use cost and get to day one at which
point you have the option of sending it
right away or you could pay the one time
left so use and so really his story was
a story about traversing the entire rim
all the way around this graph and then
finally having no choice but to go go to
see idea okay alright so again it's easy
to encode code things now it's actually
an extra thing we could throw into this
model keeping you know the naivete and
the absolute cost and all the stuff but
we'll add one everything because we also
want to model the idea of task
abandonment idiot you start and don't
finish and for that we have to have
something it's not inexorably dragging
you toward the end so we're going to
imagine something where there's a reward
at the end yes I'm just get one will
feature of the model reward at the end
you have the option of stopping if the
cost that remains as you perceive it is
less than the reward now the reward has
never multiplied up by a factor of B
because the reward is always in the
future and so it never benefits from the
increased salience although you can
imagine you know and i'll mention this
at the end to intermediate rewards
they've increased salience interesting
question okay so they're only going to
continue if the cost less equal to the
roar and again you know an example makes
this clear they start out here this
looks like 2 times 2 plus 6 is 10 so
they go this way and not that way and
then they get here now it looks like 2
times 6 is 12 and they give up because
not worth the reward of 11 and so very
easily you get you get abandonment you
also get very easily the benefits of
choice reduction if i had presented this
option you know this is some state space
i'm giving to somebody as you know a
path toward graduation in a path toward
completing something if i simply said
actually a doesn't exist AAA is
off-limits they would still go this way
because the 11 breaks even with that 11
so they're indifferent let's assume
indifferent they keep going and then
they get here and of course it actually
is 10 and and they'll continue so if I
could take away that option they get
their word all right there are lots and
lots of stories you can tell this way
just to kind of maybe convince you by
one more example because so far the only
real example is this somewhat stylish
what about the post office we thought
about and again
some since the point is not not that
each of these stories is cute but almost
the reverse that you can just
mechanically generate these stories
forever once you have the graph language
so for example if i go back to some work
of dan ariely and others talking about
the benefits of adding deadlines to
courses let me actually tell you the
story before i draw the graph right so
anyone who's ever assigned work in a
course you know you you show up in the
first day and you say alright you're
going to be you know six problem sets
and they're gonna be due every two weeks
and here's the schedule and you're going
to sort of rolling out gradually and you
think yourself you know I could have
said you're all adults here are the six
problem sets budget your time wisely
over the semester and hand them in on
you know and then and you sort of know
that if you say that if you give
everyone all the problem sets of an
semester and they start to wait toward
the very end and then they can't finish
them and then you get a big train wreck
right and so you're sort of saving
people from themselves and you know so
we ask ourselves is this model rich
enough to include the same appeal from
the cells in the course yeah oh it's a
good question um you mean should they
actually say well this is no longer
worth it to me because of what I've yeah
that's a fair question I I guess I'm
think of it as imagine you're at be so
it's a song cause so if I if I met be my
question is I could either pay 10 and
get 11 or I could just stop and at that
moment the correct answer that question
is to pay time but yeah I mean there is
in fact sunk costs by us and so that
would be completely fair thing to to
consider adding this model but if we're
saying the only bias is this this
blow-up then at the moment when you're
faced with paying tend to get 11 you
should do it but that would be a totally
reasonable you put it okay so could we
model this so in fact you can model that
you know so let me walk you through a
slightly more live example and they'll
be done with examples will start moving
on to the sort of graphs in general so
sigil and I may have this little sorry
imagine had a three weeks short course
with two projects okay and the question
is do you put deadlines in this course
you know do you have a deadline by which
the first of the two project has to be
done or you just treat them all as
grown-ups and just give them the true
product view alright so let's make up
some numbers for this work so there's s
is here so the
so the weeks of the course are
inexorably moving this way the IJ this
means this is week one and this is
you've done zero one or two projects
this is week two we've done zero one or
two projects in order to actually
complete the course successful you have
to end up at T which is really v32 if
you gets it for example v31 you don't
actually succeed because you didn't do
both projects in the courses over okay
so that's what that's what this means so
the arrows are always pushing you one
week to the right the question is just
how many more projects do you do and
there's a reward of 16 sitting here
we're just gonna make up some numbers so
this all works out and let's say there's
an effort cost for so taking the course
even if you do know project definitely
come to class that cause one doing one
project cost for for that week and doing
both cost nine because I often these
effort costs or convex going up because
the extra stuff you do cuts into sort of
more and more limited time that you have
for other stuff okay so 14 and nine
alright so what would someone reason so
let's do a little calculation here at
the beginning right both products are
available you'd have to budget your time
wisely good luck with that so this would
cause 2 times 1 because you're not doing
a project now but then you plan but
that's okay because I'm going to do four
plus four it'll cost me an effort of 10
I'll get the reward of 16 it'll be great
okay so you know now you get here and
you realize you know I could actually
wait till here and do both of them you
know because it can be 2 times 1 it's 2
plus the nine but that's funny cuz i get
there were 16 at the end so you wait and
then i get hearing you realize you know
2 times 9 is awfully painful looking
this course wasn't really worth it after
all and you give up because the 18 is
more than the 16 and so your experience
in the chorus is you spend the first two
weeks plan to do stuff and now the final
becomes there's no time and you give up
right and and again this shortest path
problem actually completely conveys that
entire story which again we found
reassuring because while that story
seemed to have all sorts of
psychological tour quality ingredients
to it it really is just what someone in
the shortest path faced with this
constraint is doing and the funny thing
is I can actually make this problem go
away by saying sorry this state is off
limits okay you must complete the first
project by the second week and now
suddenly the reason is slightly
different because now actually you don't
have that option so you actually go here
and you will actually complete the
course right i reduced your options and
you actually all right good so right you
put in deadlines yeah yeah so is really
compelling I want to test the one
assumption which is that the phenomenon
you're explaining is this distortive
lens yeah the immediate issue just looks
by a fact or two or a factor or
something yeah yeah is there which
completely makes sense and i get i was
working out here is there a different I
feel like the Akerlof story there could
be another thing about scale where it's
kind of like maybe you're always
competing with like your long-term
decision and your short-term decision
and they're sort of incompatible so you
get up that morning it's like I still
have this cost benefit for when I'm
gonna get the package on it's still the
right thing to do to mail it today right
but I also have to factor in by the end
of the day there's task X and that has
its own yeah right so just like we're
navigating that doesn't explain like the
gym membership unless I you have site
really it is true that yeah there was
this intriguing thing with the aqha life
story that each day he got up he's like
but I have to get you know this letter
of recommendation out by 5pm or helped
you know and you're like yeah you really
have to do that right so yeah that
that's a case of so I think there are
interesting because you've done this
where for example the inflow of
short-term test it can be uncertain so
for example there's gonna be some
problems to process that generates task
each day and you don't and so you always
end up kind of so i guess i would say
that that would make for variance to
model it if someone were not
experiencing some bias then they should
have some models the distribution or
they should learn it empirically from
you know the past week and they notice
they always have a recommendation and
maybe they should you know so i think if
so we're not experiencing a bias to be
interesting optimization problem there
were some days yeah you wouldn't be able
to get to it but in in the long run you
should figure out which tasks to take on
so you do the right things but in
essence the letter of recommendation
that you have to write today looks like
it's going to take you all day whereas
the letter / condition you have to like
write tomorrow looks like it's only
going to take half a day and then you'll
do it yeah so that there's a lot so i
think they're sort of right so they're
actually three things and you guys one
is the present bias one is optimism bias
as
you know as as well as says that thing's
the future you're more optimistic about
you really and then there's people's bad
reasonable probability and actually
probably in these some of these stories
all of these are converging actually
yeah okay idea that's one way out which
sort of at least some of us do right we
sort of say well it's five o'clock the
post office still of my quarters of post
offices I know I will have to work all
night and that right but you sort of you
essentially create time out of sleep or
something and you say yep well any get
no no but they are sort of situates you
not yes yeah the difference yes so we do
the procrastination but at some point we
sort of realized what's going on and we
just a tremendous cost whatever is a lot
so there's some there's some
sophistication yes so there's that some
of that is about sufficiently yeah so it
would probably be about sophistication
that you understand that you have this
problem and you're now going to do
something that commits you to a certain
area and this get back to the
sophistication question I mean some
people described in this or of a nice
way to do it like if you think about
this is sort of like your future self
versus you know your present self
doesn't occur this cost your future self
will incur it you're handing off a lot
of these commitment devices in the face
sophistication is you basically playing
chicken with your future self right
because you're basically like sort of
doing something is going to absolutely
force action out of ya so that but I
think you would want to put
sophistication about your future
shortcomings into it and then you'd be
able I think you may go visit you
mentioned like the close connection on
your mother with the David lave some
kind of basement it seems to me that
David lives and work there is a standard
notion there is a fixed notion of time
so the representation of the how to
describe the actions in different graphs
that could be equivalent in his notion
will be different in your notion because
in your notion today than a node and in
his notion two days today yeah it is so
is it interesting point this is
generalizing in the sense that really to
sort of say there's a fixed time who's a
fixed rate you would only want to deal
with say graphs that were layered this
happens to be layered but I sorta think
more generally i have an arbitrary
directed acyclic graph and so some pals
actually more step
than others but yeah that's a good point
but I sort of think of that as it's a
feature because it's it's it's more
expressive because we don't need to do
that and of course about that I mean all
these discussions we have reasoning or
why this graph is that I model but it
seems at the end everything is
indistinguishable from the actions you
do on this model is it I mean is that
everything is in distinction from the
actions independent of why I chose to
read you know children and how I reason
about why today I think yes asked me to
advise as much I supposed to it is true
yes so I think that the this interesting
questions here operated served to two
levels this sort of black box is the
mechanism it says for some reason you're
behaving this way now let's talk about
the kinds of structures on which that's
going to cause you have problems for
example let me not ask exactly why you
thought it was sort of more painful to
do it now or whatever but given that
that's what you're like this tells me
how to put deadlines in for example to
allow you to finish it then this
question of the mechanism right and I
think yeah those are both interesting
and actually is a lot interesting
mechanism questions to say like here's a
sort of level low level reasoning which
would produce this kind of behavior so
yes let me think okay so that's what
we've done so far let me talk about a
few things and I'll sort of touch any
each of these briefly to just show the
sorts of theorems that one can actually
try proving with this model the first
one which I'll spend most time is
characterizing instances with high cost
ratios okay so what are the graph
structures on which this sort of bias
leads to the biggest trouble and
actually the accra life story
interestingly because it sort of almost
was accidentally our first introduction
to it it figured it plays a role and
almost provably plays a role in this in
this whole framework so first of all
let's point out that the akerlof story
can be made much worse quantitatively
because if you think about it in order
for me not to do this and wait till
tomorrow I have an extra factor of B to
play with right in a kalaf story it
wasn't even a close call today versus
tomorrow I mean tomorrow one x factor of
B so I can take advantage of that by
blowing up the cost tomorrow to
something that's almost be times bigger
and he would still have made that
decision well it says is that you know
rather than do it today I'm going to
wait till tomorrow when it's actually
factor C worse for a see that I can
basically push all the way up to
and then I'm gonna wait till it's even
worse and so it's actually going up
exponentially right it's a it's almost
this sort of you know it's almost
painful to conduct a right this idea
you're putting off this thing is just
getting worse and worse and worse and
worse and yet you keep doing it until
finally you just incur some absolutely
massive cause so the cost ratio can
certainly be exponential and once we saw
that you know obviously that you know
that's a big problem and so we sort of
switched from figuring out the exact
bound here in n to the question of can
we characterize the instances where this
exponential exponentially bad behavior
happens and in particular are sort of
informal statement was must be the case
of any instance with a large cost ratio
contain acryl off story is some kind of
a substructure is that sort of the
unique way to get this sort of bed bad
exponentially bad situation and because
we have graphs you know as opposed to
stories we can actually try to say what
substructure means here so here's what
we're gonna use for substructure we use
the idea of a minor of a graph we're
gonna say one graph is a minor of
another frick containing substructures
so we'll say graph a Chisum so just for
definitions so that the notion of graph
Myers was introduced to say like when is
one graph sort of topologically
containing another not just a sub graph
will say hsm IRG if we can find
connected pieces connected subsets of G
contract them into super nodes and
produce a copy of age so for example if
H were the complete graph on four nodes
four nodes all connected I can say
that's a minor of this graph because
what I'll do is I'll find for super
nodes all of them connected pieces I
will sort of blur out the insides of
them and I'll notice the connectivity
pattern is complete connectivity so
therefore K 4 is sitting there as a
minor of the screen okay so this is a
very so this is a concept that gets used
a lot in graph theory because it's just
a very very nice way to talk about what
the sort of global core structure of a
graph is okay so akerlof story what it
mean to have have that as a minor
they're a bunch of ways to formalize
this let me pick one that actually
throws away a lot of the sort of fine
structure here throws away the cost that
throws away the directions and just
looks at this graph this kind of moving
around the rim rather going to the
center so we'll call this graph the K
fan because it has K nodes on the
outside and sort of
unshaved so there it is the K fan the
graph consisting of a knode path and one
note that all of this link and then
given that we actually prove a theorem
that yes the afterlife story is actually
sitting inside any a such thing and
here's here's the statement of the
theorem exactly so for every exponential
base lambda greater than 1 the sum come
absolute constant epsilon so that if the
cost ratio is exponential if it's at
least lambda to the end then the
underlying undirected graph of my
instance contains a kfan minor 4k that's
actually epsilon x so this is the
generic waited as in whenever you have
really bad cost ratios somewhere sitting
in there is actually a really large
akerlof story because actually epsilon n
is a constant fraction of the entire
graph and so it's really a constant
fraction of this thing is actually
completely dominated by by that thing
alright so that's the that's the
statement and actually it's once you
decide that this is actually what you're
trying to prove it's not actually that
that hard to prove it so I'll sketch how
we actually prove that so in the end
when you try to prove graph minor
results what you do is you know you're
given this graph and the sort of fun
things to try proving journal because
you're told something about the graph
and then you try sort of you know
literally sort of building the minor
piece by piece sort of string it
together until you get the thing you
want right so basically we gonna have to
start with the only thing we know which
is it has a high high cost ratio we have
to sort of pull out these sort of you
know it's like sort of reaching into
clay and pull out these chunks because
each of these as a connected said and
then you're going to sort of wire them
up correctly and get and get the minor
yes seems like if you have a situation
like that you could they possibly gain a
lot if you were able to somehow a
randomized be see if you manage somehow
that B is van them even if it had higher
expectation than two yeah seems like you
would not get this exponent yeah so yeah
no so here I should point to a Nicole
and Brendan saying that idea who have
actually been thinking bit about what
happens if like the the present biased
thing actually is fully is fluttering
randomly across I'm also related to
vision
maybe if you someone had one some days
that are zero hours of work days and
some days that are 16 hours and somehow
we were there yeah to try to take
advantage of that fact that there's ya
know that we told you here it's an
absolute fixed thing but I think yeah
the the stuff that yet see we have ride
Fox would be end he's saying there would
be no paper submitted a fox which would
relate to another paper you did this ago
delete all these choices hey it is just
right people I mean yeah I'm actually Oh
what you i will support yeah you you do
qatar fox actually nobody folks you
don't know there's actually interesting
role you really do hello children you do
i'll point actually so Fox was an
example that sigil and i thought about
uh because there's a role that social
norms play here also which i haven't
really seen in the searcher but we
played with a bit in spite of this kind
of example this is someone making a
decision in isolation weighing cost
benefits but if I think about say a
conference deadlines coming up the
problem is you've got you know the
letter that you have to send right or
whatever it is you have to do if you
tell if you tell the person who's
waiting for you to do this work for them
sorry I can't the Fox deadlines coming
in two weeks they say what kind of
excuse is that just get me the letter if
you say the Fox deadline is tomorrow
that's actually now and acceptable right
so the social norm is such that the
quality of that deadline as an excuse is
actually going up exponentially to
somehow match some other exponential
going on here and so I think there's
something interesting going on there
that would be a chance to to try
modeling um good so so let's let's talk
about what the what the graph structure
looks like so um so all windows has cost
high cost ratio we'd like to build a
minor so what's happening so the agent
starts it is and just drawing this
schematically cuz we don't really know
what this graph looks like it's trying
to reach tea and it's following some
path t the reason for this height is
going to come up in a second let's say
that for any node ain t no does V and W
D of V W is the actual real cost as
measured in black you know numbers as
I've been drawing them so in particular
instant like D of V T for a lot
things ok we're say that the rank of a
node is basically the logarithm of its
current distance to the target so
basically it's the minimum J so that the
distance the target is less or equal to
B to the J times the original distance
right so you started out there was some
original distance but it's going to get
exponentially worse and so the rank is
kind of the base of how it's gonna get
exponentially worse so it's the right so
it's like be to the J times D of s T and
this right if I'm going to have high
cost ratio this is going to have to
climb to a big number so picture rank is
like this vertical axis and as I'm going
I'm climbing and rank I just keep
getting further you know despite my best
efforts i'm actually getting further
from the target that that's what's going
in in the in accra life story which was
not an exponential story he was just
sort of remaining equidistant from the
time wait you sort of idling he kept
being he could always solve all his
problem with the original cost but in
the bad examples I was showing you
you're actually getting further that's
what's happening right things have
gotten worse okay so one thing that you
can notice is that I actually fill in
these ranks very grant in a very
granular way ranks can only go up by at
most one per step so I actually fill in
each step in this ladder going up and
the reason is just to kind of run
through this argument so if VW is an
edge on the path let's say here's VW
then the rank of W is at most one the
rank of V plus one you can't go up very
fast with one edge why is that well
there's a short little argument for that
so if I pick this and instead this was
the surest path to t ok that's what's
going on you're going up this thing in
for them d there's always some bailout
option right you can always bail out and
just do the smart thing and actually get
to t instantly this is sort of how we're
going to try building the minor they're
gonna be all these ways to bail out and
they're all going to kind of string
together to make the money so here's w
prime so because i chose that sorry it's
a most be worse and so things only got
worse by factor B and that's basically
what this chain of inequalities to
see so the rank only went up by one okay
um the next point is that eventually I'm
gonna get to a node that actually has a
rank that's actually epsilon in for some
constant epsilon and why is that because
if the cost ratio gets this large then
you can
are you you're eventually going to
traverse an edge that has exponential
cost in order to achieve this joining
cost ratio and at the moment that you're
about to decide to traverse an edge of
exponential cost you have no other good
options because if you had something it
was way better or even more the fact
would be better you would take it so at
that point you have something which is
genuinely far from T ok so I'm going to
end up getting my rank really really
high ok so now what we have is the
structure where the ranks are climbing
but only one by one and they end up
getting very very high up to epsilon in
so let's say P star is the segment of P
that only goes from ass out to this very
high rank node and now here's how we're
going to build the minor topologically
so let's say VJ is the last note on this
path of rank J right so notice how like
these things are like this is the last
time you'll be at this rank everything
after this is higher everything after
this is higher after this is higher
because if I'm going to climb step by
step I'm going to have some last moment
when I was at that height okay and now
let's say QJ is the shortest path coming
down from each of these now the point is
in order to build this into a minor each
of these q JS is disjoint from the rest
of this path why is that well because
this is a choice pass from here on it
goes down and we just decided we chose
this note so if we're here on it goes up
so they can never meet again okay so
this actually is the kfan minor it's
what I've done is found right so my
super node will be one super node will
be P star those super nodes will be all
the q eyes except for the node where
they anchor and right we have to sort of
be a little careful to make sure this
really is disjoint from this because if
they all get tangled up that's not a
minor zero to be one uh this is an
acyclic graph so yeah right yeah so it's
also important this is nice that we go
which actually comes back to your agile
point that if this graph weren't a
cyclic I could actually a van infinite
cost ratio because like it's like us q0
and q1 disjoint they aren't I tried to
indicate that with q2 and q3 money trees
and that's fine actually because why is
it fun for you because the K fan has to
be built from this and then this gives
can be one giant super no that's all
glued together because you remember that
was that big super new at the center so
it's okay to those all get food
it's important to have at least one step
for justice joined mossad the first edge
is fine must be exact once you start
higher yeah first I just finally just
contract all this ok I should mention
actually some nice follow-up work by
tongue at all so actually for students
in an assist professor at Ching hua who
just did some nice fall to work on this
one of the results they had I'll mention
a second one briefly at the end they is
actually that they showed the actual
tight bounds so that actually so it's
actually the same direction that we had
but they just worked out that this is
the exact base yeah they sort of got the
actual tight number actually what's cool
about their result that's not true of
ours is ours remember was if you had an
accidental cost ratio in the size of and
ends the size of the graph here they can
do it for any k independent and so they
can handle sort of into intermediate
size minors like if you have the sort of
medium cost ratio you get a medium sized
minor that's that's nice yeah so same
direction as US but a much tighter
bounded you use the costs to build a
graph in the graph that you're building
doesn't necessarily support the cause it
doesn't have cost in it yeah I think
there's a much stronger or a much richer
statement which would be something like
they're in fact as a director structure
like this where the costs are also
increasing along but but yeah but in the
language of minors we threw all the all
the weights on the edges okay um let me
mention just a couple things quickly and
then we'll wrap up so um heterogeneous
populations is wonder Singh question so
which pals are possible as we vary the
right so consider the course someone
where B equals one would actually do the
smart thing and just do the work and
they be done so with us that would be
not much bigger than one would actually
procrastinate then see trouble looming
it might actually do that and then
people with a larger value P would
actually failed accord or drop the
course right so in fact you get these
different pals and so we have is
actually a kind of parametric shortest
path problem but an interesting one
whereas I sweep over B how many
different paths can I get and what's
interesting is the traditional
parametric shortest path problem which
has been worked on for you know
several decades really is where all the
edge costs are growing linearly in some
parameter and we know actually there
that you can actually get a greater than
polynomial number of fails what's
interesting here though is that here
it's just be as controlling the first
edge everything else is sort of the same
after that and while I will skip the
details on that you can end up showing
that you end up with at most a quadratic
number of paths so in fact this is most
n squared and square possible paths
through the system all right i'll skip
that so i can mention one final question
and then i will wrap up this was one
that i found kind of you know once we
had the graph formalism and we already
thought we understood was going on there
was one more twist that we thought was
kind of cool so is it there's nice
algorithmic problem here which is the
algorithmic choice reduction problem I
give you a structure I give you you know
the map of the course all the weeks and
everything you have to decide which
nodes to delete to make it actually
achievable by someone with a given
present bias level all right so it's
exactly the question where should you
put deadlines but for an arbitrary graph
it's given a graph that is not
reversible by this agent with this
present bias because I'm gonna get stuck
is there a sub graph that would be so I
just kind of remove options for them and
now I've created something where now the
funny thing was when we thought about
this problem we thought okay this is
really you know not to be very hard
because if there's a way to do this
surely there must be a way that's just a
path right then because they're
eventually going to follow a pal so I
just figure out what that is and I
should just blow away everything else
from the graph and that'll be and we
thought that was how the whole game was
gonna go that was actually false so
here's an example this graph is minimal
subject to being traversable no path in
industry versa bowl but the sub graph is
traversable because here's how this
works I reward of 12 this with my last
little worked out thing um reward of 12
p equals 2 as always so you start
hearing you say four plus six plus two
is twelve so it's doable I'm going to
take the upper route okay you get to
here and you say oh that looks on
appealing because that's six times two
that's 14 I don't do that but now this
comes to your rescue a 2 x 3 6 12 and
I'll do that but the funny thing is if I
remove
this if I move be you would never get
started and if I remove this you would
get stuck actually need the entire graph
to get you to the end and again you know
we look as we thought is this kind of
some sort of weird artifact of our graph
model or is this to something that we
recognize in ourselves and there is
something to be said about you know you
maybe are the you know parent of someone
and you're trying to teach to get them
to play the violin you know and they're
you know six years old and so what do
you do you know you know if they can get
to the goal state they'll have a
rewarding life of knowing how to play a
musical instrument so they want to do it
because they think they're going to
become a virtuoso right that's why they
start out but you got to hear and
realize actually be kind of a virtuoso
requires a real whole lot of practice
but once you're here you realize there
actually is a way in which you can
continue and you end up doing that right
so this notion that you're sort of
there's a reason why you believed it but
then you end up not following that but
you get to the goal anyway we can all
make our own things so it turned out
this was actually quite a hard problems
not just there isn't always a path but
actually two groups of people so if I go
who got interested some of the stuff
over the summer thought about this
problem as did this aforementioned five
authored tongue Adele paper and they
prophesy prove that it's actually even
much higher than that it's actually
np-complete to figure out is there a sub
graph that's true reversible in bed in
this crap so this is actually quite a
hard problem I think there's a couple
very nice approximation questions the
most natural one being by how little can
you know if there is a trousseau get by
how little can i inflate the reward so
as to polynomial time find one right so
you know I'll inflate to reward a bit
and then I'll I'll do something ok so
that's the that's the end of my story
which again has been sort of a journey
from the metaphorical treasure maps we
draw to kind of much more concrete graph
structures again I think there are a
bunch of interesting open questions and
i'll just mention a bunch of you know
four of them and again because it
already came up i'll point it Nicole and
Brenda's also doing some cool stuff
following up on the nice work that uh
well not to act upon it but uh also nice
where's Nicole and Greg and facility are
doing so again approximation algorithm
is on this traversable sub graph problem
I think are quite interesting and
generally the design problem of
once I have these graphs I can ask how
do I design a system that someone is
likely actually complete despite their
biases and if I have to inject a little
more reward in than would be optimal
because it's computationally hard to
find the best design that's still I
think it is very much the sort of thing
either blowing up for words at the end
or even placing internal rewards in the
middle sophisticated agents came up
agents who are aware of their own biases
I think there's it really feels like
there's a very nice extension this model
to graphs with sophistication we haven't
quite found one that we're happy with
but it does feel like it's it's there
somewhere and finally you know we're
motivated by the idea that you know
badges are this interesting incentive
system that sort of lead people on
toward long-range goals and trying to
connect some of these back to models and
in particular to all the data that we
have from Coursera from stack overflow
on how people are trying to reach goals
and looking for evidence with these kind
of biases I think it's gonna be very
interesting so I'll stop there thanks
