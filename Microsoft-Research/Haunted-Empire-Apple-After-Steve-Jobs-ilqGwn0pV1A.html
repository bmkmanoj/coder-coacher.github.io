okay thank you now for coming my name's
Amy Draves and I'm very pleased to
welcome Yukari cane for the Microsoft
Research visiting speaker series yukari
is here to discuss her book haunted
empire in which he looks at Apple in the
two years since Steve Jobs death and she
reveals the challenges of opportunities
for the company as they're going through
after losing their leader yukari's a
veteran journalist with nearly 15 years
of experience writing about the tech
industry she was named a gerald loeb
award finalist and has worked for The
Wall Street Journal the US News and
World Report and Reuters please join me
in giving her a very warm welcome thanks
for the kind introduction I way to keep
my presentation hopefully relatively
short to allow for some time to ask
questions this is the last story i did
for The Wall Street Journal I was
actually working on my book idea several
months earlier in the spring of 2011 and
my original idea had been about how
Apple became successful and and how it
got there Apple was doing double digit
triple digit growth sand revenue and
profits and blowing the most optimistic
of estimates out of the water and it
just feel like it felt like you know
there was there was no containing them
and I wanted to do a story about how how
the team did it not as much on Steve
Jobs but shortly after this story came
out it became clear that people weren't
as interested in the history anymore and
the real question that people that
everyone wanted to know is what happens
to apple now how does it move beyond
Steve and how is it going to deal with
the challenges and so I shifted
directions and as I thought about the
story I realized that there was a
broader theme at work here and what we
were really talking about was this
question what happens to an empire when
it loses it
/ and you know it's it's obviously
relevant in government I actually
studied what happened in Macedonia after
Alexander the Great died and found some
interesting correlations about the
dynamics and and and the human nature
that that that plays into it but it also
is a theme that occurs in business a lot
in a lot of companies and I'd realized
that I'd seen this before in various
stages these are some of the companies
that I covered in my career and there
they were really interesting because at
Motorola I was covering the company when
Chris Galvan was there and he was trying
to get out from under the shadows of his
father and his grandfather before him
and I was writing about Nintendo shortly
after the current president awateh had
been appointed he was 43 years old which
is unheard of in Japan it's a very young
age and he was taking over after a
president who have been running the
company for 53 years and Sony of course
doesn't take much explaining but you
know it still asks the question today
about what its co-founder Akio Morita
would be doing and in some of its
present-day challenges and it's very
dominant in the in the company discourse
and so at Apple I realized that I had a
chance to to take a front seat and see
what happens in the immediate years
after a visionary founder is no longer
there I started with these two questions
this is from my whiteboard in my office
can compare this magnitude be sustained
and can a great company stay great
without its visionary founder and based
on what I knew of Apple at the time
these are the questions this that my
answers were yes and maybe and so I
embarked on a reporting tour I went
traveled around the world I really
thought that it was
important to look at Apple from a 360
degree global perspective because it
really is truly a global company and I
went to Europe to talk to Jonathan Ive
the head of industrial designs early
colleagues and friends and professors to
try to understand where we're apples
design philosophy came from I went to
Asia stayed in Taiwan and went to
Beijing and shen jen hong kong korea to
understand that mark that region not
just as part of a big part of apple
supply chain but as a market because
it's it has been apple's fastest growing
growing market and and what happens
there has a huge impact in cupertino and
I interviewed nearly 200 sources had
multiple conversations with many of them
most of them have for first person
knowledge of of the goings-on related to
Apple and the I guess the biggest thing
that I learned was that Apple's journey
is far from over but it'll never be the
same and and this seems really obvious
but it hasn't been over the last couple
of years Apple itself has said over and
over and over again that it's um that is
still the same company nothing has
changed without Steve and to me that
just doesn't hold true because
everything has changed without Steve you
know Apple was a company that had been
synonymous with Steve Jobs name and
Steve's name was synonymous was with
apples and and and and not only that but
the the company was structured around
his strengths and weaknesses and it was
carefully calibrated to to work around
him and so when you when when that core
is gone and you've got everything else
the same and you're not acknowledging
that it's things have changed
then I think you do see the equilibrium
start to to get dismantled so I thought
I saw um three areas that I wanted to
talk about today where I think the
impact of that is is really apparent and
I think products are lopsided marketing
is has become unconvincing and
businesses and decisive what do I mean
by that my first example is Apple maps I
don't think I have to explain this very
much but you know looked beautiful and
it didn't work it really didn't work my
favorite example is is that it labeled
Greenland as the Indian Ocean but yeah I
think it's it's a it's an extreme
example of products becoming lopsided
towards design and and I do think that's
a change Steve always talked about
standing on the intersection of the
Liberal Arts and Technology and I think
with respect to develop me what he meant
by that was that things had to look
beautiful but they had to work as well
and there's no single person at the
company right now that embodies both of
those qualities what's interesting is
that Apple has has put forth Jonathan
Ive the head of industrial design as as
Steve's visionary successor and I think
that Johnny absolutely gets the vision
and has shared in the vision I do think
though that it's a little bit risky
because what makes him possibly the most
brilliant industrial designer of our
time is that he pushes the limits of of
how things look without consideration
about how things work on the inside and
and if he didn't he wouldn't be the
great industrial designer he is today
and and when I think about this I go
back to an exam to a story that an
engineer was telling me about the
development of the Apple TV remote
control johnny was apparently adamant
that it could only have six buttons
because anything more than that and it
was going to be cluttered and the
problem with that is that when you think
about a six buttons means you've got the
on and off switch you've got the home
button and you've got the four arrow
keys and where's the volume and so they
went back and forth about this and and
johnny was adamant and he won the
argument and there's still no volume
buttons to this day and what that means
is that that remote control can never be
your central device in the living room
and and he didn't care and so I think
that you know that's a small example but
those are the kinds of decisions where
things can can go in a in the wrong
direction the second thing I point to is
the ads ads are really interesting
because it's actually the one area where
Steve had total control he did not let
anybody else really have any say in it
phil schiller the head of marketing was
never allowed to touch it he loved the
weekly meetings with shia day his
advertising agency and and from what i
understand it was one of the last
meetings that he he gave up before he
got too sick to do literally anything
and I was one of the surprises to me and
watching Apple in the immediate
aftermath is how quickly the ads changed
the and it happened you know almost
really fast I I think about the iphone
4s ads where sea ray was in the middle
where was all about Siri which was a
beta product and the conversations that
took place in that in the ads didn't
even work and that's something that I
you know Steve was the kind of guy that
that caught those things because he knew
the power of you know seeing something
on television using it at home and
and and then having it work and that was
part of part of the magic that Apple was
so good at playing off of and this one
of course is them was a series of ads
about a year after he died around the
time of the Olympics and it was
interesting because they were very well
done they they had the right tone they
had that Apple that that apple style and
they were a series of exchanges between
mac geniuses and consumers who didn't
know anything and and and the genius
that helped solve the problem and they
actually got yanked within weeks because
it got one thing really really wrong
which is that Apple is all about
empowering the consumer it's not about
making them look dumb and the ads made
the consumers look dumb and so it's it's
interesting that it only took a year to
to to get there of course the question
that everybody's smart that's on
everybody's minds right now is what what
comes next I referred earlier to having
studied what happened when Alexander the
Great died and one of the there's an
entire book on on that topic and there
it was very interesting reading it
because some some of the things that was
taking place you could literally put Tim
Cook and Steve in there and it would it
would apply to what's happening at apple
today and one of the things that really
made me perk up was there's a there's a
section where says that purchase who was
given the the power of the Empire had to
rule by consensus because after
Alexander the Great died he couldn't get
the he didn't have the support to get
his decisions through so the only way he
could do that is to make sure that he
had the majority behind him and one of
the things that I also heard at Apple
was that he you know Tim Cook was was
making a lot more decisions by consensus
which is a change because you know we I
think anybody who knows anything about
Steve knows that he didn't seek
anybody's opinions and I think you know
it's been people have talked about the
fact that it's been three years since
the I it was only three years between
the iphone and the ipad and we're going
into the fourth year and you know why
yet tim has been talking about this new
product for years and and what's takin
so long and i think that there is that
the indecisiveness if I were in gym
shoes I'd be I'd be I'd be very stressed
not about whether i can hit it big but
uh but about whether he should or not i
mean one of the things that Steve always
talked about was that his what was
important was to say no as often as it
was to say yes the ipad was killed three
times before he went out with it and he
didn't let public opinion sway him and
you know i will see i'm going to be very
interested this fall as well but he also
had this power of persuasion that we all
know is the reality distortion field and
we all talked about it in and did have
an appreciation for but i think in the
years since he's been gone i have
certainly grown to appreciate it more
than I've had before because i think
apple has lost something huge by this
when you think about it you know we
always thought about the reality
distortion field visa V the media or the
consumers but it was their visa V his
executive team the employees the board
of directors the shareholders the
suppliers and the developers I mean he
was able to convince people that Apple
was doing something amazing even when
there was nothing there when it was
between product cycles and people had
had faith and and sometimes often it was
irrational I'm you know and he was and
that I think is definitely
cracking right now you know I was in
China and I heard the suppliers the
suppliers talked to me fairly freely and
to the point that I asked them you know
why are you willing to share this and he
says well you know there's too many
people working on it and we're not all
paid enough to keep our mouths shut and
so you know i think that was always true
but before you had Steve's ire to
contend with and without that its people
people talk more there's less loyalty
you know the suppliers are more
reluctant about taking on apple's
business and so it's a it's a it was a
real thing and I think it was a big
driver for Apple success because you
know when you come out with something
innovative part of part of it of course
is that it's actually innovative but the
other is perception and if you don't
have the ability to control that
perception or manipulate it it's it's
it's very hard um I I think Apple
understands this because it's been out
in the media more than it's ever been
under Steve these are just some of the
the headlines that I picked up but to me
it does beg the question of you know why
do they feel like they have to be out
there so much when they've always been
about very careful messaging and I think
it also shows us what happens when
you're out there a lot because there's
more fodder for people to criticize you
know there was an article a blog I think
year two ago where the headline was you
know every time Tim Cook opens is not
the stock falls and the funny thing
about that was that he every time he
opened his mouth in those occasions he
was saying the same thing but he just
said them in different venues and so it
just gives people an excuse and I think
that as a result apples also losing
control over its NER
so my answer is changed and out of
inevitable I'm not sure that power of
this magnitude can be sustained because
there's just the more I did research the
more I realize that there are so many
forces a lot of them beyond apples
control that just wait away on a company
pulling it towards the middle can a
great company stay great I I'm still I
guess looking for that I don't think
Apple can be the same company it can't
be the same great company but if it
changes its definition of great if it's
willing to become something else that
maybe that's possible now I think the
last couple of months have been really
interesting to me because I Apple
finally seems to be realizing this and
it's embracing Steve's last words of
advice never asked what i would do just
do what's right and we're seeing this in
various ways beats of course you know
you could agree with it you could
disagree with it but Steve would have
never done it WWDC is um was interesting
as well I mean in the past steve has
owned that he was the main keynote
speaker and this year we saw Tim giving
up the spotlight to to some of his other
executives like our credit rating I
think a lot of people remarked that it
seemed much more light-hearted and fun
as well and the anin marketing Apple has
started shifting doing something
different there as well they're taking
the advertising more in house away from
shy a day Katie caught in the longtime
PR to put a PR head left so we'll see
what shakes out there and but the most
interesting thing is that Apple has
started articulating a new vision of
connected now a connected home
and either there are obvious challenges
in Apple's not the only one who's
articulated this vision but but they
have and it's a post Steve Jobs vision
and I for one am really interested to
see where they go with that and to me
the key question now is is the following
can a new vision inspire you know it's
they can they can come out with the best
vision possible but you know again it's
about it's it's the combination of
whether it has innovation and whether it
has whether it can crawl that perception
and I think that's going to determine
where Apple is 10 to 20 years from now I
I'm happy to take your questions I have
a mic if you don't mind using it
otherwise on the video can you comment
on what you learned about the aftermath
of Steve's management style and the
negative impact that it had in real time
versus the perception later the at the
time I mean out Steve Steve had um steve
was very much more mercurial he was
difficult to work for I think people
people dealt with the screaming and the
yelling for that word of praise I mean
he was a very emotional person and so if
something sucked he told you that it was
it sucked but if you came back into the
did something the next day and it was
amazing he told you it was brilliant and
and people lived for that what I found
was that the the guys that stayed
including tim cook that worked really
well around him were just calm people
who could not be rattled you know ah BTW
aenean was also like that as well from
what i understand jon rubinstein not so
much you know which which could be
perhaps one of the the reasons why he
eventually you know left the company but
people you know he they were able to
take in what Steve said and and and deal
with it rationally because they
understood that you
Steve at the end of the day just wanted
the problem solved since then I mean I
think it's a I guess the easiest way to
answer that is that I hear that there
are a lot of many Steve Jobs is out
there and cupertino now and that's part
of the problem is that he's become this
model for for a successful CEO and it's
not it worked because it was him it
doesn't work for everybody and you have
you know you have to be a certain person
a lot of people told me that you know
Phil Schiller used to like to emulate
his style and it did not go down as well
as with with him as a tip with Steve
so thanks for the investigation of the
company I mean it's such a such a part
of what we think about or met some of us
think about it Microsoft when we come to
work every day to about our competition
is doing I'm just curious about beats I
mean you kind of passed over that that
was a heck of a lot of money for two
guys in Hollywood who bought a headphone
company from a monster what is the
background there what have you found out
from your sources I mean I I personally
don't understand it from for every
reason that that's given you know is the
the pervasive thought is that they were
there buying into beads cool but you
know if the company that defined cool
for the last ten years is buying
somebody else is cool then it kind of
shows you where where they're going you
know there's this the there's the
thought that they're buying Jimmy the
the CEO and and I don't know him enough
to know whether that's going to work or
not some of the people that I talk to
you who know him don't think it's going
to work you know part of part of what
they bought was beats music streaming
business and the relationships with
Hollywood which right yeah but they do
have the relations that ships with
Hollywood the problem I think is that I
think they got a lot of those
relationships because they were that
because Hollywood in the music industry
was hoping to to beef up competition for
Apple and so when you join Apple it
becomes a different story and no matter
how strong your relationships are people
aren't going to bet against themselves I
mean they've seen what happened what
Apple could do to an industry and I
think people are too smart today and
when you have what Apple wants in terms
of content everybody else wants
Microsoft wants google wants Netflix
wants amazon wants and if you were a
content and company I just don't see
why you wouldn't give it to everybody
why you would give it just a one company
at this juncture because they've seen
that you know no matter how much money
Apple puts down if you don't have an
industry at the end of it it's not worth
it could you comment on Scott Forest
Hills departure from apple and as a
follow-up how many how many of the X the
next team that he brought to Apple are
still in place if you know I think Scott
what I heard is that well you know Scott
was a really controversial person and
the amazing thing about writing this
book is that in terms of the executive
team I got a pretty consistent portrayal
of who they were and one of the things
that everybody said about Scott is
diplomatically is that he was the least
liked executive team member by other
executive team members and that would
have included Tim Cook because he was a
colleague for a long time and Tim you
know Scott Scott did whatever it took
and Tim would have been watching that
and I so I don't think that the blood
wasn't great to begin with but then you
combine that with Tim's management style
where you know he gives you enough rope
to hang yourself with and he kind of
took that from what I understand one of
the the you know the breaking point was
when Scott in a meeting challenged him
openly and the Tim's not the kind of guy
who likes that I think Tim what I heard
was that Tim himself when he disagreed
with Steve would wait until everybody
else left and discuss it just with Steve
and so that was his style and he didn't
he doesn't like to be openly challenged
and he likes team players in terms of
what what happened to the team that
that's
i I don't I don't know a ton about that
i mean i think a lot of people are still
there a lot of people have left because
it just in general because they're
they're tired i think changing the world
is great you know the first second time
around there you know and it becomes a
little less exhilarating as as you go on
could you comment on the book
price-fixing settlement and and how
Steve and Tim handled that differently
well you might want to describe the
situation for people who don't know what
I'm talking about so Apple was was
accused of yes and convicted of
orchestrating this this book pricing
scheme with with digital books and that
resulted in raising the prices it was it
was a it was a response to app to Amazon
because amazon had would price books so
low that nobody else could compete
profitably anyway and Apple was and
there have been reams of of emails and
phone conversations and there's just
been a ton of evidence about Apple in
discussions with with these publishers
and they would the publishers eventually
settled and Apple went went forth with
the case and their main argument was
that you know they're a newcomer to this
business so they have no ability to to
manipulate anything and you know to me
was didn't really fly because they do
have you know they have the power of
being the dominant company and
technology and and being the biggest
music retailer but what was interesting
about that was that they were very
aggressive in their arguments I heard
later that you know one of their lawyers
knew that they had
living hand and so it was it was just a
matter of of getting enough stuff in for
appeal but what was interesting to me
was that a year a year almost a year
earlier in the Apple Samsung trials they
they were all so aggressive and they
managed to charm and persuade people
over to their story and with the e-book
trials it was it wasn't a jury it was a
judge and if you look at her her
decision legal files are really boring
but this was one of the most
entertaining decisions ever because she
was just you know footnotes and Commons
challenging their sincerity and their
testimony you know calling Eddy Cue out
what was funny was that Eddy Cue who's
the head of digital at Apple was thought
to have done a brilliant job testifying
and she she the judge really didn't
didn't take any of that and it it was an
example of how Apple had lost control
over its narrative I think if Steve had
been there I mean again Steve has this
um this power of persuasion that's
unmatched and I think things could have
turned out differently he you know he
was able to to persuade with no hand
so i think steve was a very unique
combination of a lot of characteristics
and personality traits that was able to
create the sort of runaway success that
he did the sort of revolution that he
created in technology right and I think
you very naturally pointed out that
there are Steve wannabes now out there
that probably more than anything else
just make a big ass of themselves you
know by being by trying to be like a
what what he was but you being a
technology reporter and being aware of
what other companies are doing what is
what other CEOs are also doing do you
think there is even somebody not
necessarily like Steve or like the same
traits as see but somebody who can
create the sort of affect the sort of
outcome that Steve created for Apple in
any other company currently in our
industry um I think it's a complex
question I me the one that most
obviously comes up is is Elon Musk but I
think to a certain extent you know
people like Jeff Bezos I mean if you if
you have if you are founding visionary
you have just in terms of the way your
company is set up you have just have
much more ability to take big risks and
because because the board works for you
you don't work for the board and that
makes a huge difference I think and how
you know how much you you have to
justify your actions or not at all and
so it does give it gives any company
with a visionary founder at the helm an
advantage uh I'm uh I'd love to hear
your opinion on some of the other books
that have come out about Apple like you
know well I see you have Isaacson on
your cover his book about jobs there's a
jony ive's book which is like more comes
off like a hagiography like he makes him
look like a saint and then there's
inside Apple and so many of these seem
like they're positioning Apple in a way
for the future and I I'd love your your
take home um you know Isaacson's book
I've
I've heard probably I know there are a
lot of different opinions about it
people who know and love Steve don't
feel like there's enough of those
stories and their etc I Walter was very
supportive my book and I had a few
conversations with him and one of the
things I realized when I talked to him
was that he absolutely understood the
value of the access he was getting and
he also understood that just a certain
extent he was really close because as a
result and so his biggest concern was to
to put as much of Steve's words in the
book as possible for other generations
to analyze and so he saw his book more
as a resource for the future and that's
different than any of the other books
he's written because he's just a you
know he's a brilliant guy and his
analysis on you know on history
historical figures in the past like
Einstein Benjamin Franklin is is just
amazing but there's not as much of that
in this book and I didn't realize until
I spoke to him that that was deliberate
because he thought that was that was for
for me and in other generations of
journalists to come Adam Lucian skis
inside Apple I mean I thought it was
it's a great primer it it really lays
out what a lot of us know about how
Apple works and covering the company in
a digestible way Leander's book about
Johnny I mean I think you know he his
blog is called cult of mac so there's a
definite there's a definite angle to it
it's very readable I you know why what
I've learned from about Johnny myself is
that he's a much more of a controversial
character inside the company he's not in
Apple's a very political place as
probably any company is they hide it
better but it's a very political place
and what I learned was that johnny is
just as political the difference is is
that he's not political for himself as
much as he's political for design
if it's too if it's to push forward than
interests of design he will do anything
I think there's Fred vogelstein dogfight
about Google and an apple Fred's a
really close friend and it's it's an
interesting take that he offers
definitely okay yeah we have time for
one more question if anyone and if you
allow me a second question in talking to
your sources about Apple and their their
world and competition how did Microsoft
come up in the context how does how do
you find the exact it is the inside
people in Apple where how do they see
the the world today in the competitive
space and where does Microsoft fittin if
you don't mind yeah I am I won't limit
it to what people inside Apple say
because I'm you know I'm sure that that
you can guess but you know the
interesting thing though is is that what
I would I you know I talked to you when
i talked to almost 200 people i talked
in every part of apples business and and
you know not just Apple but suppliers as
well and people who watch the entire
industry really closely and I think
there's a definite sense that you know
Microsoft is still really in the game
and there's doing some great work and
and I mean I heard some high praise
about the the phone you know I I think
maybe perception is slow to catch up but
I don't think anybody is you know it's
it you you have the I mean I now I'm
waiting into territory that I don't
really know as much but you know from
somebody who doesn't know anything i
think you know regardless of how much
Bill Gates is still involved or not
involved the fact that he's kind of
present in the background helps the
company and
you know it's it's definitely part of
the sphere that Apple has to worry about
you know I think others that may not be
on everybody's radars and everybody
thinks about Silicon Valley or you know
in terms of content or whatever you
think about Amazon and Google and
Facebook and that world but if you take
it to the world we know about Samsung
but the company that or the where
Samsung Samsung is also looking over its
shoulder at China and it was interesting
because when I went to China two years
ago this was before lenovo bought
Motorola people were telling me to watch
out for lenovo because China has a you
know is really interested in in in
pushing that company forward and and
lenovo has been making you know noises
by even back then that it has global
ambitions and you know samsung knows
that lenovo is coming after it and and
if it's not lenovo it's you know it's
huawei or somebody else and they've got
a whole country behind them Yukari thank
you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
