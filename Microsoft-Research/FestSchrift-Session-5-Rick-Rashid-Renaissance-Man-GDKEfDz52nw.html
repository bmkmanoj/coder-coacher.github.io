galen hunt is a principal researcher and
research manager at MSR Redmond where he
leads the operating systems group Galen
joined Microsoft Research in 1997 he'd
previously been an intern he received
his PhD in computer science from the
University of Rochester you may have
noticed a theme here lots of
carnegie-mellon but also lots of
Rochester here today Galen is going to
actually give me giving us a talk about
some OS research I thought we had to fit
that into the day somewhere yo thang we
have would somebody go get such it he
needs to hear my talk alright so my
introduction of Microsoft so I was an
intern in in 1995 I was a beneficent at
the University of Rochester and my
advisor said hey I've got a former
student bilbo Loski was at this place
called microsoft research why don't you
apply there to go do an internship and I
didn't want to go to Microsoft Research
I had made a progression in personal
thought about Microsoft so before that
as an undergraduate in my earlier life I
was a Steve Jobs fanboy and my
philosophy Microsoft Microsoft was pure
evil I was absolutely convinced to this
and somewhere around the time i went to
graduate school I learned that you
shouldn't always assume evilness okay
and so I had evolved to where I just
decided that Microsoft was not evil it
was just grossly incompetent okay and so
I helped I got this offer from bill
belofsky to do an internship and I held
onto it for two months because I had
also applied to park and embel labs and
that's why I really wanted to go and
after two months I decided they weren't
going to make me an offer so I'd go
ahead and do the internship at Microsoft
Research and Bill started me off on a
project and on the third about the third
day that I was at amis are we had lunch
with Rick because he was then the
manager of the
Systems Group as well and after lunch
Rick stop by my office and said so
what's bill got you working on I told
him is that that's a stupid idea you
should do this other thing that that we
should try to do it instead and that's
the other thing that he thought we
should try to do kind of relate it was a
time when they were doing tiger and that
was rather than using fiber which is
basically what Tiger was going to be
using to homes could we do something
over the internet because we do video
over the internet and so I did a project
and the theme of this session is rick is
the Renaissance man and Rick true a
Renaissance man is someone who can do
anything right well Rick was my tester
so I would write code during the day and
mock of trying to do streaming audio and
video over the internet over IP but I
didn't have a computer at home I
couldn't do anything streaming and so
Rick every night would take home I don't
know how we tramped probably on a floppy
at the time the latest bits that i had
come up with and he would and he would
run my tests from from his house trying
to stream from MSR to his house and then
he would come back in the morning and
tell me what didn't work and then I'd
code all day furiously and then he tried
again and it after three weeks we had
the prototype where I had the prototype
working and I don't know how many times
Rick had to watch if you give a moose a
muffin but but many people did actually
okay when I came back that evidently the
internship worked well enough that Rick
tried to convince me that I should keep
a ongoing relationship with MSR and so I
came back about three months after my
internship and here's one of my wise
things i learned from rick and i found
out that i'd done this great prototype
but the developers that were actually
working on the project hits or every
single line of my code away everything
it don't everything away and i was
complaining to Rick about how terrible
this was that they'd thrown all my stuff
away and he said well actually you win
because when they rewrite your code that
means that you actually convinced them
and so as a researcher that's all you
have to do there's a correlate and I
don't know if he said this or not but I
tell it to my people all the time it
also means you're not responsible for
the bugs because they put the bugs in
you and my other corollary from that is
that you really as a researcher you
should write any more code than you have
to prove an idea okay and I'm going to
do the extreme was I talked about a
piece of research that we've done
recently I'm going to do the extreme
example of that and that is reusing
roughly five and a half million lines of
windows with a few tens of thousands of
line of our code and be able to do
something that's never been done before
and so this is where I where we type
nicely in with such as talk from earlier
in the day about virtual machines okay
so virtual machines basically got this
great thing that you can take an
application stack so a nap and the
windows subsystem and the NT kernel and
you run on hardware but if you insert a
virtual machine monitor and another copy
of the operating system you can get many
wonderful properties that such a
described i generally summarize them as
you can get secure isolation you can get
persistent compatibility which is the
ability of you can change the host and
the app still keeps working and you also
get some other property that i can't
remember at the moment anyway so your
sister I can really can't remember at
the moment okay um but the problem is
this wonderfulness comes at a very very
high price there's lots of fat and
basically the source of the fat is
there's you've got this it's all a row
revolves around this abstraction of a
complete copy of a pc and so the virtual
machine monitor has this whole layer
that emulates hardware and then right
after that right on top of that you
shove an operating system and a bunch of
drivers that go back to abstract annette
hardware away okay and so our insight
was well gee could we we want to do the
radical most radical thing you could do
to a virtual machine could you actually
remove all the hardware and what would
that look like well it turns out this
isn't a radical idea at all okay in fact
basically the the in the inspiration for
this was the 1990 paper about unix as an
application program okay and this is
where it ties back in with Rick
work and basically the idea here was
that you know unix there's a bunch of
service as the personality operating
system the service is that the
applications need have very little to do
with what's actually going on in the
hardware abstraction portion of the
colonel and so you can actually separate
the personality out and the original
paper there was a small library that sat
inside the process and then eunuchs
actually ran as an applicant as a
service on the side okay and our twist
on this was gee what if we actually put
UNIX or the operating so the person the
OS personality inside the process and
why would we want to put it inside the
process well the reason we want to put
inside the process is if some colleagues
desire of ours at MSR I came up with
this idea of what's called a picot
process and they said if you take a
process a traditional operating system
process and you remove all access to
operating system services what you end
up with is this pure isolation container
it's a virtual address space and you can
run code inside it but the code can't
get out of it well the problem is you
actually need the code get out a little
bit and so you create an interface but
the interface rather than looking like
this baroque PC circa nineteen
ninety-five from my internship PC you
could actually create a little bit
higher level of abstraction well but
then the problem is you've got this
great container you can provide us some
basic services like say virtual memory
and communication but how do you run
rich windows applications inside of it
and that's really from because these
windows applications actually expect a
very very rich set of services from the
host operating from their operating
system and so the core idea is going
back to back to looking at a
contemporary idea from library west from
Dawson anglers work of well you can
actually take the operating system
personality and run it right inside the
process with the application because you
don't care about what the security
context is okay and so this code that
used to be OS code doesn't have to be
protected from the application anymore
because that container the pico process
is the ice
in container okay and so we created a
subset of Windows a library OS and in
examples i'm showing it's about 100
megabytes on disk but the beautiful
thing of it is it's only about 16
megabytes of working set which is huge
by old-time standards but really really
small but by modern day standards okay
and what makes this all possible is this
a bi the a binary interface between the
application or between the library Wes
and the host system and the key thing is
it's a higher level set of abstractions
than hardware its threads the virtual
memory and i/o streams but still
maintaining the core qualities that you
see in a in a virtual machine monitor
which is that the interface should be
closed it should have a fixed semantics
and it should be stateless okay and as a
result so I'll demonstrate one of the
things I've been doing since my
internship is I've always believed in
actually demonstrating the system it's
the only way to really kind of get all
the ideas across oops alright so the
first little demo will run so this is
exhale running excel 2010 running inside
a drawbridge pico process with a library
with ok and you know it's really excel
and I always prove that is I can
actually create a pie chart ok so
clearly it must all work at the pie
charts work right ok ok but this exhale
because it's running inside a Pico
process we can actually encapsulate all
of the state of the application in the
library less with basically the dirty
pages inside the process ok and so I can
do a per process hibernation or process
migration now and it works really easy
because all the state is actually there
in the library west with the application
and so what we end up with is if we
write the dirty pages out to disk it's
about 30 megabytes if you add the open
files and zip it together it's about
three and a half megabyte
it's about on size of the order of an
mp3 now I can trust this with a full
hardware-based virtual machine where you
have a full copy of the operating system
for there if you want to migrate the
thing you have to migrate is on the size
of a DVD okay and so it's such huge
drastic difference and to show you how
fast we can actually resume it so let's
see okay so i can actually bring it back
up and here's my app and it really is
still running and the key thing is I
didn't say I didn't suspend and resume I
didn't save their did the document out a
desk I actually saved exhale out to disk
okay and one of the other problems with
so we drastically reduced the overheads
not only of storage but also the
execution environment from a vm as well
and so i have a laptop here it's got a
gigabyte RAM and on a tradition if i was
using a virtual pc i could start two or
three virtual machines a hyper-v with a
hypervisor based solution on this
machine okay well i'm going to just oops
wrong demo
ok so I'm going to start seven different
apps all in in their own isolated pika
process okay and if they start it up in
about two seconds two or three seconds
they're each completely isolated from
the step from every other application on
the system so i can suspend i can resume
i can migrate them to other machines etc
and then the last demo to give an idea
of hi how high density of virtual
machine we can put / physical server i'm
going to start some web servers on my
computer and each one of them is running
inside its own Pico processes own
virtual machine it's got its own private
copy of the library us let's say let me
shrink this down okay and I can start
200 of them in about 25 seconds okay I
was starting virtual machines I'd only
be able to get one and they're all
running and I can actually run full 200
of them on this machine
okay so and so what we end up with is
this very very narrow waist saatchi
alluded to the virtual machine that
allows us to separate the evolution of
the application personality the OS
personality which is basically the
windows subsystem for example that's
experienced by applications from the
core the colonel and that allows us to
do rapid evolution of them independently
so we get all the benefits if I can run
say a windows 7 library west on top of
Windows 8 machine or Windows 7 machine
okay and in fact we've done this we've
except to prove that the 8th the waste
is its narrow as we believe it is we've
actually done a number of different
library wes implementations and we've
run them across a slew of hosts ranging
from current windows to the barrel face
research operating system that was done
with between cambridge in at eth and
also some other straight so some things
that look very much like windows as a
host and some things that look very
unlike windows as a host all right so
now I want to go back to my internship
so at the end of my internship I went
home I remember going home to my wife to
my wife we were newlyweds set that year
and I said you know I'm still not sure
about Microsoft but Microsoft is the
dream jobs I always wanted but didn't
know exist and I count myself extremely
fortunate to be able to work at
Microsoft Research I'm still it was a
chain of lucky circumstances that
brought me into being Rick's intern for
that summer and it has been one of the
greatest gifts that I've had in life
thank you Rick
Thank You Galen so next we're going to
have Andrew Herbert and looks like
you're not projecting nope okay so
Andrew retired from Microsoft actually
last year believe the last job you had
was chairman of microsoft research for
Europe the Middle East and Africa he
joined MSR in 2001 and became a managing
director of MSR cambridge in 2003 and ER
are we in business now yes we are
excellent so one of the reasons the
retiring was not to be dragged across
the redmond every March for two weeks
and while retiring it's now minimized
the two days so it must be some other
transition I can make that means I won't
have to do this although I do have to
kind of renew my American floatplane
license every two years so I got to be
careful now I'm close to a boundary
condition where it might not quite work
out exactly right I was struggling think
about what the jokes should be i'm
actually surprised about how few star
and Trek references there have been so
going to be a bit lame and say something
about alien technology abandoned that
one I really was not expecting it to be
open season on Jennifer chase and one of
my pleasures as a lab director is every
now then if you're lucky Rick's selects
you for one of Microsoft's executive
training programs and on one of those
both jennifer and I attended and we got
put in the same group and it was the
time when executive training was a kind
of group therapy thing and if you can
guess the imagine me isn't it slightly
up uptight stiff upper lip Britt at one
end of the table with Jennifer who is
not your British ins different stiff
upper lips and so forth the other we had
a fascinating time I now understand what
full-scale deflection means that's what
Jennifer does that was that was grateful
and actually we became very good friends
through that process so that was great
fun and I have one other complaint and
the pub's been open now for six hours is
not a beer available in the place so
rich we were going to put a picture up
can you still do that while I prattle on
thank you so I've picked the topic Rick
Rashid aeroplane pilot I'm trying to
think about some things I could say
about Rick a bit different to to other
people one of the pleasures of being an
overseas lab director is you basically
get Rick for a week every year and you
have to kind of do something useful with
him and it's probably good for your
career if he goes back home feeling out
he has done something useful and so what
we were doing Cambridge very often is
invite Rick to come to our time
and then do some things academic
partners he could spend some time in the
laboratory and meet people and so forth
and that went really rather well and so
one of the things I used to try and do
when i run the the cambridge lab is
arranged for our tab dinner to end up at
some interesting venue so that we could
kind of get away from the lab and seeds
of interesting things and I organized
two trips and which I know Rick enjoyed
in 2008 we went to beckley Park the
place where the the British broke the
German war time codes and we showed
everyone who attended including Rick a
replica of a machine called Colossus
which was arguably one of the first
computing devices and that broke the the
German Tunney code the there's a range
link TV program about that which
hopefully will make it onto the American
network Sam where they tried to explain
the relevance of Colossus and everyone
Kyle knows the igneous story and that's
where cheering to his work and built an
electromechanical machine called the
bomb Colossus actually was dealing with
German and telegraph traffic teleprinter
traffic and this TV show gave a nice
analogy as it was if we cracked Hitler's
blackberry because it was the
communication between him and his his
major command centers so that was kind
of a great trip the next year I thought
how do we followed literally I took us
to playschool duxford near Cambridge
which is a big aviation museum and
factors a place I take home Rick and his
family previously Rick Terry and the two
boys came across two to Cambridge i can
now explain to Ana down on the back of
that visit why you can't get Terry to
come to other places particularly
bangalore to get to Bangalore from this
part of the world you have to stop at
Heathrow the Rashid family had a very
bad leaving heathrow experience now I
can't recall the precise details but I
think basically they were locked on the
airplane on the tarmac for some enormous
number of hours nine hours doing that
with with with two small kids and I
think you know no food and hot and
whatever I think Terry said she's never
going through Heathrow ever again in
August
and it was the hottest August August
ever or whatever so basically anodyne
you have to find an airline that goes to
Bangalore from this part of the world
not via Heathrow then you might manage
it and certainly I could never get Rick
to print Ariana on a UK trip again it's
completely off-limits so we vited Rick
to come to the duxford and i'm rick has
always kind of been interested in
various kind of technology and
aeroplanes things I thought he would
enjoy that and that was the year I just
bought myself on the other strengths the
nice bonuses that Rick kept giving me
that airplane it's called a chipmunk it
was the British Air Force training error
plane immediately after the Second World
War that aeroplane is a year older than
me since it has annual maintenance it's
actually in somewhat better condition it
knows more about flying than I do and we
have quite a good relationship on the
back of that so I arranged for one of
the displayed pilots at Duxford this guy
here Clyde Denny to take Rick up for a
flight Clive gave an elderly erratic
display for the audience I pointed to
waggle something I probably do that
there we go and then after that he took
Rick for a flight over the local area to
the place where I keep the aircraft a
few miles away I'm boarding backed in
and Rick came back with this huge grin
on his face it turns out I hadn't
realized that Rick's father have been in
the American Air Force based in the in
the UK in that part of the world and so
the area he was flying go was where his
father had been flown that office he was
now quite important to him so
unbeknownst to be those those two tab
meetings and Bletchley Park and the the
kind of restoration of all computing
devices and ducks Finn's toric flying it
was actually setting the agenda for me
because since I've retired I essentially
have two projects that are keeping me
occupied one is at Bletchley Park we're
working towards building a replica of
egg sac Maurice Wilkes his first machine
from 1949 so I'm learning a lot about
vacuum tube electronics and so forth I
mean making quite good progress of that
we essentially having to redesign the
machine because they didn't keep the
blueprints but there's enough
photographic evidence and description
and so forth that you can kind of work
backwards as the guys did who built
Colossus and we're kind of picking up
some of their expert
these though it turns out Colossus is
built by people who are from the the
phone company think about automated
switching wilkes or that had a radar
background on those are two very
different cultures and you discover
people refighting electronics wars the
1940s about which kind of circuits you
should use it's amazing how these you
know these fights we have in research
about one thing versus another they just
go on for decades and decades the other
project is undoing a lot more these days
with with more old airplanes including
building a very large sea plane with
with Clive and his company Rick I think
also got a little bit of a bug at that
point yeah and his war I'm going to
gently undo all that huffing and puffing
about retirement Rick Draves did at the
beginning yeah very dangerous for me to
get near airplanes because it kind of
got me sucked out doing those things
rick has taken flying lessons in the
last six months or so he's been posting
progress notes on on facebook and i
think you're at the stage now where you
view in what is known as consolidation
after the first solo flight don't know
your experience like for me I still
remember that for that first solo
there's there's that moment where you
take off your in the aeroplane on your
own you take off when you go wow it's me
I'm flying it by myself and then you
think now I've got to land it and
there's that very nerve-wracking cruel
round the pattern when you get it back
on the ground Jesus thank God for that
then you just kind of you really hooked
at that point after first solo you then
spent a lot of time learning how to
navigate cross-country and I guess the
the next few trips are out flying to
distant airfield some places you not
been to before ma'am and a Duke or
should get the pilot's license I do
think rick is learning to fly the wrong
kind of airplanes and he's doing it in
the wrong place flying rather modern
machines and made out of Tupperware with
buttons you push to make them fly my
passion is these things that have made a
video wood bits of bent metal than
canvas and you can kind of get ropes and
things moving around inside them stick
and rudder flying is where it's it's
really at on the other hand you don't
wanna get caught out in one of these in
bad weather conditions and so forth and
I you're flying in Prescott Montana I
think the weather there is a lot more
blue skies the neither Seattle or
Cambridge has to offer
sorry we can offer you wins in the UK
this thing is quite exciting once the
cross swing gets about 15 knots it's a
taildragger so the center of gravity is
behind you in the front once the back
wants to be around the front it's okay
that has occasionally happened to me
I've I took my wife on a trip she's not
an aviator which is a fairly willing
passenger we landed somewhere and sort
of we had an arrival rather than landing
hit the ground bit of a bump and then
the aeroplane did four revolutions and
fortunately we ended up pointing in the
right direction so I kind of quietly
said nothing and taxied off various of
my flying buddies who've seen this well
she said came out said gosh you're
remarkably calm for someone who's ground
loop she said I was a ground loop i
thought he always landed like that so my
offer to rick is when you let your
pilot's license do come across to
cambridge and Terry if you can stomach
Heathrow you're welcome to and come and
do a bit old-fashioned stick and rudder
flying in a real airplane and the kind
where you can leave the roof off so that
you get some pleasure so I wanted to say
a few words about the pleasure of having
Rick as your manager as a lab director
it was a great privilege to be invited
by Roger Needham to come and join the
microsoft lab in Cambridge in 2003 Rick
and Roger had tried to get me a bit
earlier on but I was kind of tied up
doing something else it's not often you
get to invitations to have such a great
job I think many words have been said
about Rick as a manager that I don't
kind of need to repeat yeah his
laid-back style is kind of hard to read
sometimes I started playing a game of
how little do I have to interact with
Rick before yo he eventually plays
chicken and calls me up and says what's
going on I think I manage one year to go
from review cycle to a new cycle with
almost zero management interaction but I
lost my nerve first and yet most of my
reviews seem to be those kind of it what
he praised it slightly subtly and it
seems to be going fine in Cambridge what
it seems
you could kind of read it one way or the
other but yeah the number score in the
pay packet seem to be going in the right
direction side kind of was happy with
that so that that was great so certainly
he's very supportive i was able to grow
the cambridge lab from 50 to about 150
people and he let me do all kinds of
crazy things like adding steve limits
computational sciences group taking in
kenwood and the the CML group on which i
think i've added to came to success in
both cases and we kind of started those
there a bit of leap I recall just a few
bits of management advice and Rick gave
me one was to make sure if there's bad
news he heard it from me first and then
he helped me deal with it I tested that
when we ran the port of windows on the
Zen source operating system I'm sure
Rick remember that fire drill that was
quite entertaining dealing with the
windows group getting a little bit upset
about that I think we eventually calmed
them down he mails are another occasion
when he was visiting one of my Italian
properties it was when I was kind of
knowing I was thinking about moving on
so I asked Andrew Blake and four bits
here an external research to take Rick
on the ground European tour that year
one of our Italian academic
collaborators chose that moment send a
letter of protest about something he's a
bit upset about and that I thought I had
under control that didn't the Italian
member of the party was sending me this
incessant stream of emails and texts
predicting a nuclear holocaust all kind
of terrible things happening oh my god
what Rick can do about this Rick was a
master at completely calming it down he
took it on the chin he's unsure of you
we didn't intend these things to happen
let's do these following things and by
the next one the whole thing was nicely
built with and he was extremely charming
charming in it but i think i did get an
email that said yeah you might want to
look into this and do something about it
in his usual style certainly if things
weren't working Rick got the message
through but never by kind of beating off
a big negative but you could just kind
of detect something needed to be done so
I would really like to acknowledge the
vision of leadership that rick has given
them aside as an organization and I
certainly enjoyed working fri microsoft
research really does have a huge
reputation around the world as they are
leading computer science laboratory
alright thank you for the
trust he putting me in running the
Cambridge lab and support he gave me so
happy landings Rick and you have an open
invitation both you and Terry to kind of
play with some old airplanes thank you
very much all right thank you Andrew so
Andrew represented one of real interests
and now we have Greg bear to represent
another Greg is a well-known science
fiction author living in the Seattle
area I've got many of his books on my
bookshelf at home and I got this one
with the PSO i hope it's accurate but
greg has received five nebula awards and
to hugo awards and there should be a
little switch yeah going on yeah okay so
I'm actually doing sort of science
fiction and a little bit of tech here
boy this is a good thing there's a
slider here oh I'll beam up by doing it
it's been a real privilege and a lot of
fun over the years hanging out with Rick
and Terry and all people at microsoft
research that we've been introduced to
so in celebration I offer up this piece
based in part on some research I did
combining Darwin's radio research with
City at the end of time and I'm sure
that both Rick and Terry remember some
of these peregrinations so imagine a
library filled with every possible book
each book is a 410 pages long each page
contains 40 lines each lines each line
80 characters chosen from a total
alphabet of 25 letters the library
consists of all possible permutations of
those letters in each volume that is
volumes may differ by just one letter
two letters by a single word or by whole
passages or pages most volumes will
different completely from their fellows
how long would it take to a build all
those shelves be fill all those shelves
with books see dust all those books half
seriously writers and philosophers have
been thinking about such a library for
centuries perhaps the most famous
example of the configuration described
above is found on the library of Babel a
speculative essay by horribly boring
how big with this hypothetical universal
library be on wikipedia we are told that
bore Hayes's library would consist of a
staggering number of volumes 25 to the 1
million three hundred and twelve
thousand or one point nine five six
times ten to the exponent 1 million
eight hundred thirty-four thousand
ninety seven now 1 trillion is 10 to the
12th such enormous numbers may limit our
acceptance of the very idea it seems
ridiculous to imagine so many texts or
in more cybernetic a moment later so
many strings yet we are fascinated by
infinities and there's a great deal of
mathematics that deftly describes ranks
and even operates with infinities though
of course any infinite number goes on
forever why then should we be daunted by
very very very large numbers in fact
science and mathematics are filled with
ideas which involve extraordinarily
large numbers in the 18th century got
fit lightnin speculated that if we could
only know the exact position of every
particle in the universe we could
predict the next state the universe is
immediate future this idea codified the
deep assumption beneath all notions of a
rational clockwork universe or of course
knowing these particle positions
requires not just observing and
measuring but storing that knowledge and
then running calculations to determine
the next position of each particle and
then calculating how they will all
interact a pretty idea that soon gets
completely out of hand so challenged we
might then blush and claim blithely
enough that in the future a calculating
engine of sufficient capacity and speed
might be able to do just that which
takes us out of the realm of philosophy
and into science fiction there are other
kinds of universal libraries one can
imagine a picture library of all
possible variations of a 1000 x 1000
pixel image each pixel having a range of
say twenty five colors strangely this
picture library would have as a subset
the universal library of texts described
above since it would contain reasonably
high resolution images of every single
page in every single book but not the
combinations of those pages you would
find bound up as individual volumes
volumes in the library of Babel and
conversely the universal library of text
will contain word and coordinate
description
of every single 1000 x 1000 x 25 color
image embedded in many different
languages and codes one quickly realizes
that though these libraries are vast no
single volume or picture or collection
can be easily dismissed as nonsensical
or empty of interest seemingly random
arrangements of letters or pixels might
contain hidden meanings for example the
coordinates of an image or hidden
references to other resources when the
library such as the perfect card catalog
and buried within readable text might be
additional nested codes and clues which
could even give even Martin Gardner's
celebrated dr. matrix a very long
lifetime of curious pleasures however
there are quite real strings which the
universal library will not contain among
these is a complete readout of Pi some
have called this kind of number
pseudo-random because it could be
generated by algorithms smaller than
itself when Carl Sagan and his novel
contact suppose the PI might contain a
hidden message many mathematicians
solemnly cut tutted a random number
cannot contain a linguistic message they
claimed since pi is infinitely long an
interesting question arises how many
universal libraries coded as numbers
will any sufficiently lengthy string
segment of Pi contain or does the
primary algorithmic nature of Pi
preclude any minnick meaningful messages
included therein is pi its own and soul
message our universal library will of
course contain equations and
descriptions sufficient to reconstruct
pi and perhaps even proof of its
randomness but be careful most of those
proofs will be false thinking about pi
leads us to one possible way to begin
exploring in universal library pi
refuses to be zipped or compressed noisy
pictures on a digital camera take up
more memory than less noisy emit just
because they resist compression truly
random strings all have this property
they cannot be digitally squeezed into
the smaller versions and reassemble with
complete fidelity as happens when we
compress say this speech into a zip file
on a hard drive it seems logical then to
assume that all the useless or
meaningless volumes within a universal
library will likewise resist compression
whole spaces of our library processed by
finding these regions which are
compressible in which we can we can
process whole spaces of our library by
finding those regions
which are compressible and which
therefore contain meaningful or
interesting strings of symbols that is
symbols with a linguistic or at least
non-random base of course there's just
one way to process that's just one way
to process a universal library another
logical deduction is that half of the
volumes or strings in this greater mass
will be palindromic that is they will
mere reversals of other strings there
are also be other more subtle symmetries
which our ambitious librarians could
take advantage of to reduce their
searches we could for example in code
our library as a cubic construct of
symbols each coded and eight bits of
data arranged 100 or say 1002 aside
there would then be rotational
symmetries which could be anticipated
and eliminated randomness is a concept
has become a foundation for many
theories most famous perhaps is the
notion that evolution can be accounted
for only by accumulated point-by-point
random mutations in a gene through say
heat chemistry or radiation such
mutations are described in one text book
on evolution as undirected John Maynard
Keynes refers to this sort of randomness
as objective chance that is random and
unpredictable to any observer real or
imagined anywhere for ever and ever no
observer will ever discover the trick or
algorithm or alternate theory that could
predict when where or how such a
mutation will arise subject to chance on
the other hand supposes only that the
relevant observers on the scene don't
know of any trick to explain such events
a pure version of variation and
organisms caused solely by undirected
mutations leads us to the inevitable
conclusion that life itself constitutes
a kind of process and distilled
universal library whose meaningful
strips strings are located through a we
know annoying process that is by
survival within a selecting environment
so how do i directed mutations in a
string of say 100 codons get processed
to form a single competent gene between
two and three hundred genes may be
necessary for a minimal cellular
organism this collection of genes will
rely on other things which aren't
inherited but that's another issue the
random recombinations of just 100 codons
would create sufficient numbers of
molecules to fill a volume terrifically
larger than our cosmos and the time
taken to generate them would likely
outlast any number of
universes and yet many organisms utilize
thousands upon thousands of genes of
even greater length evolution is a
purely random process seems then to
write atop an immense library of Babel
the time frame for the evolution of even
the simplest of tiniest living organism
even these additional factors becomes
incalculably enormous what can give
supporters a randomness uncomfort
however is mutation and viruses up to
ninety five percent of HIV viruses are
defective most viruses fail but when
they win they can win big such a high
rate of mutation allows a scary venture
into the unexpected creativity of
randomness but in larger more complex
organisms with far fewer reproductive
opportunities there are a great many
corrective mechanisms approximately one
in three human pregnancies apparently
begin with twin embryos but the mother's
reproductive systems in these cases
mostly selects out the fitter of the two
embryos and the other is resorbed into
the wall of the womb such corrective
procedures are common in nature even
after birth mutations that are not
already fit to one degree or another are
seldom allowed to re-enter the gene pool
these volumes are never returned to the
shelves so to speak genes are corrected
and repaired on a regular basis often
turning defective or even so-called
nonsense genes into competent players as
well proteins assembled from errant
genes are tested and if found wanting
they are disassembled into reusable
amino acids deleterious mutations are
thus usually weeded out before they ever
have an effect on the organism the
genome it seems contains its own highly
sophisticated and thoroughly cautious
editing functions random mutations are
not always tried in the court of nature
that by itself cause it into question
calls into question the theory of
undirected variation still the
undirected mutation of genes genes
regarded as heritable traits has for
over a century to considered so
logically compelling so irrefutable the
researchers who sought other
explanations were severely criticized by
their peers they're meant to their
mentors and by most senior scientists
yet as we explore the apt metaphor of
the library of Babel the idea behind
such subjectively random mutation seems
both philosophically and
mathematically suspect meanwhile the
expanding study of epigenetic variation
adds to the amazing process of how
living organisms adapt to changing
environments if we regard the genome as
a piano keyboard epigenetic variation is
like a composer deciding which keys will
be played and what melodies will result
it's becoming more and more clear that
genuinely random mutation and jeans
contributes a much smaller percentage of
observable variations in wild-type
populations of complex organisms
nevertheless it is still the
academically dominant metaphor the
paradigm once remarkably fit and vital
random variation now needs to be edited
judged and re shelved in the ever
freshening library of observed reality
so that's the kind of stuff we talked
about over dinner and in conferences and
it's been a wonderful time doing that
and I want to thank Rick and
congratulations on your birthday more to
come all right thank you Greg next we
have Dan
fit onto this one down is it on the
pudding PC yeah great so I'll dance
bringing that up I'll introduce him so
Dan Ling retired from Microsoft five
years ago as vice president of Microsoft
Research Redmond although I still run
into damn pretty frequently in our
hallway so he's not completely gone dan
joined MSR in 1992 is one of the
founding members of the new lab he
became director of MSR redmond in 1995
so a good afternoon and first of all I
just wanted to say that I'm really
honored to be able to participate in
this event celebrating Rick's 60th
birthday congratulations Rick all day
today we've been hearing about Rick's
very distinguished career first at CMU
and then later on here at microsoft
research but since I've known Rick for I
think probably longer than anybody else
here in this room I thought we'd go back
a few more years and just for fun tell
you about our times together at Stanford
so I met Rick first what we were both
freshmen very early that our freshman
year we were assigned to the same dorm
at Stanford and it turns out that what
drew us together was that we had
something in common and that was that
both of us spoke Italian not that that
you might have guessed Rick was just
finishing up a year living in Italy with
an Italian family and spending the time
studying at Italian high school and I
was an international student and I
actually was born in Rome and grew up
there and went to school there but I had
always gone to an international high
school in schools and Rick had actually
gone to a Italian school so I think at
the time his Italian was probably better
than mine during the course of that year
we grew to be very good friends
we were both kind of geeks well we both
like science fiction and the year was
nineteen seventy which was a very
eventful year on campus there was
probably not been such an eventful year
until maybe last year with the Occupy
movement so you have to remember that
1970 was just after the Kent State
killings the Vietnam War was in full
swing and Nixon was president and campus
was filled with protesters and in the
evenings when we had to cross campus to
go to the computer center or to the lab
we had to duck the protesters the police
dressed in full tactical riot gear and
helicopters with searchlights sort of
scanning for protesters running around
so it was very exciting time on campus
and we became very good friends at the
end of freshman year Rick another friend
of ours Jeff and I decided to enter the
Stanford housing lottery together now at
the time in order to get campus housing
you had to enter a lottery and you
picked a number between one and ten
thousand and smaller meant a better
number and if you've got a good number
you would get housing if you got a bad
number you didn't get good housing and
Rick wound up picking for the three of
us and picked 9560 for
so as a result we didn't get housing
immediately but we somehow managed to
finally get campus housing and over the
course of the next year or so there were
six of us that wound up in three
separate apartments now we were
undergraduates and these apartments were
originally built for graduate students
but somehow we got assigned to them and
it turned out that we formed the little
dinner club together and the idea would
be that each apartment would cook dinner
for a week and then it would move to the
next apartment so in one apartment there
was me and my roommate Jeff was now a
Dean at UC Davis and another apartment
was Rick and his roommate Elwood who
went to Stanford Law became a lawyer
loved the law but hated being a lawyer
and is now Unitarian minister and the
third apartment had two women and who
became Rick's first wife and Beth was
now a very distinguished physician in
the Seattle area so every evening we
would cook dinner and have dinner
together and every evening we would
watch one of the reruns of Star Trek and
so I think that you know that that was
probably at least cemented Rick's some
encyclopedic knowledge of the first
started Star Trek series freshman you
was also very interesting oh I have a
couple of pictures so here we are at
dinner here's me here's Rick here's
another picture with Rick and is
roommate Elwood and an and so and every
evening at dinner I said we would have
watched Star Trek freshman year was also
the year that I took my first computer
science class this was a CS 106 taught
by Zohar bana an algal w now you have to
remember again this was a long time ago
so programming meant you punched
cards ran it on a 360 67 and watch what
happened on the line printer and so this
was a really long you know a long time
ago but I really enjoyed the programming
course and I would come back and say how
exciting this was and the quarter after
that Rick took his first programming
course so I think it's subway I got Rick
into computer science while we were in
these three apartments having dinner
together we also had a lot of fun we
would have a lot of parties and things
and here are some pictures of some
parties is a bunch of costume parties we
seem to have had a little Christmas
party and Rick in white plaza next to
the fountain for those of you who are
been on Stanford campus will recognize
that another little costume party so we
did a lot of fun things together but I
will always remember a particular party
that Rick and my friends had staged for
being and this party was based on
Mission Impossible now this wasn't Tom
Cruise Mission Impossible this was a
long time ago so it was Peter Graves a
mission impossible the one that started
out with this record admission and then
the recording would blow up and then he
got that Bell CA and various things
would happen so they decided to stage
this party for me the same way there was
a recording at dossier then I got sent
on this wild goose chase all around
campus going to various dorms going to
various libraries I think Rick did some
programming which meant I had to go to
different computer centers and load
paper tape programs at certain octal
addresses to get some codes all of which
wound up being a party a birthday party
for me back at the dorm so that that's a
memory that I'll never forget another
party that my friends gave me was for my
21st birthday and they decided
have a dinner party and they invited my
parents so there's Rick and ann and my
parents at the dinner party and after
dinner instead of taking me to a bar
they decided to take me to a Farrell's
ice cream parlor where in order for me
to earn my birthday sunday i had to get
up on the table have everybody sing to
me happy birthday and you know that was
fine and this they did to all the other
birthday celebrants at the restaurant
unfortunately most of the other people
were 10 and not 21 so that really brings
us to the our senior year and graduation
and Rick did indeed get a degree in
English but he actually will majored in
mathematics but he had an honours degree
in humanities as well and for graduation
we had a really nice graduation party a
group of us with our parents and we had
it at a seafood restaurant at
Fisherman's Wharf and I was able to find
some very good pictures there's Rick
again there's me my mother this is
Jeff's parents back here these are this
is a picture of Rick's parents at the
party there's me and my roommate Jeff
and I think this is Ann's mother and
that's it so then Rick graduated went
off to Rochester and then the rest of
his career you've heard earlier today so
I just wanted to thank you again and to
thank Rick especially for being such a
good friend and a boss and colleague and
a mentor for 42 years thanks so much
thanks Dan his pictures are amazing so
finally last but not least we have Terry
so Terry and Rick actually celebrated
their 14th wedding anniversary two days
ago if i'm not mistaken I'm trusting
facebook on this one Terry studied
computer science at Carnegie Mellon and
the University of Washington before she
started at Microsoft in 1997 yes where's
your VGA output so I have to preserve
the fiction so that I don't get conned
into fixing things for my children that
I really don't have any idea how to do
anything with computers this works well
because this means that when Rick comes
home he has to do all of the the
computer solving which he's very good at
my children now believe that there is
nothing that he can't fix you need to
wake your lips up up oh yeah it's a lazy
laptop woman really it can come out of
sleep very quickly I promise only we're
running much alright you go whatever
alright so the my contribution to the
fish stroke volume was the 7 Habits of
Highly Effective Rick ration I'm not
going to focus on a lot of technology
things for those of you that don't know
me well I did work in technology I was a
technical assistant at Microsoft and my
last position was working under Eric
redder and Bill Gates office but I think
some of the most valuable lessons that I
learned from Rick have to do with how to
handle people how to handle projects how
to handle basically management skills I
haven't necessarily used them in the way
he has but they're good life skills and
I'm not going to cover everything that
was in the paper
because they do a better job of it there
than I would do in person but loosely
these are seven habits I'll give credit
to Astra for the title but you can see
I've got several things on one line for
some of these things people were trying
to say that going at the end other
people have already stolen your Thunder
but if you read the paper that I've got
the very beginning of the paper talks
about how some things are worth
repeating and in fact in aviation they
repeat all the time that the first rule
of aviation is fly the airplane okay
this seems a little obvious it's not
clear why you need to teach this but
they do teach it because the fact that
matter is it's very easy to get
distracted okay and some of the fatal
accidents that have occurred in aviation
or because the pilot became distracted
and they forgot that first rule so some
of the things that I talked about in the
paper in hindsight or when you talk
about them in writing they seem really
obvious but in practice they're not done
as often as as maybe we should do
especially when we're distracted by
things so the first thing that I learned
from from Rick was give credit don't
take credit this slide I'm going to use
to give credit now you guys all know
Rick as being this fantastic technical
person which he is since Rick and I have
been together he's also taken on a
number of more athletic pursuits and the
first couple of those pictures are his
first backpacking hike in the Cascades
now being the problem solver that he is
Rick after this this hiking adventure
which he was very dubious about decided
that the Cascades were fine place to go
but they really needed to fundamental
engineering things which was escalators
and bug zappers he thought if we had
those things that hiking would be a
wonderful experience I also do running
and dog events Rick I don't know how
many of you know this has done a 50 mile
ride on horseback the last couple of
pictures are from the bottom two are
from his first 50 mile ride and then I
have to give him credit that top right
picture
is taken on Father's Day so I'm the one
that does horseback riding but he still
went out with us on Father's Day the
application of this kind of give credit
don't take credit thing in management
really comes down to everybody wants to
be recognized for their work that's
normal we put in a lot of hard work on
something and people we want people to
know that but the problem is is when
people are working really hard to take
credit for things sometimes other
members you know in their group or in
the organization feel like that credits
being taken from them and something I
learned from rick is it's much more
effective to give credit recognize the
people around you for what they've done
recognize people in other groups I've
seen Rick do this in in meetings all the
time in the company he won't just
recognize groups in his organization
he'll recognize groups in other
organizations that have contributed to
that work and he builds great
relationships by doing that okay this is
where repetition works great I don't
know how many people I've heard today
talk about how optimistic and positive
and fun and humorous rick is it's a
fundamental quality of his might wonder
why these pictures are here I had and I
talked about this a little bit I had a
situation this right after we moved to
Arizona where my top horse that I was
hoping to get on to the US endurance
team became injured and I was pretty
upset by this but I've had the benefit
of having known Rick for two decades
have been married to him for 14 years
and over that time he has taught me to
when something bad happens this is how
he handles setbacks he looks for the
next opportunity he doesn't stay focused
on what went wrong he simply moves on to
the next thing and so at that time we
decided to to go and work on learning to
fly because I didn't have our stride at
time and I also went back and focused on
my running little more and managed at
Portland to run my fastest marathon in
10 years and those were both fun things
to do but the flying was particularly
special because it gave us both a
complete
new hobby to work on together and you
know previously I would have been all
depressed and upset about the horse
being hurt and I would have been really
focused on that we didn't I mean we I
remember looking at the vets am fine
give her the time off you know and he
looked at me he goes nobody does that
everybody asked me about what aggressive
therapy can I do on my horse to get get
it ready to go again even though that'll
tell you the best thing is rest I said
no this month I'll do something else
well that worked out really well because
just recently and some of you guys know
this from Rick talking about this that
same horse after having her rest came
back and she won what was it for us was
a test event a 65-mile ride she got best
condition we beat the nearest competitor
by 38 minutes she set the fastest time
on that course in 10 years and she and i
will be going to texas at the end of the
month to try for the USD and if it
doesn't happen i'll look for the next
opportunity i'm skipping over some of
the things because obviously i will not
have enough time to touch on everything
in the in the paper these are fun
there's actually two of the the things
in my list from the paper could be
covered with these pictures these are
pictures of our our sons visiting CMU in
2009 we had a great trip there and the
boys got to go around and look at the
research projects just like Rick and I
were doing at various times they were
separated from us the the one where the
top two pictures were there working with
some of the robotics stuff they were
with somebody else at that time and the
thing I wanted to bring up about CMU
here is one of the things that I I
learned both at CMU and from rick is the
idea of the reasonable person principle
and again people have touched on that
today it's taken environment where
instead of constraining people by a
bunch of rules and and you know trying
to carve out this little hole where they
they have to do things a certain way
where they can only have a certain
number of resources instead take the
principle that we're going to expect
people to be reasonable ok we're going
to expect people to make decisions that
are correct for the work they're doing
while also considering the
other people around them and the needs
of the organization okay and Rick does
that fully and Microsoft Research and
you've heard a lot of people talk about
the freedom that they have with Rick as
their manager and the trust and some
people talk kind of nervously about the
level of hands off that there is but I
get to see this from the other side
because of that trust and that freedom
and that not micromanaging everybody
this organization scales okay you you
take these people and this gets to
another one of my points which is mentor
and delegate you take you higher really
great people you mentor them into their
roles in whatever areas they may need
help out then you delegate you expect
them to be reasonable and then you can
let them work fairly autonomously in
order to get great research done and I
get to see at home he has a huge
organization there are problems that
come up and yet when he's with the kids
and I you know he's he's with us and
he's not worrying too much about what's
going on with the project some of this
gets two things I'm not going to talk
about right now the discipline decisions
and time management which is just to say
that he's really good that if he decides
he's going to do something he's going to
do it now he wants to convince somebody
that some particular coding ideal war
work he does he'll go bang out some code
and then like Galen said and and and
rich alluded to he will only write the
minimum amount of code necessary to
prove the point which of course means
that when rich goes and rewrites his
code in the in the kernel because he
doesn't want his code there he's just
made Rick's point which is he won he
convince somebody yes you guys really
can do this and then they'll go and do
it the right way the boys are kind of
fun can't even tell if they're playing
their games are looking up yes they're
looking up sort of something that they
have gotten from Rick and I'm glad
they're learning it at a young age
because I still struggle with this is is
this discipline to get things done at a
particular time Kyle told me the other
day when he was getting his homework
done
after school which is typical for them
he says well you know it's like dad says
I don't want to have to worry about this
later I'm just going to get it done now
and that's a very handy skill so they
don't worry okay yeah I don't quite
manage this one yet actually in this
particular shot I'm not really worrying
it's just my instructors axe asked me to
calculate some distance to a detour and
stuff like this so I'm trying to both
fly the airplane which I've been told I
should continue to do and do some
calculations this is a candid shot i saw
this i thought it would be funny to put
up for this slide um I can't tell you
how many times I heard Rick say well I'm
not worried there are times especially
as a mom when this can be a little
frustrating if he's saying it in
response to me expressing some worry of
my own but the fact of the matter is
he's right um worrying in my mind is
when you sit there and you keep thinking
over and over again about a particular
problem you have you may be considering
some different solutions for that
problem but you're not making progress
you're simply rehashing the same stuff
over and over and you're stuck in
indecision and I've seen this happen you
know at work as well um Rick doesn't do
this he doesn't worry when I was Astrid
was nice enough to help me look over the
paper in advance and one of her comments
to the along side of the paper had
nothing to do with my many grammatical
errors this particular comment when I
said you know he says I'm not worried
Astrid said yes I've heard him say this
and I know a lot of you have as well but
it's who he is he doesn't worry about
things he will consider information he
will make a decision and then he'll move
on if he delegate something to somebody
he's going to delegate it he may
mentally decide he's going to check back
with them at some point but then he
moves on to the next thing which for me
is great because if we're at home and
we're doing a vacation and he has to you
know deal with a particular item he will
deal with it he'll move on and then
we'll be you know still enjoying our
family time don't worry be happy
um again getting back to the fundamental
optimism rick has made me a happier
person for many many reasons so I've
heard so many people stand up here and
say Rick thank you for my career and
certainly he has had an impact on my my
computer science career as well but I
get to stand up here and say thank you
for my life not only has have I learned
a lot of things that I have applied
because I've been active in other
organizations as well about how to be
optimistic how to not worry how did how
to take steps and move on and be happy
and have fun with what I'm doing but
these these very qualities that make him
such a wonderful manager pay huge
dividends in life and I am still
learning from him every day how to deal
with whatever tasks I'm doing whether
that might be something you know with
the horses or it might be something with
people to keep a positive focus to not
get really pulled down by complicated
details I mean I think probably a lot of
you that manage people know even harder
than technology issues are people issues
if you're dealing with with topics that
are very sensitive and polarized where
people have been struggling with the you
know a disagreement for years and I've
had to do that actually not too long ago
in in one of the equestrian groups I was
dealing with it's really hard people get
very passionate about the things that
they believe in and that passion is
great you want that you don't want
people to be apathetic and we have a lot
of that kind of passion in research you
want people be very passionate about
what they do but then you have to tread
very carefully to try to and something
Rick does here that I think is amazing
is he will redirect people to a common
thing that they they do believe in you
know so maybe you're talking about
people at at Microsoft well most of
those people really do want the company
to do well they want the products
be great and sometimes you have to find
that common goal and then try to talk
about it from there and he's really good
at this so Rick I love you very much I
thank you for everything you have taught
me and everything you continue to teach
me and i also wanted to say thank you to
rich Draves for pulling this together I
I know those of you that have been
involved with the presentations know
just how much time rich has spent on
this and and Jamie also has spent a lot
of time and Peter for his help getting
things started and I think we should
have Rick get up here now because it's
all about him and he should come say
some things what do you think which I
guess means i should give him my
microphone so i I really appreciate this
opportunity for rebuttal I mean a number
of kind things have been said today I
really appreciate that but the the truth
is that if I have a talent you know I
think it's been in having a knack to
associate myself with friends with
students with colleagues and employees
that are incredibly smart really good at
what they do genuinely nice people and
incredibly generous so thank you very
much this has been a wonderful day thank
alright thank you Rick and so we're
almost done I just want to cycle more
things I want to thank a few people who
were involved in helping organize this a
festschrift first I want to thank Peter
Lee because he first suggested the idea
of a festschrift when most of the rest
of us hadn't even heard of him and also
I want to thank Peter for working with
me on the organization you had some
great advice I want to thank all the
speakers all the people who you know
flew here from out of town to
participate you know when you're trying
to put an event like this you never know
what you're going to get and I think
you've seen everyone came through
amazingly so actually I want to give out
all the speakers one more round of
applause I want to thank some of the
people who really helped with the nuts
and bolts of putting this on you know we
had the idea of doing videos for Nathan
and avi very late really only about a
week ago and and then when we got to
actually got the footage there was this
task of editing and Henry honig and
Daniel Boettcher from the MSR Media
Group jumped in and spent actually
incredible actually how many hours it
takes to just edit like a 20 minute
video you have no idea if you haven't
tried to do it yourself so Henry and
Daniel did an amazing job on the videos
you saw the results let's thank them
and then we had some great
administrative support and I think you
saw that fewer on the mailing lists so
Jamie Jamie riff Lee Jennifer Carlson
Melissa Kelly Pamela ash we just hired
recently to get involved in editing the
book but you'll be dealing a lot more
with Pamela going forward on the book
but she also pitched in and started help
put on our event here if we get working
on the agendas so let's thank all of
those people so with that I think we're
done here tonight some of us are going
to be going on to a dinner and there'll
be Vance for you outside so thank you
