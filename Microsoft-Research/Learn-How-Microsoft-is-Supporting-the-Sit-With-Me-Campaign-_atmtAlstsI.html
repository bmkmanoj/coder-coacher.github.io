Microsoft Research and Development our
efforts in growing women in computing
we're pleased to join the NC would sit
with me campaign because it's really
important that we have more women
solving the world's greatest problems
through technology so come join us as we
sit and we embrace more women in the
field
you
hi I'm Craig Monday on the chief
research and strategy officer at
Microsoft I wanted to share a few of my
thoughts with you about why it's so
important for us to focus on getting
more women to be able to participate in
the field of computer science today we
have everything in our society
completely dependent on information
technology and communications and this
trend will only increase over time
there's really no field of engineering
science or even the social sciences in
the future it will make real progress
without computers and yet today we
certainly don't find that half of the
population I either women are really
involved in computing to the degree that
we need so be foolish for us to not do
more and more to promote their
involvement in this very very critical
field for that reason I think I want to
encourage all the people at Microsoft
particularly our R&amp;amp;D people to become
very aggressive in promoting this sit
with me campaign and we really need to
work hard to find a way to induce more
and more women starting at the earliest
stages first to become involved with
science and engineering and math become
skilled in that and then hopefully find
that as they progress through their
studies and career that they'll find a
way to take a role in the deep technical
components of computer science my name
is Rick ratchet I'm the chief research
officer at Microsoft and I think it's
really important that we get more women
involved in the field of computer
science because we really need to have
that diversity of viewpoints the
diversity of talent to really make the
field move forward you really make the
future happen Jennifer Shays managing
director of Microsoft Research New
England I think it's incredibly
important to get more women
into computer science it's a really
creative field it's a collaborative
field and it's a field that needs a lot
more women and minority the only way for
us to really make computer science into
all it can be is to get more creative
intelligent passionate people into the
field and that of course includes more
with
you
each year microsoft research helps
hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
