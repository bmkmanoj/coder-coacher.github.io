Latin America the main problems of the
chena forest are the habitat loss the
fragmentation and degradation of native
forests sadly we have many endangered
animals into late life and this is a
software that we have been creating for
the last two years to understand where
this wild species are and trying to
share that information with the
scientific community park rangers and
people at large live on this feeds into
this new paradigm of science you know
what's called in science where you have
huge amounts of data software tools like
live on is provide good help to this
scientist to deal with this deluge of
data coming from different sources
satellite sensors and other devices one
of the things that we are doing is
trying to solve the conflicts between
people on my life one of the main issues
that we are working is how to transfer
research into annuity their ideas what
we do is track animals in the wild
trying to understand where they live how
they live and what are the main threats
to them you can learn about how to take
care of the climate of the nature of the
animals in many cases when people goes
to the wild they can encounter an
endangered animal by chance then you can
use your windows phone take a picture of
them and then locate that information
and upload that information in life on
this the computer science students are
doing the programming of the mobile
smart phones doing the
of the databases and the human
interfaces students from the
environmental science would be doing the
collection of data and processing the
data the possibility of using surface as
a way to collect the data from camera
traps or to upload data from the field
into main computers it's a unique
opportunity so far they have recorded
820 species from the different
categories that live on these records
such as mammals amphibians reptiles
birds knowing the species we can start
to walk in the strategies and
conservation strategies to bring back
those population to safe revolution
surface allows us to visualize the data
in real time in the in the wild and then
take decisions for conservation or for
our research live and this provides a
platform to acquire this information to
record this information to visualize
this information life on this puts
together a lot of Microsoft technologies
to create this platform and allows
people to share upload and visualize
data from wildlife for example windows
mobile technologies sequel server Bing
Maps is the way that we use and locate
animals and visualize the animals dotnet
for programming through this live on
this project and through the technology
involved we can learn much more about
how to implement technology in favor of
a biodiversity in favor of a teaching
education
well the collaboration with jaime and
microsoft research has been very
interesting because we shared the
passion to develop new things i am very
inspired by this project because we are
tackling a very challenging
environmental problem which is the rapid
decline of important elements of our
natural heritage I think like one is
step forward involving citizen science
into wildlife conservation and allowing
people to share and enjoy wildlife the
final aim of life and this is to connect
people with wildlife our hope with life
and this is that we can use that tool to
preserve the the wildlife to the future
generations each animal species is a
very important piece of the puzzle as
each citizen scientist and a researcher
are crucial to the success of preserving
in the joint species for the next
generation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
