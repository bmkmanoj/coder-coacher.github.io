hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
this is um this is the second weirdest
morning of my of my work with anonymous
was this this is if you've never seen it
before the Polish Parliament now if you
started off with 4chan and hacker
culture and so on and so forth and
somewhere along the lines your
professional journey you're staring at
this so what I'm going to be talking
about is how is kind of anonymous in
context how it interacts with the outer
world how it interacts with the media
and how it interacts with other
organizations and and so like I say this
is the second weirdest moment of this
but to give you a little bit of my
background in this i am from the
beautiful city of Los Angeles originally
I think if this is like a picture of my
childhood in summary and and one things
about Los Angeles is every 10 to 20
years we like to have a few riots and
shoot brown people and that sort of
thing it's kind of a tradition where I'm
from and and that's a pretty normal
thing in Los Angeles it's kind of
hideous but last time that happened
we're going to have to see now we're
getting engine I'm just going to search
on Google and browser
everything works different from my
computer
now I went through the LA riots and
there's a formative moment my teenage
years and and I got to see how other
people were going through very very
similar things I say these things just
happen in Los Angeles periodically
because we just don't deal with unreal
and I work i did tune in to the anaheim
riots with the interest of seeing you
know the latest disaster in my hometown
and and i was forwarded this video the
police started shooting rubber bullets
and this day ended up hitting you can
you can you tell me like your side of
the story lake what was going on during
that time that's the weirdest moment so
so somehow it had gotten all the way
from 4chan to the Polish Parliament to
the led to the now I have to remember
what the PowerPoint icon looks like yes
okay no you know I now we've made this
full trip all the way back to to the to
the completely understood and known and
like incredibly non-technical race and
class Wars of my hometown and this face
of descent has now transited the whole
circle there and then come back and what
this is from this image is actually from
the anti active protests across Europe
and the active story is an interesting
one in that there were a bunch of us who
are I kind of shade over into activism
more on the copy copy right side from
journalism's I right about that a lot
and I had been writing about acta and
how completely horrible it was for years
as had many people in the NGO space and
so on and so forth and we were making
exactly the normal sort of no progress
one makes and this was but something had
changed earlier this year and that
bencao popipo when the internet rose up
and destroyed a bad law and now it was
happening in Europe and from 0 to 60
from from nothing from you know a few
gen NGOs desperately trying to get
something out it started in Poland it
went from there and it covered probably
upwards around 300,000 people over 200
cities in Europe and acta went down and
the people who did that the people who
did that were taking up some of the
iconography and the values and the
images and so on and so forth of
anonymous and so the question that one
has to ask when you ask about anonymous
in context is were they anons it's not
an easy question to answer does do the
people who take up the iconography for a
day are they then anons are they anons
for the day are they false flag so and
so forth when people talk about false
flag operations that implies somewhere
that there is a true flag and and
honestly I don't know exactly the answer
to that now anonymous is of a species of
entities that is coming coming kind of
the network collectives the the feral
that were collected as I've talked about
and this is actually some graffiti from
Egypt from the time of the revolution
and of course it's a huge army of ponds
and an October King and and it's a it's
a wonderful summary of the way anonymous
functions but it's also summary of how
these species that it interacts with
species of networked organisms that
interacts with also function and
sometimes this works better than other
times so also heavily involved with the
Arab Spring anonymous not necessarily
effectively but it was incredibly
catalyzing for anonymous and they tried
to keep tried to keep comms alive and
they tried to get information in and out
of countries that were in revolution and
when Mubarak shot I was in channel when
an object when Mubarak shut off the
internet and the existential cry that
echoed across the internet that day when
the anons realized you could just shut
off has has changed their character of
course they were incredibly involved
with with occupy they they were the tech
support for occupy their one of the main
reasons occupy was able to spread around
its different cities this was my moment
of realization that there was this that
there was no true hardline distinction
between occupy an anonymous was the top
1% why you pay no taxes sign which is
which is like about three levels of
wonderful meme deep and right next to
code pink to like just right there now
anonymous doesn't have leaders but it
has heroes as my fact I don't think it
functions very well without heroes and
this is again one of the places where it
interfaces with outside culture so this
Mohamed Bouazizi and and he became a
rallying cry not just for the Arab
Spring but also for and on anonymous of
course right now this is a bit awkward
for me they have a new hero and in many
ways Aaron who if you don't know was
tremendously close to me is is a fairly
perfect anonymous hero with his pirate
Hatton as eff shirt and and he was also
persecuted by law enforcement he was
setting up for Internet freedom like you
couldn't design a better st. for
anonymous and in fact they went ahead
and and attacked MIT and put up a
message there in support of him and
started something called off angel to to
run ops in support of aaron and his
goals now one of the things in a nun
told me when I was talking to them about
this particular thing was that on one
hand many people are very emotional
anonymous about what happened to Aaron
and on the other hand this was the time
they could going back to you never get
that you never get away from the walls
this is the one time they could hack MIT
without repercussions so that transits
really well into the fact that this is
an incredibly weird postmodern landscape
smoked so when you're trying to kind of
talk about where it interacts sex with
media and with a greater narrative this
gets really weird like post-modernism is
like the start you know you need your
deleuze and guitari to get through the
kindergarten or understanding this
um and and for me you know it's just one
more moment of I've been covering these
guys for a while and suddenly they're
having you know up my best friend and
and it's just one more moment of
strangeness anonymous yeah you know I
drop in and talk to them about it but
because this is how weird the world is
now I'm just reporting in from how
where'd the rest of your lives are going
to be before too long but what I
discovered in trying to cover these guys
these fearsome internet creatures is
that is that you have to come you have
to tell the story if you're going to
talk about them or understand them you
have to tell the story of how you became
came to believe the story that you're
telling and that means that you are
always part of the story you can't
escape that if you're going to
understand these strange stochastic
things you join them you don't
necessarily join the disposition of any
one thing in it but you can't not
participate so I would love to say as
josh says that I am not now nor have I
ever been anonymous but I think they
kind of press-ganged me into their media
narrative and and so I make them and
they make me and I can try to keep that
separate but I think it's more valuable
to my to to you my former audience to to
expose what's happening to me and let
you you know also get press-ganged into
the story from the
moment that you start to kind of
participate in the reading and the
comprehending and the speaking you can't
talk on the internet without in some way
being related to anonymous at this point
because they're a creature of the
internet speech so a few tips if you
ever find that you want to actually try
and write about anonymous um one of
which is that you need to have a sense
of humor and also you need to not one of
the one of the terrible terrible things
that that journalists and activists and
people inside of organizations do is
communicate that they are in some way
afraid of anonymous let's make something
clear anonymous is not actually very
scary and and they're not very tough and
and they're kind of fun a lot of the
time as long as you can kind of let
their their rhetoric bounce off you but
but showing but just kind of acting
scared of anonymous accomplishes nothing
whereas trolling them gets you respect
so when I started my coverage I went
ahead and made my own little so this is
this is a little bit older this is a
this is this is the the interior
landscape of the the the dangerous
collective and you'll notice off here i
can has cheezburger spur and and a lot
of this is still kind of describing the
same stuff that was that was on that
flow chart but i just scrawled it on a
piece of paper and I've got but I think
it's really really important to have
that area where that there's a great
cone called birth of the moral and
and that is like where we start to get
interested in onimous because most of us
in fact in the world are moral facts and
it's an interesting history I'm going to
roll on so we have to understand when
we're covering these people that they're
you when you're really talking to these
people anytime you talk to people you
raise their risk
so I in for instance ended up designing
my coverage around making sure that
nothing I could have on my computer was
actually in any way endangering my
sources I wouldn't take down Nicks I
wouldn't log anything and then I would
make that public because again going
back to the first point this is all
within a context which is oppressive law
enforcement so I designed everything
around making sure that oppressive law
enforcement had no use for me whatsoever
and I'm happy to say that since i
started my anonymous cover since i
started an almost covers for Wired i
have not been subpoenaed anyway harmless
things in aggregate can become dangerous
and dangerous things in aggregate stay
dangerous it's not a safe world you know
we have this illusion that like things
became dangerous at 911 and that cracks
me up because I remember the Cold War
when when like we were really going to
plan for the world because we were all
going to end in a nuclear holocaust and
911 made things dangers but the world's
always been dangerous like give it up
life's dangerous and death rate is still
holding it 100% so you might as well
live a little before you get there and
and the people in anonymous and and in
many of these collectives do this
because they're disempowered and one of
the things are disempowered by a safety
culture and many people in this room
well yeah we wouldn't find many unknowns
in this room because the people in this
room tend to feel empowered in their
lives which is you know means that you
can use those methods and you're not
tempted to join one of these collectives
but these collectives are full of people
who are that infinite well of solitude
that each individual is finding a way of
taking action and that is dangerous but
it's interesting so a little bit about
like a little bounce around a little bit
but a little bit about how they hack the
media my favorite operation is operation
facebook which is mainly at this point
we launched every few months to see
which media is gullible enough to report
on it anonymous is never go
to take down facebook they're going to
take down whichever media organizations
are going to say that they're going to
take to have facebook and it's it is
they reverse a lot of conventional
things about about media and narrative
and so on and so forth so for instance
when they do the big video announcing
they're going to take down Facebook or
they're going to do this or that or
something so forth that is essentially
the point where somebody anonymous's is
saying hey I'd like to talk about this
usually by the big announcement in our
world that means that all the talking
has been done the logistics have been
sorted there's been some forms filled
out a funding has been secured so on and
so forth in anonymous that means let's
have a conversation and then you go to
the back rooms of IRC channels and
strange little spots on the internet and
and figure out if people really want to
do it and and at that point on it either
hits a critical mass or does it and it
can go latent or Die altogether but at
that point there's a quiet thing in the
background that actually makes the
decision and journalists would regularly
call me and say I found a video does it
mean it's going to happen and and I'd
say well okay it's not that simple it's
not a false flag or a true flag it's a
proposal and so it should find out if
it's really gonna happen you're going to
be looking these particular IRC channels
and get to know people and they're like
lady I am on a deadline so it flex with
media narrative also media narratives
are all about finding the person in
charge putting a long title next to
their name and then you know something
is true this is this is more of a job of
finding the feeling in a room and hoping
you've got it right and accepting and
this is again why it's so important to
tell the story of how you came to
believe the story that you're telling
because that's data that is very very
important for understanding what's
actually happening in the world this is
just here because I really like it
anyway I'm that's that's that's my non
in context and once
set up respected across support or and
two if there's a relationship between
that and the fact of the net is run on
things called request for comment so I
would say the majority of times it is
there's a few instances where it's TI
and see there is no cabal but there's a
group of people who decide to take
action I think the op megalobe up mega
upload is a good example where a bunch
of people who had access to botnets sort
of just charged ahead but in many many
instances it is a proposal and you hope
it sticks and so it's very similar in
that regard yeah that first part maybe
josh can sec speak to the second part
the first part i would say yeah you know
yeah how does how does it mean explode
there's you know millions and millions
of these things and the sooner be now
soon as they're kind of set out there
you know some of them catch on and
that's kind of watching how these things
form with an anonymous is a little like
that it's hard to predict lots of
possibilities lots of announcements and
some of them just catch fire and I don't
know the science behind that but it's
interesting to watch so sideways answer
I guess um part of what you saw is part
of a blog series eating called building
a better not us with a co-author and
what we wrote some of them hated the
idea but we said something similar which
is not formalizing something with rfcs
but that mantra of measure twice cut
once or do fewer things better and we
started to inject those kinds of ideas
that when you're that mob think
groupthink spontaneous tactical you're
really prone to manipulation you're
really prone to distraction it's a lot
of sound and fury so there's a lot of
bombastic activity but maybe not lasting
impact for your true grievance that
motivated you in the first place and it
wasn't to judge them it was saying you
have a number of options and some of
these will require more strategy more
focus tighter teams and they do this for
operations but sideways answer it's a
complex group
I i will say i mostly agree with myself
on that but I um but it's an interesting
on that you know you have those groups
that kind of run and make an
announcement often they don't make an
announcement they just run and do things
but also like to build on what Josh was
saying you do have the system where it's
easy to manipulate but it's impossible
to capture because you think
manipulation leads to capture but you
just can't keep anonymous on topic long
enough to technically capture them so so
yeah you end up being able to throw
these things out there but one of my
questions going back to the kind of the
first thing that arose for me was like
if you're trying to manipulate the hive
and your day job is at the FBI are you
actually an infiltrator or have you just
joined anonymous you know I feel like
like one of the metaphors I used early
on is like if this is what this thing is
and there's all these jurisdictions and
all these law enforcement in these rooms
and they're acting like an ons until
they get to something that violates
something in their jurisdiction are they
just anonymous but so my quick metaphor
for that is if you move to California
and you get a job in California and you
dress like a California to marry
California California food have you
infiltrated California or are you just a
California Bruce Sterling I love his
hacker crackdown and probably good time
to read it right now but he's always
like you know the line between the FBI
and hackers you know is a blurry line
they're very similar it's a kind of fun
house mirror inversion they do very
similar things um and it is certainly
the case that I do think the FBI can
like further the agenda and it's true
it's very hard to capture in part
because there's also these like new
budding formations new IRC channels at
boom emerge and take off um but man like
hackers will often say the law
enforcement you know they're not very
funny they don't have a lot of lulz
that's maybe what prevents them from
becoming anonymous
curious about in some ways we live in a
society which there are all kinds of
people who think all kinds of laws are
unjust in the beginning all and there's
some of you people so that people think
the fact that stores get to keep their
merchandise and everybody can't have it
there's some people think that some fool
think we should be able to mistreat
women there's some people think any
number of things and then we have these
laws we debate and do whatever we do
however imperfectly to get those balls
and I wonder why it seems to me in this
space there's a tolerance for what in
some cases law breaking in the name of
this is kind of Rosa Parks ish rather
than this and I wonder to all of you who
think that clearly there's you know all
the presentations there was some
rhetoric of like this is the new Rosa
Parks and the some rhetoric because
people break the law how do you guys
come down on that question but I didn't
hear a lot about the rule of law which
we still have an operator yeah everybody
can do maybe I'll just take a quick stab
the denial of service attacks are a
really interesting example that I think
hit read it what you're the this the
nuance of this discussion you know
denial of service tax aren't breaking in
there just everybody knows what you know
they're taking down a side overwhelming
them with packets and fake information
in you know that's a neutral tool that's
not a that's not something that should
just be uncritically embraced right this
is something that you know one
competitive business will do to their
competitors to try to shut them down
this is something we've seen attacks
we've seen on wikileaks we've seen it on
freedom of the press foundation a new
thing that just started they've been
attacked by denial of service attacks
until a comics was hit by them NGOs have
been they've been hit by a denial of
service attacks by governments that
don't like what they're doing so in you
know denial service tags been used in
awful ways all across the board in some
cases they've been used in the case of
denial of service attacks against paypal
mastercard and visa they were used as
what you could consider to be a kind of
first protected First Amendment activity
this is
a mass group of people saying we don't
like you we don't like what you did it's
clearly a protest clearly a protest and
not that that should be legal but but
but the kind of kind of punishments were
seeing are huge 15 years per case and
$250,000 I mean shutting down as a
street corner is illegal too but you get
a night in prison and 250 dollar fine so
I think that my case would be I could
tell everybody else has a view on this
too but um the is that the nuance of
that discussion is completely lost this
is all everybody gets lumped into
hackers it's the unknown it's fearful
we're seeing huge kind of fishing
expeditions and big big punishments for
things that might might be considered
First Amendment activity so first of all
in a question or a challenge josh which
we do quite a bit but that's one of the
reasons why i brought him here i
actually don't see a lot of chaotic
actors who are trying to burn down
and be evil I've interviewed about 50
people in depth mostly on IRC and a good
handful in person and first of all what
is freaking amazing about anonymous like
sociologically astounding is that
because of the pseudo anonymity you have
really different types of people who
come together I'm talking about
upstanding you know young college
students at the best schools of Europe
to those who are hackers in the hood
like Sabu to those in the margins to
those on the center those who are
Buddhists those who are libertarian
those who are anti capitalist those are
who is social democrat some believe in
laws some don't you have a multitude it
truly is a multitude but it seems to me
for at least the political networks
boxing on anonops which are sociological
realities people there are there for
activism and they're willing to use a
diverse number of tactics that not
everyone will agree upon there can't be
consensus but to sort of portray it as
you know even like the majority and i
don't even see that many who are just
there to raise hell and what's also
interesting and maybe you guys can speak
to this because i find this fascinating
there haven't been pure trolling attacks
under the name
of anonymous in a couple of years as
well they are irreverent they are
uncivil and they will use the full range
of legal illegal and morally you know
ambiguous tactics but people they're
seeing from my perspective as an
anthropologist to be there for activism
one real quick thing in doing many many
many interviews and an account of people
the two most common reasons to
reoccurring reasons that I get why you
joined anonymous one for the lulz do
something funny and two because I have
children because I feel there is no
future and I have children I met her two
kids when it Josh had a picture of a
bunch if you remember a bunch of hackers
that had been arrested the kind of all
the mug shots that's the anonymous 16
arrested primarily for denial of service
attacks against paypal mastercard be in
the one I mentioned about WikiLeaks the
one that was actually in the middle is a
you know mid 40s housewife from Napa
Valley not technically literate by most
standards but very much to kids same as
wait I'm gonna try to pit it from what
you said to her challenge to me first
off I wrote that before you can start
early research and as an observer there
was some very aggressive over-the-top
behavior now that we know more it wasn't
typical of anonymous but now that
there's been much more knowledge about
Jeremy Hammond for example he was one of
the more aggressive guys he was one of
the ones of the clear ideology so one of
the one of my disappointments activist
ideology not just a watch and not even
come and not even common so you know a
simple an amateur trick is if I if we
exclude women from the room this is an
all-male conference right so we tend to
exclude certain examples as an observer
people were afraid I think he was afraid
you the word used that people were
afraid a lot more afraid of anonymous
personally you know there was a period
where journalists weren't attacked
the period where few journalists were
attacked so it wasn't clear it looked
very random and chaotic and that's where
some of that beer earlier came from our
frontline Brian Krebs and they weren't
necessarily done by the real anonymous
folks all right regardless we can get in
a rat hole what frustrates me having
watched us for so long is i think the
real questions are wet what gave birth
what are the drivers what's fueling the
feeling that we don't trust rule of law
we don't trust government we are opting
out of normal ways to be angry I'm much
more interested in what is fueling this
because it's fascinating and terrifying
then is it or isn't it free speech so
let's just wave a magic wand d dash
becomes free speech three years to know
it's not a felony anymore I'm okay with
that kind of line argument and we can
differentiate old in any sec argument
from what new anti second argument and
we can decide who really was or wasn't
illegal or the Joker I want to have all
those conversations quickly and
sufficiently and put them to bed so we
can actually talk about large groups of
people or post national their families
and their tribes are virtual they are
participating directly they don't trust
rule of law they don't participate in
local norms the basic building blocks of
social contracts our rule of law
nationalism family structure
judeo-christian belief or religious
texts all of those factors are eroded or
eroding and that's the fascinating
question so I'm not frustrated with my
fellow researchers I want to accelerate
what we're doing so we can get to the
real underlying questions I want to own
a go out on a limb here and say
something in support of Josh which is
that I do actually think that there is
still an element to burn it all down
inside of anonymous but in the same way
that the activism had to kind of close
itself and nihilism to get started right
now that kind of like a pond hunter and
just like the really crazy op hunt
hunter was was this this thing to go
after this guy who does had a well no he
was he was
like as a porn porn revenge site and so
on and so forth and it was pretty clear
talking with the people that were doing
that that they were that they wanted to
go after someone and like you could
clothe this in act now you close your
nihilism and activism to get some
support an anonymous instead of clothing
your activism at nihilism there are
still some really really bad bad ass
hats and anonymous who just want to
 up but you know I mean their role
you know and this takes me back to this
kind of like and I think another place
where I'm support what Josh is saying is
that isn't what I say this is a new
species this is this is a thing that is
upon the earth their role even the
kickers and anonymous is very similar to
say the ultras in in Tunisia and Egypt
who essentially football clubs that may
or may not have a political agenda but
they really like fighting the police
which turned out to be a useful skill
set when you had protests going on so
the fact that you have some burn it all
down types isn't necessarily going to
mean that the anonymous tends to burn it
all down but it does mean that you end
up with this kind of like you end up
with it with a vanguard that's willing
to train the others and do things others
aren't willing to do math charts up
suggested increasing do deviation and
subdividing somebody anybody
you think of that subdividing play out
these much two years results and
dissipation or in great network strength
how does that look so um if there's
fragmentation and nucleation which serve
certain his so long as there's shared
skills capacities and ideologies and
this is where its iconography is so
important and so strong it creates some
you know unity in the face of that
fragmentation but you know I am always
like when are they going to go away
because it's so fragmented it comes and
it goes and you know I've been so
surprised ready at how long they've
lasted precisely for the reasons you've
pointed up anybody else on that I do
speculate on this and one of the reasons
I talked about the blog of the dialectic
is we started off saying we believe half
of what we're asserting here is probably
wrong so please debate but you know
friendly debate hopefully or intense but
let's talk about it we have a belief
that if you separate the identity meme
in the convenience there's a very low
barrier to entry but an upper bounds
level of impact for that identity mean
and for those craving more there's
nothing stopping them from forming
groups there are tons of hacker groups
that predate anonymous some of them are
very clandestine and highly impactful
and yet so that there can be both right
I think you'll see groups specialized
have shorter rosters tighter trust
networks and the identity meme on our
films website we did a thing called the
hacktivists timeline which was almost as
much work as the actual film itself so
check it out if you want it's it's a
kind of tracing of this kind of activity
back as far as we could trace it and it
might start with actually Stephen Levy's
book or some or no it starts with guy
fox actually but anyway
it's clear that there that that there
have been groups there has been a this
kind of anger and this kind of activism
it rough similar kinds of activity that
we're seeing now throughout history and
sometimes that has led to really
legitimate group splintering off people
that are not attracted to the more
extreme elements but find some grain of
truth in in the gist of the activism and
I think that you know eff that you could
say some of these things have come out
of those kinds of more extreme activity
and one group that Quinn is involved
with out apparently is a telecom Ock's
telecom it's really really interesting
and really really similar to anonymous
in some ways but but different in it
sometimes they say what we build thing
anonymous tears things down we build
things I've heard Pete say that in any
case here's a group that's sort of
attempting that to try to break away
with some sympathies but but but it's
turning to break away so if I have a
hope I think I would love to see more of
that kind of stuff moving taking some of
those kinds of principles and moving on
I just want to quickly challenge the
frame of the question though all the our
whole societal structure has been
hierarchical it's been structured it's
it's fits in the Gantt charts this is
more like you know and we look for
centers of things and and I've often
said this is like nature where is the
center of nature but I mean like when
you're trying to understand this think
of it as a weather front don't think of
it as an organization and I think you'd
do better to take it out of the social
frames that you're used to because these
things are many many autonomous cells
that through communication and
coordination ad-hoc coordination create
something larger than themselves which
is again why I like to go to slime mold
for this slime molds and weather fronts
and and then the question becomes less
coherent but more interesting so wait
time tying it off real fast if you look
at the complex challenges like Internet
freedom and the ITU they deduced the
wicket conference that will not prevent
the regulation and then some of them
know that the ones that are really
really read and studied in scrutinized
would
backgrounds all the language in the
legislation they know it's going to take
a longer campaign multiple channels
working through official channels for
more channels you won't stop that simply
with a day long op so there will be
certain challenges for which it is
perfectly suited and there'll be certain
challenges which will require other
adjacent surgical efforts let's keep our
eyes on our civil liberties when tho
this happens yes it's primarily people
don't have other means for boys and
power so Eddie Quinn
nobody in this room
because
because they are in power
i'm also here
being a very diverse coalition
institutions that I'm trying to I'm een
I don't know I there's a two extremely
important people who are part of the one
percent you know someone who's very
visible I'm not going to say where and
one you know one of those is in the
workforce another one is a 16 year old
um there's those who are extremely
disempowered those there are those who
were part of the hacker underground in
the 90s and are like site that
you can hack again in this kind of
political way lots of males um lots of
people with no technical skills but I
would just say I've been astounded by
the full range but in the end that kind
of desire for sociological
quantification is impossible and I've
just gathered these flashes these
glimpses from the people I've met in
person and the interviews which I kind
of have to trust the people but in the
end I can't even verify it I mean my gut
is its diverse you know not so much with
gender but with sexuality and economic
background and it's it's a function on
part you know there's this great quote
by Naomi Klein which I don't know by
heart but it's about Che Guevara which
is like cheer for Palestinians mean this
chair for you know Americans means this
a masked entity and in an anonymous
there's not even that chap person it's
just anonymous and so people can
identify in very different ways that
said you know if you're involved in
internet geeky things fortune blogging
hacking you're more likely to end up in
anonymous but that pool of people is
already quite diverse as well to clarify
something I was saying it's the feeling
of being powerless and it sometimes I
shouldn't say everybody in this room but
and sometimes people in positions of
power still feel trapped by their
situations such that that feeling of
powerlessness and the feeling that you
can go do become this
person and be empowered like I wouldn't
be surprised if there's people in
high-level positions that have
occasionally got into anonymous where
they could really feel like they can
express the empowerment that they
actually want as opposed to the one that
their role it puts on them
out of it because why I see as I was
explaining for the equivalent in China
with eating human flesh search where
it's like everyone from all walks of
life is off you're a lot like your
Mountain which is like government
officials will also be involved in
giving up information they don't feel
comfortable doing it publicly but a lot
of times are getting well because they
see it as like this these are their
friends
these and then the political stuff comes
out of it so I'm curious through your
close interactions with these
communities what are their initial
so in the chanology network they
protested the Church of Scientology
they're actually the least anonymous of
the nodes because they protest in person
in certain cities New York in particular
like tight tight knit friends and they
themselves will say we kind of came
together as friends but we've continued
to fight the Church of Scientology one
of the fascinating things about the eat
more illegal network so where there's
illegal activity even if a small portion
are only breaking the law is that
actually friendship is very hard to form
because you can't necessarily meet
people and this is very different from
the other hacker communities I study
where it's precisely friendships and
dedication to the craft and dedication
to the idea of free speech which creates
the conditions for hyper sociality so in
my writing Oh fellow Ron's people do
become friends but it is it's under
considerable duress sometimes and they
get really bummed out about the fact
that they must hide themselves and in
fact one of the reasons why I think a
lot of people were willing to meet me
when I went to different cities was I
was like flesh-and-blood person from the
internet that they could meet and so
it's a very different dynamic from most
other hacker circles where that
friendship is so important to their kind
of you know way of life the dynamic
changes to the culture changes at with
different different ops right so before
Scientology you know there was a certain
group of people and then those people
protest Scientology and people that just
don't like Scientology notice the
protests say wow this is anti
Scientology group love to be a part of
that so the overall dynamic shifts and
changes with with each sort of cause
are there mechanisms for self-regulation
witches don't seek attention for
yourself right and so anti-second
anti-second in particular because
lovesick and quinn has written really
well about this on the one hand they
declared we're not anonymous we're not
anonymous we're not on us that the media
just collapsed the two and many of the
individuals came from anonymous and
there was so much overlap that it was
very hard to differentiate but one of
the things that was interesting was they
became rock stars and then when they
became anti sec on the one hand they
were beloved for their political work or
the potential political work and freakin
hated because they were working under
the banner of a name anti-second people
really started to dislike those you know
status seeking and so that kind of
very very strong ethic against celebrity
is one way to regulate themselves
internally the other one that's really
really important and key is that if
you're going to have and you know you
start with fortune but also every time
anonymous takes up a new cause it gains
a whole bunch of new members from that
particular like there's a bunch of you
know Middle Eastern anons now because
anonymous was was involved with the Arab
Spring so you end up swelling the ranks
with and again going back to chalegi the
ranks were swelled by the existing anti
Scientology people as well but but so
how there's an interesting mechanism
that's involved that is this what are
the other core values which is the it
was just offensive humor and it realized
like participating in these spaces that
that the way you get cultures from all
around the world to play nice and
coordinate things is not by making sure
nobody ever says anything offensive
making sure that everything is always
offensive and there's no distinguishing
between offending someone along cultural
lines because we're in an explicitly
offensive space so that kind of the
trolling culture actually actually
short-circuits much of the you know the
difficult work of the 20th century
trying to
get cold you know multicultural groups
to work together they just managed to
get away from that by saying look
everyone's going to be offended all the
time we're going we're going to we're
going to even out the temperature by
putting everything at boiling all the
time and it works like there are many
many different schisms and anonymous but
they're very rarely about local cultural
issues so that they kind of like it's
constantly offensive and it's internet
culture driven and without that level of
offense the space would actually be much
more emotionally hurtful I just say one
thing I've been informed that that moose
22 thing I gave you is maybe may have
just run out so so too I made a new one
SCS 2013 for down or I'm fine with that
too the Cabal for coming out of the
smoky backroom and sharing today
