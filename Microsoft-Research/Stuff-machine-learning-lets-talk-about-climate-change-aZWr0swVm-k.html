you
so I want to talk to you about climate
change because it's interesting and
because it's important and I do think
the skills that you have in this room
could be helpful to that important topic
I'm going to aim to tell you about three
or five things depending how our time
goes so the first three are interesting
and the second two the important bit so
I'm going to talk about historical
climate change first going back hundreds
of thousands of years first let's go to
Antarctica and you drill down through
the Antarctic Ice Sheet you can see
stripes there in that photograph those
are years each strike is caused by a
year of snowfall and as you drill down
you can measure the heavy oxygen
depletion and the heavy hydrogen
depletion as a function of death and
what you see is it goes wobbling up and
down up and down up and down and those
wobbles are years and why is it while
walking down well because the
temperature at which the rain is sorry
of snow is falling on twatter toka has a
slight effect on the isotope ratio of
the oxygen and your deuterium
thanks to physics and so you're getting
a temperature signal in the water you
take the water out of this ice core and
you can deduce an indication of what the
temperature was okay so we've got a
temperature signal and you can drill
further down the top graph is going back
50 years
Wabble Wabble looking at the deuterium
and then the bottom two graphs are
looking at deuterium and oxygen and
seeing what the temperature did for the
last 40,000 years and what you see is
something interesting happened there
there was a big change of temperature
it was much colder back here 15,000
years ago because that was the last ice
age okay I had you keep on drilling down
and down in another location and you get
eight hundred thousand years of the
temperature deuterium
going up and down so
just showing you the deuterium deficit
you can turn it into a a temperature if
you want and you can also measure in the
same ice the carbon dioxide
concentration in the bubbles of air that
are trapped in the ice and that's shown
in the red graph and people have often
noted how these are quite strongly
correlated with each other and I've just
scaled and slid them on top of each
other
arbitrarily to make that bottom picture
which is the deuterium and the co2
graphs on top of each half now why am i
showing this well I will go I showed it
in his movie and people who don't like
the politics of climate change action
try and criticize everything that Al
Gore and climate scientists say and I
think they have the impression what Al
Gore was saying was ooh look at how the
co2 changed and the temperature changed
and maybe they thought Al Gore was
saying that those causation that the co2
caused the temperature and so and Al
Gore certainly was saying that if you
put extra co2 in an atmosphere you'll
get a bigger greenhouse effect and that
will give you warming that is a true
mechanistic model like the physics says
that that will that will happen but
what's he saying these graphs are
illustrating that I don't think he was
but maybe people misunderstood and
thought he was saying that so when they
attack Al Gore one thing I say is oh but
if we can show that the the co2 lags the
temperature then that will disprove this
whole Al Gore nonsense alright so you
look at these graphs and you say is the
temperature lagging the co2 or is this
year too lagging the temperature now you
know that that's not a sensible question
to be asking because actually what
you're looking at is a very complicated
dynamical system with co2 concentration
and global temperature being variables
among billions of variables that are all
affecting each other on a complicated
way we're just looking at the natural
evolution of this system as it does its
own chaotic thing and as its influenced
by external forces as well
but let's look at this lagging and
leading thing anyway just just to see
what we make of it and my suggestion to
you is that when you stare at these
graphs it's got a sort of time asymmetry
that the coming out of an ice age this
is the most recent coming out for an ice
age here's the one before here's the one
before that well maybe this was one as
well the coming outs are quite rapid and
abrupt and steep and I'd suggests that
the change in temperature and co2 as
I've shown them here that sort of
synchronous you can't you can't tell
which is lacking or leading they're
going back into ice ages coming down
these slopes here seems to have a very
different mechanism and to take have a
different timescale to it okay and it's
conceivable that in a few cases you
could say oh look the co2 is lagging the
temperature ha ha yeah so the blue is
the temperature the co2 is lagging in
this particular going down okay well who
cares there's a mechanism for going back
into ice ages and maybe co2 likes
temperature and that but what we're
doing at the moment is shoving a load of
co2 into the system and the exits from
ice ages I seem to involve a mechanism
where maybe there's some sort of
positive feedback between co2 and
temperature and maybe other things all
reinforcing each other so you get co2
going up temperature going up giving you
more co2 giving you more temperature
okay so I suggest that there's different
mechanisms on the way up on the way down
and indeed that's what the climate
scientists say too and neither of those
mechanisms is the little causal thing we
just talked about so it is a complicated
dynamical system and the abrupt climate
change happens during the destruction of
ice sheets the sort of things that are
going on in this dynamical system are
first there's a water vapor feedback
water vapor is a very important
gasps so when you put extra co2 in then
you'll get warming which gives you more
water vapor and the warm around the
trick and hold more water vapor so you
get more greenhouse effect so if there's
a positive feedback there it's not an
unstable feedback but there is a
positive feedback of some size other
interesting feedbacks are if you start
melting your ice sheets then you get
pools of water and bits of open ocean
which have a much lower albedo they
absorb more sunshine and then getting
more radiation absorbed from the Sun
means more warming if you warm up your
ocean it can hold less co2 thanks to
Henry's law so you get the co2 being out
gas which gives you more warming so the
potential positive feedback there and
then another very complicated thing is
if you have very large scale melting of
ice sheets that dumps fresh water into
the ocean and that can then have a
significant effect on ocean circulation
so these are the sort of complicated
things that are actually going on during
that entire time series there's a paper
in nature let's maybe zoom into this a
little bit there's a nature paper fairly
recent that's looked in more detail at
what happened in the last glaciation
because what the data from Antarctica
shows which is the red is Antarctica
temperature and the yellow dots are the
atmospheric co2 in Antarctica they're
what this paper shows is there's a
difference between the Antarctica
temperature and the global temperature
so they went and got surrogates
temperature surrogates all over the
world and the blue line shows what the
global temperature average temperature
was doing during that last deglaciation
and what you can see is once it gets
going the co2 globally which you can
measure in Antarctica because it's well
mixed in yellow is actually leading the
temperature the global temperature but
Antarctic temperature is is
a bit different from global temperature
because one thing that's going on is
it's one of these melting ice sheets
changes the ocean circulation things and
they've got a name for it they call it
the bipolar seesaw so they maybe I don't
need to explain the story in in full
detail but the bottom line it here is
the last place deglaciation has been
measured accurately and during that last
e d glaciation during most of it the
rise in co2 did precede the rise in
temperature and so but what's the
mechanism that's driving all of these
ice ages something I had heard about
decades ago is the idea of Milankovitch
cycles that oh it's something to do with
changes in the orbit of the earth and
the precession of the Earth's axis um
but I hadn't actually heard the details
of how how that works I'd I'd seen
pictures of changing orbits and graphs
of changes in obliquity and eccentricity
and so forth but it always seemed a bit
dissatisfied to me that the evidence for
the earth the Earth's orbit causing the
the ice age timings it seemed to be you
know a bit fuzzy there wasn't a clear
mechanism because I I'd heard about
papers where they did Fourier analysis
though they would for a analyzed data on
global ice the global ice volume and
then look at the power spectrum and say
oh look at all those Peaks that
correspond to orbital frequencies so
here's one such paper where they've
taken the astronomy that in the solid
line so the as the orbit of the earth
changes in the procession as the as the
axis of the earth processes you can look
at what happens to the summer insulation
how hot is summer in the north northern
hemisphere and there are slight
variations in that and you can fully
analyze that time series and that gives
you
black solid line and then you look at
the geology you drill down for hundreds
of thousands of years and make
geological measurements of oxygen
isotope ratios which is a proxy for
global ice volume and your Fourier
analyze that and you get the dotted line
and then take a look at all these these
things that line up and so it must be an
astronomical cause that gives you the
ice ages and that isn't really a
mechanism it's just well it's quite
strong evidence but I've always wanted
to know a mechanism and having hung out
with climate scientists for a bit I now
have picked up that there is actually a
mechanism and it's quite interesting so
here's to nature papers that are both
quite recent which give more detail to
this the reason it's it's sort of
dissatisfying is the periods just don't
actually agree all of the big spikes in
this thing the precession story it's
22,000 years 24,000 years 19,000 years
and then obliquity 41,000 years that's
where all the big things are in this
diagram but what's the periodicity of
ice ages 100,000 years 100,000 years
it's about every hundred thousand years
roughly that you get an ice age so it
always struck me that there was a
difficulty that these spikes weren't
actually agreeing with the the main
frequency and there's an explanation for
that so first there's a spherical paper
who's saying here's a deterministic
model where you can take the the
sunshine curve and turn it into a
predictor of ice volume and they show
that with this red jagged line so
they've come up with a threshold idea
that you take the solar curve when it
hits that particular threshold then that
gives you a deglaciation and that does a
quite a good job I'd say of reproducing
this zigzag line of ice volume it gets
most of the D glaciation is right
doesn't get this one doesn't get these
to here but it's sort of suggested that
they're on to something now what's the
actual mechanism that they believe is
going on here where does this hundred
thousand year time scale come from well
here's my understanding of the mechanism
of climate scientists think is is going
on and that is giving the time scale
imagine we start out in a state where
you've got a load of ice in the northern
hemisphere and it's cold and it's
snowing and the ice is building up okay
so you go from here to here and the ice
is built up now on a much longer time
scale that enormous weight of ice a mile
deep or so is typical thickness of an
ice cap crushes the ground down to the
ground elastically responds and you
squish the ground down with your ice
until the ground is below sea level and
then the ocean can come in in the summer
and go gobble gobble and eat your glass
here from underneath you get very rapid
loss of your ice cap rapid on it on a
geological time scale so cough the ice
disappears and then the ground recovers
and you have this rebound of the of the
ground which is still happening in many
places in the in the world now after the
last ice age so there's a model and this
is a cycle this is a spontaneous cyclic
phenomenon that will just happen by
itself it's got its own time scale and
it's to do with the time scale of how
long it takes for the ice to build up
and for the ground to squish down so the
story here is this thing would have been
going on and would give you an
approximately hundred thousand year
period but then along comes the sunshine
and kicks it and so the phase of the the
the solar signal the orbital signal
makes the deglaciation happen in a way
that gives you
they call it pacing it gives it
determines the timing that the D
glaciation and that's why you get the
signal coming through in the Fourier
analysis okay so the second nature paper
I mentioned has a much more detailed
physical model of this whole process
they've modeled ice caps in different
locations in the world and they've made
a model which shows a natural cyclic
behavior it shows hysteresis if you had
a world with fixed co2 concentrations
and fixed sunshine fixed fixed seasons
then it would just go around around this
this blue and red loop but then what the
changes in in the orbital parameters are
doing is moving it around on this
diagram so you can read the paper if
you're interested in more details this
is a model that can actually predict the
timings of the ice ages so what's the
message so far the message is the
climate is a twitchy complex system full
of chaotic natural variability and
potential instability so very twitchy
very sensitive so mess with it at your
peril I think is a reasonable thing to
say it it it's very complicated
and may be quite hard to predict what
will happen but given how sensitive it
is it's quite credible that if you mess
with it you're gonna get some radical
changes so wouldn't it be handy if we
could just do some experiments on a
planet and see what actually happens
when you do this other thing instead of
letting it naturally just do its own
thing which doesn't tell you what will
happen when we do this new thing that
humanity's doing we put in tons of co2
into the atmosphere it would be nice to
know what happens because that's quite
different from business as usual in
International System wouldn't it be
handy if the if we could look at the
results of a mega carbon release
experiment well the wonderful thing is
nature has occasionally very rarely done
this for us so the third thing I want to
tell you about is the Paley scene Eocene
thermal maximum and this happened 55
million years ago if you look you drill
down now in rocks and look at
temperature surrogates in the the rocks
again using isotope measurements you can
see the history of the temperature of
the planet it was a completely different
Planet 55 million years ago much warmer
you know it's sort of dinosaur light
conditions so the dinosaurs had been
wiped out in 66 million years ago so it
was a warm and different planet but
there's this spike here in temperature
at 55 million years and this has
recently been analyzed in far more
detail again using Fourier analysis to
get the timing information of what was
going on here
it's a spike in temperature what
happened well let me just summarize what
is believed to have happened here it's
believed that there was a natural
release of one or two or maybe five or
seven trillion tons of carbon over a
fairly short time only a few thousand
years they've got that timing thanks to
the Fourier analysis of the of the data
that they can measure in this rock you
can see the sort of stripy nuts in the
rock that's a great big rock sample
black black black white and that's
caused by solar effect orbital effects
okay what happened there was a release
of one or two trillion tons of carbon
that was a natural release of some sort
methane or something coming out in
massive quantities they know that
because of a carbon isotope excursion so
the the ratio of carbon-12 to carbon 13
changes globally in the whole planet
during this release what then happened
well there was something like a six
degrees global temperature rise the mass
extinctions in some some groups of
species and it took about 120,000 years
for the carbon to then be removed by
natural processes so that's the
experiment it has been done if you pull
this trigger if if we say let's release
it a trillion tons of carbon what can go
wrong well it was a slightly different
planet so you can't necessarily
generalize from this but what happened
on that planet was you got six degrees
of global warming mass extinctions and
it took hundreds of thousands of years
for the system to recover all right so
let's time is is there so let me very
quickly say what next why does this
matter
that all sounds interesting well maybe
it's important where are we going now
left hand graph in blue is showing a
smooth global temperature we've had
about 1 degree of warming since 1880
that's shown in red on the right in the
context of the last 10,000 years or so
so it's fairly unprecedented global rise
in temperature and the advice from
climate science is that what really
matters is cumulative emissions global
warming as a measure of climate change
is expected to be roughly proportional
to cumulative carbon emissions so it's
not a question of reducing the emission
rate by 10% 50% 80% actually if you want
to cap climate change
on the vertical axis you need to cap
cumulative emissions which means that
the emissions rate has to drop to zero
that's an inconvenient truth the slope
of this roughly straight line
relationship is not known is one of the
most important unknown parameters it's
called the climate sensitivity and the
pink sausage shows the uncertainty of
that slope but whatever the slope you
still have the same message if you want
to stop the vertical thing you've got to
reduce emissions to zero at some point
okay so that's an important message and
finally there are some people who say oh
who cares about three degrees of warming
this is a projection looking at the last
20,000 years and looking into the future
of what we could be doing to ourselves
by 2100 we could have three degrees of
warming quite easily maybe six degrees
by the end of the century well who cares
three degrees that doesn't sound very
much does it well hang on that is the
difference between the present day and
the last ice age so a three degree
global temperature increase is a big
deal and just to put it in European
terms since that's where many of us live
let me finally show you some Met Office
graphs which they published in the last
year these graphs come
hair what's going to happen in Europe
what European summer temperatures will
look like if you carry on about along
this sort of business-as-usual curve in
red with emissions getting bigger and
bigger every year or if you manage to
get on this absolutely heroic dark blue
line where the emissions rate is reduced
to zero by the end of the century you
might remember the summer of 2003 was a
record-breaking summer it was the
hottest summer ever recorded in in
Europe there are heat waves and droughts
and people died so something you could
ask is according to these climate
simulations that the Met Office does
with their supercomputers how frequent
are rare events like that going to be
this was the hottest summer ever so an
extremely rare event how common will
that be right here's 2003 that's the
hottest summer ever the black line is
the historical curve this is showing
average European temperature in that
that map area in June July and August
right so there's the record with the
mouse on it and the blue line shows lots
of simulations of the future and you can
see that by 2050 that record will be
broken 50% of the time so half of all
summers even on this SuperDuper heroic
blue line with the climate change action
half of all summers will be hotter than
the hottest summer ever in 2050 and
that's in our lifetime for most of us
whereas if we don't bother taking any
Climate Change action at all on the red
line 99% of all summers in 2050 in your
lifetime in the lifetime of your
children will be hotter than the hottest
summer ever
I think this matters so I'm done I want
to tell you act let's do something ok
and if you want me to be more explicit
what do I mean by act society needs to
assess uncertainty assess its options
assess costs damages use decision theory
and game theory to choose sensible
actions and I think that's the sort of
thing people in this room are are good
at thank you for listening
so before the coffee break do we have
any questions they'd actually thinking
actions actions okay so the question is
what are what actions are people taking
and what actions should we take that
would be the topic for about nine hours
more talk so I'd like to mention that
there is a tool for the UK describing
all the options all the levers that the
UK could could pull on it's called the
2050 calculator and it allows you to
explore which actions do make a
difference and how to make combinations
of actions that add up and recently the
same team that made the 2050 calculator
for the UK led the project to make a
global calculator which describes all
the levers for the for the world and
I've actually got that here in my
browser know how long really gone
that's Thompson sampling okay all right
here it is and it's just incredible how
important some levers are that people
haven't been paying much attention to so
how about diet you know you were here
about nuclear power so that's a
contentious thing and where people say
yeah nucleus important yep you can crank
nuclear up and down and it makes a bit
of a difference to commute of emissions
so fair enough but what about diet if we
get everyone to live on vegetarian diets
and see the effect that had the gray bar
there is the cumulative emissions by
2100 and so just going from a sort of
let's all live like Europeans or
something slightly more restrained to
let's all live not completely vegetarian
but mainly vegetarian
that has an absolutely massive effect so
that's not an action that people are
talking about at the moment I think all
these things need to be discussed
there's another question of that this
mass release of carbon love like six
trillion tons of carbon if we add up the
cumulative emissions from 18 whatever
how far are we
yes the cute of emissions it's not known
exactly how much were released in the
PETM
but one or two or or six trillion tons
is a rough estimate and where are we on
this graph this is a trillion tons of
carbon here there will be two trillion
tons so we haven't reached the trillion
tons yet it's quite credible by the end
of this century or a little bit later
that we might get two trillion tons if
humanity doesn't turn itself around
we're sort of halfway we've used up half
of the budget and that's mainly fossil
fuels but it's also cement and land use
change deforestation is causing the
carbon release so we've used up half of
this budget if you view a trillion tons
as the budget I'm not saying we should
but a lot of people do talk about a
trillion tons as being the sort of
indicative bucket budget beyond which
you don't want to go of course it
depends on the climate sensitivity and
what you think about the losses and the
damages where you want to settle in it
but what sort of half way to a trillion
tons okay then let's sink David again
