hi i'm mat from buzzfeed I run the tax
section there and so what I'm talking
about today is dark social and so and to
talk about dark social first we're going
to talk a little bit about web traffic
so if you if you look broadly speaking
they're kind of like three kinds of web
traffic at least according to google
analytics so you have search traffic
which is traffic that gets to your
website through search then you have
referral traffic which you can see how
somebody got to your website so if you
if you click a link from facebook it
tells you it came from facebook or CNN
or whatever site and then you've got
direct traffic where you for one reason
or another that there's no you can't
there's no referral information so you
can't quite see how this traffic wound
up on your particular web page and there
are a lot of reasons you could you might
not see referral data for link roads it
to be going from secure link an HTTPS
link to a non-secure just a regular HTTP
link or if you're using like a really
old version of it an explorer with an
all-flash website sometimes it is the
password fold data then and then in sort
of a more interesting edge case if you
on iOS if you're going from a nap to a
browser that's another reason you
wouldn't see referral data but what
we're most interested in is the instance
where if you follow a link from email or
I am you often won't get referral data
and this is this is what we're in
student with dark social so you're
probably you're probably familiar with
dark matter or the concept of it
basically like eighty four percent of
the matter in the universe we can't
really detect or see we just kind of
know it's there and so dark social is a
phrase coined by Alexis magic all to
kind of describe all of the sharing
happening through email and IM that you
can't really see so we know what's
happening because you're probably not
typing in like a four hundred character
URL to get someplace but we don't really
know where it
from or you know who's doing it or why
hence the dark social we just know
what's happening and to sort of
complicate this more so all dark social
traffic is direct traffic but not all
direct traffic is dark social so which
when you when we get into sorry I'm
trying to figure out where I'm at it so
we're mostly talking about email and IM
which brings me to to this slide here
when we're looking at anyone i am this
is a new york time study that was on
pointer and if you look at the way
people are sharing what's interesting
there are a couple things one
Millennials now share more through
posted links on facebook and twitter
than they do through email and obviously
that changes when you look as you go
older gen x really liked email and
that's that's how they're doing a lot of
it so and then there's and i don't have
a slide on this but there's a Pew study
that when you when you going younger
like the numbers kind of get starker
like for for people who are 12 to 17
only six percent of them use email daily
which is kind of astounding and if only
thirty-seven percent use it even once a
week and then only half of them are
using traditional IM once a week and
when they are using messaging it tends
to be over these sort of other social
networks like facebook which if you
remember that josh miller posts a couple
weeks ago when he was talking about how
teenagers use the internet his sister
didn't really like facebook she's like
she's sort of a younger teen and sort of
the striking things when you think about
how younger people are using social
networks so she kind of uses facebook
but doesn't like it she doesn't use IM
she's really into tumblr which seems to
be kind of like a thing for for teens
but uh so now we're going to go so when
we're talking about you know and i am
there's a couple things that are pretty
interesting when you when you're looking
at email for one email is still the most
popular thing people do with their
smartphone according to one pew study
and there was another study that came
out really recently and thinking about
email and where it's coming from the
most popular mail app in the world now
is the iOS mao app which has a
35-percent share according to campaign
monitor so a lot of the email that
you're seeing is is mobile and what
we've known and so the kind of Moses
data I've brought today is actually from
buzzfeed and from the BuzzFeed Network
which are two different things so
there's buzzfeed com which is you know
the the meme site which you don't know
about it i can give you twenty seven
reasons you should after the after the
talk but then the other side of
BuzzFeed's business was sort of like
before the site became a thing was it
was kind of like an ad networks sort of
thing where they would sort of try to
track viral content and predict what
would become viral and so there are a
lot of sites in the BuzzFeed Network
everything from like the Atlantic wire
at a TMZ to to a bunch of other sites
and so we have a lot of sort of
aggregate data and when you're thinking
about email and I am one of the really
interesting thing that's happened this
year on the BuzzFeed network isn't
referral some email have cratered and
they have not picked back up so when
you're looking across all these sites
you've had 13 million referrals from
email and obviously you can't see all
email but there there are some there's
that there's some referrals from email
that you can track and the ones that we
can sort of indicative of a broader
trend email is falling and and and so
when we're looking at once p theta so
this is sort of the composition of like
buzzfeed com right now the what traffic
kind of looks like as we can estimate it
so um the reason this is put up a bit is
so december was our biggest month ever
for traffic BuzzFeed we had 43 million
uniques which is like almost double what
it was the year before and if you look
at like where a lot of the growth is
coming from so social got bigger which
that's traditional social sharing
facebook twitter tumblr
cetera and then you've got the dark
social which is the direct traffic and
that's also grown quite a bit now when
we break this down a little bit more
this is the really astounding thing
about direct traffic and the dark social
stuff it's really really mobile at least
for BuzzFeed and our traffic
increasingly is really really mobile so
of our direct traffic which would be the
dark social stuff nearly half of it is
mobile and in December for our biggest
months forty five percent of art of our
unique visitor traffic last month was
mobile so it's like super super mobile
and you know when I mentioned this to
alexis madrigal a thing he said to me
was like holy you have all the kids
right because when you when you were
thinking about usage patterns and who's
using mobile so but at the same time
this is actually what so you think
mobile you think younger but what
complicates the sort of picture of
direct traffic is when our data is like
when buzzfeed actually has data
scientists so there are there are PhDs
at BuzzFeed you when you're looking at
like tendencies and demographic data
across that from what we can tell a lot
of it is actually older and non-urban
the stuff coming from from what we can
tell our non mobile devices it's more
likely it's less likely to come from
urban communities and it's
disproportionately originating from the
middle of the country than the coasts so
you kind of have this like really
heterogeneous mix we've got being our
people as best we could talk on mobile
devices and you've got this other
portion of direct traffic which is older
and less urban so and if you if you look
at social and dark social there there's
actually ninety-five percent correlation
between the two if you get a lot of
social traffic you will have a lot of
dark social traffic and this this is
sort of like relates to the
nature of content as its shared and this
is sort of like what the BuzzFeed
philosophy is you know the the whole the
whole game is rather than search
although Isaac research optimizing for
social it's trying to get people to
share things which is sort of a
different kind of surly gaming I guess
you could consider like psychological
gaming preying on people's weaknesses
rather than algorithms weaknesses and
that sort of you know transcends
websites and social networks so when
something is is really social it's also
got a lot of dark social behind it there
it and to sort of kind of lay out how
hard it is to see what's happening with
dark social precisely nobody can quite
explain why with the BuzzFeed network I
asked a bunch of people at our giantess
no one's quite sure why there's a huge
spike in dark social from sep tember to
December which maybe you guys can sort
of think about because at first I
thought I've given the timing it may
have been related to to do not track
sort of becoming more more widespread
given that it's sort of a default option
now on Windows 8 and I 10 but that's not
quite the case and if you and to go back
to the correlation if you look if you
look at direct page views like with this
chart you can see like they are they
have been like sort of going up in and
tandem and the the other thing we know
about dark social vs social so the
bigger the bigger I hit something is the
lower the percentage of it that comes
with some dark social and this is in
part because the nature of sharing on
social vs ducks or soul but something
goes really big on Facebook or on
Twitter right it goes up exponentially
but if something is being passed around
on I am even if it's really popular you
know it doesn't quite explode the same
way that it does sort of these built-in
sharing mechanisms on Facebook and
Twitter just because of the the nature
of that just sort of the the end of the
slides here but there are a couple
things that sort of come out of all of
that so
as the nature of direct traffic has
changed that cuz dark tommix been around
forever but now it's like really highly
mobile and it has been emailed I am but
when you when you go back to to sort of
the the mobile stuff one of the really
crazy things we found with direct
traffic from iOS nearly twenty percent
of it comes from facebook chat and
messenger as best we can tell so there's
a lot of sharing on iOS happening be a
facebook chat which is probably younger
people as best we can tell and so as
this sort of evolved we going to see
less and less coming from email and more
through chat and sort of these sort of
alternative things but you know and even
though they're kind of off the radar
dark social like since they're going
through existing social networks like
Facebook like Facebook actually owns
like a decent chunk of this dark social
pie as best we can tell so I think
that's yeah I mean I basically just came
to throw a bunch of data you guys just
sort of lay out what we know about it as
best as best we can um yeah question hi
one before
sorry i don't really know what I word
powerpoint
it is a it is a crazy jump and they've
checked the numbers and we check them
and not supposedly according to our
people is correct they're not quite sure
why I mean there are a couple and this
is across all the BuzzFeed site all the
BuzzFeed network sites so there could be
sort of any number of things a spike on
mobile and in fact like one of the one
of the interesting things is when I was
looking today at numbers for like the
videos we've been doing since a Frank
started at BuzzFeed like if some of this
video is eighty percent of the viewers
are coming from mobile now and and when
you're looking at growth when something
is getting bigger like more and more of
that pie is coming from mobile and
mobile is where you're seeing a lot of
these instances of direct traffic and
part when you think about app handoffs
from from like an app to to Safari so I
don't have a great explanation there but
our people didn't either this this is
from BuzzFeed's direct measurement
because they they have a couple
different ways of tracking on on
different sites that are part of the
network so this is all internal
dark socials is very publisher centric
advertising centric view of what this
behavior is yes but to some large
percentage of users especially on mobile
is it this experience just privacy yes I
mean right but that's that's I mean
actually if you look at the types of
stories that tend to be hits overt with
a lot of direct traffic versus actually
I know what can explain a lot of this I
just thought about this the biggest the
biggest the biggest stories with direct
traffic in the network during that time
period we're actually capable to nude
pictures and when you when you which
were which was a big story of lot of
sites and more salacious stories tend to
be the ones that are bigger with direct
traffic so and you do see that with with
things like celebrity new pics or that
type of thing there's only like when
you're when we were looking at the top
20 stories across the network there's
only about a forty-five percent overlap
of the kinds of story of the stories
between the biggest dark social hits and
and social hits so hit sir hits but the
kinds of stories that are hits you do
get some variation in part because
people you're right that people want to
know I mean I'm saying 20 million people
were probably not want to post Kate
Middleton new pics on their Facebook but
they would share them over i am but i
don't know like the this mike there
wasn't like a great idea as to where
that came from per se
you
I do not tracks big for people it's like
a in google also like they wouldn't fall
into this because it's gonna be
considered search traffic right but if
you're logged into google now that's
that's all done through SSL so you're
not getting search term search terms and
referrals which is also you know it's
not a problem for users at the problem
for marketers
actually Twitter apparently fix
something in their mobile app where now
you can see where it comes from Twitter
where we used to have a lot of direct
traffic coming from from certain Twitter
apps like TweetDeck for a long time
didn't didn't give you a referral data
for instance but it does now and then
just think about the the the facebook
chat is that it being twenty percent of
the iOS dark topic like for a while we
couldn't tell why why so much facebook
traffic had never for all behind it but
there were sort of other indicators it
was coming from facebook but is actually
like yo hell car mon who pointed out
that actually what that's coming from is
from facebook chat which may be bigger
than like a lot of people think it is
nature stretching it out if I'm okay to
graph that perhaps you know higher
higher ground I wouldn't see such
discrepancy between the private social
the public
so I did not make this shirt so I could
not tell you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
