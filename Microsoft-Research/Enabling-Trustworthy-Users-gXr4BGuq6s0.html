hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
alright so thank you all for coming out
today on such a shy sayin and
interesting weather week and I
appreciate your accommodating the shift
in schedule so we could get gene in this
morning to a lecture so I'm very pleased
to welcome professor gene camp of the
university Indiana here to MSR to speak
as part of the series of gene and I have
known each other for well let's go with
a frightening number yeah a long time um
certainly before I gave the infamous
talk on trusted computing and mighty um
to just almond and crowd um and she
graduated in 96 for Whitney from the in
hearing public policy program at
Carnegie Mellon then was faculty at Kane
School of Government at Harvard for a
year went to Indiana and then in 2010
took the year off to be she was selected
as a fellow of the I Triple E us a
congressional Fellows Program and she
actually spent a year on Capitol Hill
doing public policy work in the office
of Etheridge Etheridge represented a
threat she was from North Carolina where
you're from correct yeah ok and so she
got a quite a different perspective than
we normally do on the way policy gets
made and so without any further ado
please welcome to camp thanks um thank
you for coming out this is my second
snowpocalypse because i was in DC when
they got a foot and a half of snow and
all the flights out were canceled after
four o'clock and i was only 359 so um
this is obviously not a cryptic on this
is a talk about making trustworthy
trusted computing trustworthy how do you
design systems that engage individuals
to make the best risk decision for
themselves and a work a lot with mental
models of risk and I want to say that
the mental model of the designers really
matters that you can think about
thinking about maybe a brain surgeon not
a stupid user a brain surgeon who's
going to go into surgery and you don't
want them to
with the security you don't want them to
use any cycles on the security and think
of them as unique individuals not as a
group that has statistical
characteristics but as individuals and
we can salt we can't solve the network
problem without solving the individual
user problem so I'm going to start with
a discussion of security decisions as
risk communication talk a little bit
about risk perception I'm explicitly
talking about expressed preference
sometimes in the industry we work with
revealed preference revealed preference
means people do exactly what they want
to do and they are fully informed so you
just observe their behaviors and then
you know what they want to do express
preference means sometimes people are
not fully informed and so you have to
ask them what it is they actually wanted
to do and then I'm going to go through
two very high level examples of a couple
of systems we built and do some
intermittent examples about risk
warnings that we have used in the
industry and I want to say one more
thing this is about participants who
engage in risk decisions right you've
got to start thinking about
communicating to individuals who are in
their own unique context of which you
can only detect partially but you can
partially detect a human being brings to
the risk decision their own willingness
their own risk posture and their own
context and the mental model of
designers matter and I'm sure we've all
heard there's only the two industries
that talk about users who use their
products every other industry is focused
on customers and participants and the
fundamental assumption that we make you
know because classical economics tells
us and agent based models weren't
perfectly with this and it's what
computers do and we learn computers
people do not engage in the calculus of
risk right I mean how many of us have
seen there are a million X trust and
everything else where you say I trust
you seven point five percent right
do not do that and one of the early
experiments we did is we compared to
failures right we had self similar
groups of 40 people they were testing as
consumers a life management website
which would remind you of people's
birthdays and then when you know your
nephew turned 14 they'd say here are the
top presence for 14 year olds right that
was what they were putative Lee doing
and then half the group saw a pop-up and
a change in policy privacy policy half
the group saw a pop-up of John Kuhn
Wilson's data complete data of this
made-up person john kim wilson they
responded much more strongly to the
privacy policy even though this showed
that they couldn't keep your information
private if they wanted to write so
people respond to benevolence you can
say oh that was just incompetent we
didn't know what we're doing and even
though the risk are I mean it's insanely
different from a risk calculus point of
view but from a risk perception point of
view and from traditional risk studies
it makes sense so one of the things I'm
going to talk about is the dimensions
which individuals systematically used to
evaluate risk I want to talk about risk
perspectives from other domains these
are all physical risk so they're going
to be different in the virtual world
because there's no fear of physical harm
right unless you're genuinely afraid
your computer is going to burst into
flames you're not worried about physical
harm and we think a lot about mental
models because that's how individuals
understand things I don't know how many
times I've heard so many in CS talk
about some medical problem they have and
they say well it's like the processor is
doing this no because you bring the
model that you want and if we can solve
the model for the individual for the
self-similar individual and use the fact
that people are not random but they
repeat the same behaviors over and over
and as well as trying to solve the
problems the network will have
complementary solutions now shockingly
enough despite decades
highly consistent security training that
just teaches individuals exactly what to
do in a computer security context we're
still having problems right how could
that be and one solution is usable
security right we want your need to be
usable and I got to say I'm actually
cheering a conference on usable security
so this is mildly hypocritical but um
use abilities for when you want to do
something right I want to draw the
circle I want to get this piece of
software installed nobody wants to do
risk mitigation right how many people
say I'm going for a drive oh my god I
get to wear my seatbelt yay um so people
want to subvert and minimize or ignore
security right and but you don't want
people to be suspicious of your machine
what we want you to do is really never
enter that credit card number right and
security warnings are irritating to
right I adore is ajar how many of you
guys remember that one I you know um and
one of the things you do with usability
is you make the connection action
consequence right you move the mouse
this way you draw a line there you
accept this the software will be
installed but the problem is what is the
consequence right there may be no
consequence at all because risk is
inherently probabilistic they may steal
your credit card number but they stole
so money they end up not using yours
until after it's expired right you may
enter your social security number and
you may transpose two digits and then
it's no then it's basically useless and
the consequence that action risk
consequence information which you see
people trying to deliver frequently in
warnings is can be completely
overwhelming the other thing is to make
security opaque right security should be
built and not bolted on security should
always be there right and to the extent
that is disabling people trying to
disable it so if you're at an airport
and you're using chrome cm picking on
chrome here I know ah this is what you
get you can go back or you can say help
me understand if you say help me
understand you get yada yada
on a contact your organization's help
staff for assistance in adding a new
root certificate to your computer so
there are two problems with that one I
have heard that people actually have
computers in their houses I know it's
like obviously this new thing that they
haven't been but the second thing is a
lot of people just don't have
administrative access this pops up in
the airport what are you going to do not
use your wireless you know maybe you're
on a different time zone and there's
nobody to answer the phone so this is
this stops action people can't get
things done so they hate security and so
my whole idea is that you want to use
translucent security right it's not
transparent it's not opaque what it is
is context-dependent and if you focus on
the human on everything that your phone
or your computer knows about you you can
guess a lot about context and also if
you bring in information from the real
world that we know in the real world
that we just don't use online then you
can help people to make an informed
decision with a single narrative right
they understand the context and they
understand how willing they are to take
risk so I said something about the nine
dimensions of risk and I'm going to go
through them so offline risk are
inherently physical right car wreck
horrible disease on terrible injuries
people are not going to be really scared
online suppose you can make some scary
horrible interface would you anyway
right so there's a classic nine
dimensional risk perception model the
objections to this is that in later
weren't they moved to 15 dimensions this
is fish off and slow back which most of
you have some of you have heard of I
know two people have heard of it and how
do we use offline security risks to
design security online so i'm going to
introduce the dimensions and then talk
about two different experiments we did
ok so is a risk voluntary or involuntary
do you
choose to be exposed to the risk of lung
cancer from smoking or you just stuck in
the city right so volunteering risks are
more acceptable how immediate is the
result of the harm I love this picture
because I don't know why they're not
dead right I mean it's like standing
jaywalk and like where's my shoes I miss
machine whereas some risk you have a
task that you want to complete and any
negative result of choosing against risk
mitigation the consequences will be
visible later so how much do you
understand the risk right are these cool
um is it you know so suppose genetically
modified crops how do I deal with that
risk am I worried about it is there some
genetic I mean obviously no genetic
modification is going to happen to you
but do you know that what's the
knowledge to the exposed whereas how do
you avoid this risk you don't stick your
hand in it things we don't understand
are scarier and the other is the
knowledge of the risk to science if you
compare for example Sciences
understanding of alcohol versus Sciences
understanding of pharmaceutical
interactions and the more unknown it is
the more frightening it is right people
are not afraid of mixing gin and vodka
but they are afraid of taking you know
an antidepressant and a mood stabilizer
right so this is not voluntariness this
is controllability voluntariness is can
I avoid being exposed to the risk
control ability is if I am exposed to
the risk can I mitigate it right so if
I'm exposed to this is actually um this
was the best car wreck picture I could
fund so you can't control this you
expose yourself to risk in airline
travel but you can't control that risk
you expose yourself to automobile risk
you control it and the more controllable
it is the morning can make people feel
in control the more they take they take
risk mitigation actions right nobody
wants to turn off their okay it's not
really a risk
negation action but pretends that
turning off your cell phone in flight
was risk mitigating nobody wants to do
it because you can't control it anyway
how new is it so of course because of
the trace elements in the massive
amounts of coal that is burned in a cold
facility it actually has higher levels
of radiation adjacent to a cone facility
right and can I say beautiful khatam a
nuclear facility where I worked out of
college this is scarier even though
you're exposed to more proven hazardous
risk out if you live in a coal plant and
how common is it is it something we deal
with every day right so there was a
study done of epidemiologist at a
conference of epidemiologist and only
half the guys wash their hands and knees
are epidemiologist right because they're
just like flu whenever it's everywhere I
can't do anything as opposed to this
this is really rare but it's scary right
you um you dread one you dread being
exposed to the risk the other risk yet
all the time so I had to I had to put
that up there um chronic and
catastrophic I'm not going to dignify
that with a explanation but so many more
people have died in car wrecks but it
you know it's everywhere it's like that
it's similar to common and dread except
for the outcome is not coming is not
dreadful so there are other risk how
severe is the risk going to be and this
is another problem that you get to into
risk communication in computer security
you're not it's not skydiving right
you're not going to be if there's an
equipment failure there it's severe it's
more like this and how many people don't
chop vegetables because they're afraid
their hands are going to cut off so one
of the things we've done is we've taken
a set of virtual risk now I know there's
there's legitimate criticisms of this
and we are redoing it with a lot more
threats and also some made-up threats
because we don't know to what extent
people just answer so we added vamp
and 218 fraud these other main things it
was a convenient sample which means they
were self similar and non-representative
but we did another study with a
representative set of retirees and we
had very similar outcomes a thing about
retirees is they have a lot of money
they are very good targets for fraud if
you want to steal money do you want to
steal money from an undergraduate with
some lovely college debt or do you want
to steal money from someone who just
retired and has three million dollars in
the bank and has less technological
expertise and is psychologically more
susceptible to fraud because of the
normal cognitive changes of Ages aging
so and this was we've done two of these
so our computing risk scary or not scary
well they're not a median they're kind
of chronic they're not dreadful and they
are perceived as being understood by
experts right and then on the scary side
we have the new and not understood by
the individual the things that really
the thing that dominated is severity if
you think it's a worse threat the worst
you think the threat is the morning
respond if it's voluntary or
uncontrollable but people had very
different assumptions about whether it
was uncontrollable or not and what we
did is we did a cluster analysis which
is how people how people's answers were
self-similar how they were grouped and
instead of severity we broke it into
four categories based on distance and we
found temporal impact hugely dominated
there was nothing else that came close
and so we want to make risk appear
immediate which means you've got to make
your warnings not only context dependent
but timely right not at the airport when
you're trying to connect to what is that
horrible airport provider insane go or
something so
and we're never going to make it scary
severity is just not an issue this is
not scary right maybe to Richard
Stallman but do the rest of us we are
hardwired not to be scared of that we
are hard-wired to be scared of some
things a computer is not one of them we
are never going to scare people I'm
warned you in the beginning so computing
won't be scary so mitigation has to be
really easy have to really want people
through this and sometimes mitigation is
really easy don't enter your password
yay but patra machine is a little bit
harder risk information can also be
unpleasant right when you're doing
something in your car and it goes beep
beep beep and you can't make it stop you
don't want your computer to have that
experience and so we're arguing and have
designed for systems that are timely and
targeted personalized and also
actionable actionable is something that
computer scientists forget and people do
try right so this is Rick wash the rest
of it is is my stuff Rick washed in this
amazing study of he went any ask people
their mental models of security and then
he asked him what do you do and he found
you know if it's eavesdropping this is
actually from a a ubiquitous computing
study if you're worried about your
information leaking you have to put your
screen in the right place right and
after that you go bury a live chicken at
midnight facing east right because it's
about the same thing if you think they
just go after the big fish you don't
have to do anything because you're not a
big fish you know whose it's like who's
targeting me I don't you know I'm not
worried about the CIA killing me right
now I'm just not that important that's
the mental model under no mental model
did anyone patch right there's there was
no folk modeled and said I need to patch
my machine zero and and if people
thought it was like a flu ubiquitous
they would update their antivirus
sometime
and the things that we have communicated
as a community is be careful what
websites you visit and don't open
attachments right even if it says I love
you and we have some nice standalone
warnings right this Adelman did a study
of this and found out this is actually a
warning sign that if this is on a
website it is most more likely to
contain malicious code and bad privacy
policies and when I say malicious I mean
spy way or not mount malware so we have
these things I got this off a website
that I really like because they offer
twenty percent off list price of Thomas
the Tank Engine those of you with
children appreciate the importance of
this but it's totally meaningless right
it's a cool lock and then we provide
things oh who's got a pencil quick
compare the fingerprints how is this
supposed in there and they're often
quite ill timed right so how do we do
effective support of risk mitigation I
have three videos on my website that you
can go to and I won't force you to watch
it but basically in the fishing video we
have this guy showing up pretending to
be an IRS agent and he asked you for all
your information and then at the end of
it there are two endings one the guy
gives them the information to he calls
his bank so in the end the messages if
you think it's a website but if you
think it's malicious call your bank and
we use this for older people and they
were all able to describe the risk and
they know what to do right it made it
controllable if they're exposed to the
risk they knew what to do so it was they
found it informative highly
non-technical the the you will laugh at
the video and think it's insane about
not signing up as an admin user because
we're like well you can live in this
apartment or this apartment and the
thing about it is at the end of it
people take away their mental models and
they say oh this is more risky I can do
more things but it's more risky so it's
actionable because it tells them what to
do so one of the things that we've
learned in communicating is that if you
want to communicate to to younger people
you have to say you will experience this
risk this will happen to you you will
die in a car accident if your friend
drives drunk right yet and whereas with
older people you have to say it won't
happen to you you can avoid this this is
how you avoid it so context an audience
both matter and it's got to be limited
it's got to be timely right so we all
know stay away from this barrel now
compared to that to something like this
this website has identified itself
correctly but it can be read by a third
party that pops up every time you go to
an unencrypted page if we did physical
risk communication like that it would be
like barrel barrel you know you drive
down the construction and your car would
be going crazy um which third party
cookies what do you have to enable most
people don't know how to even enable or
disable scripts right click here if you
want to temporarily um enable cookies
but you shouldn't even say cookies right
because they'll be like chocolate chip
snickerdoodle you've got to think of
them as really busy brain surgeons so I
have three models of of participants I
think of elder people who have some
normal cognitive decline but may very
smart I think of brain surgeons who are
very busy and I think of college
students who as we all know are what
they are I clear and actionable stay
away this is a flame hmm this is um I
was so pleased when this popped up like
oh I'm so doing a screengrab it wiped
out everything on my it took out control
of my whole screen and said okay you can
install our software or you can install
our software right most people are not
going to know how to stop a process but
we can see that so here we have
the I Triple E which is a great
organization of what you all should be
members and twitch incidentally but it
you know this is verisign pretty much
you accept it or you don't buy anything
on the web or on this this is on for
website it's the elbonian secret police
you can accept it or not or and these
are all things that this pop-up is
telling you but it's not telling anyone
in any actionable way the computer knows
what the risk is but we're not going to
tell anyone else because they're just
users they're not participating with us
we're not talking to them or this one
this website is a day old it is more
likely than others to be dangerous don't
go or don't enter information and don't
download anything right it's only a day
old how many fake anti viruses there was
a huge antivirus on installation on the
hill when I was there because there was
this banner that popped up on the
Washington Post you guys remember this
and the first thing you do if you work
in DC is you open the Washington Post to
see what's there and it said your
computer is infected download this now
it was incredibly successful it was also
had a certificate that was one day old
right so how do we tell people what to
do you can leave you can stay good luck
right I mean but the thing is when this
thing pops up um you know when this page
was blocked and here's some great risk
language some pages intentionally
distribute harmful software but many are
compromised without the knowledge or
permission of their owners now how
helpful is that right it might not be
their fault well there I think that
that's a very good point because almost
all risk communication has not been
engaged in assisting individuals in
participating with individuals to
mitigate risk it has been engaged in
shifting liability to the user right but
we could we could do better than that we
don't have to think of them as you know
liability eating users the best that's
the goal but that's what what a lot of
stuff does but how can it be otherwise
because and a lot of morning situations
right we can give you know if we know
you know there's three cases something
is no good with no no wiggle room
something's gone bad but don't like the
room part it's great if it's bad we just
pull the plug and you know pull the
connection right if we're really so sure
that we're willing to go all the way to
the Supreme Court to say no this is bad
and I blocked it for good reason there's
no penalty case now i'll be gone wrong
if it's good i just leave you alone
everything we have to message to user is
really a shade of gray we don't know yes
so we know what shade of green is you
know that it might be fishing saying you
can say if you want um or you can say
don't accept downloads right or Google
crew you say roll the plugins which is
not google com that they create when
they create new browser and the first
day it's up Microsoft tells no one you
should download anything from chrome
calm you don't think our lawyers should
be concerned that some companies might
they did not create it the day before
they started distributing it they put a
considerable amount of design thought
and their certificate was not a Dale but
false positives time they do and that's
why you can't do what chrome did right
which is good luck connecting to the
airport wireless you've got to tell
people here's what risk we think you're
taking and here's what you can do to
mitigate it right and oh by the way we
told you to disable plugins your plugins
are still on your accepting risk so go
for it ya know your reserves
application reputation your our
reputation now that's a night but I
think this is actually a huge success
story for for warnings in that we
actually used to be in battle day right
that you get warnings for almost any
site at a self-service so I'm sir or any
downloaded we would say hey download
yeah and that's that barrel the the
happier news story is that we actually
collect reputation on downloads all
across that pie users are downloading
all across
that were able to classify over
ninety-five percent of these things into
as Cormac was saying a good happy bucket
and the bad blood bucket and then the
stuff that we've never seen before and
we have to ask Peter what do we do but
so the great thing here is we've taken
ninety-five percent of the decisions
away from users making us do the right
thing they're always going to be that
stuff so let me hear Damon's and then
I'm going to talk about how to do that
farm percent and when I talk about the
two sisters I just wanted to comment
that Shirley side visor work right back
actually didn't suppose yes but they
exposed it in an in a difficult to
comprehend way like who who cares what
fishing is first of all it's a stupid
word right I mean it's just that we're
going to tell you all about this risk
and we're going to name it fishing well
they thought about naming you know
cancer throat wobbler mangrove but they
decided that it was an optimal um so I
want to talk to you about that five
percent which is the hard five percent
because it's a it's a race right you are
racing to figure out if it is good or
bad um and as long as they can get ahead
of you there is a nice window where they
can commit crimes right so what is it
seven days Clayton and more said seven
days on average before major phishing
sites were taken down malware sites are
a little slower because the phishing
site has a target right you know Bank of
America once it's taken down it gets
taken down whereas malware you know
that's just everybody and some truly
horrific science may be up for months
okay this is a nice and you know I don't
I like Google you know I'm not like
but here we go again malware is
malicious software that may harm your
computer otherwise operate without your
consent right so every second Greiner in
every middle-class goal in America has a
computer and you know you can look at
the computer and observe their behaviors
on the client without like necessarily
reporting to the mothership and figure
out who that is and or you can just say
look don't visit how can i visit safely
or I am risk seeking you know I like to
drive drunk over to my you know
girlfriends house and combine
pharmaceuticals and did you know unsafe
sex you can do it go for it but know
what you're doing umm this is nice
because they have a real domain name
most people can't tell these apart right
it's obvious to you most people can't
tell them apart at all especially since
there are mildly obnoxious people that
are started using that like lock icon
whereas here can you even see these
pictures because I'm having trouble
which one of these is the more
established merchant at which one of
them are you at risk for over paying
significantly and at which one are you
at risk for getting bogus goods you can
see the risk again which one's the which
ones are you going to put your automatic
deposit in um and so we want to give
them one story so I want to talk about
two examples in the first one addresses
yours in the United States we know how
the banks are we know what their URLs
are we know what the banks are um and we
know what they are because we can ask
the FDIC which has an ever-decreasing
available database of the number of URLs
and it's decreasing because of bank
concentration in the National
Association of credit unions if you're
going to a US bank we know it's a bank
why can't we tell people
on site here implies in addition that I
know what the user is about to do yes no
but that doesn't say continue which
means that i can either tell the future
or reminds know what you're doing is
you're waiting for them to enter their
passwords and if you keep an oblivious
copy of their password for their banks
because we know what the banks are and
then they enter the banking password
then you don't have then you can say you
know before we send this password I just
want you to know it's not a bank and
maybe you don't care maybe you have one
password use it for everything on the
internet because it's your internet
password and there are definitely people
who do that because they say this is my
password to the internet this is how I
make the internet work right I mean how
you you probably work in a more
homogeneous environment than I do I'm
going right out there on that limb but I
I have definitely heard a lot of people
say I couldn't do that freshman um the
internet wasn't working or there at the
other desk they're 24 years old and the
Capitol Hill and they would say the
internet is down gene can you fix this
you know that so you have an internet
password and if you want to do that you
can do that you can take the stupid risk
because it's yours it's your choice to
make um or you can say this is a bank
you know you might have other stuff
going on maybe you want to kill some
background processes that you know you
got it the other website that was
unmentionable I would you like to do
this these are empowering messages that
you that the computer knows using
real-world external information what you
want to do and your own history
information and that's so one of the
things we build oh do I have an
unacceptable URLs from you guys know is
oh you can't see my happy face we
actually put a lot of work into this
because we have a lot of international
students and one of our best one you
hire so good call on that I we were
trying to find like colors that make
bad and you know we still ended up using
the colors but it turns out smiling is
universally good and puking is
universally bad so that was ah there are
some universal attributes and we said
well this is a bank this is not a bank
we tested this on undergrads and some of
them kept using it at the end of the
test but of course it was graduate
student code so i crashed hugely shortly
afterwards um so this just requires
variables that that are unique right my
set of friends that I don't tell anyone
and our share in history so if you just
have a group of 10 people what we did
was we wired up a dorm and we did an
entire semester worth of click streams
from the dorm and you guys could really
do this because you have lots of crimp
Springs and you don't have an IRB oh it
just got all excited I and we found that
with just 10 people in your group just
10 self-similar people over ninety-nine
percent of your clicks were previously
covered two sites that had been in
existence for more than a week right if
you take that seven-day mean and even if
we expand it in a little bit to 10 days
you still got 99 percent of your clicks
which is if you only have one percent of
warnings and one percent of risk
mitigation you can put up with that
right here's your uncertainty and if you
do it just by yourself just your own
personal self you end up with about
ninety-five percent and we also did it
in a way that was very privacy
maximizing in there's IBM systems
journal article about that part I you've
never been here before think about that
I mean that is fishing right you've
never been here before that and that's
all you need to know right and nobody
else has been here before and we use
that a lot in risk communication all
these are so crappy and I want to make
good pictures you can't see it but this
is Mogadishu it's an awesome nobody is
here right now nobody is in any of these
places you've never been there right
history is powerful you can use it to
align with people's meant
models and you know one of the cool
things about working with elders they
don't lie on forms none of them reported
in lying on forms they think of it as I
mean and we've worked with at this point
more than a thousand a different surveys
none of them have reported lying on
forms so you know how old they are they
you know when they fill out their
registration card and nobody says
they're 70 right every 13 year old says
they're 18 we have found no incidents of
it you will detect this is not a bang
but it looks like a bag to the user no
we look at um is this a bank yes or no
are you entering your password into
something that's not a bank hey think
that you
because you know what their bank
password is because you know when they
went to a bank so once they've entered a
string that in a bank because we know
who the banks are because we asked right
we took external physical context
information and integrate that into our
knowledge set otherwise we just know if
you or your friends have visited my
first time is a site did you identify
the back you effectively sailor hat or
something off of it text input yeah
mortgage rate yes justin is infected and
then if I go someplace and I enter that
same something that matches yeah dad you
said well wait is he entering something
that now that the site that was not yeah
and then we say this is Gobert because
the second just use javascript to send
each character also by the time
sites are today so how much do we want
to UM yeah but we can hack around that
too right we can keep it locally we can
be natural engineering things you can do
but the question is what is your
overhead during this login you need to
enter a star between each letter that's
gonna be harder to get people to do
that's just physically difficult I mean
I'm not so the difference between this
solution and the solutions you're
looking for in this group and that's one
of the reasons I wanted to come here on
that because I mean it was going to be a
blizzard in it I'm really like natural
exactly been in every kind of natural
disaster except a tsunami and I have a
theory than their places that pay me not
to yeah it was it beautiful sorry this
is all right there yeah the one across
the street air trouble I'll be the best
thing they closed the airport right
after we landed so unlike the last vid
you another example of I'm trying social
engineering yeah let me let me answer
you keyboard yeah you can do that you've
just upgraded our security features
you'll now be typing your your password
using your on-screen keyboard so that
key loggers can't capture your password
so you can come up with a lot of
examples and I have basically three
answers for that one you're looking for
something this perfectly
cryptographically secure right we're
changing the race conditions so they
have to come up with one new social
engineering mechanism and then we have
to detect it and then it's detected
across all the sites right now right now
it's a game that you cannot win no
matter how simple it is because they
have a time period when they're
uncertain and this way you know that
it's not bank you know that it's not
where you work okay and yes they can do
but the more they have to do social
engineering the more they have to make
it unfamiliar the more people are going
to be hesitant because it works because
it's familiar
the more people so you can if you can
just get them like we got the elders we
have communicated to things as a
community don't don't lend attachments
but usually it's don't on down
attachments from people you don't know
one and then don't visit weird websites
right but we all do that so if we can
communicate the only thing you have to
communicate to make this work is if
you're not certain call your bank and if
all the things you're talking about are
things that increase newness people
don't like change and here's what you do
about it yes there will always be people
who will get subject to social
engineering if they're subject and we
don't have to stop it right all we have
to do is make it too expensive to be
really worthwhile if all we did was take
all the amateurs out of um out of online
crime that would be a huge step forward
I mean just think about the net without
amateur criminals on it it would it
would be a different game I'm not saying
and we're changing the rules so we are
totally going to win this game we are
going to win socially harmful I might
argue they're socially beneficial they
raise everyone's thread awareness they
tell us that things are coming before
the pros necessarily adopted
well I think that I disagree with you
and I have never read a paper that can
be if you want to write that paper and
convince me you can but I've never read
it and I think you're wrong so we can
just agree to disagree about that oh
that's funny I was just about to preface
this question by saying we're all
violent
but I think they were real excited flip
over future I think we're all on a grid
I really like the talk because it's
about what most of us in this room talk
to their best muscle Microsoft about
terms of improving user interfaces
warnings do you really have somebody
here his background is in usability or
psychology risk my backgrounds okay but
anyway okay um the heart thing I think
what you're proposing though is the
backend stuff for detection oh yeah it's
hard and that's why I'm I'm trying to
say here's an example of how this is how
we looked at a person and said you're
not a user you're a participant with
your own unique behaviors your own
unique community and we can use that
right we don't really use that now we
try to solve I mean you got to solve the
network problem I'm not saying don't
solve the problem of security on the
network I'm saying first of all stand on
the shoulders of giants and not on there
flipping toenails you know I mean
there's 40 years of risk communication
and pretty much every risk pampam I've
ever seen violators communication
actually try really hard to do this year
at Microsoft what is often part is
having there's up as nothing as
knowledge in context that we as the
system need to have
part of that is like you're saying is
this the user's banker is not the users
bank but they think is and some of it is
easy and some of it is hard and you're
not taking advantage of the easy work I
don't agree with that so I think one
that might be helpful does it think
about it was a 360 list of things for
context you have a few of them up here
like so another thing might be if we
could note from your phone walked into
the fiscal branch of the bank mm-hmm and
that Liz then we can go through the
company and knock it down like well when
just only to have this windows evenings
have this no but we do we do know that
right I mean that what for what I find
frustrating and my point of disagreement
with you is that we we can never know
that for the whole network and if we
didn't know that for the whole network
people would subvert it because it would
be hugely privacy violating but you can
know that on the client you can know
that if you think of a personal area
network as consisting of and this is not
work on presenting here because it's
very &amp;amp; Co it um it's my phone it's my
laptop it's my computer at work and then
if I start deviating from my norm its
detectable right I'm but if you're just
looking at the network and saying we're
trying not that I didn't mean to be
diminutive if you are solving the
tremendous horrific challenge of trying
to identify these things on the network
you're doing this great job you have
ninety five percent of them solved but
the problem that you know I have this
incentive to protect my network I want
to protect like that work help me
just saying having a clear list
saying these old
and put privacy thing box worse which is
very important don't put promising a
bomb I think I mean that is I'm here for
four islands anchoring reasons one to
say we are that is an active area of
research that is my active area of
research I'm trying to figure out not
only how you tell people what their risk
are and how you engage with them and
this is an example of my you know one of
my first efforts in that they said okay
what do you know and then I'm working
with he has no Steve Myers and a pooka
ponniah right and what what what that
project is is your phone ask you for
different amounts of authentication
based on its behavior right so if I
pulled out my phone now and tried to
call my sister I calling for every day
um it would be like oh you're calling
your sister I don't care where you are
but now I know that it's probably really
you right cuz um or if somebody called
up my picked up my phone here and tried
to call the Caribbean then it would say
you really have to authenticate you
can't you can't just make this
incredibly expensive call from seattle
where you never are I mean that the
credit card companies I mean that they
are the masters right visa I had visa
call me on the phone one time when I was
in a store and they said we need to
confirm that this is you because you're
shopping on a Tuesday
and I didn't know that I didn't shop on
Tuesdays right but they did and so when
I went to the eye doctor and trying to
buy you know expensive glasses they were
like whoa and and we have and there's
even more information on a machine but
trying to dispute that's what I meant
about solving the home awful immed
individual in addition to the
heterogeneity problem of the network and
I'm trying to say here are here is what
we know so much about risk and
heuristics and biases and almost none of
it gets into products I mean what did
chrome come out 10 minutes ago right and
almost every one of their warnings is
just this beautiful illustration of how
to violate every single thing we know
about risk communication but computing
isn't unique in that right so there's
this classic article about the steps and
risk communication and you know the
first one is just tell just tell people
the risk and the second one is make sure
we get the numbers right and it goes all
the way down to the seventh one which is
what I'm trying to say is not easy but
we're doing it um engage the individuals
as full participants in the risk
communication if you want to see a truly
epic fail in risk communication you
should see some of the briefings that
people gave communities about nuclear
power plants they brought the experts in
and they explained to them everything
that could go wrong and why it wouldn't
go wrong and people left going Oh
everything can go wrong right I mean is
it the this risk communication they did
in signing for nuclear plants is part of
why this really exploded in the in the
70s because it was such an epic fail
whereas the same communities would be
like oh coal plant great we need power
right they're clean they're not like
nuclear energy which is dangerous and so
like I said that you know there's
there's the big risk analysis conference
there's a huge amount
on this about how to do it and we're
mostly not using it so and like I said
so we talked about this those that have
been previously not been those that are
recent I'll we use the Site adviser to
say this is a bad site and we looked at
why it had been reported and we said
this is a bad site do you really want to
go yes ok will do this is your risk
mitigation option go you know you go
there um and then we tested it with
elders and it was kind of funny because
they were like toolbar killed the
toolbar and so tiny I can't read it the
undergraduates like the toolbar so this
is about context and this is why I
talked about elders we have never had an
elder indicate that they would ever lie
on a forum on the internet right um yeah
it's a difference yeah we have not
engaged in that component of risk
mitigation and even boomers right
boomers are mostly there they consider
it a you know what I talked about
confidence versus benevolence they don't
want to you know they they and you know
people consider computers humans I'm
sure you've all seen that that if you
have to evaluate a computer tutor on the
same computer that the program was run
versus a different computer you'll
people will give them higher valuations
on the computer than it was run on cuz
they no one heard the computers feelings
right I mean that would be mean we both
have checked we've we ok so they report
that they're not lying but the way that
they report they're not lying whoa so
there's this thing called mini
university that brings older people in
and this is why I partnered with a
gerontologist I mean if I have one
message about how to go forward is find
somebody who's been doing this for you
know 20 years in partner with them um so
one of the things I said it's well you
know you lie on forms on the internet
and this this elder woman stood up and
said I am NOT a liar I cannot believe
you and impugn my integrity right and
then I thought I'm really glad that they
don't have metal forks bunny end of this
discussion because you know I would not
be here before you I and not only do
they say they don't lie it in the indie
focus groups that we've had so what we
started out with was he had a series of
focus groups about 8 to 10 people we
ended up with 80 focus groups and so
that was very open and then we did a
preliminary survey and then we did a
thousand people serving right but in
every focus group we have this very
consistent finding they don't lie and I
think that I am more ready to reject the
hypothesis that they are lying because
they would all have to consistently lie
about not lying and they would have have
to lied in the initial class that i gave
with them and vigor and all the focus
group guys would have had to lie and you
know so no no it's a good point rather
than Mars on forums rather than Ashley
why's that there
I think that it would be hard I I think
it would be it would be extremely hard
for you to make a case for the
hypothesis that they lie given our three
years of experience working with them so
I mean it it's possible but really I
would say it's highly unlikely so anyway
they hated the toolbar so we built this
cool little cube that I adore that has
little arrows that you can evaluate it
yourself and then it has two extreme
points 1 it glows bright green if you're
in a known bank and then it gets really
red flashes if you're about to go to a
malware site and i will say that we did
a very small group examination of this
we had five people um because they're
hard to build and so on I one of them
trying to keep it like in this Lane can
i buy this no you can't buy it it's not
going to work next week when we stop
having a graduate student sitting on the
server so that that's you know shows you
the up and down
have you seen the bunnies yeah there's
ambient bunnies and there there's off
and then the seal the seal is fuzzy and
you can use it for yeah we have a lot of
we have a lot of cool stuff in our lamp
you know what we don't have an active
surface and that would be really useful
uh hmm the other thing and this we're
just starting this and uh I can send you
the paper on this about risk at work so
when you look at the insider threat and
you look at common insider threat
training a lot of it goes like this you
see that guy he's probably he might be
our enemy I want you to watch him hey
see that guy i mean a lot of it is
really spy on the other employees right
all of it is organizationally flawed um
and it treats the predominant insider
threat as the malicious insider threat
whereas how did operation buckshot
Yankee happen right I mean were those
malicious insiders no there were guys in
the Pentagon parking lot that said oh
look somebody dropped their USB I'll
just take it in and plug it into my
computer and see whose it is these were
not people who have not had training
right these are people who have had so
much training they're willing to go out
and face death right I mean I'm not big
on facing discomfort um and they still
did this and it was a huge issue and it
was a massively successful attack why
because they didn't think about what
risk they were doing they just thought
about their task right and so we have
this mechanism where we want to inform
employees right what is the
organization's risk posture we want to
figure looked in a way of aligning
incentives and identifying changes in
risk behavior now this is where we use
what I talked about I looking at how
people suddenly change so if you spend
six months or a year as a risk-averse
employee and then all of a sudden you're
just accessing everything
and you've you know something has
changed either you have changed or your
machines ownership has changed and you
can't really solve that on the network
but you can solve it on the machine and
encourage users and enable them to get
the job done so we're doing this with
this risk budget and the thing is it's
this is not a security metrics proposal
all right so we can just not a security
metrics proposal we are only trying to
do order of magnitude risk now the
reason we have the super low risk about
which we pretty much don't communicate
anything or only communicate
probabilistically to try to get them to
kind of change their behavior and the
large risk is because right now you just
get access WikiLeaks the guy who brought
down bearing banks the people at John
Hopkins that stole the information of
10,000 people in three months all of
them would have been detected if you
just had a little counter in there that
said yeah this is normal and we also
have this peer comparison right because
sometimes it becomes normal and if it
becomes normal for everybody at once
okay it's the one is the friday after
thanksgiving and all the sudden all of
your call operators are looking at five
thousand records instead of 12 right you
don't stop an entire class of employee
because the odds of the whole class of
employees suddenly becoming malicious
did you see the onion thing about the
snowman march on Washington to prevent
global warning is same likelihood in the
same so we just say are you really doing
something different alright in orders of
magnitude different and that's where you
get the real insider damage are you kind
of systematically being risk seeking are
you being really risk seeking and the
individual knows this is their job that
person can generally tell usually tell
um whether or not they're emailing
something against policy to the sea
I mean they're obviously social
engineering attacks but they are very
hard to do effectively at a massively
parallel level so you change the
economics of the attack right I or if
they're you know emailing this totally
cool file to their friend because it's
hysterically funny right and the point
is when you kind of you can break the
glass but when you break the glass it
gets audited and if you're really
risk-averse you can say you can break
the glass but will stop your action and
then audit it to make sure it's okay
right so you know when somebody's done
something it's detectable so if you call
my bank fifth third bank they will say
don't you know instead of saying please
hold due to noon they'll say we have
been the victim of a widespread a
phishing attack please stay on the line
so that we can determine if you have
been fished we will pay for you know
this for all but you can detect that at
a company level and the organization can
set these really broad risk goals and
then change them and at least have some
idea about the level of risk they're
experiencing uh we do very simple
budgets we don't we have them expire so
one of the early works on this with risk
tokens is they never expire right I mean
you can work someplace for six months
and you're missed token billionaire um
one of the punishments that's really
organizationally you know like
Microsoft's not going to send you to
Afghanistan if you screw this up oh and
incidentally if you look at continuing
violations of the USB policy in the
military I was the military legislative
assistant for the district that had Fort
Bragg so I learned I even learned like
which songs belong to which branch um a
lot about this they're in Afghanistan
right when are you going to do you sent
them to Afghanistan right I mean yeah
they're going to violate your network
policy you have to come up with another
way to deal with it that is an area
where this would be wildly inappropriate
you're being shot
would you like to accept this wrist
budget so you I mean that's an extreme
context but you need to put it in
different contexts Angeles asses you do
not want to make your currency traders
into your auditing clerks all right so
you have to be careful about it I know
I'm running out of time I probably have
run out of tum 20 minutes ago sorry we
did a really simple example of this one
that you said this is considered risky
one that said this cost you i don't know
if you 18 points right which was like
twenty cents you know eighteen cents in
our experiment and we just took self
similar subjects and um did the
experiment twice yes it was
statistically significant and yes i am
using a chart to show statistical
significance so shoot me i know it's
wrong ah this is how many risk seeking
actions were taken even though they're
you know the information was only
slightly quantified and you know we had
20 subjects in each but it was still
quite significant statistically these
are / subjects the risk budget in this
look you can easily detect whose risk
seeking and who's risk-averse this is
almost like we flipped it with this with
this very simple change one of the
questions is how much time does it take
our regulatory friction was about 4.3 in
this and we made them look at every
decision so you don't want to implement
something that is used by your employees
and it takes twenty percent of their
time they'll disabling also securing
behaviors in bed trust and risk that's
not a new finding translucent security
is not usable security it's not default
security and I'll just go through the
next year this is so this is what we get
in the physical domain this is what we
get in computer science right we can do
better and the
is the that's the equivalent of
smoking kills people try they need help
right but sometimes this I mean thing
about this is such a user cartoon oh my
god the users they're so stupid um I
don't think I need a question slide epic
fails yes you give me anything wrong
optimistic opossums any examples of
things from the industry that um
examples are really good
miscommunication who's done can I get
back to you this yes okay um I can tell
you that almost every industry has gone
through this right the pharmaceuticals
power cars every health domain you know
like the early warnings you know
everybody knows well I don't know we
know don't drink if you're pregnant
right so they started out they did
exactly the same thing this is fetal
alcohol syndrome works like this I drink
only modern amount right but the people
who really drink you know they're like
oh I cut down to a pint a day I never
ever drink up every day anymore so then
they got to them really simple don't
drink when you're pregnant even though
it was I mean it's an overstatement
right have a glass of wine what the hell
you're pregnant you deserve it um but it
it works because the people who are
extreme get the message and and i know i
know i i've been harsh to the industry
on this but in in general every other
industry is done this so isn't not like
computing is unique
that argument applied tell you that you
just say no campaign a smashing success
that's drug policy um it's exactly the
message you just gave right so I will
say to you that it has been successful
in a lot of ways what was not successful
with sis your brain on drugs this is
your brain on drugs with a side of bacon
right um I because and wanted when it's
done is massive drug shifting we have a
tie you which was one year voted best
party school you know what I won't tell
you anything with the jokes we tell
about undergraduates that would be
uncommon especially since we have such
great graduates and you totally make
them all interns um a little bit and uh
they have really changed their drug use
patterns right in the 80s you got um a
lot of ecstasy and a lot of coke and you
know there was a different array of
substance abuse now we have almost
drinking drinking is like the drinking
is ubiquitous and pre drinking I guess
you know pre drinking yeah and that's
they call it pre drinking at IU because
who needs a game um and bingeing has
massively increased so that's kind of
more than a bad risk communication
that's unintended consequences right
because we have very few very very very
few drug bust on campus right and they
will now you know a rest they will now
go to people's room who are on smoking
pot in their rooms and instead of just
the are a sand dune that stinks they
will take action against them so we have
records of these things and they have
changed their substance abuse but they
have changed their substance abuse in
ways that are probably more physically
damaged
so is that a success I don't know I
guess it depends on your your point of
view thank you for coming during the yet
a Seattle snowpocalypse well no the
designs for the underlying system to not
just what the risk communication is but
I wanted to communicate that there are
client-side changes you could make it's
not just happy pictures when we built we
built net trust rain a camilo villegas
built that I mean not and Alex oh so
those guys we have that built all we
have for the insider threat is the
design and the door / proposal we'll see
you later thanks for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
