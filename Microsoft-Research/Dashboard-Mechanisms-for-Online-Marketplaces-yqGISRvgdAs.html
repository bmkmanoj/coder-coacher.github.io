welcome everyone to the last talk of the
day so we're delighted to have Jason
heartline
tell us about dashboard mechanisms for
online markets thank you
so I want to just let you know so my
co-author Alec Johnson is a PhD student
at Northwestern Dennis is a professor in
economics at UVA Wang is a computer
scientist who's at the Shanghai
University of finance and economics and
Ono's uder is the head of data science
at blocking comm this is a project that
we started while Alec Dennis and I were
visiting oh no at looking calm and then
spent a quarter there's au Northwestern
and was able to prove some theorems we
couldn't prove ourselves which was
awesome one of the this is a brand new
paper and one of the reasons I want to
speak about it here is because you guys
are really awesome proving theorems too
and there's some pretty hard theorems
that we got stuck on and weren't able to
finish and so maybe some of you guys can
pick these up and and finish it good so
I want to just I I didn't get the memo
from you've all about not having
motivation so I apologize to everyone
who likes to just start with the
equations I'm gonna have a little bit of
motivation and my motivation is if you
know the greater motivation is it'd be
really excellent
if computer science theory could help us
understand computation than they're
happening all over the place in the
world not just in digital computers and
the big challenge of computation happens
all over the place in the world is the
the to guide that computation you can't
just tell everything what to do they're
going to be basically operating for
themselves and so you the conflation
primitive is local individual or
strategic computation and you can sort
of guide it by setting up the payoffs
but that's what you had to work
okay and you want to make this local
individual or treating optimization
achieve good global outcomes I think a
very important key application area is
what I like to call online markets and I
take that term very broadly to be places
where interactions between individuals
are mediated by some market mechanism
which chooses the outcomes based on some
rules and for an observation I have
which sort of this is something this is
topic area that they're all computer
scientists have been studying for around
20 years and there's a lot of excellent
work here but there's a twist on it that
I think is super important that people
haven't been talking about too much
which is most of these environments
don't allow what's called truthful
mechanisms where the agents have a very
simple strategic choice of just
submitting their true preferences and
the Meccan because everything else
magically so most Mexicans don't have
that property and and there isn't
actually a very well-developed theory
for mechanisms that don't have this
property so that's sort of the space of
this this talk so I want to talk about
start with some basic assumptions of
online markets that are prevalent in a
lot of them and you can think online
advertising if you want but actually
almost all of them have this very same
property okay that is one property is
long-lived agents with persistent values
so if you're thinking about advertisers
and these auctions their value for a
click doesn't really change all that
frequently compared to how fast the
auctions happen okay and you know
probably there's if you knew what the
values the advertisers had you probably
have a pretty good algorithm for
assigning who gets which ads go where
okay so given the values of the
advertisers which are these v1 through
VN you would have some algorithm which
I'll call X which decides how much
clicks advertiser gets okay and probably
this X is monotone so some advertiser
has a higher value you give them more
clicks
okay probably this environment has a lot
of randomization and it's probably
stochastic so probably the amount of
clicks someone get is you increase their
value is a random variable that's going
to be increasing with the value so I'll
think of the number of clicks is a
number between zero and one which is a
probability and there'll be a strictly
increasing function okay in many of
these environments they're sort of
standard what I call non truthful
payment rules and I think the most
fundamental of these is winner pays bid
so you say how much you want to pay for
bid click and you got to click you pay
that amount yeah that's sort of the most
standard and this is I think the most
pervasive mechanism there there is okay
so here's the basic question that we're
going to be talking about in this talk
and that is I'd like to know if there's
a winner plays bid mechanism I'll call X
tilde that takes bids that implements
the desired algorithm I had in mind on
values for all values you could have in
equilibrium okay so in other words when
people have these values they're going
to be some equilibrium in some
implementation I have that I hope gives
me the same outcome as X would on the
original values that's what I would hope
I want to basically get the outcome that
I want in equilibrium X is going to be a
probability between 0 or 1 for each
player like winner pays bid ok so if I
always charge you your bid when you win
you're never gonna bid your value
because then you get 0 utility for that
so you're always going to shade your
value down and give me a non truthful
bid ok so that's by basic setting I
think this kind of scenario applies a
lot and so we're gonna try to see what
we can do in this kind of a scenario ok
I want to give you some context and then
say sort of a high level what the
results are gonna be
so some context looking at winners pays
bid auctions is a literature arm price
of Anarchy that looks at simple auction
rules like
highest bid wins winner pays bid right
so that's also known as the first price
auction if you have one item which has
been studied a lot and if the agents are
substitutes for example if you have some
number of items to sell and you could
sell the each one to any agent that's
agents or substitutes you end up getting
constant price of Anarchy bounds things
like yi / e minus 11.5 8 as your price
of Anarchy bounds if the agents are
complements meaning you can sell to this
couple agents or to this couple agents
but and you but you can't sell to one of
these guys in one of these guys so the
agent sort of complement each other then
you end up getting linear bounds in the
number of agents in terms of your
approximation factor okay I actually
view all of these is impractical okay so
losing 1.58 fraction of the welfare or
revenue is not practical
losing a linear amount of the welfare is
not practical so I want to actually look
at getting essentially PCAST al results
I want to get within epsilon of the
optimal revenue or a welfare okay so
here are some results I'm going to be
talking about a general framework for
answering this kind of a question again
from my previous slide you have some
mechanism some algorithm X you'd love to
implement I'm going to show you how to
implement that when you can okay and so
those of you who know about the BCG
mechanism it's a framework kind of like
the BCG framework a bunch of my results
to be about national mentation meaning i
want to implement the thing in nash
equilibrium so full of formation
equilibrium and in particular i'm going
to show that for multi-unit environments
i have a bunch of units to sell and i
can sell one unit to every it to any
agent then for allocation rules that
look kind of like proportional weights
so think about a single item environment
if i map values to weight and then I
assign the winner with probability
proportional to their weight
okay that would be proportional weights
allocation rule so for multi-unit
varmints in X is proportional weights
you can implement those in Nash
equilibrium and this is sort of a
starting point for us but I want you to
think of it as like softmax I want to
assign the item to player with the
highest value instead I'm going to do a
soft max I'm gonna do like highest value
minus the entropy regular riser and that
would be like exponential weights
exponential weights a special case of
proportional weights so that would be
within our result okay I think more
generally substitutes like a mate roid
feasibility constraint that many of you
have thought about before that's an open
question so I'd love to see people
thinking about that question and you can
imagine like what would proportional
weights mean for meit roads you can come
up with reasonable definitions of that
and ask whether you can Nash implement
that okay and then for complements again
so the simplest setting is I have two
players I can serve and either serve
both of them or I can serve this one
other player in that environment you
can't implement things like proportional
weights which would mean mat player one
and twos values to waste it to some of
those weights over the total weight you
allocated to them otherwise you'll get
to the third player okay so those you
cannot implement not in that intimate
yeah so this is a they're not it's not
orthogonal this is you will see two
kinds of implementations one is Nash
equilibrium and the other one is what I
call persuadable agents okay so what are
my general frameworks one of the general
frameworks is this national iment a ssin
general framework where you can take a
such a twice rule and if it looks like
proportional weights you can implement
it if it's complements you can't like
that's the kind of result you have for
that and then for what I call
persuadable agents which is a new model
that we think is relevant for online
markets you can implement any monotone
continuous such a choice function X so
any algorithm you have that's continuous
so stochastic environment that'll make
it continuous you can implement it okay
so those are that's an overview we'll
see if it's not clear what that means
right now what am I going in detail into
what these means I just wanted to sort
of say sort of where we're going
beforehand okay Nash implementation so
the basic question of Nash
implementation is is there a winner
paste bid mechanism X tilde that takes
bids and implements the algorithm the
outcome you want X in Nash equilibrium
for all values okay in particular the
question is for what X does such an
implementation exist okay so let's have
just some definitions before we get into
this so agents have values we already
said that v1 through VN a winner pays
bid mechanism looks like the following
you give it a bunch of bids from the
agents and it's going to compute for
each player that owned that player's
allocation and which think of it as a
probability that they win or not
so between zero and one and then a
bidder is gonna pay when they win so if
they win with probability x io b then
they pay their bid when they win so the
expected payment is bi of x io b okay
and their utility is they basically get
their value minus their bid when they
win
okay so good I'm talking about Nash
equilibrium and so this is a little bit
strange because in Nash equilibrium
everything is known but I want to
parameterize actually all of the Nash
equilibrium as a function of the
valuation profile which everyone knows
okay so I'm going to write the Nash as a
function of the valuation profile and
I'm going to let this beta function be
the base of the bid function which takes
valuation profiles and says what
everyone is going to play for that
valuation profile okay and so this
function beta the bid function is a Nash
equilibrium for all values D if for
those values B the bid for player I is
his best bid for his utility function
given that other players are playing by
the bid function okay and then X tilde
implements X if X of V is equal to X
tilde B of e good so I'm gonna be
talking a lot about proportional weights
and again as I said I want you to think
single item environment so I can
basically the exes always sum to one so
think single item environment for all
the talk so X I sum the one now you can
choose what those x i's are proportional
weight says I first met values two
weights and then I select winner with
probably proportional to the weight okay
one reason why I like this family is a
very general family of mechanism so you
get to pick the weight function is that
regularize maximization looks like this
and the theory I'm really talking about
is gonna require continuous functions
and so I can't just use max okay but I
want to think about maximizing welfare
and I can put like a regular riser on
that with a very small coefficient and I
could get almost exactly the true
maximum yeah your question about being
truthful X and finding it's a little
for them it's about nothing truthful
allocations to winter phase minute
allocations so um again X tilde
implements X so X is what I'm given have
an algorithm if I knew the values I
would want to run that algorithm okay
okay now I don't know the values and I
have that mechanism that's gonna get
bids so X tilde is my Mexican gets bids
and I would love it for the case that
when people found Nash equilibria for
all values where they found the Nash
equilibria then I ran that X tilde Mecca
if I just get the thing I wanted do you
mean that exists I mean for all okay so
I want uniqueness of this Nash
equilibrium which I didn't write here
but oh yeah just to make sure that they
understand in the definition of feta the
arcamax should it be better - I of P
rather than B - I yes absolutely
I'm sorry about that yeah yeah so V is a
function beta is a function that
requires all of the values to know it so
absolutely that should be a V thank you
okay so the main idea that is used in
both parts of this talk is that I want
to combine the inference that comes from
econometrics in economics which is
looking at bids and figuring out what
people were thinking when they gave you
those bids so economic inference with
trying to implement some outcome and I
want to just walk through a simple
example which is not gonna be what I
want to do but it'll give you an idea
for how you could possibly do this okay
so here's an example two agents and I
want to think about just instead of
starting with X let's just start from
some X tilde some some bid allocation
rule and my bid allocation will just
proportional bids okay so what does that
mean so player one should win with
probability be 1 over B 1 plus B 2 for
two players so just proportional bids
this is actually a standard mechanism
that's studied in the literature ok
and so I want to point out fit if you
give me equilibrium bids that each
bidders first-order condition looking at
their optimization problem is going to
tell you what their value was okay so I
can like reverse engineer what players
were thinking what their value was when
they submit these bids let's just walk
through how that works
ok so agent 1 with value V 1 chooses B 1
to B this Arg max right or this is the
probability that they would win with any
bid be given B 2 is player 2 is bidding
B - okay and notice that when we're
doing an after-the-fact analysis like
we're doing right now we know what B 2
is because player 2 bid B 2 so we see it
okay so equilibrium did must satisfy the
first-order condition which I've taken
the thing and differentiated it right
and I've actually done that
differentiation for you and figured out
what it is and it's this function okay
so you tell me what the bids were hey
there 1 &amp;amp; 2
well now I can tell you using this
function that D 1 is is 5 halves I can
also tell you what V 2 is I didn't
bother to write that down okay so
after the fact I know what the values
are when I run this mechanism so here's
the thing
well now I'm sad right because I wanted
to allocate efficiently instead I ran
this b1 over you know this mechanism
which didn't allocate efficiently right
it we sometimes allocated to the player
with a lower value right but I know the
values and so now I'm sad why didn't I
just give it to the guy whose value as
v1 no match so it's not based Mac so how
did how this one bidder when you make
bid no I mean is there someone no the
other big to be that that's what a
massive every it's so remember we're
full information two players both know
their values they submit the bids we're
just talking about Nash equilibrium let
me talk about Nash equilibrium we never
talk about how we found the national and
we just talk about what the National
River is okay so there's a whole other
literature about how to find it which
actually I will address in the next part
of the talk but for now what's the Sumer
there okay
good so in hindsight our mekansm know
the values exactly well what I really
want is I want to use this idea to well
if I know the values in hindsight why
didn't I just do a good thing in the
first place so that's what I want to do
okay um so here's so this was a little
bit complicated how I solve for bids et
cetera so I want to make it much simpler
on the next slide okay so this is a
standard theorem about equilibrium in
the single dimensional environments that
usually it's written for Bayes Nash
equilibrium or dominant strategy
equilibrium it also applies to Nash
exactly the way I've written it here
it's pretty much the same okay so a
mechanism X tilde and bit function B's
and that shouldn't eat Nash equilibrium
not Bayes Nash sorry I cut and pasted
from slides and I'm gonna just let X of
V here equal the combination okay if
this X is monotone in each coordinate so
X I is monotone in coordinate I bi and
the pavement identity which is the
payment to the player satisfies this
formula okay and usually this additive
term at the end is 0 and I just want to
draw geometrically what this payment mu
says so here are some increasing X I of
V I this first term is this area B I
times X of B right
this integral is the area underneath the
curve so obviously the payment is this
area above the curve the difference
between those two
so do you mentally that's what it is
good so the thing I'm going to use about
this to basically this lets me solve for
equilibrium in winner pays bids auctions
very succinctly because I have two
equations for payments the payment
identity gives me one equation for
payment in terms of the allocation rule
that I want right and the winners pays
big give me another question for
payments payments have to be bid times
allocation right you pay your bid when
you win good so I can use that to solve
for what the
kids have to be so if you tell me the
allocation rule X I'm just gonna tell
you well the bids have to be integrate
the thing do this equation that function
divided by the probability that the
player wins okay good so if you told me
now the X you wanted
I know exactly what bid function hassed
can be the only bid function that
implements that X I already know what
the Eagle equilibrium has to be in a
winner pays bid auction so here's the
idea let's just set X of B X tilde it'd
be equal to X would be inverse of beta
inverse of B just do that two issues
this bid function might not be one two
month it might be multiple inverses
another issue is we're going to find a
game the action spaces need to be a
product space all right so everyone can
bid in some range think of been some
range and the image of beta might not be
a product space right so the inverse
might not might have points I can't
invert because they are named in the
space okay turns out this is actually a
pretty easy problem to fix problem - not
a big deal you can basically find close
enough points to give something
reasonable for everything but no one's
gonna bid those anyway in equilibrium
not always going to bid a real point so
it does it just needs some consistent
way of making sure people don't bid
those weird points okay you can see the
paper for that this inverse is the main
thing that I want to talk about okay and
this is where some serious math is
needed and even more serious math as
needed is identifying when these
functions are one two one two one okay
and let's just go back a slide to look
at the function we're talking about so
beta is payment which is this function
divided by X I so we're talking about
is for what X's mapping you know from
rm20 one to the N is this crazy function
one to one okay so here's a so here's a
cool proposition actually if the there
exists a winner pays bid mechanism for X
if and only if beta is 1 to 1 it might
be pretty obvious to some of you now why
that's true
good here's a cool theorem beta is 1 to
1 if the Jacobian of beta is positive
definite I'm not gonna go into that it's
a famous theorem in this space so all
right so we look at proportional weights
for multi-unit environments so again
think single-item think proportional
wasters so each player has a monotone
function mapping values to weights I'm
gonna get these weights and I give it to
player I probability WI over the sum of
the other players weights okay so the
Jacobian is positive definite and you
can compute the inverse efficiently
which means I can implement this thing I
want to implement for any proportional
weights such a choice function ok cool
compliments betas not one-to-one so I
can apply the at backwards direction I
only have to say I can't implement these
ok and that's because I basically I
can't choose like well there are two
sets of values that map to the same bid
I see only the bids I can't know which
one's the values are and if I choose the
wrong one now we're the player to like
but that wasn't the equilibrium right so
it's not the right thing cool coming
back to evals question I want to change
gear so that was my Nash equilibrium
stuff hopefully you can see what the
math questions are there I'm gonna come
back to them the open questions the end
of the talk here are some challenges one
challenge you've all agents have to find
this crazy Nash equilibria how can they
possibly find that
right and Miller challenges
I can't Nash implement general
allocation rules X I can only do special
ones I can't do compliments but that
kind of sucks alright so I might like to
be able implement far more things than
my mash implementation allowed me to do
okay so here is an idea that we ripped
right out of what actually happens in
the industry in online markets okay you
give the bidders a dashboard that helps
them understand what the counterfactuals
are meaning what would happen if they
put in different bids in with the bid
they currently are putting in so you as
the platform come up with these
estimates that help bidders know what
the bid landscape looks like and all we
have to do is read off that thing and
figure out what is the best bid for
their utility function we'll talk about
that
great good point so I'm going to call
agents persuadable if they will follow
the dashboard if following the dashboard
converges the best response meaning the
dashboard can be wrong maybe initially
when nothing no too much but it better
eventually be right okay so you can't
get people to just will even in BS you
have to actually have to be a good
strategy to follow the dashboard but if
you're wrong initially when you don't
know stuff maybe the agents are happy
thinking that you know more than they do
and it's better than they were to come
put on their own interacting with your
dashboard no these are individual
dashboards but they might be based on
history where you learned something
so anyway well so here's a dashboard
mechanism it's given by two things one
is the dashboard which is a per agent
bit allocation rule and the other is the
bit allocation rule which is a mapping a
profile of bids to an outcome so these
are different mathematical objects which
I tried to make sure was clear here
the dashboard takes each player and
tells you from their bid what's the
probability of winning and the bit
allocation roll maps of profile of bids
to who
okay and here is my historical values
dashboard mechanism which i think is
alone that makes the most sense publish
a bidding dashboard with a bit
allocation rule from historical
estimates of values so I'm assuming you
as the principle have in his horrible
historical estimate of values why am i
assuming that well in step three you
estimate values so maybe you ran this
before and have that space from before
okay I want to solicit bids and I'm
gonna assume they're best response bids
to my dashboard well now I just know
what the values are so now I just plug
those values directly into my original
social choice function my original
algorithm now I want to implement and I
run my algorithm on the true values that
or these estimated values okay and I
charge the winners their bids as usual
in a winner pays bid mechanism okay and
these results are just like super
straightforward if you've amount some
continuous L algorithm then this met in
this mechanism following the dashboard
converges the best response in two
rounds the first round you have no idea
what's going on because you don't have
any estimates and the second round you
know the true values and so you post the
true the X though the the Y tilde is are
actually the true allocation rule for
the true values in the next round and
now we're basically in NASH okay so when
two rounds were Nash okay and so I say
any month of continuous algorithm can be
implemented for persuadable agents by
dashboard mechanism so this is just a
really good idea online markets should
publish a dashboard should assume agents
best respond to them and should then
know the true information and optimize
for the true information but then
publish the dashboard that corresponds
to the true information so you don't try
to fool the agents you give them the
best information you have which is what
you're trying to out put
donation and dashboard he would deviate
that's correct with that that's be a
great question to study still I don't
know what would destroy the correctness
of the duck bordelaise ticking wrong if
they don't believe the dashboard and you
know whatever so this is this is one of
the reasons why so I actually presented
this talk in the opposite order that we
conceived of this stuff we think this is
the right mechanism but this is not a
Nash so when is this the same as a Nash
well when X is like proportional weights
and you can just do the nationalisation
before and have this sort of the
feedback loop in there okay
and so I think it's pretty robust for
settings like proportional weights with
a single item remote the units if not
gonna be so robust like that for a
compliments okay I want to talk about
some connections to lurcher which I
think are important here so one
connection to literature is
implementation theory which is this
general question of what kinds of
functions X can we empower girth of
Zechs can we implement in equilibrium
okay this is a great survey by Jackson
to look up that so that basically this
literature characterizes X where these
unique equilibrium essentially the
calculation is any monotone X is
implementable kind of like my dashboard
result however the mechanisms that come
out of this literature are crazy
impractical mechanisms that you would
never want to ever use whereas this
dashboard is a realistic looking thing
okay and in particular they're
sequential meknes where you interact a
couple rounds in one of the rounds
there's cross reporting so you ask the
agents like agent one to report what
they think agent twos value is and so in
full formation they know and then they
use some kind of like shooting the
agents if they disagree like if agent
one and agent three disagree on agent
whose value you just kind of like blow
up the world right so that's what these
mechanisms doing implementation theory
and so sort of art our take on that is
to get rid of these kind of ridiculous
mechanisms you want to restrict the
space you look for so
like these winter pasted bits mechanisms
where you get bids you can compute any
outcome you want but winners pay their
bids
what can you implement with those simple
kinds of rules and there we gave a
characterization of you need the Jacobi
of the bid function and you need to
understand what that means for the X and
we gave a partial answer for that for
proportional weights the other thing I
think is interesting information design
otherwise known as Bayesian persuasion
and this is an awesome area of the
cheaper and economics are especially
excited about basically the agent has a
prior and they need to make a decision
the prior States the world making a
decision to optimize their utility
there's an informed principle who knows
more than the agent does but once the 80
to make a different possible decision
right so the principle can give the
agent a signal which then the agent
updates their prior will make a
different decision than you would have
before so how can a principle convince
an agent to do what the principal wants
and not what the agent wants okay good
so our suggestion here is we have
something kind of like persuasion we
give a dashboard it just do what they
want based on the dashboard but we have
a more relaxed model which allows the
principle to be wrong at first but just
to be and learn over time but just be
having more information in the agent
does and basically don't be you can't
persuade the agent if something is not
true eventually but as long as the
principles right eventually you can
persuade the agent so I think it's a
more sort of amenable to learning
amenable to CS ideas of model that's
that's in the information design space
so I think that might be interesting
much more broadly cool could the
principal the agents follow these
not in that literature now that
literature is the only thing you have is
you can give them a signal which is
correlated with the true state okay but
in your model which you're free to
change
you want to put inside things in my
model there are already payments which
are you pay your bid now if you have
side payments let me just screw that and
have like a second price rule and I
don't you yeah be careful how you ask
the question okay and again coming back
to this coming back to the first comment
of implementation theory one of the
things that we got we got more
meaningful mechanisms by restricting the
space of mechanisms to something that's
sort of natural so I'm nervous about
letting it go all over the place okay so
again my context I just want to come
back to what I said my results were now
that we have seen what the details are
so I'd like to have a much more
meaningful characterization of what's
implementable besides just saying
proportional weights which seems like a
broad family but it's not everything in
that space I think that we should be
able to implement such a choice rules
like inmate roit environments that say
are smooth versions so a soft max for
like metroid environments i think that's
an open question so we study
proportional weights with compliments
and i'm not saying there isn't something
there that you can do for compliments
but i don't know what it is okay alright
thanks for your attention yeah so i'll
give you two answers it doesn't matter
any monotone function gives the result
that i say you can merge in two rounds
but i think i'm much more relevant the
answer is there is no first round in
online mechanisms not like you turned
google search ads on on dates on day one
and then that was it right so imagine
instead you're running a mechanism in
some new business shows up but you
actually could probably estimate for
whatever bid they put in what
probability they would win because you
actually have all the data from whatever
bid would happen what they would do so
when a new bidder shows up in an on
running rack
you could give them the right the right
dashboard on day one for them actually
there's no large market assumption in
your I have no idea yeah so four
different option mechanisms your bid
function would change and your cannon
function would change but to the
conditions for implementation that's
insane
like okay so you could ask so I I was
talking about implementation with winner
pays bid rules right you can imagine
implementation with like GSP right or
you can imagine implementation with all
pay bid rules okay so one thing I
actually don't like about our theorems
is they're very specific to winner pays
bid whereas I'm sure that the same thing
holds for all pay right but our analysis
wasn't the right analysis that was
flexible enough and in fact I'd like to
have a reduction I'd like to have you
know a theorem that says proportional
values works and if some function works
then putting in any monotone weights
instead of values works also right I'd
like to have a composition theorem about
that instead and I think that would
actually be a good step to getting
things like all pay for free from an
analysis of first price for things like
GSP I want to that's hard to talk about
because doing the revenue equivalence
calculation of what payment the
characterization are that's you can't do
that that care can I did on the first
slide when I talked about winner pays
bid auctions you can't do that for GSP
but one thing you can do is if you look
at our dashboard mechanisms if so what I
know about the Google Dashboard for at
auctions is they just give you a cost
per click curve right they say you paid
this much you get this many clicks
that's actually a winner pays bid
information so even though the auction
is GSP they give you winner
bit information and then they just say
well what bid is it that gets that cost
per click and then you can put that bit
in and and that be your GSP bid right so
you know if you publish your dashboard
as winner if k's bid and there's a
language that maps those bids into bids
that you would actually put in that's
then sufficient to implement these
dashboard mechanisms and so doesn't
really matter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
