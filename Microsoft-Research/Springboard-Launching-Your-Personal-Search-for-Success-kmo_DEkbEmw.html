hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
hi everyone thanks for being here today
my name is Raj at Sur car I'm a PM on
Windows and it's an honor for me to
welcome Richard shelf to the Microsoft
Research visiting speaker series a quick
introduction for him as the Wharton
School Thomas Garrity professor of legal
studies business ethics and management
Richard shell has won almost every
teaching price the school has to offer
he's also the author of many books
including the one he's going to be
talking about today springboard
launching or personal search for success
the book is based on work on his Wharton
course surveying what history's greatest
thinkers have to say on the subject of
success in life I had the good fortune
of taking the class back in my time in a
wharton and i have to say it was by far
the most impactful class i've taken in
my life so I'm really excited that he's
here to share those teachings with you
today through his talk into his books so
please join me in welcoming
professorship thank you thank you thank
you and thank you for coming it's great
pleasure to be here on such a beautiful
day and to share some thoughts about one
of my favorite subjects and to see if we
can get a you to have a few thoughts on
this subject because the underlying
theme of everything i'm going to say is
that no one can tell you how to succeed
no one can tell you what success is
because it is your journey your
definition and your capabilities that
are the secrets one of the best-selling
success books the modern age is a book
called the secret but but i've read all
the success books if any of you you know
can come up with one I haven't read I
want to hear about it because I've spent
the last 20 years or so reading every
single and I can get my hands on and
having read them all I can tell you for
sure there is no secret although we all
wish there was one you know wouldn't it
be great if you already to do is think a
single thought and then everything would
like light up doesn't work that way so
you have an assessment in front of you
called the six lives exercise it's part
of the talk so I encourage you to take a
minute and to review it there's six
little paragraphs and they're just six
stories and the idea behind the
assessment which is in chapter one of
the book so it's just part of the book
is for you to read those six paragraphs
and then rank those six lives from
number one to number six most successful
number one Lisa least successful number
six and the only rule is you can't have
any ties they have to actually have six
different numbers and a little later in
the talk I'm going to refer to this and
ask you you know who ranked which one
number one or number six and that might
give us some interesting comments from
you guys about what's going in your mind
when it comes to this activity of
conceiving of success and I think you'll
be interested to hear what some of your
colleagues have to say about their
choices so so if none of you have done
the exercise that part will be very
short so I hope that some of you can
turn to it nothing I say here at the
beginning is more important or more
interesting than what you think about
those six lives so so feel free to
immerse yourself in that little exercise
it only takes about five minutes while I
do my little setup here and then and
then we'll eventually get to the six
lives so as far as I said my talk and my
book is based on a course and it's a
course I've been teaching in wharton
since 2005 it's called the literature of
success and so it's surveys of all of
the best success literature that I could
come up with and has been modified and
changed over those 10 years by the
students so currently you know we read
Aristotle Plato epictetus the handbook
for life the best-selling book of the
Middle Ages and work our way all the way
up to Sona Sona my yours recent
biography
the Supreme Court Justice about her life
her memoirs and in between Stephen
Covey's hybrid highly seven Habits of
Highly Effective People and Mary Kay
ashes miracles happen and so it's a
really a course in challenging the
students to come up with how they view
all this literature but at the end they
have to write a paper it's called my
fill in the year 2014 was this year's
papers my 2014 idea a theory of success
and how I plan to achieve it and so I i
created this course because i was
looking for what I would have wanted to
take when I was a senior college to help
me think about these questions in a
systematic way and the goal of the paper
is not actually provide them with an
answer even for their own lives because
no one at 22 knows what success is even
after they brought all the books right
but it is a reference point for them to
look back on 10 years later and say so
that's what I was thinking about when I
was a senior in college and it also is
and I think this is the most important
thing and this is part of what I'll do
in my talk I try to help them learn to
think about success for themselves so
that when they reach different points in
their lives different nodal points
different decision points different
stages of their lives they'll have a bit
more structure to what it is that the
problem looks like that they're trying
to solve so they can solve it more
wisely for themselves so it's really not
a course in what success is it's a
course in how to think about what
success is and that and that that that
process changes at each stage of your
life you will discover that you have
different experiences you're bringing it
to that decision different relationships
that are part of your life when you make
the decision different knowledge that
you now have that you didn't have
earlier that you can bring to the
decision about what success is so you
change your definition as you move
through the years and so how to think
about it's much more important than
having an answer in my view
all answers are provisional so this is
the the motivating question every one of
us at different stages of our lives has
to ask this question what's next and
what's next for college grads is real
easy what's next is their first job and
that's a big consider that a fairly
momentous decision the first job out of
college it actually turns out not to be
that important the the first I once had
a friend of mine I'm from a small town
in southwestern Virginia Lexington
Virginia and a friend of mine is a
doctor that a doctor in town who I went
to you know elementary school with said
actually you know the most important
thing to do after college is keep
learning and the first job is just
another chance to do that in a different
way so I think that that's absolutely
the case but it still seems really
important since you've worked for what
is it 16 years by the time you get to
graduate from college in doing only one
activity mostly taking tests getting
grades that hey I've got a head you know
this is going to be it i'm going to get
my job and then life is over you know
done one and done but it doesn't work
like that so what's next is the question
that this book is about and that that my
course is about so how do you answer it
I've got two ways to help think about it
the book is divided in half the first
half asks you to consider what for me
does this word success mean and they're
different chapters that give different
assessments like the one you just took
and then the second half of the book is
well having decided some thoughts about
what success looks like how will I
achieve it and the I is very important
because everybody will achieve whatever
their goals are in many different ways
mostly the success literature tells us
to do it the one true way visualize set
goals network and me there's a book for
every tool and of course those tools are
toxic in the wrong hands I don't know
about you but I know some people who set
so many goals every day they don't have
time to do anything else except set
goals
and if that's the case they shouldn't be
setting any more goals right I mean
that's not the way to success for them
they need to do something else and
there's some people who can't help
themselves they network with everybody
they meet on every elevator and the day
right and so they really don't need a
book on networking they probably need
something more on relationships and what
meaningful talk looks like so so
everybody's got different capabilities
different automatic success practices
but everybody's different so the second
half of the book has assessments in
questions and things for you to sort of
test out what are your special
capabilities to lead you down the path
that you want to go for yourself we
picked up there's a big paradox when you
start talking about success we pick up
most of our messages about what success
is from outside ourselves schools
culture media family but in the end you
have to define it for yourself and so
the separation of yourself from all that
hypnotic messaging that came in at times
when you weren't fully aware that it was
even being put in is very difficult
waking up essentially from the dream of
your parents of the media of your
culture to define this word for yourself
is not easy it's almost as if you feel
obsessively compelled to keep performing
on metrics that you've been handed and
that in a Pavlovian sort of way you've
been rewarded for achieving for a long
time students especially Ivy League
students are very practiced at a very
narrow range of success practices they
learn how to take standardized tests
they learn how to set out what a course
is going to require to get an a figure
it out perform to that and then do it
with the least amount of work and then
and move on to something else and it's
sort of dangerous because when you've
gotten really good at something as
defined as that what happens when you
start choosing what employments it take
you start choosing employment that will
reproduce that success system so you'll
be easily evaluated according to metrics
that you can see around you and then
have that little charge that you know
you're ok still because you're still
checking boxes that others recognize so
so getting away from whatever you've
been rewarded for is hard it takes work
thought inhale it helps have friends
helping you to do it with their similar
commitment to doing it so so it's really
it's really important and it's not easy
so why this book and why am I so
interested in this well in my own life I
had what you might call a kind of
complete breakdown of my success system
in college my dad was a general in the
Marine Corps he then had retired from
that was president of the Virginia
Military Institute which was his college
it's a military school in Virginia his
father had been a career military
officer my mother's father been a career
military officer my sister had married a
career military officer so there was no
doubt in anyone's mind where I was
headed I was headed for I got to choose
Marines our Navy that was about it and
so so for me I never even gave it a
second thought I was raised in the
service we moved every year and every
single grade I was in first second third
fourth fifth we're in a different place
from Hawaii to France huh carolina
norfolk and it was just the way I
thought everybody lived and and it was
you know just my world so when it came
time to go to college I sort of broke
the mold a little I I got into Princeton
so rather than go to Naval Academy which
was the prescribed journey or BMI which
was you know okay too I just I got an AV
scholarship so I got an AV scholarship
free ride to go to call
join the ROTC and march around on you
know fridays and they paid for my
education and I I would then be a career
military officer that was the deal so
everything was going great until my
sophomore year when the Tet Offensive in
Vietnam was launched by North Vietnam
the United States escalated its
commitment to the Vietnam War in a major
way and all of a sudden all over America
campuses erupted in protests
demonstrations all kinds of activities
that called into question the war and
the military and so for the first time
in my life I was called to ask myself
what had I actually signed up to do
there was this sort of rude intrusion
from the outside world that I didn't ask
for that said we'll wait a minute why
are you doing this what is it what's
involved in it are you okay with it and
when I when I came to think about it
which I had to do I found myself between
a rock and a hard place because I came
to the conclusion that I had no quarrel
whatsoever with a Vietnamese people and
I had no interest in going over to kill
them so that was pretty easy to figure
out but then at the other hand I had my
entire family legacy and my commitment
with the scholarship and my whole life
was directed toward doing precisely what
I now saw to be immoral and so there was
just just collision between the cultural
norms that I assume success look like
and the reality of what that turned out
to be and so after some long and default
difficult thinking I decided to resign
the scholarship and become a war
resister and a pacifist now you can
imagine the call when I had to tell my
dad that I had made this decision and it
was a big moment for me I wrote a little
speech I practice it you know and I made
my phone call and explained that i would
going to be turning away from my entire
family history and I joined the war
resistance movement and he listened and
then he said there's a little pause and
then he said three words are you sure
and I was absolutely not sure there was
no way any 21 year old could possibly be
sure that they're making a call that's
going to be the right call about
something like that but I had to be sure
with him that night and so I said yes
I'm sure and that one word essentially
cut the narrative court of my life I no
longer had a past I no longer had a
story I no longer had a job I wasn't the
product of some journey that was going
to continue into the future I was just
it was almost like I'd parachuted into
Princeton with with no identity and so
it was a pretty like vertigo and so from
that day for about 17 years I had to
think about it to figure it out it took
a long long time I didn't start working
as an assistant professor at Wharton
without tenure until I was 37 so I took
the long way around but of course
because it was a long way around and
because I had no choice but to do it I
learned how important it is to ask those
questions and to go to the core of the
answers for yourself and not try to put
them off not try to finesse them not try
to fake it just go there and figure it
out so I became a social worker in
Washington for a while I was a as an
alternative service for the draft i
worked with poor families and condemned
buildings that of course was the second
culture shock I'd left I've gone from
military to pacifism and now I went from
Princeton to the ghettos and
want to prepare me for that disconnect
but and I finally just gave up it was
all too much for me and I had saved
three thousand dollars and I got a
one-way ticket to Greece and decided i
would just travel and figure it out and
my only commitment to myself was that I
won't come home until I figured out I'd
stop talking to my parents I'd stopped
communicating with anyone in my family
it was gone and it was a tough time so
as those I took two years on this round
the world trip we just followed my nose
you know wherever it went and ultimately
discovered what I was looking for in a
Buddhist monastery in sri lanka where
they welcome to people from the west and
i lived there for a while and was taught
by a wonderful monk named venerable
civilly who gave me the opportunity to
live a very different life but one that
really forced me to just observe what
was really going on inside myself in a
very disciplined way and then went on to
another buddhist monastery ins have
korea where i actually met his end
master who asked me to but wouldn't mind
changing my journey and just stopping
there and becoming a monk so that was a
career decision monk or home I didn't
still know what I wanted to do when I
grew up but I did have enough self
knowledge by then to know whether I
wanted to be a monk or not and the
answer was no I needed to go home and
straighten things out with my family so
so I made my way home my parents god
bless them were both still living which
was a great miracle they welcomed me
home prodigal son they'd never stopped
loving me and I got to know them so I'd
left the country with a general and his
wife as my parents and I came to know a
mom and a debt and lived in the basement
for two years selling insulation
door-to-door in rockbridge county so as
i was about 29 by the
time so if any of you are like around 29
or younger you're way ahead of me so
finally went to law school because there
was something that something I could do
to make money that was more interesting
than selling insulation and and then
discovered in the middle of law school
something I would wish on anybody and
everyone it was a moment in time now I'd
earned it by this time I've been
puzzling this question what should i do
was like a Zen co on to me and I was
sitting in a law school classroom at the
University of Virginia with 150 students
poised on the edge of their seats with a
professor in the front telling us about
the deep mysteries of contract law
doctrine and everybody was like like
this and I was like this waiting to
raise our hand and I had an out-of-body
experience I drifted over myself and I
looked down at myself and I looked down
at this classroom and suddenly like a
bolt of lightning I said I know exactly
what I want to do I want to be that guy
in the front of the room so that's what
that's where I've been going ever since
how do I figure out how to be a teacher
and so I found a job at wharton made my
way through the process you're lucky
enough if you have an academic career to
invent what you do especially at a great
school like warden so every course I now
teach I've made up the success course I
majored in English in college I'm a law
professor so I figured out how to teach
an English course in a business school
with a law degree we read Death of a
Salesman in that class so so why this
book because I think it's so important
for people to open the door to their own
futures by thinking in a careful
systematic personal authentic way about
who they are and what they ought to do
and it's worth the effort and it's a
hard
hard subject because there's so many
people had the answer for you but really
the most important thing is to ask the
question and then learn a little about
how to answer it not what the answer is
so we don't do much to help you guys in
elite education Emerson once said
Harvard teaches most of the branches of
learnings and throw his friends said yes
indeed all the branches and none of the
roots and education really doesn't do
much of a good job some do and some of
the Catholic universities like a Notre
Dame they work pretty hard on helping
people discover ideas about what their
vocation ought to be it's a kind of
Catholic concept of vocation but in most
schools they just hide this it's
relegated to career services and you
know about career services there are
nice people in career services
overworked underpaid and harassed and
all they end up doing is is is managing
the information session for people like
Microsoft and Google and Bain and you
know Mackenzie so that they're all the
recruiters are comfortable and all the
students line up and then there that's
all they can do if somebody comes to
them and says what should I do with my
life the career people go well I don't
know maybe you should go talk to the
psychotherapist there down the hall you
know it's almost as if you're a
pathology not to know what it is you
want to do but i'll tell you a secret
nobody knows nobody knows in my very few
ten percent fifteen percent of students
know what they want to do really they
know what they're going to do they know
if they've been told to do they know
what everybody else wants to do and so
they want to do that but they don't
necessarily know what they want to do
and if you scratch them a little bit
they'll admit that they don't know what
they want to do but we haven't given
them too many tools to help them get
past that uncertainty because right
behind the door of uncertainty is a
little pool of fear and people close the
door again they don't want to go to the
fear part so at Wharton we've got a new
program we just started by 300 MBA
students are doing it now where they
themselves are facilitate
groups you could do it here but they
take springboard they read a chapter a
week for eight weeks two hours a week
talk to each other in a small group of
six people and share what they're really
thinking what they're really uncertain
about what they really ought to be doing
experimental little Auden once said how
do I know what I think till I see what I
say so sometimes when you hear yourself
saying something I said that wow that's
interesting maybe that's what I should
be thinking about i have another
correlator that how do i know who i am
until i see what I do how do I know who
I am until I see what I do so if you
want to know who you are just look at
what you do every day that's who you are
and guess what you can choose to do
something different and then you will be
someone else so it's really a question
of choice action and your identity
follows you don't have to have the
identity I'll figure it out in order to
be something just do something different
and the identity will catch up with you
so here's a quick little diagnostic
we're going to do this and the six lives
thing before I'm finished but you know I
think it's sometimes useful someone at
Microsoft others design an app for this
it would be something that you could
carry around with you and on a given day
on a random moment it would be you to
put your dot in one of these cells and
ask you well how is you how are you
doing as far as achievements concerned
and you get to rate yourself and how are
you doing as far as satisfaction is
concerned and you get to rate yourself
and then you get to see what you're
dissatisfied with are you just satisfied
with your level achievement you just
satisfied with your level of
satisfaction and whatever you're
dissatisfied with that's the compass
move in the direction of improving it
but notice there's always trade-offs you
can have all of one without some missing
part of the other and so it's like
navigating on on water you know you guys
forces that you have to to manage at the
same time to get you
where you're trying to go but it's a
pretty good sort of way point taker you
know you can kind of point yourself well
I do this at warden and I'll just give
you a couple examples of what can happen
to people senior people when they don't
do this enough check to see whether
they're on the right path there's a
program for senior executives called the
advanced management program which has
people from all over the world about 55
a couple times a year and I have a day
with them on success and I did it a few
years ago and there were a couple people
in the room who were actually honest
enough which I thought was a kind of
very very open of them and it's a good
learning community so they learn to be
pretty candid they put their dots here
in the low satisfaction high achievement
cell very few people that they always
stick in these four and so I asked him
what what's up with those two those two
people so one I'm raised his hand said
well I'm the CEO of a major you know
global 500 company i'm the CEO not of
the whole company but north america and
so big big responsibilities I've
achieved way past any expectation I ever
had in my life about where I would end
up this is just you know a wonderful
gift that I have this position and I
said well that sounds pretty good why
did you put your cell here Milo
satisfaction he said well I as I was
sitting here this morning thinking about
this I realized that for the last three
promotions I've gotten each one has
taken me further and further away from
what I actually love to do and so here's
someone who's in a career and has sold
themselves to the career they was either
be promoted or leave they didn't want to
leave they had other things that were
keeping them there and so they just kept
promoted and promoting themselves away
from satisfaction turns out he really
loved logistics efficiency factories and
as he got promoted he got further and
further away from running anything that
had anything to do with efficiency and
mostly it had to do with politics and
regulation you know a corporate
backstabbing and whatever
up there so it wasn't a happy guy so you
know his job was to okay not now I
figured that out now that's
dissatisfaction let's move myself in a
direction where I'm closer to what I
love to do the other guy was 35 years
old he was a youngest lawyer in
Argentina ever to win the prize the
country goes to the best lawyer so
here's a very young person top lawyer in
Argentina and I said well
congratulations it sounds like you've
really you know achieved notable success
in your achievement category why so low
in satisfaction he said well it's pretty
simple I hate law so now there's someone
who's been rewarded for doing something
that he has a talent for and get paid
for but he forgot about the enjoyment
part and just went down the trail of
getting paid to do something hated to do
and if you do that for a long time you
will burn out for sure I mean to do you
have a choice between a life of
satisfying work and a life of work that
you are good at that you hate choose the
lower-paying satisfying work and you'll
live longer you'll be a better friend to
people that need you you'll be a better
parent to children if you have them
you'll love better the partner that
you've found life will work a lot better
if you choose the lower compensation
with a higher satisfaction than the
higher compensation with not not lower
I'm you know you have to hate law in
order to get to this test but but you
know don't leave satisfaction behind as
a criteria so that's just it you know
all of you are different stages of your
lives but that's what can happen if you
suddenly wake up one day and you're
honest about it what's really going on
and it's a wake-up call so these two
dimensions of success that the book
talks about and that you really discover
soon as you open the lid and lick in the
box outer success achievement
recognition celebrity fame fortune and
internal success happiness and of course
if you ask most people off the street
what do you mean by the word success and
without much thought they'll say well
tap
you know I'm happy I'm successful but
we'll see in a minute that that's really
just shifting from one uncertain word to
another because happiness turns out to
be just as hard to define a success does
so you haven't really solved the problem
by simply saying happiness is the answer
you've just introduced a new puzzle so
we'll talk about that in a second so
external success the problem with
measuring yourself on this and this is
sort of famously known but seldom
followed is that it's always relative
wealth is any income that is more than
the income of one's wife's sister's
husband so doesn't that sort of give you
a problem if you're going to measure
your success in well then you better
pick a poor community to live in because
you'll always be dissatisfied because
someone will have more than you hungry
ghosts is another thing can happen for
people who are motivated by external
rewards The Hungry Ghost is a buddhist
deity actually not deity as good
glorious word it's a Buddhist entity
that's in an afterlife and this is what
you get to be reborn as if you live a
life of shameless service to your own
appetites so you've been nothing but
satisfying cravings all the way through
your earthly life and then you get
reborn and you get reborn as an entity
with the body the size of an elephant
and a mouth the size of the head of a
pin and so for the rest of eternity you
try to feed yourself with this tiny
little mouth in this gigantic body and
you can never ever cure the torment of
hunger pretty brutal but think about it
I bet you know some of these people
already hungry ghosts are people who
wake up every day and they have to start
all over again proving that they're
important or start all over again trying
to get attention or trying to get more
money or trying to get recognized
by their audience whatever it is and all
they do they end up with this little
empty bucket every morning and they
spend all day filling it with praise
that they can find or the attempt to
find it and then they wake up the next
morning their buckets empty again so
then their whole life is consumed with
seeking external validation for their
existence said but it's very common so
that's another problem with external
successes as you end up as a Hungry
Ghost we have some Wharton alumni who
have fallen prey to this Raj Rajaratnam
recently went to jail for the largest
insider trading program of the last
century he's a class of 82 Wharton grad
he was worth over a billion dollars when
he was indicted and tried and convicted
for insider trading what could that be
about you have a billion dollars and you
still don't have enough and he brought
the head of Mackenzie along with him so
they're both in jail now they had a
Mackenzie I mean if you got a warden and
scratch any of the students they say
well where'd you like to work Mackenzie
sounds good i'll work at McKinsey well
here's the head the global head of
Mackenzie's in jail Hungry Ghost hungry
goes couldn't get enough and so they may
have less freedom than a homeless person
you'll meet in the subways of New York
pretty amazing sometimes you picked the
wrong pond I think everybody is entitled
to pick the pond that they're in but
sometimes you pick a pond that makes you
feel inadequate less than the best
always questioning your own abilities
because everyone around you is more and
that can be very discouraging so you
pick a pond that doesn't actually
recognize your talents because there are
so many people around you that have more
of those and then you become discouraged
and then you become unmotivated and then
you don't use your talents so if you
took a different pond smaller pond
different pond that would use and
recognize your unique gifts a little
more readily you'd bit more motivated
you'll feel better you'll achieve more
so you may pick the wrong pond sometimes
people get to the okay platts
it's like a bar the okay plateau the
okay plateau is a place where
everything's okay and the problem with
being in a place where everything is
okay is that it's hard to change
anything because if you change anything
it may not be okay so it's not the
excellence plateau it's not the
happiness plateau it's the okay photo so
it's a dangerous place to be because you
become risk averse and you spend your
life playing defense against
opportunities they keep coming at you
and go yes but and then you stay on the
okay plateau another day it's like
having a used car that's just not quite
ready to get thrown away and then
there's a metaphor problem and I'm going
to have to a test for you before we're
concluding and the fruit this is the
first one I think it's important is a
simple assignment you can take a home
and think about with your friends or
your loved ones what's your metaphor for
the type of achievement you need to be
doing what's your metaphor for the type
of achievement you'd like to be known
for this is the usual metaphor for
success it's a ladder right and you
climb the ladder one rung at a time you
go from whatever the lowest is to
whatever the highest is or try to go
there notice something very interesting
about this it's a very lonely ride up
that ladder and also it suggests that
everything is easily defined so this is
the school metaphor this is the problem
with school if you go through college
you get into the great go through high
school get into the great college going
to college get into the great grad
school go to grad school getting great
firm getting firm getting a great you
know partner in the firm you know then
what you may have realized after a while
that what you've really been in is a
pie-eating contest and every time you
win the contest the prize is just bore
pie
that's the problem with this little plan
ah so is that your metaphor you know
sometimes it's really important to
realize what you're working with and a
lot of people work with the ladder it's
buried in there it's like a little
programming glitch that got put in very
early because what's the first thing
people want to know when you're at a
party with people you don't know what do
you do and what do you do in America
usually means well I do something
important or at least cool and and then
very well there you are on the ladder
and so everybody gets to go I see you're
on wrong number 12 okay good well I
happen to be on 13 you know so we got to
compare ourselves so you know there's
something to videos it's a career
metaphor just realize this limitations
it's a career-ender floor here's one
that I like for myself but I think the
challenge is for you to come up with one
of your own so think about this this is
a pond and there's been a little pup
somewhere in the middle that's an act
and then it has influence on others and
so one way to measure the achievement
might be how many positive influences
have you had on how many people
throughout your life because every
positive influence you have on one other
person they're going to have some sort
of influence on their network and so how
far do your rings extend that's a
different metaphor not about climbing
it's a little harder to talk about at
the cocktail party now well my rings are
about this big you know but but I think
it points to a different goal and that's
what I'm thinking about maybe your
metaphors a light bulb and you want to
be inventive and create things that that
make life better maybe your metaphor is
a hand that's on someone comforting them
and you're measuring success by the
people that you can comfort with with
hand to hand my person-to-person
connections I don't know it's up to you
but I think it's important you have a
metaphor for what it is you think it's
worth achieving before you decide what
success is so that's your homework find
your own personal matter
for for the kind of achievement you
aspire to in your life you do that
you'll be right on the right path if at
least beginning your mind will start
working on it mine loves images images
are simple compelling a memorable it
will start moving that way all right if
you're going to do success on the
happiness trail then you better find out
what happiness is and that's the problem
happiness is very hard three kinds of
happiness I work with a positive
psychology center at the university of
pennsylvania party supplement his guys
they've studied happiness upside down
side side ways every way and this is
basically the conclusions they've come
to you can define happiness as a
cumulation of many positive mood states
so when someone says were you happy
today and you think back while i like
that corned beef sandwich yeah i was
happy today problem with that is they
tend to average out and different people
have different genetic set points for
the degree of positive moods that they
can experience so some people have a
sort of high level of a setpoint and
their their high is really exciting
lehigh but their low is well above what
the person in the next cubicle has is
their highest high because they're down
there at a different set point and for
them life is a question of being
realistic you know we have research it
shows that people who are more
pessimistic are actually more accurate
and describing the reality so that's
what gets you pessimistic as you
actually see reality the way it is dan
gilbert who's a psychologist at Harvard
we're terrible forecasters of what's
going to put us in a positive mood state
or a negative one we stay away from
things we fear that wouldn't make us
miserable and we try and try and try and
try to get the things that actually
don't make us very happy and so it just
turns out that way we're just bad at
forecasting the future when it comes to
our own moods so if you run your life
predicting that you're going to be happy
and so you do this that the other you're
always going to end up about half the
time going didn't make me happy you know
Ripoff want my money
ah but it's not it's not realities fault
it's your fault it's a bad way to
measure what to do it's a flawed compass
you're using another way to think about
it is there sort of retrospective
evaluations where are you happy when you
were at Microsoft you know this 20 years
later you're looking back you know from
your penthouse suite having started your
own company and everything's working
great where are you happy at Microsoft
well if you're in a good movement when
you ask the question you'll probably say
you were a little happier than if you're
in a bad mood when you ask the question
so our current mood affects our memories
of the past in a huge way and if that's
the case how flawed is that as a measure
because I could just give you a
chocolate chip cookie if you like
chocolate chip cookies and you'll have a
much rosier view of whatever it is I'm
asking you about not a reliable metric
and then we tend to emphasize peaks and
ends more than the rest so you may have
a net net happiness you know total
happiness experience at three out of ten
but during that period of time the 20
years you were at Microsoft there was a
time when you were a 10 and near the
very end it got good again and so you
were a 10 again when you look back you
won't average to tens against threes
you'll say and was probably an eight
because you're just going to focus on
those two points and extrapolate from
those to the rest it's a very flawed
cognitive process and then finally
there's this which I recommend we should
all have lots of deep happiness names
for this include joy this is a receipt
ilion term eudaimonia which means
thriving flourishing sim caza hebrew
term normally means ordinary happiness
like you know go to a wedding be happy
but a rabbi that one of my students
brought to my attention wants to find it
this way simca is the feeling that comes
when you're doing what you should be
doing the feeling that comes when you're
doing what you should be doing now that
may be the feeling that comes when
you're sitting with someone who needs
comfort or when you take time out of
your day to to work on something that's
actually very
difficult but deeply satisfying to you
that's not happiness like smiley face
very often is happiness in a way that
follows suffering sacrifice experiences
where your devoted to a purpose larger
than your own survival or your own
positive moods so that's worthwhile but
it you know doesn't really sound like
happy it's something else and one more
problem with this it's hard to arrange
you can't go well I'm going to spend the
next month visiting people in hospitals
and I'll get a lot of deep happiness
well maybe well maybe you won't you know
Gilbert's rule still applies you're not
going to get what you expect Hawthorne
once said this kind of happiness is like
a butterfly if you try to catch a
butterfly with your hands very hard but
if you sit still sometimes a butterfly
will come and light on your shoulder so
sometimes you get this by a gift of
grace and you only notice it if you're
quiet enough to see it you have to be
there on the beach on that random
warning when you got up too early
because you couldn't sleep and you walk
out and there's a sunrise and oh it just
happened you didn't get up to go find
and because if you do it won't be there
so great concept but you have to just
learn to be still alright so now let's
see I got one more thing and then we've
got your six lives exercise one I this
is my second challenge to you first
let's find your metaphor what is it
you're trying to achieve this is find
your definition of happiness since there
isn't any a guy came up in a seminar was
attending at Wharton and it was a big
you know maybe 12 15 people big room and
and they were doing a lecture on income
and happiness the relationship between
income levels and happiness and there
was all these data about Bhutan
you know mongolia and stuff and and
about right before it's getting ready to
start this man walks in who's obviously
not a member the wharton faculty he's a
working-class guy with flannel shirt
blue jeans and rough hands sat down
right next to me at the end of the table
and where our seminars are open to the
public so sometimes people come in we
always wonder what they might say uh
because you never know you know who's
going to come in but anyway the lecture
went on the guy finished and someone
asks a question about the regression
analysis on the boot on data said and he
happily answered that you know and then
this guy raised his hand and everybody
has sort of held her breath and he said
excuse me I'm just a member of the
public but you seem to be talking about
happiness and money he said I don't see
how happiness has anything to do with
money said as near as I can tell
happiness is just three things good
health meaningful work and love you have
that you're happy and there was this
dead silence
and it was very you know like the
presenter kind of went well thank you
and then someone else said about that
regression analysis on the boot ain data
set and everything kind of went like the
water over sand and he got up and
wandered off and went out the door now I
was sitting there and I thought to
myself my goodness God has sent an angel
to the Wharton School to tell us the
meaning of life and nobody listened I
mean isn't that interesting ah so you
know I was the first time I had ever
heard the phrase meaningful work when he
said it so I took you know I thought
let's find out what that is that looks
good um but you know I don't think that
that's actually true for any bus I mean
good good health may be the beginning of
happiness but you can have some bad
health and still have days when you're
happy meaningful work whatever it is is
is something that you may have it
outside of your job that pays you and
there's another thing you're doing
that's your meaningful work so it's hard
to know whether it's a requirement that
you have it as a nine-to-five part of
your life and love comes and goes you
know it's you lose a loved one doesn't
mean you can never be happy again just
means that you have some sadness so so I
don't know that that's actually the last
word on the subject but i would give you
this challenge if you're going to say
success is happiness you have to define
it and I thought I call him the wise
angel I think the wise angel had a
pretty good definition and I gave him
credit for having thought enough about
life to have come up with it and they
shared it with us and the one Alissa's
but I listened so you know I'm telling
you and finally you know if you've got
to succeed I think it's important to be
unhappy sometimes I mean that's where we
get injustice and so we have programs to
improve it that's where we get poverty
and we're unhappy about the poverty and
we try to change it that's where we have
relationships that are working and we
take steps to fix them so if you if
you're constantly in denial about the
things you're unhappy about then you're
going to end up
in a you know piling all this stuff on
top of yourself and it collapse at one
point so be dissatisfied use them as
motivations be unhappy find out why
you're unhappy work from that don't just
you know follow this pursuit of
happiness I think Jefferson should have
said life liberty and the pursuit of
dissatisfaction that would have given us
all much more to work with all right so
here is the six lives and I'm going to a
quick Astro show of hands and then you
know I'll wrap up animal guessing Q&amp;amp;A
here so there's six lives and some
people rank them number one some two
three four five six so I'm just going to
ask you to sort of raise hands and will
do very brief survey to see what the
numbers are for number one and number
six that's the separation of this see if
we all agreed about the same thing so
the wealthy investor the guy who makes a
lot of money and has political causes
that he supports anybody rank they want
the investor number one hands up for
number one okay about for view number
six I love quite a few more okay all
right but we have some on each side so
someone some sex people like the wealthy
investors variety autonomy options or a
lot of things to be said for having that
kind of control of your life and they
willing to us to exert yourself and have
influence people don't like the wealthy
investor because he has no family he has
no partner he doesn't really have a way
of connecting emotionally with others it
seems like he's on a lonely trip and
some people find that to be very painful
as a choice first a definition of
success but people have different ideas
about this the banker anybody picked the
bankers number one okay so we have about
maybe 10 of you 11 pick the banker
number six for the banker about the same
number it may be a few less alright
people who pick the banker off and
respect her choices I mean here's a
woman who's defending her life choices
against a lot of people who saying you
know you ought to be too satisfied
through life you know and she's saying
no I've chosen my life her devotion to
her child her loyalty to her company to
her mission at work her success in the
latter sense they're all of that
suggests a person not living a selfish
life and a one that they she's
and that's very admirable to some people
pick at number six sometimes because it
looks like a very painful life in some
ways I mean she's got a lot of time
devoted to this child and not sure that
that would be the way you'd want to
spend your time and she's alone you know
like the bothy investor she doesn't have
a partner doesn't seem to be working out
with the love side although she has a
great deal of love for a child it seems
incomplete to some other people so they
picked they pick it lower tennis pro
number one and he paid anybody picked a
tennis pro number one oh just one person
excellent look congratulations on your
choice tennis pro number six okay a few
more people pick the tennis pro I mean
different audiences I have this reversal
of that dynamic ah tennis pro has some
appealing things she's very accomplished
she's a pen on the front of the tennis
magazine she's very good at what she
does she is an individual accomplished
Urso she earned the right to do this on
her own merits there's no complications
about who gets the credit she has a
family she's gotten past the the
possible pain of not being able to have
children and adopted them so she's
taking control of her life in that
respect she's giving back to the
community she has a non-profit she works
with to bring tennis two kids with lower
incomes and less opportunity all that
sounds pretty good people pick against
this life at number six often because
she doesn't have work-life balance quite
set right she doesn't have time for
those kids she's adopted she's it's a
hard road out there in the circuit it
looks like she's sort of sweating it a
bit and some people wonder if she chose
this life you know someone who's been
playing tennis since there were five did
they really choose this or is this
something their parent or one or parents
said you know up every morning drill
drill drill serves or sort of volleyball
volley and it just turns out she's good
at it but isn't actually something that
excites her passion if any of you have
read Andre Agassi's autobiography open
he's obviously a world-class tennis
player it starts with the first three
words are I hate tennis because his
father was a monster who drilled him
beyond endurance and that's of course
why he got to be a great tennis player
but he really hated the game and finally
put it together later in life
when he married Stephie and started
doing some other things non-profit
leader anybody picked a non-profit
leader number 10 quite a few okay number
six for the nonprofit leader a few of
you hi people pick numbers one for the
nonprofit leader often respect his or
her willingness to sort of take
accomplishments in one career repurpose
them to a new direction so they're
moving in a more purpose filled
direction for another stage of their
career that looks attractive they are
have a family they're bringing them
along they're going to expose them to
this new culture in Africa that's he
could look exciting I've moved around a
lot when I was a kid that doesn't show
any fear for me it was normal for me I'm
I would assume those kids you'll get
with the program but people sometimes
see that life and go oh I see a nuclear
bomb going off in the middle of Africa
when this family lands in Africa because
those kids are not going to like it no
social media no friends you know not a
happy crew and if that's the case maybe
this parent is really a dictator and not
really a parent who's compassionate and
caring so they see that as being an
unsuccessful choice then notice what
you're doing with each of these lives
your interpretive 18 from your own fears
hopes experience to read into this what
you read into it I think that's
important to note because it's true that
they're different but it's also true
those are your fears those are your
experiences and when you get to nodal
points unconsciously that's some of the
stuff that you're using to choose this
or that so it's important to kind of be
aware of those metrics the teacher
anybody picked the teacher number one
okay excellent about 10 or 12 p teacher
number six all right fewer people like
to teacher generally like the idea of
you know this pawn thing you know this
person showing ripples with their
immediate community there they love to
bring out excellent and others there
they're being quite good at it they've
got award-winning science high school
students and they have a family to
people who pick against this one often
fear that one
Nick there's a child who doesn't speak
to the family anymore and sometimes
people kind of infer wait a minute this
person is such a great high school
teacher how come she can't like keep her
own family going and that's sort of a
problem if you think about it that way
and that looks really like a dark place
to go I myself pick the teacher as my
number one life out of this exercise but
not just because I happen to be a
teacher there's obvious but I like the
pond thing you know I like to bring out
the best in others part and I was her
child and I came home so I know that it
works out sometimes and so it doesn't
have that fear for me finally the
stonemason anybody picked the stonemason
number 10 quite a few interesting uh-huh
Dunham nice number six a couple of you
okay hi hi picks for the stonemason
often come from a sense of his autonomy
his craftsmanship his control over what
he's doing his family is completely
integrated with his life he's building
his children's homes it takes great
pride in what he does both for them and
for his work so this looks like the Zen
master of the of the six but you know
some people read this life and go boring
boring boring I mean what effect is he
having on anyone outside his family and
he's not even on the cover of stone
mason weekly you know and people people
honestly feel the sodium you know what i
want my life to have a little bit more
like happening out there besides this
summation thing so it's a it's a it's
not a it's not a literal you know the
stone mason is anyone who likes a kind
of craft approach to their work that
they can control and that's that's rare
in our workplace so i see a lot of
people picking the stonemason because
they're lacking that sense of completion
on things that they do and control over
things they do and in our world that's
rare and people really would like to
have more of it and so we vote for that
life so just as a final thing and then
we have a few minutes for questions if
you had to pick one of these lives for
your only child assume your only child
is just
a sort of average child without you know
a lot of aptitudes displayed yet
sometimes when I asked it that way
people change their boats one and only
one life for the only child you're going
to leave in this world which one would
you pick and very often people move a
little more to a kind of external
internal balance with a few less risk
because even the stonemasons life money
sometimes a problem he says some people
get a little worried about that anything
our only child we're going to endow this
life to this person where there's money
is a problem I'm not sure so I throw
that one out as a final note to you
because I think the choice you would
make for your only child is probably the
choice you would make for yourself if
you actually had to take the path of one
of these six and the balance that
they're showing and I think that's
important to know because that's the
action value that you're using to make
real choices not just the ideal the
admirable the the thing that you admire
but the thing you would do if you had to
do it so so I think getting at that
level is kind of important okay we got a
few minutes for questions or comments
anybody got anything they want to throw
at me the professor is here yes o course
online yeah i can ask about that i
haven't put i'll tell you i haven't put
it online it is not because i'm trying
to hide it i put a book out out after
all but but it's just it's the trouble
is i find the online teaching
environment to be rarely one way and and
and so for me to just so you know sit in
front of a camera and talk and then have
twenty-five thirty thousand people you
know out there isn't the kind of ripples
that I'm you know I'm spending time
teaching I like to spend time teaching
people I know and parsha and tell me
tell you that that means a lot of
interaction a lot of discussion a lot of
knowledge about the you know what who
they really are to be helpful because
because you know my real goal is to try
to help not just to influence to be
so so I haven't but maybe someday you
know they'll change the online
environment you guys want then a new way
to make it interactive in a way that's
compelling yes you know that's a great
question the question is knowing what I
know now and looking back on my life
would I made different choices you got
to remember that the big moment for me
wasn't a choice it was it was a an
outside force that hit me like a
hurricane and so I was completely turned
upside down and my identity was taken
away I had to make a choice and I made
the right choice on that that is I chose
an anti-war stance that I still maintain
I led part of the team that that
protested the first Iraq invasion that
took place you know back in the 90s I
could see the train coming it was an old
train I knew it well and and there was
nothing we could do to stop it but we
stood up and wave the flag and said no
no not again and it just went right over
it again so but I still maintain the
rightness of that position but as far as
my own life is concerned I am a big
proponent of trial and error rather than
choice cause effect I think what you do
is you make choices that put you in
different places and then life happens
and then you make new choices based on
the options that life provides at that
next stage and you can't predict what
the next stage is actually going to be
so I just like to start going from the
inside out try to maximize your
capabilities so that you continue to get
better at what you do and and achieve
what you're trying to achieve and I
think that that's the best you can do I
I kept journals while I was traveling
those two years so I had these great big
stack of these very introspective
journals and at one point I the question
what should i do was big big question
used to write about that a lot and at
one point I came to the insight
abstractly I want to be a teacher this
is before i had the out-of-body
experience that I realized I really
wanted to be one and so when I when I
wrote it down i said okay i want to be a
teacher one of the things
could teach and one of the things I
could never teach and I could teach
English literature history you know
poetry and the top of the list of things
I could never teach business Here I am
so I was smart enough and I'm married to
someone who's smart enough I married my
college sweetheart who was also there
and she had a few adventures of her own
but we connected with each other after I
came home again and she knows me well
enough to know that when the opportunity
to teach at Wharton came I should take
it so it's not always choice but it is
response and wise wise responses anybody
else yeah advice for some time just
about to go into their last year of
college ah yes other than read
springboard ah the yeah I think you
should be taking things you really enjoy
and not just things that you think are
going to look good on your resume it's a
last chance you're going to you're only
going to be a senior in college once
take an acting class take a you know
whatever it is you like to do and then I
think you ought to look at the next
stage of life more as a post graduate
fellowship in life and not as the
beginning of a career and even if for a
couple of years you do something else it
might be travel it might be work on a
cruise ship it might be you know go to
you know work for some group in Asia or
something just not not a career choice
an educational choice so that you
maximize your ability to respond to the
world around you open open the big gate
and let the information in I think
that's the best advice that we good yeah
yeah yes any type of love sometimes the
taste things still to be able to tap
into that does that go home cuddling
meditation and getting into that skill
place to kind of be increased that new
happiness increase those experiences I
you know I wouldn't SI it has to be
meditation I think some people are
hyperactive people and so for them they
have to get really really really active
and then they can be quiet and if you
try to tell them meditate they just sit
in the meditation go hoop know like this
so i would say whatever it takes for you
to be at a place mentally where you're
open where you're aware where you're
noticing what's happening around you
even if it's running you might be open
aware noticing what's happening you
might be in motion as you have that
state of mind so however you achieve
that state of mind without drugs uh I
think that that's the way to do it so
everything is like everything else it's
your own you have to sort of assess
yourself for metin for me quiet
meditation I'm an introvert basically
I'd like to spend time alone I don't
like big crowds if I love being with you
guys but if this were a social event and
we had aa mix I would like go to a
corner and find one of you and just talk
to that one person although so so the so
I think everybody's got to find their
own kind of thing and for me it was
meditation yeah I just have a feeling
that if the point is like to define
success in their own terms then isn't
such an exercise they were looking at
different people rating your successive
images inherently establishing this
model we're here qualifying people's
success taking us back to the same
tainted vision of defining success in
terms of what other people see well I
gave you this exercise and it's an
impossible exercise because I asked you
to judge six lives but the reason I gave
it to you is not to decide whether they
you think they are successful the reason
I gave it to you is because those
criteria are implicit in your mind about
yourself and that's what's activating
those choices so I mean there's no way
to separate the social inputs from the
inner world we are social creatures and
we are the product of social
conditioning and social information no
way to separate
it but you can be more aware of it just
like you can be aware of hunger and so
once you become aware of hunger you
don't have to eat as much because now
you're not fearing hunger oh that's
hunger okay that's some happens
sometimes during the day and and so you
know a lot of people eat just to keep
the feeling of hunger away and they
never are aware that it's the hunger
that's motivating the eating you get
aware of hunger as a feeling you can do
something with it so I think that this
compulsion to achieve or to achieve
status or to get fame or increase your
wealth or whatever our impulses and once
you're aware of them then you become
able to sort of Judge well it's this one
I ought to follow or should I just sort
of like you know move this one down the
road and see if I can find something
that gives me more satisfaction when I
achieve it a lot of people wake up often
in the in a week and they go wow I just
achieved that XYZ and then they say to
themselves but why do I feel so empty
why is it why am I not excited the day
after that about it and that's because
they've been acting on these impulses
that are unconscious they might be
trying to please their family are trying
to beat a brother or trying to whatever
and they've forgotten all the Y's and
all they do is the dues but they've wake
up and they don't understand why they've
been doing it and so that it lacks the
savor of something you genuinely
understand so I think it's it's it's a
great question I don't think you can
ever pulled the two apart but you can
adopt an attitude about them that gives
you a little more perspective and choice
about what to do yeah so you spoke about
maximizing your ability to respond or
around here and also inherently
experiencing a set of unhappiness or
dissatisfaction and I'd look here to us
on there is when one is it a point of
life whether and not as happy as they
like or they realize that perhaps what
they're doing not their final holly is
it worth for how long phosphate once you
remain in
position recommender the notion that
there's probably a lot to learn there's
probably a lot more to pick up or to
learn more about said on happiness or
what really is the court driver bit so I
don't know if this the juxtaposition of
it into something you've thought about a
written about it certainly something I
thought about I mean the question is
being one of the things that keeps
people from do taking this journey is
the fear that it will never end it will
never end it's it's going to it's going
to it's going to end up with me being
dysfunctional and unable to achieve
anything and depressed and sad and
lonely and yuck so why not stay on the
ok flat oh and I got a number for you
thirty two thousand eight hundred and
fifty is the number of days you get to
live if you're lucky left to live to be
90 now if that's it that's it that's the
quantity there's no more than that for
most people so how do you want to spend
them I say my theory is you should go
all in that is be willing to face the
fear be willing to face the uncertainty
be willing to especially at your age be
willing to open the door to finding
about yourself this is not about finding
about a career this is not about
discovering you have an f2 for
programming this is about discovering
what it is that motivates and moves and
causes you to behave and if it does I
you know I'm for therapy if that's the
way it goes that's a direction it needs
to take to figure out you know the
emotional core that's actually bubbling
under there I I just think if you don't
do that you're always the effect of
these things that aren't under your
control and then you you die and you
were just the effect of some disease and
this just doesn't seem worthy to me so I
think it's worth the roll the dice find
yourself all right I think it's a bad
time to wrap it up I see Amy coming up
here so so much to do
group Oh excellent so if you're
interested please send the alias email
and we'll connect you with us let me
I'll conclude with this thought with
that motivating statement the the book
that is back there has an appendix which
I created based on feedback from the
first publication back in August which
is a reader's guide and their eighth
session guides and they have questions
that a group can talk about as far as
the exercises and assessments topics to
discuss and so there are eight little
sessions all designed to provoke you
into asking the right kinds of questions
and facilitating your own growth so so
the book has that all built in thank you
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
