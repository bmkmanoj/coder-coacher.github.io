hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in

academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
thank you for coming my name is Amy
Draves and I'm here to welcome carolyn
arnold to the microsoft research
visiting speaker series
Carolyn's here to discuss her book small
move big change using micro resolutions
to transform your life permanently she
has designed a system involving small
pivotal behavioural changes that will
lead to true personal transformation
she's been a technology leader on Wall
Street for more than a decade and is a
managing director at a leading
investment banking firm she led the team
at Morgan Stanley that was awarded the
Wall Street and Technology Award for
creating the Google IPO auction platform
please join me in giving a very warm
welcome thank you really thank you all
for coming it's great to be here it's a
special pleasure for me to be at
Microsoft because I am a tech person and
I grew up programming on visual basic
visual c++ dotnet still important
technology to me today in addition to
programming languages the office suite
is still a large figures largely and a
lot of the innovative things we do as
Amy mentioned my team built the auction
platform for the Google IPO which was a
very unusual transaction I don't know
how many people remember but sort of
everyone anyone in the United States was
allowed to sort of bid on Google stock
and we only had like six weeks to build
a system that would gather all of these
bids across Wall Street and process them
and so almost immediately we hit on the
idea that we would be passing excel
files back and forth between these
brokerage firms and ourselves so that's
all it and this is my first book it's my
first book tour it's my first time in
Seattle it's not my first time on a
Microsoft stage because in 2003 I was
invited for the 2003 launch of office to
appear with Steve Ballmer in Orlando and
my handlers who got me ready and told me
what to expect said now you know when
you go out there Steve will ask you some
if he doesn't like you like if you're
bombing he'll just thank you for coming
and you know even if you haven't
finished that's your cue to leave so
just go and you know it's sort of like
the Balmer hook you know and I went out
there and it was kind of like being shot
from a cannon you know there were all
these blaring lights and everything and
and I thought we were talking about but
it seemed to go by for me like in a
second so when I exited I thought you
know well how did it go and they said oh
my god it was just like a homerun he
kept you two minutes over and like that
two minutes was considered you know you
know Steve's time being critical as it
is was considered a sign of success so I
have a little bit longer today and I
just you know if I'm looking wondering
me is he gonna appear and thank me for
for coming halfway through the thing
that what that would be about so it is
the new year and this book is about
change it's a time of change can I just
ask for a show of hands for how many
people made a New Year's resolution okay
how many people have kept their New
Year's resolutions so far
okay a little fewer how many people can
remember their New Year's resolution
from last year how many people succeeded
at their New Year's resolution last year
okay you know 90% of people fail at
their New Year's resolutions whether
you're a high achiever or not and it's
it's the punchline this time if you're
on late-night talk shows and stuff it's
such a common thing to fail at your New
Year's resolution organizer shops and
fitness programs and diets and even
books like mine do their best business
during January because that's the time
we kind of try to shake ourselves out of
the holiday doldrums and do something
but very few of us succeed it's it's a
rare event to succeed at a New Year's
resolution and I think a very common
thing when you fail at your New Year's
resolution is to blame yourself I think
you know it's kind of a common thing to
say I just I just wasn't strong enough
why am I so weak you know why can't I
succeed at this I succeeded other things
but in fact it isn't weakness it's not a
character flaw it's neurological
willpower is a neurological resource and
it actually shares a pool it's part of a
pool of neurological resources mental
energy activities one is willpower one
is active initiative you know taking
charge of things one's decision-making
and problem-solving they all share sort
of the same pool and willpower can be is
its depleted over time and if you stress
your willpower too much it just runs out
but because it also shares the same
mental space with these other really
important brain activities other things
can deplete your willpower so if you
have to make a lot of decisions during
the day at your job it's taking away
from that willpower space anything you
have to kind of negotiate yourself or
get yourself up for using the same
mental energy as that willpower space so
that's a lot of why people fail and
there is a way to sort of rethink these
resolutions so that you can be more
successful so coming back
fundamentally coming back to you the
resolutions that we make I'm gonna read
some resolutions and you tell me you
know raise your hand if you've ever made
anyone like this before anyone ever made
the one to be fit you know go to the gym
go running okay a lot of people how
about to be slim by summer that one okay
be organized be on time and get more
sleep okay good because sleep is
important we'll talk about that more
how about to be more assertive be more
defense be less defensive improve a
relationship okay if you listen to the
language of you know and be neat if you
listen to the language of those
resolutions they're a lot about being to
be something different
really they're closer to wishes then
they are two resolutions for action when
you're a slob and you resolve to be neat
you're just wishing to be a different
person to like drop
all the habits and the behaviors if you
make a resolution to be organized you're
pretty much just gonna every time you
touch a piece of paper all day be
organized you know be organized I open a
kitchen drawer be organized be organized
be organized and pretty soon you've
exhausted your will to change I mean
you're really putting yourself in a
space where you're number one activity
is telling yourself to be different in
another way and that is a large part of
why it is stressful to make a new year's
resolution so the way that we actually
are able to preserve this mental energy
we have is that mostly you're running on
a kind of personal autopilot all day
long it's the mass of behaviors and
attitudes and preferences and habits
that you've learned through your whole
life it's mindless and it's efficient
autopilot it doesn't cost you any well
power or real mental activity you don't
have to concentrate to tie your shoes
right autopilot ties your shoes
autopilot locks the door if you grew up
making your bed autopilot makes your bed
for you you know you turn around and
make your bed and oh my god my bed is
made you know the stealthy stealthy hand
of autopilot did it for you didn't
realize it's so mindless for you but if
you didn't grow up making your bed and
you decide you're gonna make your bed it
will cost you it will cost you because
it's not part of autopilot autopilot
does a lot of good things for us because
it allows us to kind of it has a low
efficient hum of running a day but
autopilot is also the thing that snags
the last donut by the coffee machine you
know it's the thing that snaps at your
partner when there's a certain kind of
dynamic it's the thing that causes you
to skip the gym if you don't usually go
and you make a resolution to go to the
gym if it hasn't been part of your
autopilot you'll feel tremendous
resistance autopilot is about resisting
change because that's what makes it
efficient it pushes back on change
because routine is its thing so when you
make a resolution to be organized
you're really declaring war on autopilot
because you're going to have to be
conscious about every single thing you
do all day to be organized and that's
what depletes your willpower so quickly
between auto pie
and that massive sort of ingrained
behaviors and attitudes and stuff will
powers the loser auto pilot is the
winner generally now some people say oh
but there are no people who have had
these they transform themselves
overnight and that can happen it's just
a very rare event and often it's
attached to something negative you know
if you get a bad health report or you
get a bad review on the job that says
that you're disorganized you might clean
up your desk overnight and be really on
to that and it's gonna dominate your
life where you know if you're if if you
fall out of a relationship I've seen
people fall out of a relationship and
all of a sudden they're at the gym and
they're eating less and things like that
but mostly you don't want to be driven
by the thick bold wa new was very thin
in his 20s and then he gained a lot of
weight and you know sort of ended up
being the heavy in films gotta just this
past year was told he was becoming
diabetic and in three months he gave up
sugar and lost 40 pounds and he could
have lost that 40 pounds any time it
would have been probably healthy for his
career but he didn't because it kind of
got tied to something dire so you don't
want to only change or be able to change
when you get that kind of be put in that
kind of situation you want to really be
able to change all the time the thing
about New Year's resolutions and the
failure thing beginning we make a big
push and then we make some progress you
lose some pounds or something and then
it's sort of Withers
right and it goes and even God you know
it just wasn't if you don't think that
you're weak you think it's because it
was the wrong time
it's such a stressful time in three
months I'll be able to do it and you get
into this kind of stopping and starting
and stopping and starting without making
any progress and the book that I'm here
to talk about today small move big
change
it's about continuous self-improvement
you're just redesigning your behaviors
one at a time it's about the
transforming power of the marginal
behavioral change that marginal
behavioral changes that you can sustain
forever can transform you your personal
life and your professional life okay so
how did this I get into this I mean how
did I come to be here talking about this
book I came because
I myself was a a resolution breaker so
several years ago I had broken my
resolution four years in a row when my
resolution was to lose weight and
exercise more lose weight and exercise
more and I had broken it every year and
I couldn't understand it I mean these
failures were mystery to me I mean how
was it possible that I could move a
mountain at work and do pretty well for
my family but the one thing that I
wanted to do to change myself I was a
bust that every year and I thought well
it must be that I'm picking the wrong
resolution it's just so hard to eat less
and exercise more I'm gonna pick
something easy because this year I'm
gonna succeed so the easy resolution
that I picked for myself that year was
to be organized the one we were talking
about before and I went out and I got
all the desk organizers the cubby holes
and the slots I color-coded all my files
I put everything away and when I stood
back and surveyed my desk I
congratulated myself on having succeeded
at my new year's resolution and three
months later my desk looked as crappy as
it had before I bought all the
organizers because I really I had a
burst of sort of organizational zeal
right I actually to get get over this
hump but I didn't really have any
behaviors to sustain it but on this year
because I thought that was gonna be my
easy resolution I was so mortified to
have failed at what I thought was going
to be my easy resolution that I just
wouldn't concede defeat and I thought
okay well if I can't be organized what
is one thing I can do that would be make
me more organized and I looked through
all the ways in which I was disorganized
I sort of reverse engineered my behavior
for those of you who are programmers and
I had many options to choose from and
being disorganized but I just picked one
and the one I picked was to put all my
notes in one notebook I had a habit of
taking notes on whatever was handy and
in front of me so if I was in a meeting
and there was an agenda I take my notes
there by the phone if there was like a
loose pad I take my notes there at home
I put something on the back of an
envelope
then when I wanted to find something I'd
have pieces of paper on my desk at home
pieces of paper on my desk at work
pieces of paper my handbag and I thought
I'm gonna put all my notes in one place
and I went out and got like a little
shiny red notebook I still have it with
me and I thought this is going to be a
breeze and the revelation was is it was
really hard just to do that one thing I
hated doing it I hated taking notes in
the book I felt awkward it felt weird if
I was sitting in a meeting and I was
talking to you and we're doing something
I want to make a note I thought oh I
have to fish into my handbag find this
notebook find a page and do it if I were
on the phone and I just wanted to jot
down a confirmation number something and
I'd see my book over there I had to go
get my book and do it if somebody
stopped me in the halls at work and told
me something I needed to know I thought
well won't I just remember it I had to
do it but because it was such a
reasonable resolution I just felt I had
to do it because if I didn't do it I
would have to sort of face I was never
going to improve in anything it was so
obvious that I could do it that it was
feasible and limited so I stuck with it
and I'm only gonna read one thing today
but I will just read this one section
about this short okay I stuck with it I
forced myself to put all my notes in my
little red book if I had an idea for a
client I wrote it in the book
confirmation numbers in the book
recommended articles websites events in
the book random contacts I might never
need again in the book packing list in
the book priorities and to-do lists in
the book bullet points for my next
presentation in the book recipe from a
friend in the book after weeks of
reminding myself to use the notebook I
noticed my feelings of resistance and
awkwardness fading as the notebook
became second nature I just did it
without thinking like brushing my teeth
as soon as I sat down in a meeting or at
my desk I reach for the notebook now I
could locate what I needed
almost immediately without stress or
drama
notes I would have once deemed
throwaways proved significant weeks on
the notebook ruled that I had first
found intrusive and constraining I now
experienced as empowering and liberating
my stress level declined I had become
more organized and that was sort of my
first sort of epiphany if you will about
how change happens that it's something
very targeted that it fills a specific
need that it gives you a benefit that
it's something you can sustain and I
decided to try diet I thought okay I did
the notebook could I apply the same rule
to eating and I looked through all the
things I did with respect to my eating
habits and I picked one thing I decided
never to eat a conference room cookie
again I worked in a firm where there
were really rich cookies and afternoon
meetings sometimes I would eat one
sometimes I would eat two there probably
got 400 calories each sometimes I would
eat three and I would leave these
meetings kind of thick and cut it in the
food coma space right and then I would
crash like an hour later and I just
thought I'm never gonna eat one of these
again I will bring my own cookie I
didn't say I would never eat a cookie
again cuz right that's in the failure
space I didn't say I would never eat in
a conference room again that wouldn't
have worked either I just said I'm never
gonna eat one of those cookies again and
I didn't and I sort of arrested the
long-term upward climb of my weight and
so what I ended up doing was spending
time on this stuff and really practicing
this this was my year of behaving
differently where I actually behaved
differently and I did a couple of these
things the whole year
throughout the year and then friends of
mine began doing it and colleagues began
doing it and they sort of began giving
me their stories and that became the
basis for this book and the set of rules
that that sort of developed around this
but the major thing that I discovered
during this year was real change happens
at the margin it happens
the margin of behavior what you might
almost call the vital margin you know
people don't wake up 15 pounds
overweight or many thousands of dollars
in debt it is something that happens at
the margin and a change in eating habits
can have one eating habit can have a big
effect a change in spending pattern can
cause you to save more money these are
all the positive things a subtle change
in communication can help you in a
relationship a slight change in attitude
can help you advance on the job and to
prove this to yourself you only need to
see the reverse of that is true that
relationships get sour on the corners
and at the edges it isn't an overnight
thing that you know people end up going
into debt overtime by small small
behaviors and when you realize that and
realize the linchpin of that was to work
the margin I started making a lot of
progress and that each one of these
micro resolutions sort of advance the
ball and I began to develop differently
so I think one way to think about this
as technologists that might be useful
especially at Microsoft is you know we
live in the age of the small and the
powerful you know micro computer chips
iPods iPads nanotechnology is
revolutionizing medicine you know
micro-financing is eliminating poverty
you know critical communications come in
140 character tweets you know each one
of these tools is a very sort of precise
dart aimed at a precise target filling a
certain need and delivering a benefit
immediately and that's kind of the idea
behind the micro resolution so like how
to start you know we can try some today
and I'll sort of go through some of the
principles and the way the book works is
the first part of it is sort of the
seven rules for making micro resolutions
and then the second half is broken up
into the most popular areas of kind of
self-improvement with a lot of stories
and models there's a lot of science in
the book if you're interested in that
willpower science etc but the first rule
of making a microwave
Lucian is a micro resolution is easy
okay everybody has to like that it's
easy don't make resolutions you can't
keep make a resolution you're absolutely
sure you can succeed at and don't tell
yourself it's too small to be
significant say what is it that I can do
that I can succeed to be sure that you
can succeed and no excuses resolution
it's got to be limited you know to say
I'm gonna walk everywhere all the time
or I'm gonna give up sweets or I'm not
gonna online shopping that's not limited
limited something absolutely targeted
it's got to be reasonable something that
you think you can absolutely follow
through with okay it's not relative you
know like to snack more or to snack less
or exercise more it's got to be in sort
of the absolute space so when you're
going to start start in an area like
let's say it's neatness and
reverse-engineer your behavior look at
all the things that you say if you want
to be neat
forget about being neat what are you
gonna do differently today that makes
you neither it could be as simple if
you're a total slob as just closing all
the drawers after you've opened them or
closing closet doors
it could be segregating surfaces so that
you know you don't end up with your
hairbrush on your desk and coins and
keys in your bathroom you could be as
simple as that or it could be more
ambitious to do your dishes immediately
after dinner whatever it is but it's
going to be based on you and your
behavior if we take to be fit a lot of
people say okay well I'm gonna go to the
gym three times a week also very vague
right what are those three days okay you
don't know if first of all it's probably
too much if you don't go to the gym
today you don't have the habit your
autopilot is gonna find a reason for you
not to go a couple of those days but
this gets a very important principle if
you overreach all you do all week is
bargain with yourself you say you know I
didn't go today Bob go tomorrow you know
oh I didn't go Wednesday but I'll make
it up on Saturday or Sunday and that
kind of bargaining is decision-making
decision-making depletes willpower the
more you have to think about it the more
you have to discuss it with yourself the
less likely you're going to
so you want to be absolutely explicit so
if you say okay I'm gonna it could be
I'm gonna walk to work or one day a week
I don't do it now I'm gonna walk to work
one day a week if you're in a driving
city it could be I'm gonna drive in the
farthest parking lot at Microsoft and
I'm gonna walk to my building and walk
back whatever it is the thing you think
you absolutely can do you know so much
science now is also about when I started
researching the book also about what
happens at the margin it turns out in
Fitness I think maybe some of you have
read of how bad it is to be sedentary to
sit all day it's kind of like the new
smoking they say it is better if you get
a better health benefit of getting up
two times an hour to walk around for a
couple of minutes than you do to go to
the gym for an hour after work that is a
better health boost than the hour after
work there's so many things like that
that boosts your health since we're
talking about fitness standing if you
take a bus or train doesn't going to
stand every day you're not gonna want to
stand every day you want to stand maybe
one way in and after a while you may
prefer standing but whatever you do
that's different I'm gonna tell you this
you're not going to like it
it is really disturbing to your
autopilot it feels weird and awkward and
you have to have enough willpower to
push past that time where it just feels
icky to the time where it actually
supports you and goes into autopilot and
you don't need any real power to sustain
it which is really the definition of
getting something into willpower that
business of arguing with yourself and
deciding it actually has a name in
science it's called decision fatigue
decision fatigue you see that a lot too
in people's diets would say okay I'm
gonna cut a hundred calories out of out
of day okay if you don't say 100
calories you're gonna cut you're gonna
be counting and adding and figuring it
out all day long that's a decision
fatigue you want to get these things in
a space where you don't have to think
about them you want them to be mindless
one thing I found out is there's no such
thing as a small change they're all
significant the ones I've made
practically and personally in
Psychological besides a psychologically
but you get something you know something
that seems limited has a lot of benefits
so if you walk to work one day
week which was where I started and now I
walked to work five days a week and do
Pilates three times a week but I started
walking once a week you're gonna be
fitter you're gonna arrive at work at a
clearer head you're gonna have getting
to see every season of the year for good
or for bad which has its own effect you
may sleep better you may think better at
work all these things from doing one
thing differently one thing differently
okay so that's one kind of micro
resolution another one is you know your
head it's a lot to do with who you are
and how you react to things your
attitudes and your values you can do
something called a micro resolution
message which is not a commitment to act
or behave in a certain way but just to
send yourself a message on a cue so for
example you might send yourself the
message when you come home with your
coat if you're working on NEET it's
really just as fast to hang it up before
you drop and share it don't come at MIT
to hang it up it's really just as fast
to hang it up if you're tempted to snack
instead of telling yourself no snacking
you could work on a mindset thing which
is just I really enjoyed dinner so much
more when I'm hungry for it I really
enjoyed dinner more when I'm hungry for
it that was one of mine so it wasn't
that I didn't snack but I started
shifting the way I snacked so I be
hungry for my meal and these things work
on you and they'll change the way that
you behave if you're tempted to spend on
something and you overspend when you're
looking at something that maybe you
shouldn't really really can't afford to
buy you can send yourself the message
the greatest luxury is security the
greatest luxury of security it's
personal all these are personal you have
to kind of find the dart that hits your
psychological spot and has a difference
but it will affect your head and it will
affect the way you behave and maybe
we'll talk about some other ones that
people have done that have been very
good okay Freud said thought is father
to the deed so that's kind of the idea
there okay
the next rule so first one is it's easy
the second thing is it's an action an
explicit and measurable action as I said
it's absolute not relative it's not
doing something more doing something
less
it's absolutely specific to that it's
not something in the aggregate like I
will have done this three times a week
or I'm gonna do this five times a month
if you're gonna do something once a week
you have a day and a time that you're
gonna do it and you only measure
yourself on that so if I say I'm gonna
walk to work I'm gonna walk to work on
Monday morning that's it that's what I'm
measuring myself on okay it could be
snowing so I don't go it didn't do
happen that way but and I can walk more
if I feel like it but the only thing I'm
gonna measure my set my resolution on is
did I walk on Monday morning and that
relieves all of this kind of negotiating
and everything else and one of the magic
about being so explicit is that you want
to manage obstacles out of your way cuz
this is your only chance
you're not gonna defer it right you're
gonna say this is it I'm gonna do my
resolution and if I don't do it I can't
make it up so you want to be absolutely
explicit about what you do I think I
brought up the hundred calorie example
that's just a math problem you have to
solve all day a hundred calories you
won't know till the end of the day did I
save 100 calories you don't want to be
in that place if you say you're not
gonna eat bread at dinner that's a
hundred calories and you do that if you
drink two glasses of wine and you drink
a glass and a quarter that's a hundred
calories if you say I eat a candy bar at
three o'clock every day or a cookie I'm
going to eat half of it that's a hundred
calories that's the space you want to be
in mindless you want to think mindless
so that it can just slip in and become
part of your autopilot it's personal I
think we spoke about that it's a reverse
engineering a thing you have to look at
your own habits so something that makes
you late isn't the thing that makes me
late
if you drive being out of gas can make
you late if you commute with a card
being out of fares can make you late
I was late in the morning and I wanted
to reverse that there were a hundred
reasons that I was late
I picked one the thing that bothered me
the most is when it was time to leave I
live in Brooklyn I commune into the city
I take my young daughter to school and
then I go on to work is that nagging
feeling were my keys where they were
supposed to be or were they in a coat
pocket or on my Bureau did I really have
enough money left on my MetroCard you
just slide through the thing
was it gonna say insufficient fare as I
heard the train like a rumbling by what
about cash because I needed a little bit
of cash for car ride with my daughter
and all morning that sort of hung over
me that sense of we'll all those things
there and I finally just got a separate
purse and every Friday night I filled up
my MetroCard and put it in this purse I
got money on the way home on Friday
night enough for every car right I put
it in the person I put an extra key in
there and I did not use that purse for
anything else if I had to commute
someplace else I had a separate card so
there was no way I could lose track of
how many fares there were if I ran out
of money in my regular wallet I went and
got money at the cash machine but I
didn't deplete that wallet and I haven't
been late for that reason since I did it
there are other ways to be late I'm
working on those but I had not been late
for that so you have to sort of take a
look at your own behavior eating so
personal everybody picks up the same
diet is really personal some people are
snackers some people skip breakfast some
people eat late into the night you need
to take a look at why you eat and how
you eat I think one reason those you
know those diets that give you like the
packaged food that comes or highly
prescriptive one reason those are so
successful is it's a new kind of
autopilot you know you don't have to
think you just rip open the package and
eat it but sooner or later you have to
kind of go back into the real world and
back to the cafeteria and you haven't
really changed that behavior so when you
think about it come up with that
personal thing one of my favorite
resolutions someone made was just to
leave something on their plate just
leave something on their plate even if
you serve something a little bit more
just leave something on your plate
because if you're used to finishing
which is an autopilot activity finish
all my food and you train yourself to
see something tasty disappearing with
your plate that will be a game-changer
all of those can be really really
profound changes so we went through
personal action etc let's do just a
little bit more okay I guess the only
other thing I want to say is you have to
be relentless single-minded purpose and
relentless you hone in on this narrow
behavioral change and you just
camera you hammer it and hammer it until
after a while it doesn't feel weird it
might not feel natural for a few weeks
at about four to six weeks it won't cost
you so much to maintain it and then you
can go on to other micro resolutions
just two at a time because you really
you can try to do them all but you'll
fail it's a lot of focus and the thing
is you want to preserve most of your
focus for these other things you're
doing at work so just two at a time and
single-minded purpose the rest of the
book is devoted to sort of different
chapters on and there's chapters on
cueing and how you queue a resolution
there's chapters on how you frame a
resolution so you want to do it the Q is
important you want to be explicit about
it we did talk about sort of schedule
cues like doing things on a day but if
it's a relationship cue for example or
something like that you have to isolate
the moment that tells you okay this is
this is my new behavior right so if
you're a behavior in a relationship that
you're trying to change is not to say I
told you so to your partner you might
not think that's big change but I can
guarantee you it will improve your
relationship tremendously if you don't
say I told you so
when you feel the impulse to say I told
you so that's the cue to not say I told
you so right if you have trouble when
you receive feedback at work what we
call feedback used to be called
criticism now as a developmental
feedback when you receive developmental
feedback you could receive it from a
colleague or a subordinate or your boss
if you try to solve for all those cues
you're gonna short-circuit so I would
say pick one if you have subordinates
who want to be able to give you feedback
and tell you that you're wrong I would
say you know that's a great thing for a
leader to feel okay about being told
you're wrong you might practice a
response when your response when you
feel yourself wanting to say oh well the
reason I did that or whatever you might
train yourself to say thank you I really
appreciate you giving me that feedback
you don't have to say you agree with it
you know but these kind of things
disrupt those cues between people and
give you a chance to respond in a
different way and there are a lot of
them in the book I'll do one more which
I think is really significant for the
workplace there's a story of one person
in the book who didn't get promoted
because she was told she she was a bit
negative
and that thought that she would have to
develop sort of a more positive sort of
attitude you know in the workplace
before she had a leadership position her
first serve response was how unfair it
was but she had heard it before and she
decided to make a resolution this person
was a complainer she decided to make a
resolution not to be the first to
complain in the workplace
not never to complain but not to be the
first to complain and the very first day
of her resolution something happened in
the workplace that she thought was
worthy of complaint and she sort of
waited for someone else to take the lead
and no one said anything and in that
moment she realized it was her I mean
she really was the person it seemed like
a group thing because everybody joined
in but she was really the one that
started it so a lot of subtle things can
make a huge change and that's really
partly what the book is really what the
book is about one more thing and then
I'd love to do questions sleep is your
friend and self-improvement sleep
restores your willpower stores it
restores yourself it rebalances hormones
that have to do with hap appetite and
being satiated that help you if you died
if you don't get at least six hours
those hormones don't come into balance
and you feel hungrier and what you eat
satisfies you less people spend hundreds
of dollars on creams to make them look
more youthful if you get more sleep
you'll look more youthful
all the studies show that you know for
anything physical you'll sink more
baskets you'll get more first serves in
you'll do flip turns in the pool faster
if you sleep more sleep load if you have
something big to do it's really hard if
you're a programmer but there's a lot of
things that you can do if you get on the
computer late at night just to check
your email you're likely going to be on
for two hours that's something you can
do but really taking a look at sleep and
making sure you get more of it is
important anyway that's sort of the
basic outlines of the book and why it
works for me
I've lost 22 pounds I'm the fist I've
ever
then I'm the most organized in the
neatest I've ever been I've improved
relationships I'm not perfect in any of
these things Ralph Waldo Emerson called
it the endless work of self-improvement
but doing one thing differently proving
to yourself you can learn to do one
thing differently really punches your
ticket for the voyage of continuous
self-improvement why don't you kind of
get that hit hey I changed myself right
it's just a question of deciding where
you want to go that day so that's that
so any questions yes so I believe
aspects of personalities don't change um
I believe personality traits are
tenacious but I think things give way to
doing differently so being different is
one thing but if you learn to behave
differently and you can train yourself
in that example not to say I told you so
you will definitely change your
personality you may feel very liberated
not to feel that you have to say I told
you so
and they might believe that you have
become a better person but you may still
not be in agreement with yourself which
would be a cause of okay so that's a
that's a great point so let me make two
points about that one of these I did for
myself was I would come home I have
worked all day I made dinner for my
family and then my husband would say
something like hey you know you left the
light on in the basement all right and I
feel this surge of resentment but I
would say oh I'm sorry and then I would
explain why it was which was really my
long litany of everything I had done all
day that he should have appreciated
right and there'd be such a sour feeling
in the air after that and one day I
decided what would happen if I just
didn't apologize if I just said oh got
it you know
and I started doing that and I felt so
much better you know like I didn't feel
like I had a base myself by apologizing
when I didn't mean it became a micro
resolution not to apologize when I
didn't really mean it you know is a
gotcha I treated everything he said is
if it were gotcha
you know as a gotcha if I gotcha doesn't
get you is it still a gotcha you know no
it's just information and I felt lighter
I felt better
I enjoyed life more you change by doing
things differently not just by telling
yourself that you must change and it's
really profound to do that at and you
know I have a lot of these things with
my child and elsewhere one thing I
didn't mention that was important is a
micro resolution has an intrinsic value
it's not a someday thing that's one of
the things that's the problem with New
Year's resolutions it's kind of like if
I do all these things someday I'll be
neat if I do all these things someday
I'll be organized I don't even think of
these things as steps you know a step
implies the reward is in the future it
is what it is if you teach yourself to
make your bed that's what you get you
get a made bed if you teach yourself not
to eat half a candy bar in the afternoon
that's what you're going to get you
don't eat half a candy bar in the
afternoon you make your bed whatever it
is it's like an intrinsic value and
there's no such thing as a small change
all of them carry benefits change is
good somebody said and it is any other
questions yes catastrophic failures in
your plan like what have you lost your
okay so if something like that happened
I'd go get another notebook and just
chalk it up to experience but you do
raise a good point sometimes they don't
work so one of the tenants of the book
is hey they should always succeed if
it's reasonable and limited and in your
power to do you should be able to
succeed but the book does talk about
test driving your resolution because it
does take a couple weeks to sort of feel
do you have it right and it's you said
to yourself I'm gonna walk twice a week
and it turns out to be too hard scale it
back to what you can do if you say
you're gonna walk a mile and it turns
out to take too long walk half a mile
and if it seems like a cop-out it isn't
because what you're looking for is a
behavior
that's repeatable forever it's a forever
thing so if it takes I mean I'm not
saying that sometime in your life you
might decide you're gonna stop walking
to work of course but you're trying to
do something and routinize it so you can
do it forever so getting it right and
getting it to fit is important so don't
be afraid to make adjustments during the
first couple of weeks yes
I'd be really curious to hear your
thoughts on okay so I know that being I
definitely need to get me sleeping every
day
right so well the first thing I think is
to find out why it is you stay up late
and what keeps you up and then I'll talk
a little bit about framing so if you
find yourself eating late at night but
you're not really hungry you're trying
to stay awake so sugar is or something
sweet when people say they have the
munchies made dinner two hours ago
they're really trying to stay up so one
thing one resolution might be and it's
in the book somebody made not to eat to
stay awake let's say another thing is
you know I ended up getting about seven
hours more sleep per week by breaking up
this habit I would put my kid to sleep
and then I rushed downstairs to kind of
hang out with my husband which usually
meant watching TV and then I'd fall
asleep on the couch for a couple of
hours and I was too tired to get up and
get ready for bed I just could not face
like contact flossing phone-charging
pajamas so I just kept sleeping and then
finally I get myself up and I do all
those things and then I'd be wide awake
and couldn't sleep because I'd had my
nap so one simple thing I did was I just
got ready for bed before ever went
downstairs and as soon as I felt dozy I
got up and just slipped between the
sheets there was nothing left to do to
your point about framing to these
changes that I made I also set myself
the message I'm just when I was tempted
to stay up I'm more successful when I
get more sleep I'm more successful when
I get more sleep like a mantra framing
is a great topic I once made the micro
resolution one of the most important
ones that ever made was to eat more
slowly I ate really fast I was the first
done then I would eat bread out of the
basket or go get other food because
everybody else was still eating I told
myself to chew my food slowly yuck what
a horrible resolution to chew your food
slowly so I reframed that too
to dine leisurely and savor my food and
drink who wouldn't want to do that
deine leisurely savor my food and drink
and while I was dining leisurely and
savoring my food and drink this little
voice would say to me if you don't speed
up you'll never finish all this food it
came to me again and again it was not an
accident I didn't I never knew until I
started isolated that channel that I had
in my head the notion I had to hurry up
and finish and get done it's yet another
accomplishment in my day to finish all
my food and I realize kind of in that
moment I rushed in everything I do
you know I rushed whether it was the
weekend if somebody's walking slowly in
front of me and I really don't have any
place to go I resent that person and
that was kind of a revelation one thing
when you really isolate and get down to
these precise targets you're listening
on a channel that's so clear you can
really hear what it is psychologically
to the point this gentleman made that's
in your way I don't know if I answered
your question entirely about framing and
sleep okay but yours will be personal
yes Amy okay
oh that's a good one well I mean I don't
know a lot about what that bedtime
routine is like it could be that if now
you just put the child in bed with you
and that's the routine you could maybe
have the bed and go spend a certain
amount of time with your child you could
say that lets you know that you're going
to move your child after a certain
amount of time pick up when you're
asleep and tell them how much better
that's going to be you know training a
child and making a shift like that is a
little different from changing your own
behavior but trying to understand what
what your child gets out of that
arrangement might help you come up with
something there something with my child
for example a little different again my
own behavior about my child's behaviour
when she became a teenager we started
having like kind of a lot of yelling and
standoff and one day I just made the
resolution not to try to top or with my
voice but to lower my voice and every
time she raised her voice I lowered my
voice and then she would pick up her
ears you know she she had to lean in to
kind of listen and it didn't always
carry the day I can't say that I've
never blown it but mostly it helped a
lot so kind of understanding her
psychology a little bit her desire to
fight same thing with a child who wants
to sleep of course it's about security
so what are different sort of security
substitutions you can make bit by bit
that ultimately make your child you know
confident enough to sleep other own yes
you mention it takes about 4 to 6 weeks
to kick that micro resolution and did
you also say
you would never get more than two two at
a time so I want to be clear it won't be
completely autopilot after four to six
weeks but it won't bug you so much it'll
be more natural it'll be kind of doesn't
take a lot of willpower at that point
over a period of weeks it moves itself
into autopilot two at a time is plenty
if you if they if they average five a
week that's 20 changes to your behavior
you can make this year that's profound
you know what the tenant of behavioral
science is by townsend and beaver to
behavioral science scientists this is
the tenant most of the time what we do
is what we do most of the time every
once in a while we do something new
every once in a while doing something
news a big deal so if you do 20 things
new this year it'll be immensely
empowering I mean actually changing your
behavior and seeing it going to the
place where you never want it to change
back again is empowering it's also
identity changing because all the
Preferences that you have and the
attitudes and the values line up with
the way you behave when you shift your
behavior some of those preferences hang
around for a while but sooner or later
they realign to your new behavior and
you feel like a different person you
have a new identity if you describe
yourself you know oh you know I'm such a
hopeless slob you know at a certain
point you don't feel like a hopeless
slob anymore because you've done these
things you haven't become you know and
your preferences start to be for order
you know because you've trained yourself
to appreciate order in one area it
starts to spread that's like a
cornerstone but two at a time beyond
that you're just gonna short-circuit
yourself don't be impatient that's why
New Year's resolutions fail patience yes
it now goes bad yes well it shouldn't
happen if it does happen you have to go
back you know and keep going you
shouldn't ever move on to a new one four
weeks is sort of a standard but if it
feels really wobbly and like it needs a
lot of support don't move on to anything
else until it's ingrained
yes
I my main question is about planning
like this is something that when I tell
myself I'm like I'm gonna do things once
a week or something and then if everyone
not heard it over and over again
schedule an exact time and a bhoot say
you're gonna go but then with schedules
that change travel and all that how
would you suggest you know because then
I'm like well I said I would do this
Mondays but this Monday the next room is
I'm out of town okay so I mean I think
that's a very common thing scheduling
can change you're looking for the best
time that you're most likely to be able
to do this thing so if you think about
travel or three-day weekends or personal
things you might not do it on a Monday
you're gonna skip if you have a
something that's scheduled there's gonna
be times that you skip it but if you do
it most of the time it you know it will
succeed and it I wouldn't say like if
you missed a Monday I wouldn't say don't
go Tuesday you probably will want to go
Tuesday
I only say only measure yourself on
Monday because you want to get the day
that's the best that you can maintain if
you say okay Tuesday's as good as Monday
Wednesdays as good as Monday
tomorrow's as good as today if any day
is as good as today you'll get to the
weekend and you won't even know what
happened why did I not go cousin no day
is good no day is good for a change in
behavior what's good is to do everything
the same way all the time so yeah I mean
look I had like ah a thing of paying
bills on Monday nights because my
husband had a class and he came home and
the thing was I would just go straight
and go through all my paperwork and do
it and then he gave up that class and
the thing went away and for months I had
like I couldn't get on top of it I had
to come up with another time that was
good so things do shift around and so
you know you have to kind of be flexible
in that way but if you're completely
flexible and you're always a good reason
for not doing it you will you want to
get it's a habit space right
one thing about going to the gym I think
like a lot of us and want to go to the
gym we want to be fitter but we don't
really imagine all that business of
you're tired after you go to work you
get out onto the floor you exercise and
then you have to get back into your
tired work clothes they can't go home
the whole thing you know it's a lot of
pieces
that are uncomfortable you know in the
book one person goes to the gym for 15
minutes 15 minutes to row that's it
but what is candy about that resolution
is it's going to the gym and doing all
the steps and leaving they get you the
habit not whether or not you spend 15
minutes or an hour it's like figuring
out what is the gym near you what's the
right time to go and if you say I'm just
gonna go for 15 minutes you said well
that's not gonna do anything yeah it'll
do something it'll neurologically embed
that feeling of going to the gym and
doing all those steps somebody else yes
yes so I actually did I have to be
honest and say once I had a contract I
did take some time off work but I did go
back to work and had to keep writing and
I get up an hour earlier to write on
weekdays so I sort of adjusted my sleep
so that I can get up it's my best hour
for writing and at first it wasn't an
hour at first it was really just 20
minutes just to get 20 minutes in and I
sort of successfully moved that back for
me but I love getting up early and
writing down I'd always been kind of a
late morning person so it just goes to
show you yes more so obviously yeah
which has a lot behind it and as far as
I'm not thinking of other things and
people are talking at you important
people in your life how do you break
those things down to make that like a
micro resolution okay that's a great
question well what is listening well to
you give me a characteristic of it is it
well it's giving it's empathetic
maybe not interrupting more for me it's
about not I'm already thinking about
other things okay yeah okay this is what
I would say you're not gonna listen well
all the time if your head is in that
space so pick a time where it's really
important to listen well it could be
when your kid comes home from school and
your first interaction with them you
tell yourself I'm gonna give my kid my
attention I'm not going to go to the
phone I'm gonna do it and you'll
practice it in a limited space it could
be you know when my partner tells me
about this special project that they're
doing that bores the tears out of me
I'm going to pay special attention and
I'm going to ask a question okay it
could be as simple as that
I'm gonna be pay attention when I hear
about this project I'm going to ask a
question there's a story of somebody in
the book who had a regular job and their
husband had a creative job and his
creative job allowed him to stay up late
and work in front of the TV and stuff
and always wanted to tell her about the
movie he had seen the night before and
she hated it it was like oh my god and
it was a movie she'd seen and she felt
some resentment that she had to go get
up at 6:00 and he stayed up till 3:00
and when did she just and she kept
signaling him that she didn't like it
she said that she was so answer she
couldn't even sit still she never looked
at him all these kinds of and then one
day she decided okay I'm gonna I'm gonna
give him my entire attention when he
tells me about the movie and she never
really got interested in the movies but
she did give and she asked questions and
she said the goodwill that was created
between them was enormous she couldn't
believe it you know when she stopped
just fighting like oh god oh my god here
comes like it's gonna tell me about
Nashville you know she does listen to it
so I think if you pick a specific
instance where it really counts
and practiced there it'll bleed into
other areas it's a it you know it's a
skill to listen well yes
we couldn't see of the abolitionist I
think that
yeah there's a lot in the science of
queuing so in a certain way and to the
point this young this woman made over
here about you know what about Monday or
whatever yeah the things that I have
that are once a month things I have to
cue myself so if it's like I'm gonna
review you know I have one thing where I
review bills not to see if they're
accurate but to see if there's any way
to save money you know I actually have
something in my calendar that tells me
the day is coming up a couple of times
to remember so that I do it it is easier
to do it daily
I think catching cues is a very you know
for things schedule scheduling can be
difficult if it's just once a month or
whatever but on the other hand it's very
concrete these kind of cues between
people you know where you want not to be
defensive or not to complain or you want
to remember to do something differently
you know that requires kind of isolating
something in the environment to cue you
and you're responding to cues all the
time you know if somebody brings Donuts
that's a cue they bring pizza that's a
cue you go to the store and they put out
samples you're being the environment is
serving up cues all the time so if you
say well I'm just never gonna eat any
food I didn't plan to eat that's not
gonna work but if you say okay I'm not
doing donuts you can do it so kind of
trying to find that one cue can be
really critical piggybacking on things
you know with my notebook habit I kept
forgetting to take it out at the
beginning of the meeting and one reason
that irritated me as I'd have to stop
and fight it so I started saying as soon
as I slip off my back I take out my book
I slip off my back I take off my book
and I had never thought of slipping off
my hand back as a habit or a behavior
but it is you know it's something I do
all the time I sit down I slip off my
hand back check out the book and so in
that way I was able to get a better flow
with it so I hope if you get the book
there there's some other things in there
that might prove helpful anybody else
oh thanks you guys were great really I
appreciate it
thanks a lot good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
