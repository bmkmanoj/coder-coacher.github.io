say sometimes it can be about doing kind
of desk research so doing reading
understanding what state of the art is
quite often we develop prototype
technologies in house to try and explore
things like and new messaging devices on
your communication devices and often
will work in teams to come up with ideas
for those and then some of the some of
my colleagues are some of the engineers
and designers that I work with all will
kind of build something and then it's
more my role to do feels those of that
so it's often my job to go and take that
to people and maybe deploy it leave it
with families or with individuals for
maybe up to three months and just kind
of go back interview them try and
understand what they think of it and
then see what we can learn for that from
that to inform the design of Technology
I think the best thing is probably
working with such a mix of people and I
really value being in an
interdisciplinary team and working with
they're getting to work with social
scientists but also gains work with
designers and computer scientists that's
really interesting it really makes it
more varied so I did my degree in
psychology and and while I was while I
was in my final year of my psychology
degree i did a module in human factors
which is was basically about usability
and we touched on some technology and
new interfaces within that and then at
the same time when i was at university I
was trying I was beginning to learn how
to develop websites and from that I
ended up doing a master's in
human-computer interaction which is
basically about designing interfaces and
supporting people in interacting with
technology and from there it was quite
actually quite unnatural thread although
it feels sounds quite old to have a
psychologist working for a company like
Microsoft it was quite a natural
progression to end up somewhere like
this where obviously understanding how
people use technology and using that to
feed into design is really valuable well
I would say the importance of working
with really and quite inspirational
people like I take a lot of inspiration
I think from the people that I work with
so that's really important and I think
all through my career like when I was in
my PhD and right now as a research
assistant all the people who have been
working with have been really great and
that's been really valuable
I know there's lots of little things
like when you get some work published or
I mean there were there are big moments
I suppose like when I got my PhD that's
like a proud moment or like when I got a
job here that was a proud moment
when I was kind of choosing my a-levels
I wanted to be a psychologist that's how
I ended up doing a degree in psychology
and I think I had quite a general skills
I wouldn't say I was like we gifted in
any one area I kind of did a spread of
subjects I did like English and I did
biology and I did math so I kind of I
did sociology so I cut across social
sciences and science subjects I just
think there's plenty of space women in
engineering and science and I think that
being actively encouraged to get into
those fields so they should we shouldn't
feel a retina barriers where they should
go for it
