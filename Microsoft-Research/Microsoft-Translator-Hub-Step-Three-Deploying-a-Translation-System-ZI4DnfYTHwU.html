in this video you'll learn how to deploy
a translation system and solicit
feedback from the community after a set
of trainings has been conducted go to
the project details page and select a
training with a good blue score the blue
score is a metric that you can use to
compare different training runs and
decide on which data and settings
produce a better result you may want to
consult with project reviewers before
deciding that the quality is sufficient
for deployment in the training results
page of the selected training you'll see
the option to deploy translator system
click on that deploy translator system
to submit a request to deploy a training
run an email will be sent to Microsoft
with the details of the training and
information required to process the
deployment please allow several business
days for the deployment request to be
processed you will receive an email
confirming the availability of your
translator system as soon as the
deployment has taken place after a
translator system has been deployed you
can use the test translation page to
access the translator system and use it
to provide translations to verify the
quality of a translator system go to the
test translator link under the community
menu enter the test sentence into the
left box and then click translate the
translation of the source sentence or
sentences will be displayed in the two
box here on the right after you've
tested the deployed translator system
you can then begin sharing documents
that have been translated by your
translator system and solicit feedback
from your community go to the community
pulldown menu and select invite reviews
select the documents you wish to share
and click the share button these
documents will then become visible to
members in both the reviewer and
co-owner roles you can also share the
document with people who are not in

review documents go to the shared
document tab and select the documents
that you want to have reviewed and then

email address or addresses and then
click the send button
let's look at the process of reviewing
documents and submitting alternate

alternate translations provided by
reviewers as a project owner go to
invite reviews under the community menu

further edit the translation select edit
you will have to repeat this process for
each sentence translation once you've
received sufficient feedback from your
reviewers you can decide to retrain your
translator system based on reviewer
inputs or additional data you may have
uploaded to do this go back to the
project details page and start a new
