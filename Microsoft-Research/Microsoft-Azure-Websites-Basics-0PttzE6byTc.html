of using Azure's websites feature in
particular we'll take a look at how you
can publish and configure auto scaling
of sites will also look at the gallery
of web applications that are available
for us to easily use and then we'll walk
through a couple of examples creating a
simple wordpress blog and then a more
sophisticated example that plots
earthquake data using bing maps to recap
things we covered in the azure overview
video windows azure websites allows you
to build great websites using some of
those popular frameworks in just seconds
and a few mouse clicks you can use a
free tier of service and build and host
a website at no cost using just a basic
as your account as you want to scale up
you can pay for more compute resources
as necessary there are many different
ways to code for and deploy on to as
your website's you can use Windows Mac
OS 10 or different flavors of Linux as
your development environment and
seamlessly deploy your site into a sure
using the azure portal web interface
it's extremely easy to provision
configure and debug your website
furthermore there are many great
performance monitoring features built
right into the azure portal dashboard
there are a variety of different ways to
manage your as your website's code base
ranging from simple FTP to dropbox
integration or deeper integration with
source control systems like Team
Foundation server and get there are also
ways to integrate hosted source control
providers like github codeplex and
bitbucket with as your website so that
your deployment is tied to check-ins
into those systems as your website's
supports a number of web frameworks the
ones shown here work out of the box
classic asp asp net PHP node.js and
pythons django web framework however you
can also host a custom fast cgi handler
which can then interface with many other
kinds of web frameworks one of the key
features of using Azure websites is that
it provides painless and even automatic
scaling as your web traffic load
fluctuates well now look at the scaling
capabilities in more detail there are
three tiers
free shared and standard the free and
shared tears are both multi-tenant and
are shown in green this means that your
website and its associated code runs on
a machine that is also hosting many
other websites the other so-called
tenants that share a machine with you do
not affect your code or the appearance
of your website in any way however
sudden changes in their load could cause
temporary resource strain on the system
which would then also lead to temporary
impacts to your website performance
because of the shared machine there are
daily resource usage quotas on the free
and shared instances these quotas apply
to CPU time both per minute and per day
memory used and bandwidth the standard
tier provides your site with its own
dedicated virtual machine which better
isolates your site from potential
resource contention by other sites note
that this does not mean that you are
suddenly burdened with managing the
virtual machine itself that is still
handled by asher for you and you are
still just coding up the website however
because you get the entire virtual
machine your resource utilization is
limited to the capability of the virtual
machine and there's no daily quota on
your usage with azure scaling you can
start with a single free instance on a
shared multi-tenant machine then as your
web traffic increases you can tell Azure
to start more instances of your website
those will still live in a multi-tenant
machine but your website will be able to
handle more load as your website
continues to grow in popularity if you
find that the baseline amount of traffic
to your site requires more compute power
and you're running into quota limits
then you can move to using a standard
instance this gives you your own virtual
machine and only your site will run on
it with a standard instance you scale
your website in response to traffic and
load by allocating an entire new virtual
machine and firing up your website there
with standard instances you can also run
multiple as your website's on a single
virtual machine that is dedicated to
just your instances for instance you
might have an image gallery for your
research results
blog and a private content management
system for your research team you can
put all three websites into the same
virtual machine this gives you more
control and visibility into website
performance since only your own sites
will affect each other and you can look
at them all via the azure management
portal when you choose to put multiple
standard instance websites into a shared
virtual machine you can still scale up
with a simple slider in the azure portal
all of your web sites will be able to
access and use new virtual machines as
they're added Azure can automatically
scale your website up and down with cpu
utilization this is a really nice
feature that lets you tell Azure when to
turn on more instances as existing ones
get too bogged down with load when the
load subsides as you can then turn off
the new instances this auto scaling as
it's called is a good example of how a
platform like azure can help you get
more bang for your buck by building your
website on top of well-established web
frameworks azure can automatically
deploy and remove properly configured
servers for you you then have a much
more direct connection between your
computer and the dollars you need to
spend on computing infrastructure you
might think that this is not that big of
a deal for something like a simple blog
or photo gallery but the same pay only
for what you use principal plays out
across all of the azure services and
features as your website's includes a
large number of open source web
application frameworks and templates
these range from blogs and discussion
board software to very powerful content
management systems which can power an
entire business or labs knowledge
management needs web frameworks like
Django and nodejs are extremely
open-ended and flexible and can be used
to build very powerful data dashboards
and web applications now let's take a
look at a couple of examples of using as
your website's first we'll look at
creating a wordpress site in this
process we'll see how easy it is to
provision and configure a new open
source web application in this case
WordPress using the azure portal if you
want to follow along with this video
you'll need to have created and as your
account already we'll start by logging
into windows azure com we neither click
the portal button he
or we can type managed dot Windows Azure
calm after typing in your credentials
you'll be taken to the management
dashboard this shows all of the windows
azure resources that we've currently
provisioned don't worry if your list is
empty in the bottom left corner you'll
find a new button that allows us to
begin using Windows Azure services
clicking this button brings up a window
which allows us to select the type of as
your service we'd like to use in our
case we want a new website so we go to
compute and then website then we select
from gallery in this window will choose
blogs and then select WordPress now we
click the next arrow in the bottom right
corner of the window on this next screen
we can configure our new wordpress app
we enter a URL name of our choice I sure
will check to make sure that our name is
unique and not already taken by some
other website hosted at as your
website's net we will keep this option
to create a new my sequel database and
here in the region drop-down will leave
it as West us if you're following along
with this video you'll want to pick one
that's closest to wherever you're
located now we click the next button and
we just create an arbitrary name for our
my sequel database it doesn't really
matter and the auto-generated one will
work just fine however the region it's
in should be the same as the region that
we created the website in here we also
have to click the check box to agree to
license terms to use my sequel now we
click the check box and azure will go
and create a website for us we can see
here that the provisioning of the server
and the configuration of wordpress is
happening for us automatically if we
give this a little bit of time the
status will change from creating to
running great now our website is running
the next step is to configure our blog
itself through the WordPress interface
to do this we should just navigate to
our website if you've forgotten the URL
for your website you can click here and
then click the dashboard scrolling down
a little bit we can see the URL of the
site we can just click this link and
i'll take us to our website
because this is a default WordPress
install it starts up now with the
configuration page for WordPress will
enter some basic title will create the
admin username we like to use to
administer this blog and now we create a
password for it as I enter my password
you notice that there is a password
strength indicator that changes to
reflect the strengths of the password
I've entered because this is simply a
demonstration I've picked a fairly
simple password if you're creating a
wordpress site for your own use you
should pick something that it's more
secure here i will enter my email
address so i can receive updates and
notifications from wordpress and here i
can choose whether or not to allow
search engines to index the site and
just like that I'm all set I can click
install wordpress and wordpress will
finalize the installation now I can
login after logging in I can create a
new post I'll save the draft and with
one click I can publish it if I click
here I can view my post and this will my
blog page looks like if we go back to
the wordpress configuration page we can
change the appearance of our site very
easily here I'll select a new theme I'll
click activate and now when I visit my
site i have a new theme one of the
differences in using Azure to host our
WordPress site versus using a hosted in
the cloud service like wordpress com is
that this is a full installation of
WordPress and we can add plugins and do
much more customization with this
website then is possible on wordpress
com now we'll do a more complex example
using Django a Python web framework and
Bing Maps our web app will monitor the
last 20 earthquakes and plot them on a
big map to manage the website we will be
using an ftp client so if you're
following along with this video you'll
need to already have a Windows Azure
account additionally you'll need to have
TP client like FileZilla or winscp to
get started we'll go to our windows as
your management portal
after logging in you'll see the
management dashboard of Windows Azure
it'll list all of your Windows Azure
resources that you've currently
provisioned don't worry if there's
nothing there now we'll click web sites
and this shows all the websites we've
created in my case there are none to
create a new Django site will click this
new button then we'll go to compute
website from gallery here we have
different types of websites we can
provision Django is a app framework so
we'll go there and select Django will
click the next arrow and now we can
enter a URL for a website this has to be
unique name under the azure websites net
top-level domain it's possible to later
on map other domain names to your site
but Microsoft provides this domain for
all websites created using Azure i'm
going to pick my django 99 for the
region drop down i'm going to keep it at
west us but again if you're following
along you should pick one that's closest
to you now we'll click the checkmark and
we'll wait a little while for our
website to get created we can see on the
dashboard that our website status is now
running will click on this it'll take us
to the web site dashboard now we're
ready to code up our site and upload it
to a shiur to do this we'll use ftp but
before we can use ftp we need to
configure the deployment credentials to
do that we'll go to dashboard and then
click setup deployment credentials now
we enter a new username and password
these are not our as your credentials
this is a new one will use just for
using ftp to access this website great
diploma credentials were set now if
you're following along you should
probably write down that username and
password on a sheet of paper so you
don't forget it or store it using some
kind of password keeper software if you
ever do forget it you can always click
the reset diploma credentials and that
will allow you to reset the username and
password now we're going to go to
FileZilla and check out the code on our
website for the hostname
we'll just paste in our ftp s the secure
FTP hostname for a username now this is
very important it's not just the short
username we typed in rather this entire
deployment ftp user and the password is
the one that we just created great we've
connected to our site and under site
then ww root this is the source code for
our Django application one thing we can
also do is click the Browse button and
that will open up a new tab letting us
see the basic default django site that's
been created so this website is being
generated by the code stored in this
directory as you may be aware this video
and the related videos are based on the
azure for research training courses that
microsoft teaches around the world the
code for this example can be found in
the complete course zip file that is
available on this website inside here
under day 1 section 2 as your websites
you'll find the code that I'm using if
we to actually take one of these courses
in person you would take the contents of
the begin folder inside exercise to
begin and you would modify these in
accord with the step-by-step
instructions for this hands-on learning
exercise however for the sake of clarity
and brevity in this video I'll just walk
us through the final result in the end
folder so you can see inside the end
folder there's a managed py that's used
by Django to run a variety of utility
commands and inside here there's a
subdirectory called Django application
this is where the bulk of the logic lies
there's five files inside here and then
a subdirectory templates and there's one
more file inside there the underscore
underscore in it py file is an empty
initialization file that tells Python
that this subdirectory this folder is
actually a Python package settings py
contains the settings and configuration
for this Jango project let's take a look
at that real quick
inside here the only things we had to
modify our the template ders and here
we've written some code to tell Django
to look inside our templates
subdirectory for additional view
templates next we'll look at view pi
this is a new file that was created
during the exercise let's walk through
the code it contains a single function
called earthquake this function first
loads a CSV file from the USGS and then
it writes it to a temporary location
then using this csv module in Python we
read the CSV file line by line and break
it up at every line we convert the
geographic coordinates into floating
point values and we store all of these
values inside a list called data then we
load the earthquake HTML template inside
the templates directory and then we
render this template replacing its
contents with the list of floating-point
tuples representing geographic
coordinates inside the variable name
data finally our earthquake function
returns an HTTP response object which is
then returned by django and served up as
a web page next we'll look at urls pi
this is a file that django uses to map
urls to actual functions in this case we
add the line here that maps any URL that
starts with earthquake and then has a
slash to the earthquake function we just
implemented in views py that earthquake
function is imported up here at the top
the wsgi GUI file or whiskey as it's
pronounced in the Python world is just a
boilerplate file that Django uses to
interface with the underlying web server
system it does not need to be modified
for this example let's look at our
template this is the HTML web page that
is ultimately served up it's a template
because inside this web page certain
things like this particular template
variable will be replaced by Django
with the values that we've created and
passed into the template one thing you
will note here in this template is that
the function get map which actually uses
the Microsoft being Maps JavaScript
classes has a placeholder for the
credentials these credentials are used
by our JavaScript code to connect to the
Bing servers and retrieve the map data
so we need to go to this URL and get
some credentials to sign in to the Bing
Maps account Center we can just use our
same as your account credentials now we
can go here to create or view keys will
enter earthquake for the application
name the URL should be the URL of our
appt the key type should be basic
application type will set as education
now we enter the characters for our
CAPTCHA this one's a little hard to read
so I'll get a new image much easier the
application URL needs to include HTTP
and now we have a key now we'll go back
to our file editor and paste in that key
value file save now we'll go back to
FileZilla and we'll upload this code
great the file transfer has completed
now we'll go back to our website note
the earthquake at the end of the URL and
we see it's an interactive being map if
we click the show earthquake button now
we get the pins for the 20 most recent
earthquakes so what we've seen here is
that we were able to very easily have as
your provision a new django web server
for us and we were able to upload our
website code and have the changes go
live now downloading a csv file and
processing it is a fairly
straightforward example but these kinds
of tasks are very common in scientific
analysis and I hope that in this video
you've seen just how easy it can be to
use as you to create new web apps and
services in support of your research
again for more information you can
always visit the windows azure for
research training site and get technical
papers as well as look at the training
schedule of courses that are held around
the world thanks for watching this video
on as your website's we looked at what
the as your website's feature is all
about the various tiers of service and
scaling and we build some example sites
I hope you're now encouraged and excited
to create your own sites using Windows
