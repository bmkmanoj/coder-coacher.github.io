you
I'm John Boylan and I coordinate this
this series as well as some as the other
studio 99 efforts with some of the
studio 99 starts this afternoon we have
Thomas dual who is a neurologist
neuroscientist and sound artist
currently works with the Swedish
Neuroscience Institute as well as being
an affiliate professor at the University
of Washington's DX arts digital
experimental arts program and we brought
Thomas to talk about the project of the
work he's been doing using and selfi
Graham exactly graph a
electroencephalograph to to generate
sound and music we in a in a term be
calling the encephalo phone so anyway
that's about it for me Thomas so I'll be
talking about the encephalo phone so
it's a musical instrument that I have
been working on that's driven by thought
using EEG or electroencephalogram I'll
tell you a little bit about EEG in
general and how it works
I'll talk a bit about the history of
people taking EEG and turning it into
sound and music and then I'll talk to
you about my device more specifically
and then I have some I have some videos
with demonstrations and feel free to ask
questions along the way I'll get fairly
technical I can get more technical and
get less technical stop me uh feel free
to interject so just developing personal
background John touched over this a
little bit but the things that brought
me to this place
to to create this device are my my main
job is I'm a neurologist with a stroke
team at Swedish Neuroscience Institute
and I also read
Iggy's for them with the epilepsy group
I'm a PhD in neuroscience and most
recently as a my postdoctoral work and
working on processing of complex sound
and specifically music in the cognitive
process
I also amateur musician and I have a
certificate and music composition from
New England Conservatory and I practice
as a sound artist mostly doing audio
installation artwork and field
recordings and then I have a studio
slash laboratory I just call it a studio
lab because I don't it's really halfway
between laboratory and art studio kind
of combines these things that in scape
arts which is a in the International
District here I'm also an affiliate
professor in digital or it's an
experimental art the DX arts program at
UW and I teach a class called art and
brain and there's an art and brain
laboratory that we we have there as well
so so it's a whole lot of parts and they
all these parts kind of come together in
this development of this device I call
it a cephalopod so it's a novel musical
instrument it generates musical notes
from conscious control without movement
in real time uses EEG which I'll talk
about some more and uses intentional
control which is different as I'll show
you then people's developments in the
past with EEG rather than sort of a
passive generation of music you can
actually control it consciously and
intentionally in real time
so essentially you control you the music
with your thoughts and I have a patent
pending on the one that device so eg
it's a medical diagnostic technique it
reads electrical brain waves brain waves
would be a colloquial term but it's just
reads the electrical activity the brain
he uses metal electrodes and a
conductive gel placed on the scalp
that's me with with an EEG cap on it was
developed to diagnose epilepsy and it's
still how it's used primarily and sleep
disorders and it's also used
increasingly in neuroscience research so
its advantages are it's very fast
response so millisecond response it's
also non-invasive in this format
you put put a cap or electrodes with gel
on your head and and it's very
non-invasive there is invasive EEG and
we do that in the hospital for
intractable epilepsy patients where
we'll cut cut their skull up and and
plates electrodes either implanted or
placed directly on the brain and the
signal is much better than it is here
but I wouldn't go and do that to you to
help to just to generate music but in
general this form at the scalp EEG is is
very non-invasive so I don't have to
inject any drugs or give you any
radioactive tracers to to measure
disadvantages are the localization is
pretty poor we can kind of tell what
general region of the brain but specific
localization is not very good we can't
get down to two millimeter resolution
not until we did we get intracranial
when we cut the skeleton but in this
format not not great localization and
also there's a lot of noise from non
brain signals so when we're listening
today I use sound metaphors a lot but
when we're listening to the brain
electrically at the scalp it's quite
quiet we're talking about micro volt
signal to to a 100 or so micro volts or
the typical ranges around there there's
all kinds of non brain signal that can
drown out any G so you have to be very
if to listen very carefully it would be
like being in a in a loud party and
you're talking to somebody who has a
very soft voice you have to either get
in another room and get all the other
people out of the way or get really
close to them and and just tune
everything else out too in order to hear
it so that's that's a that's a big
disadvantage of EEG scalp EEG so what
it's measuring is synchronous activity
of many neurons many nerve cells at once
not one or two but a thousands that's
what's required to measure at all if you
have a hundred neurons you're not going
to measure that at the scalp and it's
estimated that you need approximately
six square centimeters of surface of the
cortex in order to actually get a signal
to top that off these signals are volume
conducted through CSF cerebral spinal
fluid and the meninges the the
the coverings of the brain and the skull
and the scalp and skin and all that so
that attenuates a signal so then by the
time you get out here the signals that
you're measuring are in the range of 2
to 200 microvolts then there's all these
non brain signals that have talked about
that can cause artifact and it can cause
misinterpretation and they often do of
EEG signals so muscle for one if you you
know the muscles of the muscles of
mastication of swallowing if you all
bite down you know this there's the
masseter right here pops out and then
even the temporalis it's this muscle all
the way up here and you're if you bite
down you can feel it all the way up here
there's some some muscle activating
that's millivolt range so a thousand
times stronger signal so if you're
chewing you're talking you're biting
down it's going to drown out the EEG
signal other things
there's the orbit of the eye so when you
blink you move your eyes around there's
a big dipole and that gets measured so
that's that's another source of error
the tongue itself has a big dipole so if
you're talking if you're chewing again
it'll cause noise so where are you
measuring them you're you're really
measuring when you're measuring at the
scalp you're you're measuring voltage
potentials or charge movement across
these neuronal membranes across these
cells of many neurons at once again on
the order of thousands are required at
minimum it's the the recorded EEG is
generated by the cortex so it's only the
surface of the brain you're not
measuring deep structures at all and I'm
to top it off the signal needs to be
perpendicular to the scalp so there all
kinds of nerve cells that are pointing
in different directions and you're only
measuring the ones that are pointing to
the scalp and you're summing all these
these things called the epsp ipsps
they're postsynaptic potentials you're
not measuring action potentials which
are what people often think of when they
think of communication between neurons
so why is all that important well the
thing is you're only you're really only
measuring a subset of the whole whole
electrical activity the brain you're of
a small subset so that makes
interpretation difficult so we we use
this international system for placing
the electrodes so that everywhere in the
world is the same
I read an EEG from Istanbul or from
Shanghai or from Wenatchee I'm gonna
have the same format come out so I'll
know what electrode is what part of the
brain so we use anatomical landmarks so
that Union which is this little you can
feel it in the back of your skull
there's a little protrudes out there and
the occiput it's that's the inion and
then the nation is this low point in the
in the nose where people's glasses the
bridges all the electrodes are placed
with percentages of the circle that
circumference or half circumference and
it's called the International 1020
electrode system because they're ten and
twenty percent of these various
distances even numbers on the right odd
numbers are on the left and then their
regions of brain are labeled as well so
f is frontal C is central T is temporal
peeper idle o occipital so that you have
a you know where at and this is the very
very very standardized around the world
system then you you have electrodes each
of them are measuring voltages and then
as I'm sure you all know the most you
measure voltages those potential
differences so it's something it's a
voltage relative to another voltage
should be relative to ground it can be
relative to another electrode so the
different mountain montages that you use
you can measure one next to another so
bipolar montage is a very popular one
you're measuring the voltage of one
electrode to the one adjacent to it and
that's that's what we will mostly be
looking at you can do a referential
where they're all related to one you can
have a grunt this sort of a a if it's
not truly a ground but a reference on
the forehead or on the neck and all the
other electrodes are reference to that
this is what a normal EEG looks like
this is one of the bipolar montages so
what we're looking at is a whole lot of
squiggly lines but going across the page
is time so on the x-axis that's about 10
seconds going across and each one of
these essentially represents another a
single electrode there there one
relative to the other as I mentioned but
this is about 20 20 electrodes they're
going across and as you can see there's
some periodic activity there's some
regular waveforms that are kind
in a periodic fashion they're not just
there's some variation obviously but you
can see some regular frequencies coming
in there so we take all that and we
divide it up into these frequency ranges
the slowest they're pretty arbitrary
honestly they're just categories of
frequency ranges to help us sort them
out the slowest are called the Delta up
to 4 Hertz and then 4 to 8 is felt theta
and then alpha and beta and then there's
gamma which is even faster and the
general rule is as you go down to the
slower that's the more sleep and more
less wakefulness and less attentiveness
and as you go up it's more attentive and
and that part of the brain is more
active in general that's the general
there are exceptions this is another
normal EEG and there's some interesting
patterns here on the left it's the same
setup so this is about 10 seconds and
about each one of these squiggly lines
is a different electrode on the left the
subject has their eyes open and then
they close their eyes and these are some
normal patterns so with their eyes open
we have these things with the black
arrow is called lambda waves those are
waves that appear in the visual cortex
in the back of the brain when it's very
active and it's looking around so if
you're reading a book or scanning or
looking up at the ceiling
those lambda waves will come out it
means your your eyes are open and you're
scanning something actively and then
there's you can probably see a big dip
right in the middle not the red arrows
but right to the left that's the eye so
that's that artifact I was talking about
the eye closes every time you close your
eyes you have something called a Bell's
phenomenon your eyes actually go up so
you close your eyes you blink even when
you blink your eyes go up and then come
back down it's a reflex you can't help
it you may not believe me but it happens
so as that goes up the dipole of the the
between the cornea and the retina causes
a big deflection so that's a source of
error that big dip but then after it you
see this fast alpha frequency so it's
it's around 10 Hertz there that's the
red arrows so that's again the visual
cortex but now with the eyes closed it's
it's not know
under receiving input like it was over
on the left and it's its resting it's
sort of a holding pattern it's it's the
that part of the brain saying I'm here
I'm ready I'm awake but there's no input
even if you're thinking you're not gonna
be that should you're thinking about
imagery so people asked us off and your
eyes are closed and you're just
imagining things you still get this
resting and you won't get that active
scanning type of pattern other normal
patterns there's something called the
p300 it's an event related potential so
this is a pattern that is basically
recognizes novelty it could be a visual
novelty it could be an auditory novelty
it could be tactile so all of a sudden
the elephant appears and you you'd get a
p300 because it's new and you haven't
seen this elephant before and then I go
back and I show you the elephant again
and you got another p300 around the
third time the p300 will go away because
there's no longer novel it's really a
novelty kind of detector pori I should
rather say it's not a it represents the
detection of novelty rather than it's a
detector then you you kind of get used
to the to the to the elephant the
elephant's no longer new and interesting
and the brain gets very bored quickly
with things that get repeated but then
if all of a sudden I show up them
there's a monkey then BOOM you'll get
another p300 and then the monkey comes
back maybe another one and then maybe
the third time you're the monkeys no
longer interesting anymore
and if I go back to the elephant now the
elephants knew again so you'll get
another p300 that's that's how it works
it's it's a normal signal it's a and the
reason I bring it up is people use that
as a trigger for for various things for
control of devices and with the EEG so I
mentioned a lot of this noise I don't
probably don't need to go over all of it
again but just to give you some examples
on the left a picture of those big
deflection and that's the eye again when
you blink you get this huge deflection
but other sources of noise can be just
poor conductance you don't have good gel
contact between the electrode and the
scalp or electrical noise cell phones
nearby other electronics in the hospital
will have IV pumps and things in the
electrical noise can be a problem
because they're you know these are very
sensitive
electrodes at high dynamic range muscle
so I mentioned like the chewing muscle
up here in the the temporalis that's
what's going on there's all that red
very fast
activity that just looks like a big red
smear at the top of that that's that's
all muscle so you can imagine trying to
read underneath that it's pretty darn
difficult it's a it's a it's a big
source of problem so people have to be
kind of quiet not using their muscles
even just standing up with an EEG on the
muscles that are keeping your head up
that are that are propping up you know
the neck muscle is just propping up your
head they'll they'll create a lot of
noise so the best way to get a good
reading is to have someone laying down
and quiet and not chewing and not
talking and and then another another
issue is of course that besides the fact
we have all there's noise a lot of these
signals we recognize as patterns a weak
we we have a general sense of what they
represent but we don't know what a lot
of the rhythms mean quite honestly so
people have been trying to harness the
EEG for creating devices that control
control things for a long time so brain
computer interfaces I really need to
update that photo that's a like a 1982
monitor but it's a stock photo so the
idea of a brain computer interface is a
direct communication between the brain
and the computer and you might use it to
restore or even augment cognitive or
motor functions so restore in the sense
of someone who's got motor disability
augment in the sense of a normal person
he could control things without moving
and we've been researching this for you
know 50 years or so started at UCLA
under a grant from DARPA but it's the
BCI research has been going on for a
very long time now almost 50 years and
even even after 50 years we're kind of
bumping up against the limits of the
technology of EEG and the best groups
really achieve about 75 percent accuracy
with a lot of training really good
protocols so this is why does that
happen it's because of all the things I
was telling you about with the artifact
the noise and then to top it off we the
specific lack of specificity we don't
again we don't know what a lot of this
means there very few signals that we
actually know the meaning of yeah
willing to be invasive you know patrols
and his goals and stick electrodes
wherever you wanted to mm-hmm with
almost all of these problems go away a
lot of them do we then have a whole
nother body of knowledge we need to
acquire with very few subjects because I
died I worked with I did I did a
fellowship in surgical epilepsy at
Harborview and we one of the reasons I
went there was because they did a lot of
surgical epilepsy so we did a lot of a
lot of this one of them probably the one
of the biggest centers in the world for
and really really wanted to do this is
the neurosurgeon I worked with also
worked on brain computer interfaces
intracranial II but the basic answer is
yes the what makes it complicated is the
number of people that you you can
imagine yeah it's it's it's a very
invasive we're that's not the purpose of
why we cut their skull open in the first
place
we're trying to find out where their
focus of epilepsy is so that we can take
out the smallest piece of brain possible
and then we have to consent these people
so you can imagine the ethical barriers
do you mind if I make some music out of
those these electrodes that are
implanted in your brain in surgery well
don't worry we'll still take care of
your epilepsy but we we can at we can't
actually ethically consent people but
the it's access is very difficult and
one of the reasons I was doing research
there is because I had access to
patients after patients who will consent
while they're still awake
yeah but the answer the basic answer is
yes a lot the the noise goes away but
then we have we still have that
specificity problem like we have a
exactly yeah but they don't believe
Gibson models but I guess the first
novel with where you guys can plug in
with a jack mm-hmm you you have to still
have full access the brain don't you you
couldn't just Jack it in well
not necessarily because you could yeah
you don't have there you know we
generally are using triggers a from a
very specific part of the brain so you
don't necessarily need the whole access
to the whole thing yeah and we will have
we'd have patients who have electrodes
coming out of their skull and they're
able to walk around they stay in the
hospital while that happens but they can
walk around go through the room they're
talking they're awake and they have
electrodes coming directly out of their
brain yeah believe me that wasn't you
know maybe a lot better that way and and
ethically it's actually I'll talk about
it later but I'm you know using this not
only to generate music but also for
cognitive rehab and for neurological
rehab and for that for those people that
might be a very ethical use of that no
technology so people have been doing
turning EEG into sound and music since
the very beginning of EEG really so 1929
was the earliest description this guy
hands burger and a few few mmm like
weeks ago I noticed that there's a
strange piece of brain in this photo was
the only photo I have that's burger a
little disturbing but he was the first
one to describe EEG and then 1934 these
guys Adrian Matthews replicated his
results and while they were doing that
they tried well let's try monitoring our
own EEG with sound maybe we can just
hear things so very early on people were
doing this trying to convert it into
sound and artists have been trying to
convert EEG into sound and music for art
pieces for a very long time and one of
the earlier famous ones was Alvin Lucier
the composer who had a piece called
music for solo performer and he
essentially was looking at the posterior
dominant rhythm so that sort of resting
rhythm that's in the back of the brain
when your eyes are closed but you're not
actively using your visual cortex it
turns on when you close your eyes
quite simply he was using that to drive
percussion instruments so timpani in
various
they're instruments in this performance
called music for solo performer he
collaborated with John Cage and it it
was it was a great piece conceptually
but in practice what really happened was
they he's sitting up he had a lot of
noise he didn't have good referential
it's it's it's not very good signal and
John Cage was watching the signal coming
out and realizing in real time that it's
not working so well so he John Cage kind
of cheated and adjusted the the levels
have made for a good performance but it
wasn't it wasn't scientifically very
tight I'll just put it that way this is
a really long video but there's the part
of the part of the performance was the
preparation and so I won't go through
the whole thing there'll be some others
I can show you people continue doing
variations of this this was David Rosen
boom did some pieces in the 70s there's
one called ecology of the skin we don't
have a recording of this one we have a
schematic but in a description which I
don't even quite understand but it was
called ecology of the skin they said
they were this is a direct quote
bringing signals of multiple
participants controlling mixing of music
played by keyboard performers along with
philosophy and visuals I actually don't
know what that means but we take a
natural geometric magic ice cream this
was somehow phosphene visuals for the
for the viewers who knows but anyway he
did another piece later called on being
invisible and this one was a little
better described and we have recordings
of it so it was a self-organizing
multimedia performance using
event-related potentials from two
performers brain so that related
potentials are things like the p300 that
I'd shown you earlier it's it's it's
exactly what it sounds like it's a
potential with the voltage that has that
you'll see within a some particular
event
one of the more common ones that people
use is the p300 so there the first one
was more sound just sound see ya
should maybe I will go this way to make
this happen not sure why those aren't
playing under full screen and people
continued to try to make music and sound
from EEG a big proponent of this done a
lot of works as a composer at the
University of Plymouth in the UK and
wardo Miranda who's on most of these
papers so he's used some sort of a lot
of them are passive control where you
take a recording and then transform it
into music in some way
onee views that was a little more closer
to control although not not actually
technically good control was this using
alpha and versus beta rhythms the beta
is a little more attentive and the Alpha
would be a little more resting it
depends I mean the ones that are
recorded and then you do post hoc
analysis sure you could replicate them
some of them are live real-time and so
they're improvisational so you can't
quite but you probably could go back and
say
how to do music for solo performer
that's replicable i but I mean of course
wouldn't be the exact same as the
original performance but does that
answer your question I'm meaning you
play some you play some passage of music
and then someone else tries to replicate
it that would be theoretically possible
really good control and very tight
control and good talent skill on the
performer please in these settings no
the answer is no it's a very good
question and easy for me to be critical
of others but that's there's there's big
problems with noise and a lot of these
papers here they're not they haven't
shown that they're very specific control
that's proven accuracy so I'll talk a
little bit my device but I've attempted
to do that try to demonstrate prove
prove that it's actually accurate you
have actual control real control these
guys in the bottom Stanford did a pretty
interesting thing again this is not
control but it's a they took they took
seizures and made it did a transform
that made it sound like human voices and
you can kind of hear the whole evolution
of the seizure
go through it's quite quite impressive
so then my device is a new for a few
reasons one is one of the things you
brought up but it's a new musical
instrument and a cognitive therapy
device I did it in collaboration with my
research collaborator and my
postdoctoral work who's Felix darvis
he's a
physicist at at UW in the Department of
Neurosurgery I have a patent pending on
it it's rationale is that yeah we can
only get 75% control over say a robot
arm which is not good enough if you're
if you're paralyzed and I hook you up to
a robot arm with your brain and you only
get 75% control you can see why that
would be not good enough and we haven't
really gotten much higher than that
that's not good enough for a robot arm
but it might be good enough for music as
long as doesn't sound bad and that 25%
of time it's not horrible as long as you
get a sense that you have some kind of
control even if it's not perfect it
could be good enough so the ideas music
is created with cognitively inducible
signals meaning conscious control
without moving the signals themselves
people often ask why are you thinking
about music they're not musical in
origin I'm using motor and visual cortex
to trigger the signal so you're you're
activating and deactivating motor cortex
and visual cortex we're not good enough
yet I do research on the path you know
and on how we process music cognitive
processing the music we don't know the
signals well enough I can't just look at
an EEG your brain and say you're
thinking about a sharp you know you're
thinking about B flat and there's we're
not even close to that so that's not the
signal we're using but in the future
with with better research we may be able
to get to that point where you're
actually thinking about music and making
music but this is really a transform
between thinking about something else
and turning it into music so my goals
were initially just creative they were
just to create a novel musical
instrument that would be interesting a
new performance and composition and
soloing device but naturally since I
work with patients with motor disability
with stroke patients patients with ALS
spinal cord injury I think of how could
I use this to apply to help people with
motor disability so my goals are really
in two directions one is creative and
musical and the other is
neuro rehabilitative way I'd put it so
we took our device and we have run some
experiments which were on the verge of
submitting and essentially what we did
was we wanted to just prove very simply
that we have accuracy with this device
it's not just I could attach a cap to
your head and have music come out and I
could convince you that it's working but
it would be very hard for a novice or
someone else to say oh I you know that's
that's working or it's not so what we do
is we take the signal power from either
visual or motor cortex we run two
different paradigms we convert the
signal power from that part of the brain
into a musical scale and then what
happens is that once we've done this
calibration and we've converted it into
the musical scale the calibration takes
about five minutes so we calibrate for
each individual for each session so even
me I'll redo it every single time so
that it's specific to that person's
brain the physician the electrodes
everything then then you're generating
notes right now it's generating notes on
a scale by activating or deactivating
the motor and visual cortex so you go
through this training and then and the
training is very brief about five
minutes and then we test the accuracy
what we do is we give people a target
note and we say give them ten seconds to
hit that note they actually have to hit
it three times in a row we didn't want
him to hit it once because I hit it once
it could be random
you have to hit three times in a row and
then you score a hit if you ten seconds
go by and you haven't scored a hit it
plays a tritone like a back and you get
another note and you get to try again
you try to score as many hits as you can
within a five-minute trial period so we
just see how many times people can hit
and then the goal was simply to see if
we could do better than random so our
initial results this is from 13 people
we're now up to 17 or so but it's it's
similar it's actually a little better
now but
random is down there on the right and
the average is every every single person
did better than random these are novices
mind you there haven't been trained on
this at all
the average was much higher than random
percentage-wise it's not amazing but
we're up into seventy percent or so we
have the two conditions the visual
cortex on the top and the motor cortex
on the bottom motor cortex is a little
more difficult but a little more
interesting because it doesn't require a
meme of you can do it within no movement
at all the visual cortex you still need
to open and close your eyes which is
movement in one way even even if we're
not measuring that actual eye movement
but people did better than average and
they did significantly better than
average and that's basically all we were
trying to prove here we are doing
experiments where we're going to train
them and see how much better they can
get with it with a good feedback loop
and a good training paradigm and my
theory is that by using music and
specifically by using music and not
using say a cursor on a screen that
you're trying to just move left or right
that that paradigm of music is powerful
enough in in in the human development
and in our cognitive space that I think
it's gonna be a more powerful feedback
loop and I think we're actually gonna be
able to do better than has been done in
the past that 75% with just moving a
cursor on a screen because the feedback
loop is music specifically I may be
wrong but we'll see we also did a skew
bias to try to make sure that people
weren't all just generating one note and
then they would always hit that one note
just by chance and some people were
skewed from one side to the other but
overall that the skew bias was pretty
minimal and it was we also did a
separate analysis to say okay if you're
always hitting this one note what would
be the chances of scoring as as you did
and everyone did better there was one or
two that were very skewed that for the
most part they weren't and then
performance wise have performed this
once in a
audio art festival down in San Francisco
called the megapolis audio art festival
and we had a band and we I was playing
the encephalo phone and we had three
other instruments we had a drums we had
bass and we had guitar and played four
songs and it gave a brief talk that was
similar to this but like lots more
simple to describe what was going on and
then we just played four songs where I
improvised
little sound for the beginning they
still have to go through the calibration
every time like I said
the band decided to just send a backlog
recovery
I think on such the queue queued part of
the calibration and then once it's
calibrated we start playing
I'm the vibraphone type family
and the way it's set up right now
there's continuous notes there's no
stopping so for a performance family we
decided use a volume pedal upon my left
leg to allow crazy
I'm the Bible
I control the pitch yep here it's
restricted six notes it's a pentatonic
scale or our little show here dr. gyrus
the electric salsa and then I do what
the hell I'm breathing
so I'm gonna try to explain it to you
discussion this so I'm gonna talk to you
a little bit about there's a couple
others on bench and I mean they're able
to switch you know I switched the keys
and instrument drive by pretty easily
this is basically a MIDI instrument so
even you could have any voice you want
it could be so could be human voice of
measurement it generates notes from the
conscious control since we have six
pitches might move which 15 well the
major - baby what happened
it uses EEG electroencephalogram and I
use as intentional cruel control it's
not just passively opportunity here
right hand you're there so yeah so
there's the motor cortex and it's
thinking about movement and you have to
specifically think about one side it's
lateralized so in this foot and then
there's visual there's the visual cortex
I use the visual cortex in this one
so this is just a piano sound
now we're at a major key board
there'll be one wine
so when it's when the visual cortex is
activated that alpha frequency goes away
we open your eyes it goes away when you
close your eyes it goes up so the
relative power of that so opening and
closing your eyes is the basic idea but
you can sew the top and the bottom are
very easy meaning that the top of the
scale the bottom of the scale are
related to the power so you can hit the
top and bottom quite easily going in
between is more difficult that I'm
learning more and more how to control
the middle so I can I can dip into the
middle and come back out by partially
closing and coming back out right
exactly and it's difficult in the middle
but it's it's it's it's like any other
musical instrument when you're new
you're a bit sloppy and you get better
with training and I think that like I
said the motivation of having music
playing live is powerful enough that
people will
we'll learn quite well
so in this one it's just a synthesized
sound and it's an a minor key in any
case I think you get the picture
I have a website I mean to come out of
the full screen mode so then you know
where am I going with this
I don't have anyone recognizes that film
but no there they were doing a thank you
he was taking the souls out of kids or
he's taking their mind it's like poor
children I mean we're not planning that
but the future directions are musical so
within you know within the musical
paradigm there are lots of ways to go
with that
this one is chords for example switching
between chords not just notes switching
between Tambor's so so you could switch
have a preset melody and then you're
switching instruments you could you
could trigger whole passages but
diagnostically it could also be used for
listening to eg in the in the hospital
we have heart monitors and people are
very attuned to changes in sound that
let you know that the hearts going to
arrhythmia EEG is a little more
complicated because II have 20 channels
going at once but you could learn to to
recognize certain patterns that might be
useful so you're not having to stare at
the at the EEG continuously if you're
doing continuous EEG so it's more
diagnostic and then therapeutically
motor important impaired patients
patients with spinal cord injury brain
stem stroke or ALS they have motor
disability but their their motor cortex
is still intact for the most part and
that part of their brain is not being
used much or it's or it's very impaired
in its ability to effectuate music
movement funny I say that so I can then
go and one just hook them up to this
device and have them be able to express
themselves using part of the brain that
they don't get to use much anymore
because their motor impaired and to I'm
willing to believe that there'll be some
cognitive rehab that may actually help
flip back and help them with their motor
disability now if a person has a
amputation they're not getting movement
back out of that arm but patients with
brain stem stroke essentially have a an
intact arm they they can't move it they
have an intact motor cortex they're just
missing a portion in between it's like
the the wires cut in the middle and I
could use this to bypass obviously I'm
creating music I'm not creating movement
but we could work a paradigm where we're
improving the the use of that part of
the brain the cortex in order to start
getting them to to move more so I'm
applying for grants for clinical trials
to see what this does the coal you know
assuming the person is fully cognizant
of the risks to go and do surgery on
their motor cortex so you get better
signals to control their arm because I
would be yeah yes yeah I would totally
stop for that absolutely yes it's it is
it I mean obviously like it's exactly as
you said they need to be awake
incompetent and you know but a lot of
these patients are fully cognizant of
you know the classic would be a
locked-in patient they have a really bad
brainstem stroke and I can't move at all
they're cognitively they're completely
there they have difficulty communicating
but those type of people yeah they would
they would sign up for that again the
the research isn't great so we don't
have a whole lot of data as to how this
would work well invasively ironically
enough the meaning not going
intracranial II we actually don't know
very well how what we'd be able to do
but yes and there are trials it's just
the numbers are so tiny that we don't
have good control yet with that and but
that's that is being actively pursued in
general yeah here basically
I mean your instrument your mapping one
thought pattern onto music you not to
say other people are napping on this
cursor control right people are not
being on whatever
so one claim is that because probably
evolutionary wives sort of music things
probably have more stuff going on right
yeah cursors don't have a king a lot of
evolution on that exactly that's that's
my ex that's my superior who I will do
better is there any other is that really
the key difference towards that raise
another question what other what other
modalities can use that powerful
yeah well tying it into a motion is
helpful and at that limbic valence that
music has which meaning it's it's it's
very emotional is a motivator so if
other other paradigms using non-musical
things that are very emotional might
work well I mean that's pretty amazing
very good yeah I was I'm able to with
six out but as I guess yeah so I'm
wondering weird is that where do you
feel like that starts to top off right
now sections about it I I started off
with it uh it's a good question a lot of
people want to know how granular can you
get I do 100 units now no way
zeroing one the binary is piece of cake
I can I can hit that I started off with
eight nine cuz it was a eight because it
was a it was a there was a major scale
with all the notes and I got better with
six just a little more so yeah I can't
tell you precisely but it feels like
it's pretty good around six and that's
sort of maxing out six degrees of
freedom line
when the electrode yeah if you go up to
100 electrodes is that how it doesn't
really help because I'm only using a
small part of that I don't even need
most of the electrodes to do that cuts :
yeah but with training young men motor
could take some kind of imagine I'm
trying that it's a little bit like
patting a head and rubbing your stomach
I think you're kind of doing I think you
think that once but yeah it would be
nice to have a non motor control over
over phrasing over the be on and off
because as you saw right now it's just
it's just continually pretty producing
music notes I'm you know it whatever - a
second and that's not very musical so I
use a pedal but it'll be nice to use a
second control to pause or not what
about the thing where they use infrared
light going into the brain to look at
different activity and it might get
passing the motor stuff anymore
it could another their other modalities
transcranial magnetic stimulation or Meg
magnetoencephalography : cephalo Graham
uses magnetic field to measure
indirectly an electrical field it's it's
got much more spatial resolution so much
better but it's a gigantic device that
there's only a few of them in the world
in there they're massive and it requires
super cooling and so it's a technical
limitation Iggy's practical it's
portable I can put this I can take the
whole thing anywhere all right what's
that the deeper any place that's not so
hard to do right not too bad it's a
little more invasive in the snuff
infrared itself but from what I
understand the preparation is a little
more but I'm not sure I could possibly
there's another one would be just DC
direct stimulation you can use direct
stimulation from DC and
turn on/off yeah yeah another one would
be fMRI that's real-time good control
spatial resolutions good temporal
resolutions not so great I don't know
about the infrared honestly I'd have to
I'd have to look into it more sorry
so everyone's really curious about like
how many different game cook points are
there right and you we're talking about
like there's motor that's also visual in
that you're just you have two bands
mm-hmm I'm seeing that you're doing a
mapping from input pitch yep
and you settled on a major minor scale
yeah so I'm wondering do you guys have
plans to extend that one to other pitch
systems mm-hmm they use five or six
notes yeah that this could be portable
to other cultures yeah that have
different musical scale systems and then
the other thing is are you interested in
doing things that are not just pitch
which also would have the same effect
because pitch and harmony and I think
our biases like the Western classical
tradition but a lot of other people
focused on other elements of music like
texture or rhythmic structures and
things like that yeah
yes I've mentioned we're you know one
one would be chords another would be
Tambor just in switching instruments or
passages and definitely thought about
other scale systems I was looking into
some Indian what do you type of scales
and other ones
one thing about pentatonic is not bad
there you know there's some that are
culturally similar like the fifth is a
tonics and fifth or in every culture and
and pentatonic is seen in almost every
culture but yeah there's lots of
applications that way
this is first iteration I want to see
this you know I want to see this work in
a way that I know and yeah I'm
culturally biased from Western musical
tradition that I was educated in and
then in terms of to to
inputs I'm generally not doing two at
once I'm doing one or the other I'm not
using the visual and motor cortex at the
same time in general we're experimenting
with it but I again I want to get one
modality going really well prove that it
works well see how how how high we can
get the percentage accuracy and then you
know in parallel try these other things
so are your are your inputs analog or
digital analog to digital I mean they
they're the that box I have I'm stating
so you got analog inputs just current
right it cuts it goes into a it's the
the eg has you know has its nineteen
outputs coming out just voltage that's
analog that head box is an amplifier and
a ad converter so that's digital and
digital into a sorry I'm asking
consecutive questions
are you looking at a specific direction
and that's coded to a specific note or
you have to be like on a violin you have
to be very precise with your intonation
in the location so that you get the
exact page that you want as opposed on
the unfretted instrument like a guitar
where they're fixed by the location of
the frets so I'm just looking at the
power of a given amount of rhythm at a
certain electrode sort of buffered over
about one second or 500 milliseconds
ready structure for because it fixes
where yeah yeah they're never restricted
yeah right it's a it's not a continuous
scale that's it's restricted to units
those units are I calibrate your range
for I have you go through your your own
personal range and then I set bins
basically and I have eight bins and if
you get within this power you know from
0 to 200 you get one from 200 to 400 you
get to that's it
so you know you can imagine if you're
near the edge of one of those bins it's
not so accurate right did you want to go
best it was just a comment only on the
essence and I'm just gonna say it's it's
easy to put on but it's it's hard when
this hair so prefrontal cortex is himmat
well we can get through yeah I mean I
use people with lots of hair and there's
a limit but you can get there like your
hair would be easy I may be
collaborating with Reggie Watts and his
hair is crazy I'll be like Reggie I
don't know no oh right I thought you
meant Harold
shake 10th grade yeah here stuff a
little bit of here son please don't you
everyone's here don't share everyone up
to him my question is we're using a
pentatonic scale and I'm not a musical
expert but I think tonics are pretty
forgiving yeah if you were to insert
instead of instead of one of the six you
inserted something that sounded really
horrible
yeah are you able to avoid hitting that
note when you're controlling it I'm more
and more but you know I'm cheating a
little by doing a pentatonic scale here
sounds good all the time you know I
realize that and since the accuracies
not great in the middle it's okay it's
getting better I have a way the
pentatonic avoids the fourth which
sounds terrible against the third for
example and the seventh can sound really
bad against the eighth the timing so so
I did cheat and the control is not great
to avoid a bad note if it has a good
better I may flip it back and see see if
we can you know as the control gets
better he's sure we kind of proved
scientifically that we have accuracy
that's higher might try that because it
would certainly more be more interesting
a little more dangerous which makes it
interesting yeah
so it's would you be able to insert some
time to control with your eyes then like
that you're sort of saying Lucia was
doing it a while ago yeah he wasn't
doing timing per se he was just doing
eyes open eyes closed or control the
visual cortex but just pretty much what
I was doing there you could you could
you could do I control and then do motor
cortex floor with a scale and then use
your eyes for control I was like is it
possible to do that you'd still have to
use the mortar cortex probably tell her
you couldn't do it all at the visual
cortex and then use your blink for
that's right that would no less yeah we
are really limited in what we're able to
use as you can see there's a reason it's
not just people have this concept of EEG
like you can just read your thoughts and
then just translate that into a robot
that does yeah it's quite it's what I
tried to say with it what the talk is
described while the difficulties not to
shoot it down because I obviously love
you
gee I'm really interesting but it's very
messy signal and it's really difficult
to weed out what's not what's not even
brain signal and it's also difficult to
weed out what we what we know is
functional and what's not that well are
you saying much crosstalk between the
motor cortex and using the volume no no
and I mean I specifically put it in my
left foot if it were my hands it might
get a little you get a little bigger
signal in the motor cortex with your
hands than you do with your feet and I
put it on the left and not on the right
for a reason if I do use it with motor
cortex in the foot pedal it will affect
things more in the motor cortex paradigm
than it will with the visual cortex the
visual cortex doing that shouldn't
really be a problem you don't want to
move much I move my upper body even much
you get messy signals I'm going to
really detach that foot to keep it away
but yeah it's it's it's very sensitive
so okay so I think that's about it thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
