you
hello everyone I'm John Boyle and I
coordinate the studio 99 project for
Microsoft Research art and technology
today we're really pleased to welcome
Keith salmon who is a lives in Scotland
and is a landscape painter today he'll
be talking about about the experience of
being a landscape painter who is who is
visually impaired and how that how that
has has affected his practice he's also
in town to work with microsoft research
on a project around creating
sonification of his work so that Keith
and Neil and others at microsoft
research will be working on on creating
an installation that will be a sound and
visual installation the sound part will
be based on prep on proximity the actual
the viewers location in regard in
relation to the work so that's that is I
think sufficient will will talk for
about 45 minutes and then there will be
time for questions so without further
ado cute salmon thank you very much job
even get work okay i will thanks John
thanks to everyone here at Microsoft for
inviting me along and for inviting me to
take part in this kind of collaboration
with this very exciting project I'm here
this afternoon to just tell you a little
bit about myself but my practice um
about how my work has developed
especially sort of since my site went
bad in 1990 um I guess how I've ended up
standing here talking to you um I'll try
not a sort of go to stoke gonna have to
whip through quite fast anyway um I've
always loved art I've always loved
making out even as a kid I used to love
drawing painting making stuff and I
guess it was almost inevitable that I
would end up going to art college which
I did in nineteen seventy-nine I went to
a small College in shrewsbury in England
to do a foundation course now that's a
course where they kind of give you a
real shake to try and get rid of all
your preconceived ideas about art to
open your mind up to new ideas
it obviously worked with me I've ended
up being a painter huh yeah boring old
painter anyway um I did that course it
was a good course and I went on to do a
three-year degree in fine art at
Falmouth School of Art down in Cornwall
and I studied sculpture there um and I
constructed stuff from our steel from
wood smoke fondue plaster paper and so
on the surface ah the work was very
different from what I do now but
actually when I think about it when I
look back there's a lot of similarities
it was primarily about landscape which
is what I do here uh it was very much
about drawing not just in that I used to
do lots of drawings of sculpture but
that I used to kind of draw with the
materials I had in three dimensional
space and it was very much about surface
and texture and about drawing onto
surface and texture and so there's not
that big a change in 30 odd years um I
went from Falmouth to newcastle upon
tyne the opposite end of England up on
the northeast coast where I set up a
studio and I then managed to get a place
on a postgraduate masters fine art
course arm the problem there was that
unlike the degree course there was no
funding for the postgraduate you had to
work professionally and this really
wasn't a good time to be a young artist
working professionally this was the
mid-80s ah and there was mass
unemployment in the north ah and no one
really had any money to buy art even if
it was good and probably what I was
doing wasn't so good at the time um and
so uh yeah after a couple of years I
decided I had to sort of pull out of the
course I couldn't afford to put on the
the quality post-grad show that I needed
to so I quickly the course equipments to
do in Newcastle and I went looking for
work and by chance I ended up in
Shrewsbury again I spotted a job vacancy
at a youth hostel there and I like the
job got it um and that had 3 great
advantages the first being that they
paid me I had some money clean which was
pretty good
the second was that it was a big old
Victorian building with big sellers and
the the wardens at the hostel let me
clear one of the sellers and use it as a
studio when I wasn't on duty and the
other great advantage was that I met my
partner Anita who's here she was some
getting some some work before going to
do it astronics course town in Wales and
we got on pretty well in fact we got on
so damn well that two years later I I
quit the youth hostel job and when Nita
finished her course in Wales I moved
down to Wales and and we set up home
together and we also set up a studio
together we kind of figured that uh we
could connect Nita's ceramic skills with
my kind of more airy well fairy kind of
our fine art skills and come up with
some good art and we did we had this
little studio in a disused pigsty on the
side of a hill in Wales uh and it worked
for a bit but we didn't have either the
money or the the sort of business skills
to make it really work and at this time
are something really major happen that
kind of put a bit of a dent in our plans
in that my site which had been fine for
the first 30 years of my life in 1998
suddenly went very bad very quickly and
and the consultant I saw said that he
thought that I'd probably go totally
blind within a few years but he did so
try and save a bit of sight arm and so
as you can imagine it was a huge blow
for someone who'd kind of been trying to
sort of get himself into a position
where he could call himself a
professional artist and live a life as a
professional artist suddenly to learn
that you could be totally blind in few
years it was bad news and I didn't
really make any art for about three
possibly four months which about the
longest time i I've never made our and
then I just thought or hang about the
guy only said I'd probably go totally
blind he didn't say I would def nigga
totally blind and he did say try and
save a bit of sight and so I thought
well what I ought to be doing would was
actually trying to make as much art as I
could in the time that I had and I also
taking that a bit further i thought well
i put the sculpture to one side and work
on the purely
visual side of my work the painting and
drawing and over the the sort of next
few years luckily saved a little bit of
sight when I and I I started to just try
and relearn how to work and I tried all
sorts of different ways of drawing
painting printing and by the time niche
and I moved from Wales up to Scotland in
1998 I was starting to find ways of
painting with a little bit of sight that
I had which basically comes down to just
a little bit in this this right I that
all the rest is kind of gone and this
this picture here this was one of the
pieces one of the first pieces which I
started to feel was was starting to do
something that I wanted fairly crudely
put together these are this is quite
small this is a foot square so this is
blown up really big here but its its its
oil paint on board and I use broad
brushes and i budged the paint down with
very little technique and I scrape paint
off and I built it up in layers in it
and these paintings at the time they
were based on kind of manmade
environments buildings street scenes the
harbor scene in irving in Scotland um
but I found I was really frustrated cuz
I prior to my site going bad I used to
do a lot of observational drawing I used
to sit around especially used to like
building sites big construction sites
and I'd sit and draw and I found I could
no longer sort of see my subject and I
couldn't even see the bloomin drawings
which was a bit of a problem it was yeah
it wasn't good and I started to think
what how do I get around this how do I
try and create pictures that appear to
have detail without having a sight to
see to do it and one of the first
solutions that came up with I suddenly
realize it if I scribbled line through
the nature of scribbling line you create
something at least quite detailed it
might be fairly random but it's quite
detailed and I started to do a sort of
scribbled drawings this is one of them
they're done in past all there they're
built up from layer upon layer of just
scribbled line gradually pulling out a
vague image this was one of a series of
drawings i did based on
a church we have in urban called the
Trinity Church big high steep spire and
it catches the light in the summer
evening and they say it's it's it's not
an exact representation but it it
conveys something of it and it it's got
a lot of detail in this this one kind of
touches landscape because we we live in
irvine on the west coast of Scotland
just to the southwest of Glasgow on the
side of the Firth of Clyde and out there
down to the south is amazing Island
cordell so Craig and it's an old
volcanic plug that rises to think about
1,100 feet out of the sea and from Ervin
if I use a monocular and need to point
me in the right direction I get this
kind of fuzzy kind of triangle and this
is what this drawing was about um I'm so
touching on landscape here this is a
second great passion in my life is the
outdoors the wild the mountains my
father he was a great Hill Walker um and
he moved from London with my family rule
from North London and he got fed up
commuting across the city and he got a
job in mid-wales in nineteen-sixty-nine
when I was 10 I'm very quickly after we
we set up home he started taking family
out into the world Hills my mom and
sister quickly realized that it wasn't
the way they wanted to spend their
saturday afternoon being dragged across
a damp welsh more and they they they
abandoned this and went shopping on a
Saturday but I really caught the bug and
over the rest of my teens I i went out
fairly regularly with my father and so
this hill walking thing again in 1990
where my site went bad i suddenly
realized that when I wasn't on a
man-made surface I couldn't really see
where I was putting my feet and I was
jiggling around um I'm you know this is
going to be really dangerous going in
the hills and I think well I can't go in
the hills if I can't see but I just
couldn't really get my head around that
the concept had not been out of walk
mountains i love them so much and so I
decide to had to find a way of trying to
walk in the hills safely or as safe as
as possible and start with i bought a
stick i thought if i had a stick that
would keep me upright it would give me a
bit of sort of
confidence about you know if I mr.
footing I would have something to try
and keep me from falling over and I
thought I could budge it around and try
and feel what the ground was doing and I
also thought well I can ask nature if
she would see if it was possible or even
practical for her as a fully sighted
person to actually guide me now visually
impaired in the mountains and so we went
back to our local hills and at the time
this was the area it's called Marvin van
it is high area of moorland out of which
this wonderful escarpment rises and it
runs for about seven miles in an
undulating and curving sort of a line
and it reaches about two and a half
thousand feet and on that first day with
my new stickam a new guide we got to
roughly this point where this photo is
taken and it involved climbing up from
the more lower down big drop on one side
and the stick worked Anita found that
she could guide me and over the years we
developed we work we walked further we
did more difficult routes arm and we
cover quite a lot of ground but the
problem was that I I kind of felt guilty
that I was walking in the hills I kind
of thought that the person who used the
white cane to get around in town at the
pub if people found out that every four
or five weeks I was throwing it to one
side putting the walking boots on and
grabbing me old stick and going out in
the mountains they would think I was
very irresponsible and that will change
though when when nature and I went to
Scotland in 1998 about 18 months later I
heard about a magnificent course being
run by the mountaineering Council of
Scotland and it was a summer mountain
skills calls for blind and visually
impaired people and I thought were hey
yeah that's for me and I signed up and
it was the start of almost me getting to
stand here today talking about all this
stuff because i went there and does not
with i met six other blind and visually
impaired people who just like me work
we're kind of mad enough to want to
still walk mountains when they couldn't
really see their feet um also of course
it was being run by the mouth
nearing councillor Scotland and we had
some of the top mounting instructors in
the UK leading the course and they were
saying yes you know it's fine for you
guys to go in the mountains you have to
have the same skills as anyone else but
you have to adapt them to meet the
requirements of your visual impairment
and so that kind of took away the guilt
and finally the way the course was set
up there was each vision per person was
teamed up or paired up with a fully
sighted volunteer guide and by pure
chance that week although the course is
open to people from all over the country
there was four of us from north ayrshire
in Scotland we'd never met before before
the course tervis work were visually
impaired and and to as the fully sighted
guides were were there that week one of
them was a guy called Stevie who was the
sports development officer for the count
County Council and he guided me and
another chap called guy hansford who is
a retired computer man he guided Jerry
the other other visually impaired person
from Asia and so when we got back from
the course Stevie suddenly got in touch
with me and said I'm setting up a new
mountaineering club for North airship
called air know Craig and he invited me
and I to join and guy got in contact and
said look I'm going to go for a walk
with Jerry do you guys want to join us
and that started a very long arm
friendship it continues today and we've
climbed many many mountains with guy
Jerry is actually Britain's all time
with Britain's leading blind girlfriend
and he kind of drifted away from the
hill walking he's always on a golf
course but guy nature and I have been
out many many times and this combination
of guy hansford and Stevie and his clock
came together in in February 2002 when
the club went on its first weekend trip
and we went to a place called crew for a
station it's it's two platforms and old
signal box and a tiny estate building
turned into a wee restaurant that's in
the middle of nowhere it's the highest
point on the railway line between
glasgow for william in the highlands and
at the
time the signal box was converted into a
bunkhouse and so 13 of us turned up on a
februari friday evening nita was working
that weekend so diet come along with me
and when we got up on the the Saturday
morning there was snow on the mountains
now even when I was fully sighted I'd
never done any winter walking I'd always
been very much a three-season Walker but
guy was an experienced is an experienced
sort of winter walker mountaineer and he
had been following the conditions he
said no this is perfect conditions to
introduce someone like you to winter
walking so we won't need crampons but we
will need an axe he said I've brought
along spare axe and I'll introduce you
the basic techniques for using it and we
set off and he was so right because it
was the perfect day we had all four
seasons which isn't unusual you can get
that in the middle of summer in Scotland
but we set off and as we climbed up we
looked out over the the vastness of
Rannoch Moor and there was patches of
sun light and dark cloud and it was a
great sort of pattern of textures and
color and it was gorgeous then we got
into the snow and the cloud swept in and
by the time we got to the top we were in
thick cloud it was bitterly cold driving
wind bits of snow and guys snap this
little photo of me on summit my first
winter winter hill which is lure Mollom
and it is just under 3,000 feet we
carried on from there and we drop down
to a call and as we sort of hunkered
down behind a rock to have our lunch the
bad weather swept through briefly and we
got these fast views out over the more
to the bigger snow-capped mountains of
Glencoe and and then it filled in again
and by the time we got to the second
summit of the day we were we were stood
in a new sort of mini blizzard it was
driving horizontal snow very very cold
and guy had something wrong with these
rocks like he's always faffing around
with some bit of his gear or other and
for about ten minutes he was prodding
around with it and I was stood at this
mountain and slow getting in every
little gap of the gear and that and had
the biggest Broadus grin on the face you
could ever believe be
I was thinking what eight years ago I
thought I'd never walk a hiligaynon and
now suddenly I was on this wild Scottish
mountain in a in a near blizzard you
know what better could you get really I
it actually got better because three
hours later when we got back down to the
the crustacean the the whole weather
system had swept through and there
wasn't a cloud in the sky uh and there
was a big long sort of late afternoon
shadows and and the late winter Sun was
turning the the more sort of this
fabulous gold color and I learnt to
really really important things that day
the first was that I had to combine my
two main interest might my art and my
hillwalking and use all these days all
these hours all these things that we
were seeing and experiencing in the
Hills as the source for my artwork the
second thing was that I knew that I had
to go and get the skills to walk in the
mountains in winter safely and a year
later we were back nita myself and guy a
glimmer Lodge doing a winter
mountaineering skills course for blind
and visually impaired people we
persuaded them to run this course they
only did the one and we were lucky
enough to go on it and again it was a
proper korte what this wasn't a of
adventure holiday for people who can't
see too well this was a proper mountain
skills course they taught us how to walk
in snow how to kick steps how to work
with crampons how to walk with an ice
axe we spent an entire afternoon
tumbling which every which way down
hills learning ice axe arrests they
taught us the basics of avalanche
awareness of survival techniques digging
snow holes and some really useful little
techniques that visually impaired people
could use to help their fully sighted
guides navigating bad weather so it's a
fabulous course and over the years we
put these skills and we together and we
start again out very regularly our
friend guy this is him i met him in in
2001 on the first course and he was 69
by the time we were here he's about 75
amazing little mountain goat
he is so fit put-put neater and I to
shame every time we weren't walking but
he soon realized that his job was to
take us to the places we wouldn't have
the confidence to go and he started to
take us on to the much more rugged
mountains to do serious scrambles this
is on the Isle of Arran out in Firth of
Clyde another they're not above 3,000
feet these things they're very rugged
and there's some serious scrambles and
climbs indeed this day we've just
finished climbing gear Hawaii which is a
bit of a brute of a rather exposed
granite slabs that ends in a very narrow
region and I sat down to recover my
nerves and guy of course was playing on
a rock but then of course sort of the
people in the club started to hear where
guy was taking us nay they decided on
one night in the pub that I ought to be
out of crime Scotland's one of
scotland's sort of premier scrambles and
that's on billeted more which is one of
Scotland's famous mountains it's on the
edge of Rannoch Moor on the edge of
Glencoe and for the first part this big
east northeast facing a face of the
mountain is the preserve of serious
climbers very serious climbers but there
is one scrambling route that goes up
this this kind of left hand skyline and
ends by taking in the weave pinnacle
near the top and so on a dry fairly
Winfrey September day a group from the
club for serious climbers they led
myself and anitra up this hill and it
was a huge huge day and of course with
guy taking us to places quite
challenging in the club doing the same
niche and I started gain more confidence
and we nearly always go away in first
two weeks in may to the north west of
Scotland and we started to take on some
quite big mountains this is mounting
cord and chela in the north west of
Scotland then it's but some people
reckon it's probably the mainland
Scotland's finest Mountain it is superb
I was trying to look fairly mountain
like there I was actually really quite
nervous because we've done we've come up
by quite a serious scramble and I didn't
really know how the hell I was going to
get back down again but the picture
looks good this
this was another day nature and I had
together in the far northwest of
Scotland this is on a mountain called
Quinn again it's it's less than 3,000
feet but there's five separate tops and
this was probably the best I've ever had
on a mountain in that when we started we
were under very thick heavy cloud and we
thought we weren't going to see anything
and we went up a little bit and suddenly
broke through the cloud and we were
above the cloud and that's quite a rare
thing in Scotland because the mountains
really aren't that high and we had this
incredible day climbing three of the
summit's of Quinn egg including this
this should a shark's fin one need to
took that of me coming up the narrow bit
which was me about my kind of limit you
know sort of here it's kind of difficult
going in these places where you can't
quite see what you're doing but over the
years we did a lot of hills by 2008
februari 2008 when this was taken this
is me stood at the top of the hill court
of Arcana which is a big plateau like
top of a mountain and it's one of the
Scottish Monroe's monroe's of the title
for Scottish mountains over 3,000 feet
and there's 284 of them and it's become
quite a thing over the years for people
to climb them all now I knew I'd never
do them all some of them are just too
damn difficult but I kind of figured it
would be quite good if it if a blind
person or someone who's registered blind
could walk 100 and this was real on my
hundredth Monroe and it was quite a big
day but of course it's not all about
doing big hills and difficult hills and
the bit of sight that I now have for the
last few years it's been getting worse
and it's proving more and more difficult
and I'm kind of avoiding the the more
rocky the more difficult things but
there's loads of smaller hills in
Scotland the offer fabulous walking I
took this photo of meter just three
months ago on the way hills the pentland
hills just outside edinburgh dan knows
these he's been up there and you can
catch a city bus to the base of them but
you still get these magnificent bits of
walks and views this photo is taken
probably our nearest hills
is at that very southern edge of the
Highlands Glasgow is just over there
this is the southern end of Loch Lomond
and these are the last hills and there's
steep grassy sided hills but offer
fabulous walking ah and so yeah all of
these walks are there there what I now
based my work on but of course when back
in two thousand until I decided to
combine these two interests I really
didn't know how to paint the landscape
because I'd always painted other things
mainly man-made environment and to start
with I i started i just got photos I've
taken in the hills and I i squared them
up and I I tried to sort of copy them
using small brushes and big magnifies
and to be honest with it they were
dreadful they were awful but I was still
doing these kind of organized scribbles
and I started to do organized scribbles
based on the outdoor environment this
was one based on day we're in in glen
lyon in central highlands and although
it's a it's a deeper big high empty bare
mountains in the base of the glen
there's this wonderful array of
broadleaf trees and on this October day
that the autumn colours were about as
bright as you could get them and so I
did this kind of failure abstract piece
all built up with scribbled lines as you
can see but based on the colors this was
another drawing i did at the time this
is a day we'd walked out of a big Glen
which i think it was canonic Glen which
is in the southern highlands of a late
kind of winter evening but again
scribbled line and I realized that these
kind of things had a much better kind of
feel for conveying that the landscape
than these tight pictures which I
painting using magnifiers and little
brushes and then I started thinking
about what if I started to paint first
using quite broad brushes and then
scribbled into it so I had the paint but
then the kind of that the sort of detail
of the scribbled line and this is one of
the first pieces I did based on one of
the big rocky mountains that we climbed
up near glen coe been a very very cloudy
day we haven't seen a damn thing until
we start
to come down and we had this short break
where the cloud cleared and we we look
down almost 3,000 feet to lock leave and
the seal off below but this is done it
it it's painted first but then scribbled
over the top to try and give this
impression of detail of the rock of the
texture of the atmosphere this was
another piece done at the same time in
the same way this time when we we've
climbed or started to climb a hill above
the north end of Loch Lomond and we got
called out about a thousand feet up by a
thunderstorm which wasn't a clever thing
to do but we just stood it out and and
as the storm started to pass by rather
than the sky lighting up first the lock
lit up in this strange kind of way and
and and this drawing come painting was
about that but of course I then took it
one stage further and thought well
instead of just putting paint down and
scribbling on the top I ought to try and
mix the paint in the past all and I
started to do paintings and this next
few paintings there there I usually
start off paint first and then I'll
scribble on to them with pastel and then
I seal the past all with a matte acrylic
varnish very very thin coat of varnish
and once that's dry can then work with
more paint and then more pastel then
more varnish and so these paintings this
was based on a day we got caught in a
big heavy snow share up snow shower up
near very mar but these paintings
they're built up in alternating layers
of paint and past all painted mark and
drawn mark this is one of the more sort
of abstract pieces of you looking across
from the hill called craig magrunner
towards a big range of mountains called
been laws which are the bat highest
places in the southern highlands they
they got to almost 4,000 feet and this
was a winter day when I do paintings I
kind of think the best things that I do
are the ones that are at the same time
both recognizable is kind of Scottish
landscape
but are also abstract as well and I find
it very difficult to get the balance
right they either go one way or t'other
way and if you kind of force the
abstract sometimes I think it kind of
looks naf and so this painting I did
this in 2008 based on a walk what I did
with this chap guy in the monolayer
mountains in the grampians of Scotland
he's a big high undulating treeless
plateau around 3,000 feet it'd be an
absolute nightmare to navigating if you
got caught very missed and yeah i think
this painting kind of conveys this is I
suppose yeah up in the top five that
I've done it i think this one works as a
landscaper abstract painting some of
them though that i do that i
deliberately try and make them more
obviously mounting pieces this was based
on it on a winter day up on a mountain
called ben and Dottie we'd climb them
out in as we came down in the late
februari afternoon it was bitterly cold
there was ice everywhere are very very
cold and it's just fabulous I sometimes
try and do works based on the coast
because one of the great things about
the west coast of Scotland is that it's
not just mountains you've got the sea
everywhere this was a painting I did
nature and I went over to the Outer
Hebrides to harrahs a couple of April's
ago and it was a pretty rough tree April
evening when we cross the pherion and
this was based on the idea of us SAT
looking out from the ferry trying to
spot the first signs of the islands in
the west and the mist and the rain and
the rough sea and of course some
paintings go deliberately more towards
the abstract you can see that I've used
much broader marks here still got the
the drawn marks in there but these are
big wide broad brushes based on a day
we're on a northern Monroe called
carnivore are in a sorry May and there's
still a lot of snow on its north eastern
slopes and there's these great big snow
slopes um a few years ago that I managed
to move into the bigger studio and it
gave me room to not only carry on
doing the acrylic and pastel pieces but
also to start working back in oil again
and these next few paintings they've all
been done in the last year 18 months
they are about 3 foot square they're
done in traditional oil color but using
very thick paint node roaring in this at
all they're they're just thick paint but
i've been using a great big old eight or
nine inch wide a house painting brush
that my father used to and i found it in
his garage when he he died in 2008 and i
had to go through his garage in his
house and i found these old brushes that
i can remember him using on the house
when i was a kid in the 1960s and he was
always you know very keen to look after
his tools and so these brushes had
lasted all this time and their horse
hair brushes very cool Spritle and they
leave these fabulous course marks in the
paint which a normal modern nylon brush
they're much softer you get softer mark
and so these paintings are built up over
sometimes three or four months putting
layers of paint down and then letting
the layer dry before dragging more paint
over the top and in the same way as the
the past or picked up the little ridges
of the acrylic paint to create fine
marks I'm kind of creating fine marks by
dragging this great big brush of paint
over the top of already dried paint and
these paintings it there I suppose most
of my work is about whether I love the
weather it constantly changing in in the
highlands this was one based on on
Rannoch Moor as a big snow shower swept
in off off of the more nervous sort of
sunny breaks so that again that
partially landscape partially abstract
another one a game you know based on on
the idea of snow when it first starts to
fall and starts to just turn the grass a
little gray and again put down with this
virtually entirely with it just this one
great big paintbrush of course this
the work I've shown you this is this is
the kind of work that I've been doing
for latias I'm still developing it and I
love the whole side of making smaller
paintings that you then show in
galleries but I am starting to try and
develop my work along a kind of parallel
line but doing my bigger more public
kind of works and in 2010 I was very
lucky to be invited by a top German art
group based in the city of spire in
southern Germany to go and live and work
in their city for four months and they
have an artist house and each year they
invite an artist from around the world
to go and live and work with them and
you basically you get an artist house
which comprises two great big studios
and some living quarters and one of the
the studios had this big wall it was
about seven meters long and about three
meters high and and I kind of thought
you know I'm not going to get a chance
to do something really big again
probably so I thought I've got to do a
big piece of work and the city is a very
old city it survived the ravages of the
Second World War and it's dominated by
an enormous and I mean enormous its vast
a great Romanesque Cathedral it dates
back a thousand years and it's a
hotchpotch of stonework because it's
been had bits knocked down burnt down
falling down rebuilt over and over again
suits it's this massive structure of
masonry of domes of buttresses of spires
and I used to walk around it every two
or three days and in the hills i use a
monocular to try and see a bit further
and so I found myself doing what I
normally do in the mountains eyes going
around look it up and I thought you know
perhaps I ought to try and create a
drawing a big drawing the idea of
walking down the side of this this great
structure but from drawing it from sort
of all different angles and i created
this destroying its it's a little over
four and a half meters long by by a
meter and a half high so it's a pretty
big drawing it's done in
for different shades of grey oil pastel
and it says it's quite abstract and it's
quite distorted it's quite gorman gas
for anyone who's read mervyn peake it's
kind of strange thing um and during my
time in Germany I did a lot of paintings
and at the end I had to put up a show to
show the people of fire you know what
I'd spend their money on basically which
is fair enough it's great and I price to
all the paintings but I didn't bother
pricing this drawing settle with you who
the hell wants a four and a half metre
long glory and in fact on the night the
opening had four people arguing over who
was going to buy it and luckily it sold
to a chap called head Deutsche who was
not only one of the city's leading
restauranteurs but he was also an art
collector and he bought it for his new
hotel and restaurant which is on
Maximilian Strasser right in the center
of spire just 400 meters from the
cathedral and this was a photo one of my
colleagues in Germany slapped on on
their phone so it's not a very good
photo unfortunately but it gives you an
idea of the size of the drawing and and
so I came back from Germany thinking I
want to do something this scale again
but based on Scotland and it actually
took me two years just to work out what
the subject for this this some new
Scottish big drawing would be and in
2013 January Nita and myself and guy
who's now at this stage I think he's 81
or 82 when we took this photo we went up
Glenn roaster on the Isle of Arran and
as you saw that glimpse of the Iron
Mountain's they're very dramatic and
there's a couple of superb Glen's that
go right up and they're almost
surrounded by mountains and as we walked
up on this very dree snowy day I was
looking up with my monocular and I
suddenly thought wow this is almost the
opposite to what I was doing in Germany
there I was walking around at the
outside of a great man-made structure
looking up and here it was like walking
on the inside of a big natural kind of
Cathedral and looking up and I thought
this would be the perfect subject for a
big drawing and a
round sorry that's that's that's the
kind of weather that we was getting that
day there was a lot of snow on the tops
of the mountain and the snow is coming
down into the Glen and one of the things
I love is when you get days like this
and the mist is swirling around and so
you can't quite tell where the mountain
ends and the sky begins I love that kind
of quality and so around about this this
time I'd also been invited to work just
for one afternoon with a doctor David
Feeney from Edinburgh University who was
researching into how technology might be
used to help blind and visually impaired
people interpret see art so similar to
what we're we're doing on this project
but in a very different way and and I
went along and I spent an afternoon with
David and we got on very well and and I
actually had an exhibition opening in
Edinburgh just a couple of months later
in i think it was March 2013 so I said
to David at the end of the day we do you
want to come along and you can see what
I do and he did and he brought down
along who some of you know who
apparently was there for a year
basically just tossing around and
drinking beer as far as I can apparently
was doing at what was it a fellowship
yeah I'm beer drinking yeah uh but we
got talking and by the end of the the
preview evening we decide you well you
know we both love landscape ah and we
both like hiking and so we had arranged
that that Dan and David would would join
us and I having just started to think
the glenrosa would be the place for my
new drawing big drawing project needed
to get back here and so a couple of
weeks later we went back I can barely
see that photo yeah there they are David
Dan and Nisa we went back to glenrosa
and we had a fabulous day because
nothing did we we walk up this amazing
Glen we did a lot of talking about art
about landscape about how Nietzsche and
I sort of work together as a guide nita
guiding me in the hills and and then did
a few interviews and took some footage
and the
end of the day he kind of said well look
you know I'd love to make a little
10-minute sort of film about about your
work and your hillwalking which she went
on to do and a bit after that he came
back to well you know there's more
information maybe we can sort of make a
proper documentary together uh and of
course we've been talking about my big
sort of new Glen Rose the drawing
project and he said well you know it'd
be great if we made this documentary we
could kind of use the drawing project as
the kind of focal point and over the
next two years we poured it all together
and in a December 2014 in the art center
close to my studio in Irvin they have
lucky one of their walls he's five
meters long I needed a big wall to do it
and it didn't seem any point to do it in
my studio because not that many people
come in the studio is open to the public
but I wanted to do this piece in a big
public place where people could actually
watch me work and get involved in the
whole process and so I suggested to the
Art Center that I put on a standard
exhibition in in the gallery on all the
gallery walls but on day one on the big
main war we just have a big blank piece
of paper and over the course of the
exhibition which was 35 days long I
would try and create this big drawing
based on this idea of being in glenrosa
with the mountains sort of stretched all
around I kind of flattened them out but
this this idea of the snow and I use
graphite which is basically the insider
pencils without the wood on there just
solid graphite and you can get them a
very soft to a grade called 9 b which is
extremely soft and you get these really
lovely dark marks and i was using a
Razors to rub back through to create the
kind of negative spaces and so this
large project as I suppose that the
start of me wanting to do more of these
kind of big public pieces big large
pieces where I can interact
with the public but it was around about
this time that as I say my sight is just
basically I have a little bit of sight
in the the upper left-hand part of my
right eye and about five years ago on a
routine sort of check up they said well
you've now got a cataract forming in
this I which normally isn't really that
big a deal but the retina in the eyes so
badly damaged that the wealth a couple
of different consultants have looked and
said no you know we don't want to touch
that until it's absolute last resort and
so I'm very aware that the bit of sight
that have is now getting a bit worse
again hence I'm not climbing such
difficult hills as I used to and I
started to think what you know what am I
going to do arm if my site gets to a
point that my paintings become
incredibly minimal which I can see
they're going to do and I started to
think well you know I had thought that
possibly I could go back to sculpture
but so many years have gone by i'll be
going right back to the beginning again
and so i decided that i would perhaps
try a new sound we're out there and we
there's a wonderful subtle sounds in the
mountains almost the sounds of silence
and i thought well maybe i can to try
and capture some of this and try and
incorporate sound with these ever more
minimal kind of pieces of work and we we
were working alongside Graham who some
of you at the meeting spoke to you on
skype this morning he was the sound
engineer at theatre at the time and he
was doing some he was helping Dan recall
this whole drawing process in time lapse
and doing some interviews once Dan I had
to go back to the states and I didn't
really know anything about I'm not
technologically minded so you know I'm a
real just slap her on a paint person in
amongst all this technology it's a bit
scary but we got talking uh too grainy
to support you no speak to Greg miss a
sound engineer and I told him what I was
planning and he was really excited and
said well yeah he said I'll lend you
some gear and he said and I'll give you
as much help or as little help as you
want
so I decided the best thing to do he
gave me this this recorder and I said
well show me the on/off button I'll make
me own mistakes and when I need some
more advice I'll come back to you and he
did that and for about 18 months nitra
and I had been going out on our regular
walks in the mountains and we've started
to make recordings and i found that i'm
starting to listen differently and I've
kind of figured that for this this to
work it i think it's got to work with
large-scale fairly abstract paintings
and so I've been starting to put
together the plan of doing a large-scale
fairly abstract pastel drawing to which
will add some sound and of course dan
has been following this process and knew
what you guys were doing here and
decided will perhaps we ought to be put
in contact and so that happened was it
back in November that you put me in
touch with Neal I think it was something
like that um and it's led to me coming
over here and spending 11 days with then
and Anita and people over in Joseph sort
of walking exploring the landscape and
collecting information both visual so
that i can create some big drawings but
also audible so that we can we have
audio to put with the drawings so yeah
that's how i've got from going to art
college back in 79 to just stood here
with you people on this really exciting
project so hopefully that's what's
happening to like me yeah yeah well i
was i put my foot down on them yeah yeah
yeah so we do our time for questions if
there's any yeah anyone what's dogskin
king over I have a question um you a lot
of yours has dealt with landscape but
I'm wondering if you could maybe speak a
little bit more on what
you know personal meaning you find it
landscape and white significant balanced
art form um well I thought this was
quite strange as I say up for many years
you know when I was art college after
that most of my work was based on sort
of much more man-made environments
landscape nonetheless but but man-made
environments but I've always just ever
since my father introduced me to her
walking I've been passionate about that
going out in the wild I think it's
something about that just the quietness
getting away from sort of busy roads
busy arguments busy towns and just being
out of wonder one of the great things
about Scotland is that you have a almost
complete right to Rome you have to be
aware of stalking times when the biggest
states are stalking and you have to
respect the rest' you know some of the
restrictions that there are around then
but in in in theory you can move almost
anywhere in upland Scotland and I just
love that that thing that you don't have
to stay on a path or a trail and in fact
nature and I you know some of the best
walks we've had when we look in the
guidebook for some of the mountains and
you look at the route that the guy book
has and you think right okay that's
going to be quite full of walkers so
we're not going to go there we're going
to go along here and we're going to just
head off up the side of the hill and
there's a there is a great kind of
freedom um but there's also stunning
beauty of the landscape um you know I
can't see much of it these days I see
very much in terms of of kind of pattern
I guess these days I don't see detail
but your brain fills in the rest I
suppose I've been lucky that I had 30
years of almost perfect sight so my
brain has a lot of kind of memories but
yeah it I think it is just the sheer
beauty and solitude of being in some of
these places and in eyes brought up in
the hills of Wales which there are quiet
bits you know Kemal van van was very
very quiet there's more walkers got
there now but when you and I were first
there you would you know quite off Nazi
assault but a lot of the bigger
mountains in Wales they're very busy
very busy trails um Scotland oh you can
go up and as long as you avoid bed
nervous the biggest one and Ben Lomond
I'm a fewer the big popular Monroe's and
especially if you keep off the the main
paths which most of the monitors have
now you can you know go a whole day
without seeing anyone and in fact just a
few summers ago we kind we climbed a
Monroe called Ben school odd on the very
west of west coast of Scotland and his
big rocky mountain with fabulous sort of
very rough rocky undulating ridge and
the main summits at the far end of the
region it was a perfect day that
virtually not a cloud in the sky gentle
breeze to keep the bugs away and to keep
you cool and nature and I I'm very very
slow this is one thing about being
guided and not being at sea I'm
incredibly slow so we used to do a big
walk we have to start at perhaps half
eight in the morning or earlier and
we're quite often were in fact we've got
a fairly proud record to be in the last
car in the car park we're nearly always
coming off the mountains as the lightest
is going down and the sun's getting low
and that day we did this phenomenal walk
and we didn't see anyone the whole time
and and there's something really quite
you know just very very special about
these places and that's what excites me
and that's what I try and convey these
days into my paintings something of the
spirit of the place they're not you know
incredibly accurate representations that
even whole factor of representations for
the most part especially the more
abstract pieces there about me being in
these places about the the experience of
of the day they're all titled with very
specific places they're all about
specific you know days specific moments
sometimes although you know for the most
part people come in and and I get this
experience quite a lot of my studio say
it's open to the public when people come
in and they look at the labels and
they'll suddenly say and I haven't been
there but I feel like I have and I think
that means my paintings are kind of
doing something right because they're
they're picking up on the save the
spirit of these wild places yeah it
could be it could be interesting to you
talk about the thing that was exciting
you about the idea of the proximity and
the audio changing as well moved away
from from from the work for go any
creation yeah um one of one of the ideas
that work starting to play around with
is the drawings like this one in
particular for this project that we're
I'm proposing to do arm three large
pastel drawings scribble pastel line
they're going to be around about 8 feet
by four each so big drawings and one of
the things about this one that when when
you get close up to it it's just a
complete massive scribble of line it is
a bit like looking at a Jackson Pollock
painting but as you pull back and you
get further the landscape kind of opens
up in in a sort of vague way and one of
the things that that quite excited me
when I heard about this kind of idea of
being out at this proximity thing was
that sort of we may be out to sort of do
something we sound that sort of is
similar to the kind of visual thing so
that possibly when you're stood very
close to the drawing and you're right
front and all you can see is lines that
the audio that goes with it the audio
recordings are a complete mash of the
different little bits of audio clips
that we've made while out in what was
the the Oregon canyons but as you pull
back that sound starts to sort of pull
together so that when you're right back
you're then getting at an overall
soundtrack of maybe you know sort of one
of the drawings these can be based on on
a place we visited called what horn
coral ridge yeah sorry um and it's right
at the top of the canyon and the canyon
just drops away for was it almost 3,000
feet isn't it it's a long way and so as
you the idea beam as you pulled away
eventually from having a complete set of
cacophony of overlapping bits of sound
and audio that you come back to a much
broader soundtrack which is just the
sound of the wind blowing over the top
of the canyon and perhaps a few insects
or the rain spattering down and so
you're kind of mimicking the the kind of
transition of the visual side of being
closed up to something this scale and
then pulling back so with the audio so
is that there's a whole lot of
possibilities but you know it's it's
quite exciting for me because I know my
site is getting worse and and I like to
sort of think that you know I now go to
a big gallery or music museum and I
really struggled to see anything it's
it's it's really difficult and of course
you can't get up desperately close
normally to work and so the whole idea
when when Neal first got in touch that
you know maybe this might be a kind of a
first step towards providing something
that would give people like myself a
better access to two-dimensional work
you know it's really exciting but of
course the thing we've realized over
this is that you know obviously we
haven't the time for me to go away now
and do three big drawings you know if
there's a lot of drawing to be done in
just three months but we haven't got
that time to then say right we've got
three drawings and I ship them across to
you here in Seattle and and then you say
right well now we'll work out the sound
we're doing this all at once we've been
out we had to first
side what type of landscape to do the
work on and there's three different very
different types of landscape at Joseph
in Oregon where we've just been there's
high alpine mountains high prairie and
then these deep canyons and we had to
try and visit that is very briefly in
the first couple of days so I had an
idea of what I might try and do the work
on any the Canyonlands seemed to be to
me that the most interesting the most
different for me and then what about a
minute oh right and then of course we
had to go and collect all the
information so this whole project is is
much more than just a a thing where
people will be able to interpret a piece
of work it's it's it's a much broader
thing it's a piece of work in its own
right the audio the the interpretation
is is part of the the artwork part of
the drawing okay thank you to use
amazing as you track the very well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
