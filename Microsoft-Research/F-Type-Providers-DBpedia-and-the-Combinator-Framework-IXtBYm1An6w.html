you
okay thanks for coming everyone and uh
my pleasure to introduce Andrew from
Queens University and it's been great to
have you here as an intern this this
summer yeah it's been how many interns
we got left here in the audience it was
good it's not over yet that's good it's
been a really pleasurable summer to have
to have you all visiting and Andrews has
been was initially set the task of Thai
provider for dbpedia to get his his his
his toes wet in the sea of data and
programming and and then moved on to
look at the more general question of
Combinator's of type providers and over
to you Andrew and thanks again for for
being here for the summer all right
thanks Don um can everyone hear me okay
okay yeah like Don mentioned I've been
an intern here for the last three months
and this is my end of internship talk
I'm going to be talking today about F
sharp type providers both a specific
type provider called dbpedia and also a
framework for combining type providers
together so I'm going to start this talk
with a brief history of linked data on
the web you may know this as this map
the Semantic Web each of these nodes is
a data store and each of the arrows
represents data in the data store that
is referenced or linked to an entity in
a different data store so this was the
situation in may 2007 there's just a
handful of data stores each maintained
by sort of a different a different
company or a different organization by
october two thousand seven the number of
data stores has doubled and this trend
of growth sort of continues into the end
of 2007 and into the start of 2008 now
in 2009 there's an explosion of new date
sources as the Semantic Web really takes
off and the situation today is something
that looks like this now this is a lot
of data and this diagram has been
colored basically by category so on the
far right-hand side you have in green
all the data source related to
publications on the left hand side you
have data stores related to government
and teal things likes US census data at
the bottom in pink life sciences things
like pubmed lived there now part of the
vision of F sharp type providers is to
bring all this data into the F sharp
language and in fact we already have
some type providers that do that for
instance we have a freebase type
provider but what I've been working on
over the last three months a large part
is building a type provider for
something called dbpedia and as you can
see from this diagram it really lives at
the center of these entities on the web
so it's a pretty important one so what
is dbpedia well consider for example the
typical Wikipedia page you have a lot of
unstructured content in the main article
things that are easy for humans to read
but difficult for computers to
understand but a lot of these Wikipedia
pages have an infobox on the side and
this info box contains a lot more
structured information so what dbpedia
does is basically extracts all the facts
in the information from these info boxes
in the format of RDF triples and makes
them available on the internet for free
and as you can see from the data in the
info box there's a lot of hyperlinks to
other Wikipedia pages and the extraction
process that dbpedia uses actually
maintains these links so what you end up
with is a highly sort of interconnected
web of semantic data so that's great but
how can we as a developer oh yes
question
how do you know it's consistent with the
text on the left or that up to the
maintainer of the page it's up to the
maintainer of the page there's no cross
referencing to the actual body of the
article yeah so how do you as the
developer gain access to this you know
treasure trove of information one way is
through a program like this this is a
java program using the jenna library and
it's it's fairly straightforward up at
the top you defined your endpoint you
want to connect to then you define the
query you want to run you execute the
query get a result set back and then you
can iterate over the result set and
maybe do something with it like printed
out so this is a fairly straightforward
I'm going to briefly go over the query
here just sort of explain what's going
on the query basically takes a named
entity called Albert Einstein and finds
his academic advisor and then finds the
advisors alma mater and finally finds
the alma mater 'he's name and that's
what's returned as as the query the name
of einstein's advisors alma mater it's
basically a simple inner join query but
there's a couple problems with this
approach or a couple downsides and one
is that there's no static typing for
these names for example you know oh well
Albert Einstein is not likely to change
but if it was for example the name of a
company that got incorporated or merged
with another company the name of that
entity might actually change and you
won't find out until run time when
something either throws an exception or
in this case it wouldn't actually throw
an exception would just return 0 result
set in which case this while loop would
never never actually execute anything so
it would be a lot nicer if you could if
you could have some sort of static
typing for these names that if they
change over time behind behind your back
then you have some compile type safety
and this is one of the advantages of F
sharp type providers so I'm going to
switch to a demo of the dbpedia type
provider just to give you an example
of what it looks like the first thing
you do to access the dbpedia type
provider is access it through its
namespace which is f sharp the data
dbpedia and this is a type that's
provided by the type provider and this
type has a method called get data
context that we can call and we are
going to bind the results to this
variable called data and with this
variable we can access some of the data
in this dbpedia database so there's an
ontology that's available and this
ontology basically categorizes a lot of
different different parts of Wikipedia
so we're going to try to look for or
recreate this this query in our in our
DBP idiot I provider so we going to look
for first the Albert Einstein entity and
we do that by well just by discovery
basically he's probably not an activity
he might be an agent I'm going to drill
down into agent and take a look agent
has sub categories like dat family
organization person well I'd say he's a
person if we drill down into that we can
see a lot of other subcategories
ambassador archaeologist he probably
wasn't any of those things but I'm going
to take a guess and say oh he's a
scientist and look at the subcategories
of this we have entomologist medician
and professor well I don't think he was
any of those things so I'm actually
going to drill down into the individuals
of scientist and each of these ontology
categories has an individual's property
so I'm going to save this into a
variable called scientists and then I
can take a look at my scientists and I
see a bunch of actual individual
scientists people's names and
if I search for Albert II I can see all
the Albert ease and the first one is
this Albert Einstein conveniently pops
up this tool tip that tells me albert
einstein was a german-born theoretical
physicist he developed the general
theory of relativity ok I'm pretty sure
I had the right guy ok so once I have
this entity named Albert Einstein I can
dot into him and see a bunch of
properties about him so the abstract is
the is the string that on the wikipedia
page each wikipedia page has an abstract
there's other things like his alma mater
every time you see a DV pedia rough-in
in parenthesis that represents an
internal link to another entity in
dbpedia which has more structure that
you can you can further explore so going
back to my original query I wanted
Albert Einstein's advisors alma mater
name ok so Albert Einstein's academic
advisor dot alma mater dot name and
that's how you achieve the same thing
using this F sharp type provider so very
quickly I'm going to just show you how
you'd run this I'm going to run this in
f-sharp interactive by first sending a
reference to this dll and then every
time i select some command i can press
alt enter and send it to F sharp
interactive and you can see the results
down here so I'm going to first send my
data or set my bind my data variable
then bind my scientists and finally I'm
going to calculate this name or figure
out what the name is and the result
appears at the bottom so this is sort of
how the type provider framework enjoy
works and how there's dbpedia tie
provider works in particular another
thing i want to show you quickly before
i go back is a search feature and this
is accessed using the same namespace
f-sharp data dot instead of dbpedia it's
this dbpedia search and this takes
actually two parameters the first one is
a string that represents a ontology
topic so you could plug in something
like agent or a person or scientist into
this category let's say we're searching
for Albert Einstein but we can't
remember his first name we could maybe
search for a person any person that has
Einstein I can't spell his name Einstein
isn't in his name and we'll save this
will call it Einstein search and once we
have this type provided by the type
provider we can call this search results
method and it'll actually under the
covers go to the DV pediat endpoint
execute the query and return any person
who has einstein and his name and this
is all happening at compile time so all
of these values are sort of compile-time
safer statically typed and we can find
Albert Einstein the same way and do
everything that we did before ok so I'm
going to go back so the dbpedia type
provider is 0 these are a couple slides
that I we've already covered I'm just
going to skip over them the dbpedia type
provider actually has a very simple type
specification behind it and it pretty
much fits on this slide so even though
the dbpedia type provider can cover
millions and millions of different
topics it's actually very concise how to
describe it
using this type specification and that's
all I'm going to say about that yeah
okay so it basically describes at the
top level we have a root type that's
dbpedia and it has a get data context
method and that gate the gate
datacontext method has an ontology
property that returns a thing ontology
type and thing is the sort of the
topmost category everything is a thing
then for every something ontology type
and it has various properties has for
every subtopic and the ontology new
property is provided for that and it
also each ontology topic has an
individual's property and then once you
devote drill down into the individuals
each individual type has a list of its
individuals and each specific individual
has a list of its properties that that's
essentially what this specification is
saying basically what I would have just
demoed for you but but this simple
specification covers millions and
millions of cases and a categorization
of them ok so the effort that goes into
building one of these tie providers is
pretty significant it takes takes a lot
of time takes a lot of resources and
traditionally they've been constructed
as these sort of giant monolithic code
entities and what we've been trying to
do recently is experiment with a
framework that allows us to compose them
using sort of building blocks more more
piecewise and essentially build them up
that way instead of one huge effort and
what we find quite often is even type
providers with different shapes
different different purposes and
different functionality often share
pieces in common for example
caching is a common one so for example
if you're working with your your data
source online and you're able to catch
all the interactions you have with that
data source through the tie provider
then when you go offline or you don't
have that resource available you can
still use the local cache to to interact
with it so so yeah our goal using this
framework is to combine pieces together
to build these type providers more
easily and I'll actually plug in new
functionality to existing type providers
as well and we've been calling these
pieces type provider Combinator's so I'm
going to go over a specific Combinator
that I've been working on recently
called the chain Combinator and the idea
is that type provider a provides a
series of types and not the periphery of
those types is a set of properties here
in green and those properties have
primitive primitive values like strings
in spool ians and quite often these
things represent a link to some other
data some other structure that it
doesn't know how to provide types for so
for example it could be a URL in this
case the DBP dro that references a
resource in dbpedia that has its own
properties its own structure but ty
provider a doesn't know how to provide
types for it so it just it just uses a
string another example could be a link
to a file CSV file has a lot of
structure in it but ty provider a might
not know how to provide types for it so
the idea behind this framework there
this Combinator rather is that we can
take one of these strings one of these
links and pass it to a type provider
that does know how to provide types for
it so we have for example a CSV type
provider if we we pass this link to a
CSV file to a CSV tie provider it knows
how to provide types for it and the
chain commoner basically links these two
pieces together automatically and yeah
i'm going to show you example
okay I'm just going to get rid of this
okay so what we're going to do is linked
together to type providers one for the
file system which basically just
provides types representing the
directories and files in your file
system and we're going to link that to a
CSV type provider so we're going to
access the file system I'm going to do
this manually first to show you and then
I'll show you how it's done
automatically using the Combinator
framework this takes one parameter which
is a link to a directory or a reference
to a directory and i'm going to call
this whoops i'm going to call I'm going
to call this my demo directory
and if i look at my demo directory I see
three sub directories content files and
tools and if I look into my further into
my content subdirectory I can see a data
subdirectory I can see filename indexed
fsx and another file called tutorial fsx
and I can further dig down and see CSV
files xml files and text files in this
directory so the file system type
provider by itself doesn't know how to
parse any of these files so it just
returns strings and I'm going to create
a variable called SF a CSV file and set
it to my CSV file and I'm going to
create another one called XML file and
set it to the xml file in the same
directory ok now if I take a look at the
type of CSV file it's just a string so
if I do a dot on it I just see the
standard net string properties and
methods ok so in order to sort of
execute this or take a look at the
values I can execute each of these and
my CSV file value has the actual file
path to that file c equal and / demo /
content / data / msft csv and what I
want to do is actually look into the
content of that CSV file provide provide
the types associated with that CSV file
so for that I'll need the CSV type
provider and that's access using F sharp
dot CSV provider
and I'm going to copy the link that I
got down here and reuse it I'm going to
replace all the slashes with double
slashes and I'm going to name this msft
and now I have a type called msft and I
can call the methods provided by the CSV
provider for instance taking a look at
the rose and if I reference the right
dll I should be able to take a look at
the actual rose in the CSV file provided
as a sequence of tuples in f-sharp so
this is how you do this step manually
i'm going to show you now how you do it
automatically using the Combinator
framework okay so this is sort of a
blank sheet on how a space where we can
create type providers and to create a
type provider or to create the the
Combinator we we start by creating the
same way we create a normal-type
provider i'm going to name this my
chained provider it takes a
configuration argument and typically oh
I need to mark this as type provider so
the compiler knows typically you define
the contents of this type provider right
here all the members all the methods
everything that goes into it would be
defined here but when we're defining
them compositionally we use another
approach and that's to inherit this type
provider expression class
and we pass in a value that represents
the expression that that represents the
type providers we want to combine so I'm
going to create a helper function here
called FS to CSV the file system to CSV
chain that we're trying to build and
it's going to take one argument called
config and I'm going to define it up
here ok so for the first step for
putting this together is to create an
instance of the type providers we want
to combine so our file system type
provider we're going to get a reference
to that using this helper function that
I've already defined elsewhere and we're
going to get a reference to our CSV type
provider and then we can actually
combine them together and we use F
sharps for pipe sort of a pipeline to to
accomplish that so we start off with our
file system type provider and we
actually have to go through a
simplification and addie simplification
step and briefly this is needed because
the dotnet type system which is what F
sharp typically uses makes it very
complicated to write these Combinator's
so we go through a simplification
process where we simplify the type
algebra and then apply our Combinator's
and then d simplify it so you just have
to book end the the transformation with
these simplified e simplify steps and if
you look at the types simplify simply
takes an i-type provider and returns a
nice simple type provider and d simplify
does the opposite it takes a simple
version and returns the original version
what's an example
so essentially it just takes all the
dotnet types and it's essentially just a
transformer but in order to make our
framework easy to write and easy to use
we have to do these steps at the at the
front on the back yes it can it can
always it can always be done it works on
any f sharp dotnet type top or bottom
wall is deploying the compiler sits on
the darknet types court system type and
sis about member inference system not
metheny for this reflection objects that
used to transact type information with
the components those types have a lot of
junk in them they're there they don't
they have a lot of extra stuff that the
tie provide a framework doesn't need and
are also they're sort of utility help
kind of methods so you basically throw
all that junk away into a simplified
algebra and it's much easier to do
transformations over I mean like
probably ten times easier to get those
transformations correct and then you d
simplified back to project back into the
into the into this what to be able to
actually plug in so yeah we have were
actually written these Combinator's
without the simplification process but
as Don said it's much much harder so it
can be done there's no technical reason
why we have to do it this way we just
find it much easier ok so once you once
you have those bookends in place you can
just focus on the actual Combinator that
you want to apply in this case there's a
function called expand static data that
does sort of what you saw on the slide
before it takes static data and expands
it into a type system based on a new
type provider and an argument so this
takes an argument that's a function and
I'm going to use the lambda notation so
this function takes an argument which is
going to be a string
i'm going to call this string s and the
body of this of this lamb of the
function is going to be a decision if s
dot ends with CSV so if we have a string
that that ends with dot CSV then I'm
going to return some information about
what we want to combine it with also i'm
going to return none so none means don't
do anything just ignore it and some
tupple means yes do something with it
and here is the information so the first
element in the topple is going to be the
type provider I want to instantiate it's
going to be my CSV type provider which
I've already defined above and the
second part is going to be sort of a
reform matter if you recall I had to
change the backslashes into a double box
lashes for the argument that I'm passing
in and this is what I'm going to do here
I'm going to replace the single
backslash into double backslash ok so
I'm going to save that and compile it
into my dll
let me make this a bit bigger for you
yeah okay let me get rid of this so now
remember the CSV file before used to be
a string now it's not a string it's a
type F sharp dot CSV provider and where
we used to be able to see the string
methods we can now see the actual
content of this type provider so i can
look at the rose and the same way as I
did before and I'm just going to try
running this just to demonstrate that it
works the same way and if I say CSV dot
rows instead of getting a string I get
the actual content so that's the simple
way to sort of plug together different
type providers and explore the data that
used to be just a string now I can
actually dig into it and see see what
the contents of that of that structure
is and our xml file over here is still
just a string because i'm not targeting
xml files i'm targeting only csv files
time's up I could show you other stuff
but that's fine I can go okay can I show
the other okay yeah that's fine that
concludes my demo that concludes my talk
I want to give a big thanks to my mentor
dawn to Victor the bright minds intern
who I work with closely and to Thomas
who also contributed to the Combinator
framework thank you
now you build the chain typewriter
somewhere else and you compile it and
then you could use it is it possible to
build it on the fly so I I just know
that I want to use this type of ireland
by the way I want to expand these things
so yeah there's there's if it fits a
certain pattern or a certain case and
and we've already written a one to do
that then you can essentially just take
the function that we've already written
and and use it just like I've like I've
done here but if you need to do if you
have a situation that that is not
covered by what we've already written
then you'll need to sort of roll your
own so okay I need to go to this
database and I by the way I know it
happens to stall some links that i need
an 02 i know i need to expand those into
xml files can I just take oh but I have
this company that can take that database
by provider and food together with this
X multiplied both of which some on this
road and then I just say now I want to
use that and I will immediately happy
yes in principle the answer is yes ya
khuda could you switch back to your code
I'll elaborate a little on that because
it also points to sort of next steps in
this work and you can see where the sea
column demo is at the top the static
parameter to the thai provider in the
f-sharp type provider for F model for F
sharp 3.0 and 3.1 you can only pass
fairly simple static data in as
parameters you can't for instance pass a
type of information or you can't even
pass an array of data or static data and
there's no there but most crucially you
can't pass type of information and so
the question is whether we extend the f
job language to allow you to pass
compositions effectively like take that
expression pass that in as a
compositions of things in the script
itself and behind the scenes you'd be
getting on the fly compositions I think
what you mean by on the fly is like as
you code without having to make a new
type provide a component it's sort of
just it kind of you can pose them in the
same so
far without switching across so our
intent well that sort of the next steps
really would be to allow passing
motorist or information systems or type
information and that would in turn we
believe that would be enough to allow
you to just sort of make up compositions
as you go so for instance you might
hopefully be enough to allow you to list
maybe you'd have a Combinator which
takes ten type providers or an arbitrary
number of them and some indication about
how they stitched together like the dot
CSV kind of extensions and sort of just
does the the closure of all the possible
completions for that but that's next
steps and I mean I think it's what i
like about this is we kind of got to
that a stable point and then we're ready
to take the next the next steps it's a
fair yep yeah so so currently we we
can't we can't we can't do it on the fly
I guess as dawn was was describing we
have to actually specify which
combinations we want and compile it into
a new assembly and then use that
assembly currently we can't sort of
build that assembly on the fly as your
as you're coding but it's not
technically impossible yeah proposed a
future the future language feature yeah
motivates of future language region yeah
yeah thing is clearly a useful piece in
the framework and ah similarly this
extension I also sounds great are there
other Combinator's in the framework that
I mean is that all you need or do you
need a tease for see other companies as
well we actually have implemented other
Combinator's in fact victor the bright
minds in turn has done a lot of work in
that area so he's implemented a caching
Combinator he's implemented a Combinator
where you can hide various properties
and methods based on a regular
expression syntax he's done ones where
you can add new static parameters to
your type provider
so yeah I don't know this or any others
yeah I mean in some sense you're taking
all of Wikipedia and doing a
transformation of a rotating any
information source and doing
transformations it's probably like a
just a vast number of Combinator's that
you can do over over those over
arbitrary information with associated
metadata metadata I the you've mentioned
some of the ones we're thinking of there
for instance doing query language
implementations it's quite tricky that
if there was some some way you could mix
in an implementation of queries
especially for often with this god it's
the kind of work you don't need you get
eighty percent of the value display
having queries that support map and a
selection and filtering for example and
if you could kind of mix in a query
implementation based on some fairly
simple information on like given this
here's how to format the query strings
or something I don't know then you could
save a get yeah so a huge amount of
effort but um yeah I think that it's
early days but it's really a just I'd
encourage people to just think about
like if I had all of these data of a
data data source with the associated
metadata then what will I do with it
like one example we came up with just
brainstorming about that is like there's
soft metadata that comes along with
these things do like the comments that
you saw about Albert Einstein and what
if you just automatically translated all
names and all and fall into another
England other human language
automatically so you put a filter over
an information source and suddenly
that's all in Japanese despite passing
that stuff off and that's quite
interesting right or yeah there's it's
yeah lots of potential things it could
be done another question George of all
the access control seems like when I can
you know like three did you want to
access
they completed basis or so yeah so the
question is about access control I mean
type providers they often take for
instance parameters representing an API
key to access yeah no let's take one
example so doing an open orth often a
type provider is backed by a web service
of some kind and that needs
authentication and and so you'll find
it's common type provided parameters for
for passing an API keys or doing
authentication in some way and it's
possible that would drop out in a
standard enough way that you could sort
of mix that in to a tie provider
implementation potentially with some
standard static parameters to control
how authentication is mixed in yeah yeah
so that's it's possible yeah it's kind
of we're kind of working inductive lease
from from taking examples and I'm trying
to find enough commonality to build to
build them yeah yeah yep yep one more
question ya dumb question which is I'm
not super familiar with tie providers
and so what's the relationship between a
type provider and accessing a database
in runtime I mean it's this with the
idea being that if you authenticate via
type provider this is sort of I fixed at
compile time and it's then you know it's
a constant whenever you run the program
or one especially I think so yeah the
idea behind type providers is it
provides F sharp types at compile time
based on the schema of your remote data
source so the step of actually going and
querying the data source for its for its
schema actually happens at compile time
and as such you get statically typed
compile safe methods and types to work
with
and that only happens in the typical
situation at runtime or you don't even
get that safety because you only know
when something changes based on what
you've coded against at runtime is that
yeah so if you need author if you need
credentials to access a schema then you
at compile time then yes you would you
you would have to have those credentials
and often you might use a different set
of the one reason why these get data
context methods appears to allow you to
use certain credentials at compile time
to access your internal system
development system and then other
credentials at runtime for example based
on the users credentials coming into the
system and of course there's a soundless
with you the it's only sound if if the
scheme is opposed to the internal system
and the external system matchup for
example like for example here my
directory structure changed then my
program wouldn't compile anymore whereas
in a in a typical non type provider
language your program would still
compile and it would run and it would
fail you'll get a runtime exception yeah
so you type check early type check often
continuous integration life checking
every every day every night as often as
possible you land the advantage of that
is you'll at least get you've got some
chance of seeing the change happening
before your runtime system latest
crashes in some yeah the idea is to try
to catch these problems as quickly as
possible or as early as possible right
okay let's think Andrew again and yes
