you
so with that I'm going to turn it over
to Bernardo who is going to come and
share all his tips and tricks that he's
stumbled on to and figured out as in his
apt building so Bernardo thank you very
much seems we all want to make money
with our apps so that's hopefully
something that I'll be able to share my
experience today and so the goal of
today is really tell you what I've
learned about making money and
monetizing your apps after building 19
apps already in the marketplace and the
this is gonna be a very practical
session so I would recommend that you
download the apps that my app so you can
look it up with my name because i'll be
showing real examples of how this some
of these techniques apply to different
apps I mean I have some screenshots but
it's easier if you tried it in the phone
so I'll talk a little bit about the why
some decisions were made and then actual
real numbers and real examples and real
code about how the does that translate
the code and that translate to money a
bottom line and please ask me any
questions that you have so have 19 apps
the latest one is laser link was
approved yesterday so it's in the
marketplace and you can see there are
free and paid versions of all of them
except one liquid paint and been
developing for about a year and my wife
is not very happy about my weekends
because it takes a while to develop this
app but based on that I've tried free
I've tried paid I've tried different
models and I'll share what I've seen
with us this this apps as I go through
the sites i marked with the this thing
very important so where you see that
really pay more attention because this
is some of the tips that have made more
impact when monetizing the apps in
particular if you have only a little bit
of time download this 3 these are the
most recent ones and those are the most
advanced examples of what I'm going to
be talking about box it never wore and
laser link and you'll see this this
techniques in I know this apps so so the
first question I think I want to make
sure you ask yourself is you know you
want to make money but really how much
time how much expertise what what do you
want to achieve III don't want to tell
how many hours I've spent on this but to
make one you have to spend time and I've
actually spent thousands of dollars on
an external help for some of this app so
so depends on what you want to do that's
what you're going to be able to achieve
so if you want to spend a lot of money
or if you want to spend a lot of time or
not that's that's something very
important before you start running app
some of this take probably three four
hundred hours right I'm test so it's
quite a bit of investment and of course
then you get the rewards of all of that
I also think about what's your area of
expertise as you'll see all these apps
you'll start to see some common pattern
I there's no 3d graphics there there's
no advanced music in all of them that
there's what I can do well is some
reasonable set of apps and those are the
ones that you can see that are mostly in
silverlight mostly is not very advanced
animations those other ones I feel
comfortable each of you will have to
decide what's your area of expertise
because you'll see later you have to do
a really good job to make money with
this with this apps the next thing is
you're not going to make money of free
apps and that's that's an important a
statement here because I see there are
three types of apps and again as you
think about your app you have to put it
where do I want this app to be if it's
free it's free you don't make any money
out of it and you'll see some apps that
i made that are free the next one is
it's paid by ads so you're selling ads
and that's subtle distinction as you
later why it's important but so either
it's free and it's totally free or
you're going to sell at or you're going
to sell the app you can mix a little bit
of those two models and I'll show some
examples but in general I try to figure
out if this is the way I'm going to make
money with a certain app or this is the
way I'm going to make money or turn up
or I'm not going to make money just
going to give it out for free and it
depending on what you do the app is
different forgetting about free if it's
going to be selling at you need to sell
a service and add is an impression so
you want to make sure there are more
impressions of that there's it's you
want to make sure people come back to
you
and use it more and more and more when I
see comments in my apps i'd say i'm
addicted to this app that's perfect that
means they're coming back they're coming
back they like that experience and
they're coming back and seeing it more
whereas if you're going to sell it it's
a little bit different you need to give
them enough that they have fun but but
then they they want to buy it and after
they buy then that's it that's them in
addition there's no more money decision
so those are a little bit different
models and then the way you develop app
and then the way you do updates it's
different depending what type of
monetization you want to have I also
what I've done is I've looked at all the
competitors iphone android and others
and figure out how they do it there what
works what doesn't work to be able to
choose the right model for each at it's
not working well so so all the apps that
you saw before they fall into these
categories so have a couple of apps the
free now are basically free and i'll
talk a little more about how that works
you see most of the apps i have right
now are based on selling ads and the
last one is one that it's a show a paid
app yeah even though both all of them
have a paid and a free version or paid
on trial and free version the
monetization is very different for each
of those and you'll see with the trade
of submitting the apps so let's start
with free free to me again add this is
my experience it's an experimental app I
try to do some experiments or I try to
it's not very polished I'm not going to
be committing to doing any updates I'm
not going to spend a lot of time in it
it's somebody by said in case they buy
it you know it's good i'm not going to
continue improving it and they're 21 is
my first experiment with XNA just too
cool drawing program and actually it's
the one that I've SAT percentage most
people buy I don't know why it's like
ten percent but but I mean I'm probably
ten cents a day of it and this one is
just a speed flash cards to try to touch
two cards and see how fast we can Matt
my map two different cards it's worth
most of fun experiment to try to port it
to Windows 8 but it's there when I get a
little bit of money and I'm not going to
support it and if people complain a lot
baby I'll fix it but really I'm this are
more of an experimental type of app and
that's good you could do those
but if you want to sell it which is why
I have one up here it's very different
you need to make sure the initial
reviews are awesome and you need to make
sure that you have enough content they
get people hooked and then they want to
buy the whole thing and some ways of
doing that is to create an app that is
crippled that means it doesn't have all
the functionality of course it doesn't
have all the levels it has enough levels
to get people hope but then they want to
buy more levels it needs to be so good
so good that people want to buy it
actually I received a comment from one
of my apps couple days ago that said you
know I love this app I would never pay
for it so that app I have put it as pain
I would have sold prolly 20 times a year
I probably thought that the quality of
some xbox games or that they wouldn't
want to buy it but they would be willing
to pay if it's free they're paying me
for ads it needs to be very simple to
buy the paid version there seems to be a
big bottle by now and it takes you to
the x version updates are not that
important once they bought it they
bought it what's important is the
reviews there's a really really good
article here I i recommend you take a
look at it it's from a developer that
analyze how iphone paid apps sell what
doesn't sell well one of the strategies
and I actually use some of the ideas
it's not easy I mean and what they were
saying is to be able to do a good paid
app in iphone takes at least fifty
thousand dollars of development because
there's so much competition there and
we're lucky in some ways they're there
we don't have half a million have a half
a million apps yet but the apps are
getting better here so there's gonna be
a moment that you argue if you want to
do this you have to invest a significant
amount of time of money and professional
development to compete in that market
nevertheless I this is really good
analysis tells you how much money other
apps have made and I haven't made and
why and they don't talk about that it's
the only about paid so let me let me
give you the example of this one which
is a baby sound cards it's an
application I did for my daughter too so
she can actually to flashcards you touch
them and it makes a noise or it makes
the sound
in English Spanish French but this
little app I paid more than eight
hundred dollars into sounds and music
and images so high resolution images
it's better than any iPhone equivalent
half there's a couple similar like that
but really my only goal here was to
teach my daughter and but sell it to
sell it and to able to recoup the money
in at least at most a year it's not a
lot of money but I thought I mean it's
practice so how do i how did I get
people to pay for this app and actually
it is it is the app that i sell most of
all the other ones even though the
number of downloads is very little
number one it's a better experience so
for example if you if you already have
the paid version you have the full
screen if you don't have the paid
version it gets compressed and you see
the ad so you see better images the
second one is you get Buy Now button and
in this case for this app is great
because kids are touching the screen so
two things happen hey I get a lot of
good click so the the click rate the the
CPM is just extremely high it's nine
eight dollars this yeah everybody's
touching it and parents don't want that
so they buy it I mean really it is a
kitty touching everywhere and they want
kids to learn english until you learn
spanish and to learn french and all I
and the other one is I don't give them
all the content if you see here there
four categories so for the first
category they get everything which is a
really good experience but for the other
categories they only get part of the
content so is the one to that the kid
really likes trucks or read well there's
no trucks until you buy it but but it's
not that I gave them only one icon I get
into the whole first screen so there's
enough content that I can actually use
it but they end up buying it a high
percentage of them buying and so this is
some examples of how I make an appt
wanting to people want to purchase this
F so that's that's an example of a paid
app before I go forward any questions on
this yes so feed a triad version is
celery
fevers the pay actually let me go to the
next next slide which answers the
question about page versus trial versus
three and I've seen very many
presentations here about page versus
free versus maintaining different
versions and I'll tell you how I do it
which I haven't developed code in 20
years so maybe I'm doing something weird
but it's to me it's very simple I have
one code for everything paid free trial
it's just one code I change two things
every time I want to recompile number
one I put some constant with certain
values and number two I changed some of
properties of the name and the icon
that's it and you'll see you the
implications of that but so so the
version you see all my apps if you go to
about in the apps you will see the F or
you don't see the F depending on the
constant I put there and inside the code
I change four three two yes or no and
then what happens is inside the code I
do things like that if that variable was
defined then during run time when when I
am initializing the code I what do we do
i remove bottoms add buttons hide images
shrink the screen things like that so
basically I only have one version of the
code for the pay and they're paid is
Heights things trial and free are
identical and I get a lot more downloads
of the free than of the trial because
try is it trial is in the paid category
so people like to like to try it for you
of their wanted free or they want to try
out whatever they're going to get ads
because that's how I make money I I
invest hundreds of hours that's that's
the return they're getting great support
that's a service that they're getting
great support they're getting updates
they can complain about it out how to
fix it and and underpaid actually
removes on that so that's one way I'm i
found of being able to simplify the
number of applications i have so i have
like 10 different files each of them
with just changing these variables and
you get change so let me give you an
extreme example of these have two apps
in the market place dots and box it this
is encode
this is changing those two variables and
that's it and I change it two variables
i change the if it's going to be boxed
in and dots and the same map gets
compiled and runs differently so i put
it in different categories different
names with different music different
look and feel but you can see the same
app and I didn't have to maintain two
different versions of the source code
different different files different form
just make sure they are synchronized
nothing like that it's just one simple
one single version of the code and that
really helps when you have 19 apps and
you have to then certainly I find one
new technique like the ones you'll see
today and I have to apply to 90
different files took me a month to
actually go through all the apps and add
that new feature or trick and then again
so I have to try to simplify the number
of different files I have to maintain
and I hope this helps you because you
are all figuring out how to do the paid
how do i do a trial etc yes how do you
know what price to charge for the for
the paid app because you know isn't it
possible that you would have somebody
who's so addicted to the free version
they see so many ads that you would make
more money on that version and you what
if you charge 99 cents for the pain I
mean how do you know what to charge
there I asked my son and my son looks at
the app and said that no you can never
charge more than 99 cents for that up
and he buys all the app so there's only
one app that i have that is more than 99
cents which is exactly the app that
actually more more people are
downloading and using by far actually
not done running it's about half of the
downloads but much more usage than any
other and that i actually have increased
the price so actually exactly i want
people to be using the free one more and
more but if that you've put a paid more
than three dollars especially the
categories are mad more than three
dollars i get i start to get complaints
in the in the and the reviews that it's
too expensive so it's a balance probably
no more than two dollars for the type of
apps i have here it more than that you
get complaints and I don't like
complaints in the reviews usually you
have to have some really good reviews
I'm sorry there was a question Oh
and so I son my financial consultant how
old is he he is 13 yeah so he can use
some of the more advanced applications
didn't and my younger consultant is one
year and a half and she's the one who
helped me try it out the the one with
the sound cards and the ml ad and she
always touches the ass because they're
more flashy that that increases my eCPM
and actually my friends daughters also
tried it out and actually all the all
the friends that I know that have babies
her age they're all using that happened
he's teaching their new languages so
it's good yeah nobody uses a lot of apps
mostly the iphone but also in the
Windows Phone and he he told me oh this
one no more than 99 cents that that's my
friendship consultant ah though most of
them most of revenue by far comes from
the ads so you've seen here free what is
really free you've seen here what is
paid and how to actually maintain some
of the code for the paid version so now
let's focus on the on the ads which is
probably what most of us are doing
anyway it's a lot of work it's a lot of
work and you are not what's really
important so you're not selling a nap
you're not getting people to draw
download an app what's really important
is you're getting people to use and
download and experience and I'll surely
there what what I mean that but in
summary and experiences something that
your users your players are going to or
your users of your app we're going to be
so happy so excited so emotional so they
feel so good of using it I want to use
it more and more and more and more and
more because you want to show more ads
and more as a more ads so that's what
you need to achieve if you're planning
to sell ads and there are three things
that I found we need to do or you need
to do what I to do to get more more ads
number one is get more downloads so you
need to make sure more people download
your app number two you want to make
sure every download gets used more time
and number three is you need to make
sure you're delivering it and more ads
every time they're using it so those are
the three things and and there let me
let me tell you how that works in real
life this is the number of ads i get
from
all my apps this is exactly the last 12
months as two for one April one all the
number of ads that are downloaded from
all my apps together the number of
downloads Khloe has gone up twenty
percent since here not much more than
that so the downloads are fairly stable
now I realize that I needed to do more
things so the players use the apps more
time so you'll see exactly what what I
did so whoa you know if they started to
using in more times the same number of
downloads per month they started using
it more time then I realized I could do
other things to show more ads in the app
and that increase it more so there and
while at the same time they continue to
use the apps more so the scale of the of
the graphs is not very good in the in
the pub center system but bottom line
this is 1x let's say at 10,000 add views
per day and the the top part is 4x so
it's 40,000 app so bottom line if you
have in a good app by using all these
techniques you're able to multiply by
four the number of ads that get
downloader IE x for your revenue so
you're making a thousand dollars a month
this is four thousand dollars a month by
doing all this things that will see
today so it's it's important to
obviously start with a good base I mean
this is not magic if your application is
bad well they're going to make any money
but but then there's the thing needs to
eat make make a lot a lot more revenue
out of those yes this is the time that
is green or the question is how do you
get paid by ads I've used several
different providers of ads by far I
think the one in Microsoft this better
pop center and you get paid by views
other google map fox gay get paid by
click the one from windows you get paid
per view so you need to show a lot of
use a lot right now i think i'm showing
about three more a little more than
three million a week so it's a if you
need to show a lot of ads to be able to
make revenue now to twitch to sell those
ads as i mentioned you have to
have more downloads each application you
have to be used more time and then hfh
usage has to deliver more ads so let me
let me actually go through some of these
things actually how we how I did it in
the different apps so the first I said
totally we have to have to have such a
good app that people like to use it so
the first tip is choose the right
category choose the right app similar
what we talked before let me give you a
the only sad example I have from all my
apps is this one dots is much better
than any iPhone app that has thoughts it
has much much much better intelligence
the AI is great the graphics I think are
very good it's much better than anything
that's in the in the marketplace today
but it wasn't the first there were
already two other apps there it's taking
me four months to even try to catch up
it's catching up it will catch up in
about 2-3 months and it will pass them
but it's taken me probably seven months
to catch up so if you're not the first
mover in that category it makes it a lot
more difficult so established first
mover it's very difficult to move it out
of this category so so the app that i
have many of them were the first one
there category and they continue to be
really good so competitors just cannot
get there that means if they're in the
top 20 you get more people looking at
your app so you have to choose the right
category yet make sure you don't copy
you don't make just another another
tic-tac-toe please I mean who's gonna
download that and they're like hundred
yeah I'm sorry give the download it out
the other half right how do you know me
never go after Scott you know how do I
know if my tap is catching up well there
are two ways there are a couple of apps
in the marketplace that tell you more or
less you're not by your ranking and you
can actually see any app ranking that's
not exactly download numbers but he
tells you the ranking you can see the
other one is going down and you're going
up and the other one is I don't know how
the math is done in the search in the in
the windows phone but it kind of follows
downloads I mean there's some download
pattern there i'm sure there the mac has
something else in there probably also
all the number of stars you get but but
it but if i see the other one going down
in the ranking and mind going up it
probably means i'm getting more
downloads it says not a certain thing
but yeah
which is the Oh apptrackr sounds like
that I look for me later so to find out
the name of the app but there are a
couple of apps that actually track apps
and most of us developers look at it and
you can see actually the rankings of any
app doesn't give you exact download
numbers but at least I ranking see if
it's going up now it gives you a hint of
where you are so think about the
category if not you're going to have to
spend a lot more time and effort to be
able to move it in the category and be
in the top ones being in the top one
gives you more downloads the other the
other one is interesting i call it no
user left behind so you have a good app
you want to make sure everyone can use
that app that means please go back from
time to time make sure it is actually
usable in all the markets the windows
phone marketplace team adds more more
markets frequently so I know it to me it
takes about a probably an hour more than
an hour to actually make sure all my abs
go in all the markets every time but
within an hour of work I'm able to
distribute my app to 20 more countries
and just amazing so it takes a while one
hour of my time but then suddenly
everybody in 20 more countries is able
to use it so make sure you always have
all the countries my apps have been not
accepted in China a couple times because
they have some certain additional
regulations dots in particular was not
accepted in China so i need to change it
because i want to make sure it is in
china i want to make sure every country
has my apps yes the question is do I
have to localize I don't have to
localize I've tried to localize two of
my apps I don't get more downloads in
those countries so unfortunately but
it's a lot of work the other one is this
is a very interesting one make sure your
app runs in Noto and mango in the
previous version of the Windows Phone
and the current version I've made a
mistake one of my apps I submitted it in
mango first so I cannot longer update it
to Noah but so now what I did actually
would link the laser link the new app
the first version i submitted was with
noah with the previous version of
windows phone and immediately if there
was available I updated it to mango so
now I have both versions available in
the marketplace so even if it's fifteen
percent of your market well you don't
want to
just I mean it's this to print percent
free market anyone I have lots of
friends whose wives or husbands have an
updated the phone to mango well they'll
be able to use my apps I want everyone
to use my apps and the last point is a
couple of my apps good warning that they
don't work with less than 250 for 6
megabytes especially one that uses a
huge cash for thinking well I change it
it to make sure it runs it all the less
than 256 device so you have a great app
make sure everybody can use it okay so
nobody is left behind so I'm still
taking it to make sure it's accepted in
all the countries especially China and
some of the new countries yes please
pick a little bit higher path question
on the first mover slide it doesn't have
a well-established
utilize something one day sweet they
knowing that you have okay so the
question is there's an existing strong
competitor how do you compete against it
do you if it's paid do you do a free one
wait that could work I will need to
think about the category you need to see
what happens what works in the Android
and iPhone marketplace and but at bottom
line it has to be much better if it's 99
cents vs 149 so it's really not going to
make a lot of difference and if it's
free free free it will definitely free
will download more than than a paid one
but it really has to be much better has
to be much better to try to catch up if
the other app doesn't have a free
version then they have a weakness there
they that's an opportunity can go in and
sell your app or promote your app yes
just talk to your answer it's not the pr
behalf is not much better than the beta
you were actually advertising to that to
it for people to find a fail yeah so you
there are other answer is you make you
only need to make sure your free app is
better than the paid app if not then
people will try yours and that'll say
you know sucks this one is better and
they move to the other way there was
another question is just how to do is
how to promote your app yes I have some
some some recommendations later coming
later so this is just the first stage of
making sure you have a good app making
sure that everyone can use it so we have
time take a look at this for ten seconds
this is a new app you want to download
it and it's for by gamma okay they just
choose one that you would download
choose one okay time yourself who choose
number one okay who would choose number
two okay who would choose number three
mmm who choose number four would choose
number five interesting who would choose
number six this is my app and I spent a
couple two hundred and eighty dollars to
get this one to sign this logo safe I
didn't waste my money so you won't see
that logo anywhere because it's going to
replace that one so again now let's see
how you promote your app that was now
this chapter is about this you promote
your app the first thing is people look
at the description and look at the logo
there's some logos that don't look that
professional the some logos look more
professional some logos that look cute
but depends on what you want to achieve
this is the first time customers are
going to your users are going to see
your app has to be really good really
professional I found some apps that
actually I download them they're really
bad but the logo was very good it look
professional so lots of people
downloaded it unfortunate then the
reviews were really bad lots of bad
reviews because lots of people don't
know it but I mean I'm assuming your app
is very good okay so then go so this is
one way of promoting and making sure
that the icon looks very professional
and I'll tell you which designers are
used for this for this blogger's so
that's one of the first thing you need
to do have a really good icon the next
one is you really have to have some
extremely good reviews you cannot put an
app that people complain about that just
kills you going getting out of that hole
is just impossible so uh you want to
make sure you have an app that is better
than anything else that's in the Windows
Phone but also many people have used the
iphone
android so it has to be better than
anything that exists in those markets so
the first thing I do before starting any
app I read the reviews and analysis of
all the apps that exist out there I find
out what works what really doesn't work
and whenever I create a new app I make
sure it's better than any existing app
out there even from wind from iphone so
customer people that might have both
phones prefer prefer mine of course one
of the things critical as you have you
sure have no bugs now so about the
reviews when you get it out you need to
get some feedback I how many of you are
familiar with this screen okay most of
you but this is the skin of the app hope
there's a little thing here called
reviews and I think it's one of the best
places to find reviews from all the
countries there are some apps that do
that but the absolute that don't cover
really all the countries especially the
Asian countries so you can look there
and I translate some of the comments i
look at this every week to see which
comments there are for all my apps i
want to make sure that anything that's
broken get six and these are examples of
of comments that i received all of them
i take in action and fix them i want to
make sure the service is good i want to
make sure people get a better experience
one of the first comments i got from
began on is that it was awesome it was
great what the design was terrible awful
they didn't want to use it because it
was really awful so I spent hours and
hours making sure that the sign is
really really beautiful and pleasing and
people enjoyed and now now they take
Lauren use it more and more I mean again
it's part of the things you need to do
to get users to download and use your
app there's some confusion with some of
the menus I fix it and what you'll see
later people want to use it more so
somebody tell me you know i finished the
24 achievement why do i why should i
continue playing oh no this is bad i
want you to continue playing so i added
many more achievements to this half this
is service i mean i want them to be
using it and using it to get addicted to
it so again no box look here look at all
the reviews make sure you address any
questions concerns that they have the
other one how do you promote your app
well i have their 50,000 people playing
my apps daily so every time there's a
new app you open any of my apps they
have something that's called more games
more app
and whenever there's a new one there's a
little number that pops up scintilla
there's anyone so they can come here and
they can see all the apps and you can
click there and they can download it so
starting probably a couple days all the
new apps that i have will start to show
laser link when you have again that's
one way of cross promoting the apps to
make sure that I control that and I can
point people to the new apps that are
out there I mean have some people users
that like my apps hopefully they'll like
the new one there's a question so what
am I point you do this when you click
here you go to the windows for
marketplace to the exact link for the
download so they can see the app click
download and install it yeah and if they
have the free version it points them to
the paid version as one of the ones in
that so it's cross promoting it now does
this work or not I did some analysis in
40 day period I'm deleting some of the
data because I have like four hundred
thousand rows of data every day that I
analyzed but let's say I kept about 40
days out of those in those 40 days I had
67,000 63,000 different players some of
them were 53 were playing all my games
have played it at least once and about
5,000 had played at least two games of
the ones that I have so it does work it
does help I mean if people like your app
they might try another one if they cross
promote it you can show it you can show
them the other app I wasn't prepared to
do I have / for that but let me hold
that until the very end to make sure I
have time I'll take you to tell you how
I get all the data I can take about
everything anything that crashes
anything that fails any usage any
settings too much there about four gigs
of data every day so you have a
different day I in your absence of you
running you know how do i how do I do
this is the question you know one of the
things I like to do later is so it's a
web service brings data in it now right
now it's hard coded so I have to
recompile the app add the newel image
and this all right now that's an excuse
you'll see later so so people get see
that there's a new of
it they want to play more Hall one isn't
this new update even if it's this is the
only thing in the new object now deeply
I tried to give them a little bit more I
try to give them a like some of the box
fixed or a couple more achievements
there's one happy you see later that
cause this one person who's paid played
almost 9,000 times so they reach all the
highest level in achievement so every
time I go in I try to add more levels
because this guy is just off the roof so
I try to add a few more things every
time I I add things and and then I slip
in this new Disney up so it's an excuse
for them to get this all yeah I remember
this and I haven't played this in a long
time let's play it again so that's one
of the advantages of self sending but
it's a lot of work if i added link place
a link well it's 19 apps that i have to
update and then send it and test it i
want to make sure i actually just one of
my updates fail about last week and and
and lots of people are complaining one
of the 19 when I have dated updated
something I shouldn't so you have to be
very careful it's a lot of work but you
know it's that's the way it's working
right now one showing that anxiety
wanting to use it as on me no no no I ok
I want this to be a very pleasant
experience so the question is do I keep
showing this number so I show them
things that I want them to show without
bothering so the first time this new
version comes in they show the number
they use it Nick if they exit the app
and enter again they won't see that
again this has to be a good experience
for them so I think somebody asked in a
previous session what happens if I I
show ads everywhere where the this year
so the person clicks it they'll take
more ads I want a mnemonic big more ads
I wanted to have a pleasant experience
so they're really happy with it put it
with the app so the ads have to be
designed as part of the program it's a
whole experience now again talking about
the experience as you use your apps you
have to be happy using a heavy yeah and
I've seen lots of feedback that were
they complain about the sound or in this
in the case of battleship novel war what
i read everywhere is that people wanted
to feel you're sinking the ship
explosions okay so i went and purchased
lots of sounds lots of images i hired a
designer and you'll see the feedback in
that app people here
with headphones because it's stereo
sound how to ship is sinking and
exploding that's what they want in that
up in checkers you don't you don't want
the things to explode but in this one
it's an explosion you're seeing well
that's that's I don't design sounds so I
these are sources of things you can use
and the presentation will be shared
please take photos but the presentation
will be shared so so you don't have to
do everything now but you can either go
to us that istockphoto I spend hundreds
of dollars of images higher I have a
friend who's a designer I spent
thousands of dollars in the design I
actually just found this new auction
site in Australia where I can hire a
designer and that's the one I use for
logos Larry fonts my phone's great
phones i purchase several phones for the
apps send Rangers awesome place to buy
sounds and and test this test so you can
see here there's some good graphics
there's some good design there's some
this is checkers Oh checkers for
professional players with professional
boards or four kids with colors with
aliens it's a different sounds it has to
be fun just to give an example the dice
and the pieces I spent 10 hours making
sure that the ice road really smoothly
and the pieces I've got the right
mathematical formula so the pieces move
really smoothly this one is by gammon is
displayed thousands of times a day
because people feel fun playing with it
again I want them to see more ads that's
the reason i doing it is because i love
to develop but if i'm going to develop
want to make sure it's a better
experience yes Harry designers are you
mainly hiring people to create your
images if you also hire you
work on the floor okay so the question
is why do I had to hire designers for
depending on what your skills are or not
in different games I do different things
for this one I hired the signer to do
all the core graphics and that's about
it for this one I didn't hire anyone I
just purchase a couple of things the
rest I design it myself but I'm not
signing so it took me a lot longer so
depends on what you are the the flow of
the app now I do that all myself and
sounds I always purchase them yes I'm
sorry the question there so the game do
you have it without all of the games
have ads okay so this one seems like
landscape if you have the atom okay
right well how do you make sure an ad in
a landscape one doesn't impact you well
you can see exactly the shape here it's
the shape of this so this doesn't impact
the game it is this the whole board is
designed around the ad space so if you
are not don't have ads you see this
great-looking nice header with some
information about the type of game
you're playing but if it's covered it
doesn't hinder the game and it looks
part of the design you have typically
what I've seen done in landscape is is
putting the ad here sometimes it's in
the bottom but it's a little bit
cumbersome yeah it's a great question
yes when you hire designers do you
retain ownership of the assets it's a
question if when you hire designers if
you retain the ownership yes of course
they build it for me it's nice yeah so I
can do whatever I want with it and I
decided to purchase the design but then
I have to do a lot more work if the
design doesn't work i get the photoshop
five so the illustrator files and i
fixed it myself but I own all the assets
of course yeah then exclusively I'm sir
so you only the essence do you own a mix
do you want explicit yes there are
designers that created a pair content
for me for my app so I own the content I
can do whatever I want with it yes a
couple more questions yes I don't do it
games but for the other
the users always want to see a metra you
are have you seen any complaints about
your games that don't use the maitre you
are like the dragon I so the question is
Morris about the metro sign who which
absolute it widget signers can do it as
you can see Metro design doesn't work
for this apps so you could get pro in
the sign crowd someone that could do
some Metro design yourself a makes the
difference or probably I mean depending
on the up for this apps it wouldn't work
but for many apps that are not getting
flaps up I think sometimes you do good
but you can actually see some of the
apps when they're really good there are
a couple of have like one from stocks
and CNN they're really well done and I
think not not ebay there's another one
amazon i think they're really well done
in metro so you could do it there but
it's a having it blocky and square
doesn't mean it cannot be done very
nicely but do you need to spend a lot of
time making sure it's really nice yeah
last question it isn't just it is a
rough guide how much campaign / sound oh
how much do I paper sound how much would
you pay for an awesome sound no I'm
asking you 10 down okay so it's about
199 really yes well I IE purchase
packages so we did with the package i
spend about three hundred dollars and
sounds and it's about 199 really so
shuffling of the board's dies explosion
sound music water and actually the
latest one laser link has bo has a whole
music track behind it that was more
expensive so again it just I mean it's
actually that's up but it's l it's a
mean if one of the latest app has
probably 47th still i mean it's not a
lot yes
oh she still repeat three thousand
dollars for narration yeah well one
thing or the baby app let me give you
some suggestion the baby app has a
someone speaking in English in spring
branch English French and Spanish
different sounds eighty eighty four
cents anywhere every area for words so I
started looking for translation services
well I found a translation API will talk
about the link later but it's a
translation API originally started for
the iPhone but now it's available on the
web so you can try 50 different sounds
for free so i tried 50 different signs
for free or different different words
and i recorded the translation directly
from the computer and that's the that's
the that's the sound you hear i'm very
and you can choose if it's an asian or a
European woman or a young person so I
chose certain different accents so
that's the way I got the word spoken
words with the same accent for the baby
sounds app so you have to find out some
most of these resources exist already
and you can use them for your app please
the box no crashes really doesn't help I
mean there are a couple things that you
have to have to do you look at your
stack traces in that pub and you can see
not only the number of that the number
of bugs of the number of crashes
actually which app so actually obviously
here you can see that i submitted an app
with a problem so i detected it a couple
days later submitted a fix and then it
went back to normal so the even if the
app is being used more and more and more
there are no more crashes because i keep
on reviewing every month which are the
things that are crashing the app more
and then fix those so even though the
usage is more the crashes are less and I
get lots of comments saying how finally
an app that doesn't crash I'm glad but
it's sad that I mean have to make
abstracts solid and try them with
different phones and I'll get a little
bit of info on the on the telemetry I
have a web service where i can that i
can i use for everything for for storing
the gains for throwing the high scores
for storing everything lots of other
things and I store
time there's a most of my functions in
the code if something shouldn't happen
like a value shouldn't happen I instead
of showing an error or I send it to my
app via web service I just submit all
the string of the status of that at that
moment and if needed I pop I show a
message but if not needed i try to
correct it and keep on going I mean it's
a game it's not a financial app so in
this case I I get pro Eve right now I'm
getting only about three or four
failures a day and then I in most of
them are because people are having
updated the app but I know exactly when
something felt like fix it on the next
release the thing that I could detect
our fix the things that crashed I i fix
also and you and this is the way i do
some of the telemetry so every time
somebody uses an app and submits a new
high score I have it every time there's
an error I submitted here every time
someone reports online game that how
somebody's using a dirty word for the
username I banned them I mean that's all
this thing you have to so now I'm a
banner I find out who's not behaving as
an ugly name when paint checkers i ban
them or I find out there's a new version
and I inform everyone there's a new
version things like that so so that's
the way I do all the telemetry in the
database it's a fairly large database
yes your services are you hosting your
service i knew i was going to get asked
that i get about four gigs of data
transfer about 400,000 rows of data
every day so i have it in a place where
i'm using sequel server and i get i get
to pay a very premium service for about
twelve ninety-nine a month which is
godaddy I using a used sequel server
there and it works really well because I
don't need a lot of disk space but I
need a lot of bandwidth and that I have
one of the best services they have that
they manage it and that's the one I'm
use that way i can host the web series
and i can host the sequel server
database works really well really well
I'm you know I've never I thought about
hosting with myself but a couple of
times I've seen godaddy actually being
swamped by people trying to take it down
but they they're really experts on that
I know a few hours later it's so fix I
wouldn't be able to do that so they take
care of that
reasonable cost device in there did you
experiments with requiring the stage a
notification of the phone versus not
wearing it okay the question is do I use
the device ID do I require customers to
put our users to put their ID how do I
manage the ID from the very first step I
took the device ID hashed it and this is
the code that I haven't done anything
else more sophisticated so what happens
is when you change phone you lose all
your your progress which actually have
already fixed with began on with da Gama
you can upload your data and move it to
a different phone in case you get a
nokia 900 because i got some complaints
that people have played five thousand
times and their son it raised the phone
so they were not happy so i try to make
them happen now they can move to the new
versions of the phone and don't lose any
of the began on data i have a few more
slides let me well one more thing
if they want to move from devices I
require an additional user password so
that's you go and try it and go download
by gamma see how it works but for the
same device in case it gets erased you
don't need to do anything if you want to
move to a new device I tried many
different things you know forget it you
need to find a user passwords that you
put in the original one if you lose that
well then there's nothing I can do but I
would assume somebody s play 5000 games
will try to put a username that they'll
remember it's not that mean that there's
only so much you can do in a game now
I'm a couple more topic so you have a
good app people know about it has a
great icon have no bugs well how do you
make them use it more so therefore
techniques I've used and and they
actually have been very successful they
make people use it more and more they
make them want to do more one of them is
leaderboards so that's what I'm all of
this I've done through web services well
the other one is online gameplay the
other one is achievements and the other
one is sharing content so let me let me
give you an example this is a
leaderboard so this actually you can go
to net naval war and you see I think the
top one last time I checked had played
nine thousand nine hundred and nine
thousand nine hundred ninety-nine times
so it's probably more than 10,000 times
now so I keep adding levels here and I
keep adding achievement so that that's
one way of doing leaderboards the other
one is achievement and i add more
achievements and achievements some of
them are easy some of them are very
difficult to get them to play more and
actually to give them a reason to keep
on playing it's a challenge the new one
I'm trying a sharing content so this is
a puzzle and you we solve all the
puzzles and but you can also create your
puzzles and share them with different
people and does that work well this is
this one example of my gammit from a
couple months ago and the number one had
played five more than 5,000 times if
each game takes three minutes this
person has played more than two hundred
seventy nine hours and that was a couple
months ago I think last time i check
narayan had played more than 6,500 times
so and this is because this game has
leaderboard and achievements and smooth
gameplay so all of this techniques
really really help and another one
another way of getting them getting them
excited is notifying them when they're
sending version many people don't know
how to download new versions so I need
to help them make sure they know there's
a new version so one of the things I
have in wipe service is the latest
version that this version can upgrade to
because none of them are upgradeable to
different versions like nodal cannot be
upgradable to mango but if I mark it
immediately all the phones that get used
in the main screen shows some type of
button that says new version ah there's
diversion they download it and they get
to try out whatever is usually if it's
one of my new apps or most of times
there's some new content some new ads
and something there so they it gives
them a possibility and but there's more
out there so they can try it again
there's much i mean mr. dated if we go
to answer but how do you how do you
think that the new version is already
markedly oh no no this is totally manual
I i submit it to the marketplace I know
it takes a while so I keep on checking
my phone and probably after two days I
oh it's in the marketplace then I notify
in my database that there's a new
version yes and actually it seems in
some markets it appears much faster so
for laser link I already was getting
users playing and I'm playing it I
wasn't accessible in the US so I make I
want to make sure after the US thanks
are probably one more day I would assume
that that's the right time and then I
tell everyone there's a new version but
the realities I even tell them to be a
week later because there's a bog or
there's something i didn't realize i
don't want 100,000 people downloading
ordinal 5,000 people downloading it bad
so I wait until I see there's a week
nothing seems to be wrong then I
notified people oh gosh there's this and
then let me get through this this is
really really really important okay so
ads let me just explain a little bit
more how ads work ads work by there's a
web server there's some service under
how it works but they goes to the
central database of ads and it shows if
there's an ad boom and it shows it and
then 60 seconds later those looks for an
ad and if there's an ad it shows that if
there's no ad well that doesn't show
anything so there are a couple things
you have to do the first one is
to auto collapse true that means
whenever there's no ad it just
disappears so there's nothing being
shown on the screen and if you don't do
anything if you leave it at no refresh
it does it once checks for a new ad and
then nothing happens it only shows one
ad this is really really important I
think I haven't seen this document or
anywhere else if you put autore flash
enabled true that means every 60 seconds
the ad control looks for an ad and if
you'd find some that it shows an ad why
it might fail either the network is down
or there might be not enough ads in the
in the supply chain from for Microsoft
so if it fails well 60 seconds later you
try again 60 seconds later try again if
it find one it shows one that's
typically how most people develop their
apps what I what I do is something a
little bit different because it is auto
collapsed I every 30 seconds I check
well actually it's every 60 seconds if
there's an ad perfect if there's no ad
Oh something happened that means there's
no supply all the network went down for
a little bit I checked 30 seconds later
manually so I do the auto flesh false
and I manually check that therefore you
can see that just like doing that in
four and five ads I was able to improve
it by twenty-five percent the number of
ads that were shown they have to be very
very careful because the rotation if you
do it too fast in each battery and it's
a lot of battery so this has a lot more
adds to that are shown again I said
using it mark now I want to make sure
they're always seeing an ad
you cannot go you should not you know
policy city can do that okay then videio
that okay then I didn't know that now I
know go and now I know but there's a new
one that works well which is ah you
can't you cannot go under 30 seconds by
plug that's on there 30 seconds that's
right Oh Sarah biopsy yeah no that's
what I knew this is 30 second not under
30 seconds that's why I said 30 second
look no no no faster there are many
reasons I mean they will kill your
battery yeah are you heard about 30
seconds that I knew so that that allows
you to do it and I typically do actually
about 35 seconds because there's some
delay internally about the thinking but
it lets you find ads faster and there's
another strategy so let me give you an
example there was a nap here I submitted
an update and I didn't realize I had
turned out the turn of this this new
capability new strategy and the ads
display went down fifty percent so I
realized I I need to put this back on
and then they people downloaded it and
it was back normal so it doubles the
number of ads you can show but there's
there's a twist to that what I'm doing
right now is showing different ads in in
the phone and if this ad for example the
phone the phone doesn't work is not
available okay I don't refresh it I go
on to a different provider and then I
show at from a different provider and if
that doesn't work then a couple minutes
later than I tried this one again so it
gives you different options in different
countries to be able to show ads in case
the primary one doesn't work so that's
another way I'm getting a lot more ads
being shown and though i'll tell you the
one from microsoft's the one that
actually has been more successful though
i've seen from for my other providers
that especially in some countries in
Asian countries the supply of ads is
lower so I get more much more ads from
other other providers of ads media
networks are not very good you find it
to em
stutter tourniquet EDT there on the neck
and photos and uh sometimes sometimes I
start yeah and it's something I'm not
always home I don't know let me add one
more thing so this is one of my favorite
apps this is reversing downloads have
remained fairly static so I liked it but
I like my yeah but I said you know it's
not moving it's just saying the same
number of our ad views so the next thing
I did is I improved what I said before
the graphics achievements leaderboards I
added all the features to be able to get
it more people to use it more time and
that doubled the number of views and
then on top of that i added the
optimization at it add to all the pages
added the multiple suppliers added fit
all these fixes also to the nodal
version to the older version i added
multiple ad units from different
providers and if you add it all up it
again double the number of at that i was
showing so you can see that i was
showing certain number of ads and
multiplied it by 4 by doing everything i
told i talk to you about changing the
icon I mean all of that together and and
now it's pretty much stabilized where
you see there but I mean it's it so it's
things you can do to to actually get
more get more views and get more get
more as being shown yes Marcus first
time how do people you know like FBI you
said it's at that low level how do
people who will see it after
let's invite one of the top its most of
my upside in the top 20 but if there but
the new ones but no but no no no but but
but I but all the new ones are not there
all the new ones that are that I've
delivered they're not in it sometimes
they don't exist so all the ones that
have delivered this year they're not in
10-20 what the way I do it is make sure
that if whenever you release it it's
awesome because it appears in the new
app and lot of people try in the new
apps icon has to be great and as soon as
you get an app that has that is really
great that has a great experience people
start commenting in it and then you
cross promoted from others and that's
about it I haven't found a lot of
success from from under paying
advertising or reviews at least to me
that hasn't worked probably works for
some other someone else but it is just
you need to make sure that when you
launch it everything that I took their
it's perfectly done it's an amazing
experience and then you get good reviews
I say I was surprised there was a card
game in my category that was released at
the same time I release another app and
it seems it's really good it's got like
500 reviews already in two months but
the app is very good and that's what it
is then it's very smooth very well done
very good sounds very good UI and have
achievements yes all of that so people
like to use it one last question and I
finish the presentation i have a blog
that gets viewed about 300 times a day
it probably talks about the other apps I
don't I don't I even though there's a
clear by now I haven't I actually
haven't tracked it I don't know I
couldn't tell you probably not actually
no not because ninety percent of the
views are one page the page that talks
about scoring in bergamo people really
really pissed off about the scoring
because it's because it's the official
yellow scoring statistically valid
depending on your ELO rating which is
very sophisticated and people get angry
when they actually don't go faster
because it's the official international
standard or final rating which needs a
lot of statistics to explain so we will
get pissed off and they go to that page
so now I don't think that
that drives a lot of traffic but it
explains in a really nice way how that
works I think I'm done in time but I
want to make sure I leave time for a
couple more questions I'm sorry how do i
do my work for Microsoft well it's taken
me more than a year and a half to do
this and you have to divide it into
because it's paid and free are the same
and I love vacations I love my most of
these apps come after Christmas or after
Thanksgiving that's when I do the the
big push and now what I'm doing more and
more it's outsourcing outsourcing the
graphic design to the signer outsourcing
the music outsourcing and copying I mean
the latest ones take me 40 hours because
I've already I copy most of the code for
the only thing that Co it's really the
logic for that one which takes 3 30 40
hours the rest is scoping from other
places the first one took me about three
months into the first one and and
Thanksgiving know it was that was a
Easter yeah yes how do you maximize your
visibility by a search terms of keywords
and things like that search I don't know
how search works I iiie I don't have a
good experience with search neither on
the web neither on the phone I don't
know how it works sorry I cannot tell
you I have some keywords in my blog but
I don't think it's doing a lot I'm not
the only thing that's important to
remember is there's only five keywords
that the search tracks so your keywords
that when you're submitting your app you
pay 50 put 15 only the first five are
counted so we need to make sure the
first five I really go to the first five
keywords the rest are not used at all I
don't know why they allow you to do that
a couple more questo yeah okay we have a
deal out now just video we want to ask
the ad version of that beta does that
kill or decrease the revenue of the beta
app or with the sum actually be more or
equal to the length of what you use to
make a bit only version so you said a
beta version if you already have a paid
version I pay they threw out of three
start with apps so does that hurt
harrity revenue or actually with ended
up more
same I don't know for your specific app
but definitely if you have a paid
version settle you had a free version I
mean people are going to gravitate
towards the free version so the question
is are you going to make more on ads or
on the paint if your think you're going
to make maranatha well it doesn't matter
that much but you have enough features
with reason for them to pay for it but
it will diminish the number of paid apps
version did not actually make my own
hand you staring back i would say in my
case ninety-eight percent of the revenue
comes from the from the another free
version the ad-supported version so but
the paid version is whoever wants to get
rid of the ant go ahead and pay it to me
that's extra money but ninety-five
percent of revenue is the ads so that
the other way works with mine because it
is actually lots of usage of the game if
it's an app that you're only going to
use once a month to store some passwords
then this model will work you probably
should go with the paid one yeah yes if
I said this is some views versus clicks
no I don't have statistics up it the ad
control should do it but if they only
actually show you the views not the
click so i don't know i do have
statistics for clicks for the other I
providers google and a mop fox it's
about a point three percent very low in
my case yeah i'm so you had a question
are you talking about easy p.m. i know
i'm not gonna talk about you see p.m.
buddy i will tell you that is fairly low
for me but because of the millions and
millions and millions of downloads
that's good I don't control the AC p.m.
I think that's that is one important
point I don't control the ec p.m. that
is the amount of money you get per views
that sounds sort of my control sometimes
is really high sometimes really know at
the end of the month sometimes is no
sometimes for some reason it goes really
high for 22 dollars it changes it varies
it's a mystery if you but it doesn't
matter I don't control it what I do
control is this I control the number of
downloads the number of views and every
because that goes up some time it
actually has gone a bit down than at the
beginning it slower but my ad views had
more than x 6 because i keep on adding
more more apps and then more views
no that's so that more than takes into
consideration any any add cost though
comparing it to all the other two out
providers that I've used from lot of the
major ones this is much better much
better unfortunately it's not available
in other countries that I can see I
don't have reports for that but yeah the
categories man yes I experiment a lot I
have no idea I think what happens is
supply and demand so sometimes there's
more supply of people of a paying
customer wants to pay more so you get
paid more this is mr. truly miss about
at least i don't i don't know it works
so i trade different ones i try to make
sure the ads are relevant to the app but
well that's a relevant to a reverse your
began on up it's more difficult i'm at
this one it's an area i don't control so
therefore i try to control the ad views
which I control and the usage of the app
yes I think I saw a slight said
something like thirty cents per yeah I
had that but the thing is it varies it
varies tremendously anybody's by our
values by geography it varies by day so
let me give you one monomer well I have
one of the house like nine dollars the
nine dollars of ecpm Wow and I make out
of that app probably thirty cents a day
it's the kids up because there's not a
few up as they click on them but there's
only very few ads the apps that they
have much more ads hundreds of thousands
of AD views per day the revenue is much
lower because I mean it's the same at
being shown against the same person you
shouldn't get paid for that but if after
1 million times they haven't seen it and
they're gonna touch it again whereas the
kids start sharing but but but again I
mean hundred times more revenue from the
from the ones that download 100,000 as a
day so so it really depends a lot of the
app the day the country the Geo you can
see it one o'clock in the morning
extremely high yeah but who's using your
app I one o'clock in the morning oh
there are some people but yeah no not
that many so it's a bottom line is a
variable I don't control I don't want to
cannot control I don't know how he works
I try to put make sure the ass out of
the right ads but if there's no you
shouldn't think about manipulating and
reach edging that and what you
can do is make sure your app is great
that your app is used more that your app
is downloaded more and therefore your
app make sure these are happy and they
want to play more and more and more and
more yeah couple more questions and I
think I will have to closely yes how
much of the video the graphic code yeah
not a lot I mean the concepts the
graphic concepts that the the axe XML is
shared the great the overall structure
is shared between the apps the more the
section where you have the more apps
where you actually go and see my other
apps that's fairly shared the code to
share to show the ads is shared but
every app is very different the one is
your drawing some laser lines the other
is moving check not not a lot like some
concepts are but not a lot that's the
part that takes a little bit more time
really to more questions and I'll stay
here to to answer more bright and some
of you might have to leave games London
be eventually collapse depends the
Prince wake up now I don't know I I do
what is what excites me I do I I make
sure I read all the rules and I'm the
expert on any of these games I really
know all the rules of began under lots
lots of all the rules of checkers all
the rules of reversing you need to
really spend time and love that and
that's what i like to do so no there's I
thought about doing a nap but the
realities I don't think people use apps
that much I think they use games more we
again I'm showing ads that's my revenue
model for this apps I want him to use it
every day or two hundred and seventy
nine hours in this case I don't know
what app can you do I mean that you want
to have people using it two hours a day
that actually people have to delete it
because their wife's tell them you know
go to bed so that's what that's that's
important for ads but if you're going to
do paid then there's some apps oh no I
don't blend node plan once the last one
how many games we have created for a job
more anymore so I should consider window
site so that's another option but I just
I'm running out of time I just
maintaining it just when I'm running out
of time but it's a lot more a lot more
it's uh I think it's great I think it's
a good good support it gives me a lot of
incentive to keep on doing it but now to
quit my day job a great day job here is
really good so I didn't exactly ok one
more up and that's it one people fishing
jump like that the Dec p.m. on top yes
and it went down the window yeah because
they use the world now Clayton well that
you were showing many more ads but still
know the number of clicks probably went
up but not went up enough I'm guessing i
know the map I don't know the math
behind it so he went down but it this
one's quadruple that the jump like four
times I guess no I remedy jump about
three times so so it is I mean it went
down the the but not enough not the
number of AD views were much more so it
compensates for that by far because
you're actually getting more people to
see more ads because they're playing
more so it does it did go down so it's
going down and down and down and down
for the past year yeah so I told you a
number whatever you every week is down
but the number of AD views go up higher
even faster so that's a and because
we're going to be selling a lot more
phones because you're going to do great
apps it's even going to go higher and
higher thank you very much I'll be here
