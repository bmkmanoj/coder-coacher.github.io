conversational clothing and modest aces
so i would first advise everyone here to
turn on the academic part skippering the
visionary parts their brain those are
activists please everyone needs to
access the funny clothes are their
pranks it exists in all of us and
essentially that's the entire premise
with which my clothing Brinsmade I'm a
fashion designer I never thought about
clothing much at all before Sarah
company I didn't I've never made it
before I just a dumb idea and I actually
own that dumb idea and it became a
celebrated our clothing home so what I
did is I built an entire clothing
company around social experience in
close so i'll take you through how this
came to be and what makes products such
okay so this is important
at last is fashionably dropped out of
focus in special burglaring overweight
special look like an idiot thank you
enter what we're most interested in my
clothing company right now is how to
turn to everybody on earth and two
models so this isn't just the
square-jawed Scandinavian people you
normally see accidents that's the
millions of people would actually own
clothing who happen to own digital
cameras how to turn those people and the
models so this is how it all began to me
I started think about what would what
was vertical without gloating and the
reason why is because I started clothing
company called Korins I'm a horizontal
for my pants that's seven years ago and
innovative stuff and I my background
before Anna I work in technology but I
was also a TV writer and I start coming
up with all kinds of jokes about this
book I was like wow look there's a fair
hand sticking on that actually that look
at you Joe until about of every weeks
and that's how i started off and i start
sending out newsletters and these
newsletters were open forty percent the
time they were asleep which is a stack
knee high number ecommerce and the
reason why is i add a commitment though
the ninety-nine percent fat fiction in
one percent fashion each of these
stories so it wasn't just a blatant call
for you to buy something was really more
oh this stupid cause of your day at work
to come up with a new story about the
story this led to a clothing company
that was based on the idea that you
wouldn't operate the normal bloated
company of those things that seasonally
we operate more like a block so it goes
back to the conversation earlier that
bloggers have changed fashion while I
start in San Francisco I have no
background fashion my entire social
network for people who work in
technology so for me it seems strange
that the clothing industry would only
put out products on a seasonal basis I
was like online the lawn pay attention
something new every day so we're here to
stretch out the design calendar that
normally keeps februari and August and
you were just do that all year long
sorry I would set down
so this is the first product I had they
were cord around me the joke that I'm
aids I knew that I could never compete
with with Ralph around and taking a
photo of a very hey looking guy wearing
a great looking pair of pants so I
started talking about the aerodynamic
supporter rats and how they would lower
your crotch enzymes back there be less
friction between your lips and believe
it or not as everybody knows that
stuff's gonna go a lot further in the
internet missed a good picture
the next great product that i have i've
got a lot of attention as i figure to be
funny if a person could actually be the
black sheep of the family but also wear
a sheep made only apply to facebook so i
traveled to ireland fountain built and
actually isolate the natural dark sheep
wool white and make sweaters out of that
this really filled all the herself
styling iconic list but she would family
on the internet and they sold great and
they continue to suffer it's still buy
the brand so the next product innovation
I I noticed that all as people were
cycling to work now and that there's no
pants that were made specifically to the
task of segments per couple miles so I
create advanced that have fun deployable
reflective things as you can see the ass
comes our collective stripe like this
and you can roll up a custom a
collectible which makes you this
supernova as you like that road well the
great thing about that I discovered is
that all bikers are bloggers and vice
versa and these pants Fiat remember I
had nothing for a marketing budget from
the start they were Rick about something
like a hundred thousand times online so
it found the audience room and also
there's really never end clothing stores
that look like stores there are no bike
stores are really sold clothing they
only sold like stuff so I created a
market for that stuff online as it turns
out so many bikers are into the internet
the next break controversial product is
not that was the veg soft blanket and
we're going to do so I went back into my
pseudo scientific roots and I imagined a
subatomic world of somnos actually
measure these things like sociales
capable of fabricating like fabric feels
softer than the anus of a silver as I
imagine I'm going to sell something
online discussing things like the
softness of an anus re really lends
itself for social media so from all this
I have a clothing company i'm receiving
tons of photos of people wearing our
products and put them up and as you
would expect eighty percent of the
images that you receive are not that
good with twenty percent of great but
for those eighty percent of the people i
was like well those people still that
great stuff too and they're nice enough
to send it to me so i built an
application for beta grand that would
allow anyone with any photo that they
have to be the principal model of any
page on our site with their friends to
enjoy which opened up the Pandora's box
of social sharing it's been wonderful
put that out last summer and so far
about 2,500 people of San pictures
themselves and what's great about that
is each of those pictures get about 20
views peace so slowly but surely I'm not
really having to advertise any much
anymore and let my customers do that
warming which is a lot more fun
personally I think it's great because it
allows me with limited
Limited friends and neighbors that I
could use my moms too then expand this
to an entire universe of people who
really want to be models and what's
great is that as that library photos
grows it allows us to be able to present
very different looks and feels the
websites that people care about that I
would assure you that there's no fat
redhead and model that you will ever
find in any regular clothing companies
casual but it betta bring you will and
you happen to be a person that looks
that way soon enough you'll be able to
look at clothing through that view
because the back of their thousands and
thousands and thousands people that are
submitting to this cattle so the premise
there is that the Tyndall's photos
clothes cheap storage and social
networks equals the infinite global
kennel I have clothing catalog that only
has about 60 items but have more photos
I guarantee you Ralph Lauren those
behind as we grow and grow and grow its
going to look something that's a lot
more like Flickr you can actually buy
stem it's been a very funny thing that
funding for us to start this blowing up
again sort of said premise here is
billed it as big as we possibly can of
the content that people submit to it and
then I'll tell you with very different
shopping experience we make pants that
are made of this disco government that
became
nike's of burning as last year because
of the fact that they were positively
stupid but also very fun to wear in
those situations beauty is that that
product is now found its way out of the
golf course found its way into more nuts
it's now find its way into bachelor
parties tears grow I was just speaking
with a gentleman of New York we're
opening up a a social space for disco
pants februari we are actually be able
to get 15 minutes of time and the
strength of air locks disco laboratory
but so it's going to be like a three
wheel installation but the beauty of
having products online at customers that
we need to because you can take a pretty
asinine pair of pants and grow a vast
excited community around this where
they're actually pretty nervous then you
can display this is perhaps someone's
looking at my website hey I think that's
about it I think what's interesting for
everyone's experience here is that I
thought about solving a problem no
background the local classroom nor any
exposure real fashion industry at all i
can tell you I've interacted with people
there are more like you
those may think about clothing and it's
a strange thing that I've been at for
seven years now I still have yet to meet
like real fashion industry people and
it's nice that you can exist completely
outside the screen it actually have
summoned as a complete house then you
know very nice to talk to you really if
you have any dumb fashion i'm using my
lord we actually do make our customers
photo yes so I I would see my friend
submitted a picture to you I
I mean it's still pretty rudimentary
literally as we just generated unique
URL and slop that butter first or anyone
you see so you're giving a URL where you
are we model Oh exactly yes I really
want boxer briefs that have a copy for
my cell phone he explored this and I
know so so the thing about that is
everyone has ideas left and we tried as
quickly as we can to generate brand new
ideas and put up to and as it turns out
that minimums of the real issue can make
cool clothing as anyone in the the
tell you that would probably take about
we can have the prototype when you put
it up online two groups and people like
that we can
and so I would I would just ask you away
about six to nine months we're still
growing to the point where I could then
literally take anybody's ideas we just
need to get about it man of about 500
items pretty much yes
so right right now I said they're like
we're becoming the clothing brand or
anybody have an idea that's good novel
mega so far it really is us sitting
around there editorially saying what
makes for a good fashion horrible story
in the internet and how can we make
those things as quickly as possible so
we really don't say no to anything
sometimes we put things up as neck time
someone and nobody really likes them and
those things we have sang them to but so
far it's just about everything yes we
manufacture most everything in San
Francisco and there's kind of this leap
that occurs right is a successful idea
and you can sell thousands of them then
we'll start considering i came across
but it's a good thing for local design
among the fashion because you really
need to make things as placement art as
possible if you want the ideas to be
expressions yes
major reason anybody like the clocks or
short
yeah good story with that we made a
these pants will put up her why they're
made of stars stripes and I really
dumb-looking be below and so someone
came in saying you know you're coming up
you take more products so that someone
sitting I love it I had like an apron
that at the time I was like that was
like but I'll make a cake for you
recently so we created a cake apron
hybrid and that one we actually just
puts ketchup on our site and the demand
was so great for it that three weeks
later we're selling july and regis and
kelly are wearing it all cooking on TV
and that was about a two and a half
three we turn right so the caper is
perfect sample the sketch that quickly
became consumable product and that's
what's nice about soft bits and you
really be go from brainstorm to some
people are buying in three to four weeks
time alright thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
