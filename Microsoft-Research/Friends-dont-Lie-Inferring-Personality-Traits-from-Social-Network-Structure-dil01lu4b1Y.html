you
so it's my pleasure to welcome here
Kapoor saffiano stay on steroids my
apologies who's visiting us from
University of Toronto and he's very
interested in research in human behavior
modeling specifically with focus on
affective computing and you know today
he's going to talk about some of very
interesting work that he's done on
social networks all right thank you so
first of all I have to prepare you that
so this talk was East one I will give it
ubicomp in a couple of weeks and
therefore is quite short so i will talk
about this work and then i will give you
some hints on other works have been
doing lately actually bear in mind that
so this is involving data from
smartphones and afterwards i'll give you
just a quick outline of a data
collection we've been doing using
wearable sensors and then finally i will
talk about a system we devised for a
user experience evaluation using a
webcam so it's it will there would be a
jump from I to feel the one hour somehow
so okay the title is a basically what we
try to do is we ask ourselves if there
is any relation between the network
structure that between the social
networks that a person builds around
itself and is included within and
basically we asked how effective Agra
network structure features are in
predicting users personality and most
importantly what are the benefits of
using activity-based data versus servic
based data so personality is seen as a
static internal
determinants of behavior that means it
influences our dispositions towards leaf
actions attitude formation and it's
often used to explain and predict
behavior the model we've been using is
the big five factor model which
basically gets defines the five traits
who are chosen as being the most
orthogonal as possible and those five
traits are extraversion or intervention
which basically describes a person on on
his/her sociability versus shyness
emotional stability vs neuroticism so if
a person is calm and emotional or
anxious agreeableness or disagreeable
pneus so if it is friendly cooperative
or as a full finding attitude
conscientiousness under on the other
hand is a trait of people who has who
are organized while unconsciousness are
people don't really care much are in
Ephesians in doing their duties and
finally a trade related to creativity
which is openness to experience so it
distinguished people who are
intellectual insightful versus people
are unimaginative so why we go for
personality we go for personality
because it's linked to preferences in
latitude it's revelant relevant for user
modeling recommendation systems and it
basically is a factor if you want to
devise a precision system because
adoptions that I might take as an
extrovert person are probably driven by
different dynamics if I compare it to a
guy who has a different personality than
me
one thing we have to I want to stress
about is that so there's been previous
works in both the social psychology and
the social computing fields the main
difference about these two fields that
while social psychologists use
traditional social networks in the in in
in the meaning that those networks are
built using service in which you
indicate friendship ties or run or a
national ties with other people from
social computing perspective we instead
use social events that are basically a
like a call I make to someone or if I'm
wearing a device that tells me that I'm
around you right now those are events
those are not I'm not self reporting the
time friends or I know any of you but
there is a device that's that's logging
somewhere that something in happening is
happening between me and the other
people that have around me so some
previous works I found that cycle of
psychological predisposition so
personality are linked to echo network
characteristics also there have been
works made on mobile phones very related
to the work and represent xochitl
Iranian and gatica Paris found out that
actor based features that means cold
durations how many calls I do our can be
predictable big five traits on the other
hand the only vera and Oliver found that
by using those actor based features and
augmenting them with the network
structural features Europe them
significant performance improve
improvements so
we basically had access to a database
which was collected at MIT a couple of
years ago last year it's a it's composed
of an international sample of more than
400 students and those students are
married graduate students living in a
married student residency and in the
experiment there is a dis unit and his
partner taking part of the experiment so
you have data also from people whose not
the was not really into that community
even though if you look at it it turns
out to be quite Amadeus so this is one
of the limitation I will talk about
later there's a vibrant community life
so social events facilities and there
are some diverse sub communities and
social groups like based on the
technical or geographic provenance of
the of the participants so a rough view
of the system that we used to collect
the data it's basically this is an
application that is a freely
downloadable on Android systems is
called the fun f and basically it
allowed to gather some data which I will
describe in the next slides and that
data was augmented through the use of a
facebook app which was getting
information about people who are load us
to do that and importantly the it was
the data we had was augmented with the
buying a bit listen I a bit of the of
the people who were participating in the
experiments of course all of these were
complemented with the service that we
used to to submit to to to the
participants so the platform itself is
composed of a number of probes which are
let's say the sensors for which with the
wheel with which it interfaces to the to
the subject and then there is
applications there is a
market application there is a basically
all means to know what the user is doing
with that smartphone so if i install a
new app how long it takes for you my
best friends to adopt it too if a if i
keep using it how long it takes it to
spread over my this is one example and
of course all the service and
notification were logged as well so this
work is based on the pilot phase of the
of the study so we isolated the pilot
subjects 53 subject we're using the the
were logged 48 complete weeks the data
we used our the Bluetooth hits call logs
and the social metrics survey data so
the blue two teats were basically driven
on derived from obviously the Bluetooth
sensors but they were filtered on the on
the on the signal level in order to try
to avoid as most as much as possible
false positives the big five
questionnaire data was used to gather
the ground truth for the personality
traits so from this data we built three
networks one was based on call logs the
other on Bluetooth and then we had the
survey one and we also merge the call
and meet it bluetooth data by tating in
the intersection of the of the two
networks and so build let's say a
digital network on based on the on the
entire digital information we had while
the last one was built on the automatic
survey which was basically by the
traditional means asking what your
relation is with the other people or
so the is at a glance the distribution
of the of the ground truth which we had
used to Dakota mice and we struck the
set of feature which are related to the
structure of the of the network subject
was in we focused mostly on the egg
network structure features because our
hypothesis was that the the structure of
the of the ego network of a guy who
tells something that could augment the
the prediction ability of a model so we
started centrality measures mobile
deficiency measures and the triadic and
transitivity measure in particular so
this is a fixed slide in particular we
started the standard the centrality
measure then then we structed the local
efficiency nodal efficiency and then the
mean local nodal efficiency of the egg
network of the subject and with respect
to the triadic and transitivity measures
we extracted two different definition of
the tragic census the first was
formalized by division liners and
basically it's a it's account of a
different configuration of triplets in
your own in the subject second network
while in the collision Robbins
definition this configuration is based
on a on a on a strong weak strong weak
assessment of a given tie and in a
different configuration in which the ego
would be present other than that we
calculated the clustering coefficient
the global transitivity and the main
local transitivity meaning the the mean
of the local transitivity of the altars
of the
I so to give quickly some definitions
okay the standards and tidy measures are
the degree which is defined just as the
number of others an ego s closeness I
don't know if you're interested in this
but i wouldn't spend much time on this
so is the inverse of the sum of the
distances to the outers between us
eigenvector centrality information
society which is the relative drop in
efficiency where when I is taken out
then we have efficiency measures which
measure basically the the response of
the ego net when the node the ego is
removed and you have another diffusion
which is the inverted an automatic mean
of the path length so the closer the ego
is tweets alters the higher is not
efficiency now we calculated values
relative to the entire a connect of the
I finally we computed the triadic
measures that I described before and
transitivity measures so our
experimental setting was based on the
for network type so the the network
based on the core network on the cold
data the one based on a Bluetooth beta
the merch one and then finally the
survey one we evaluated eight feature
types so centrality centrality plus
effusions measures transitivity Davis
and liner tried a combination of them up
to eight we had that binary binary
classification tasks for which we use
the random forest cell grid and we used
the bootstrap a bootstrap strategy so
basically for four we embed the DS in a
live one out settings so basically at
each iteration we will take a subject
off then
for under times resampled the set the
data set that was remaining and I using
that one is training and two to predict
that the left one out subject and this
was suggested by a paper Jim what is the
binary classification so it's basically
for each straight so you have extrovert
or introvert no all right now you have
five binary classification task list and
then we try to explain our resources but
by running some correlation tests and so
global impressed rate analysis of
variance and some analysis of marginal
means so the results are I will skip the
boring tables and go more into the
Jewess so a global analysis of variance
was performed so we ranked the Icarus II
figures and an analysis of variance was
run on on a design which was five traits
by four networks by eight feature set
that we defined what we got out of these
analysis was that basically the budget
network and the centrality with with the
efficiency features on openness and a
gay bonus we're coming out as being the
best performing once in particular
running a pairwise comparison marginal
on the marginals you find out that this
is the ranking of the for example for
the network types you will find that the
bridge Network would be more informative
than the merch one then the survey then
the colon then regarding the feature set
as I said before the centrality and the
centrality plus efficiency were above
the other ones and with respect to the
trait then openness agreeableness where
over the extraversion and
conscientiousness now go into details
you ran we ran five a novice so 11
portrayed and what we found out is that
basically the network type as a
significant influence on all trades as
you can see from this table and the the
the stable i accuracy of centrality
measures it's somehow contract with with
the good performance of transitivity
measures especially on extraversion and
bluetooth and on the other social traits
so agreeableness to see here in the
openness which kind of makes sense
because those are social traits so the
transitivity gives you a measure of how
close together are your alters so for
example this is a graph showing the
performance on extraversion the blue
line indicates the Bluetooth Network and
this is the peak over there which
relates to the transitivity set of
features yeah is tell me how
I can go back
the Bluetooth data is telling you how
sorry with the track yeah so Bluetooth
data is telling you how extroverted they
are how are you figure that is that by
how many times their bluetooth is within
the presence of other so basically the
Bluetooth data is telling you shall we
use it as a proxy of for proximity and
basically it was so the the the
smartphone will act in a opportunistic
way so each at mosi at least every five
minutes it would sense whizz around and
lock them and then as a post processing
step you would use some some filters to
to eliminate a lot of false positive
because we'd Bluetooth you have like a
10 meters range or so and if you have a
really tiny wall then you also have a
hit but then if you filter by the signal
level for example and you you you can
get a decent approximation of the
proximity network
so for example one result that came out
was that basically as you can see the
acceleration for example now here we are
focusing on on the peak we seen on the
previous slides so extraversion on the
presence network and you can see there's
a positive correlation between
extraversion and the the full the
complete triad let's say what is
negative otherwise and this just makes
sense because it's a measure of the
clustering coefficient and we explain
these dis values by by saying that
probably extroverted people like to
let's say filter out people who don't
fit in their in their network so like
x-rays patrol are probably better off
with the other extroverts which also
somehow makes sense and it's actually
supported in the literature by a work
from re naina kubacheck so they show
actually that that friends with students
so xr8 students show a lower tolerance
for intransitive triads and tend to
remove them over time so this is a this
might be an explanation of the results
we get we also try to compare our
results with the actor base features we
had we couldn't directly compared with
other works for example 1 by x gattaca
parrots because we in our data we only
have its we don't have the for example
the duration of a call that's not
represented in our data unfortunately so
we couldn't really extract all the
features they used anyway we extracted
all the features we cooled from our data
and what we found out is that basically
the network features network-based
features always led to better results on
all trades turning to the limitation of
this work one is definitely the small
sample sites because we only have 53
participants the population is quasi
magennis and importantly we have no no
logs about interaction data with
non-participants so we we can't really
tell if a guy has a really sparse
network because it just doesn't use his
phone for calling or because he only
calls people who are not participating
to the experiment so this is a pretty
strong limitation to our work so the
takeaway messages are that basically the
structural AG natural features are
important for look importance for
personality studies the data accurately
based data seems to be more informative
than service based data and triadic a
transitivity measures are very relevant
for extraversion especially on proximity
network like the one we built on on the
Bluetooth data and centralia new
features were relevant for neuroticism
and agreeableness overall on all trades
but on neuroticism the the proximity
based network was more relevant than the
one built from coal logs so this is the
first part of the local ownership
question on this then we'll go on with
the other
yeah actually enter this but I'm i
missed it so for introverted people
would if you look they're like local
social network with their social network
graph have lower day and there's an
extroverted people sorry would it have
with the social network graph of someone
who's introverted you have a lower
diameter than that of someone is
activated a low diameter so you mean
they're more ya know I should be the
opposite i think yes yes
I guess it should be the opposite
because basically as feed go back to the
to this one so for example here we're
talking about expert people so the
opposite of of the introverts either are
on 11 out of the spectrum and it's very
negatively correlated for example with
let's say this setting of triads or this
one let's say the non closed triads so I
expect the yeah no you're right it would
be longer you mean you mean the diameter
no for introverted you mentioned that's
right yeah I said get away around
awesome diameter for an introverted
person okay should be ideal should be
shorter or smaller and for an edge over
person should be water yeah that yeah
there were our results suggest the
opposite because it looks like the
extrovert have a tighter network so the
a diameter is short right yeah so means
if you have a Spartan network I feel
like it so much I favorite they should
um they might be make friends quicker
and with more wider groups so they have
a like a longer path there's our network
like you have more aesthetic important
source of network so introverted should
have a bigger their diameter we did I
would buy them either you define the
yeah but I never finds that it's an
introverted they have small small close
group of friends or all polychaetes
recharge the damage probably lower all
right yeah the complete case ok so the
year you're such an opposite but yeah
usually extroverts friends all like
different
also no leak it's so like so it's sort
of because it affords mortiser yes so
that we might intuition results are
opposite of my cuteness so I was curious
yeah
so if there's no more question it'll
give you so I give you a quick glance of
the actually our latest work which was
basically a data collection we ran with
wearable sensors so the sensors are the
one you see in the pictures over there
and the social metric badges and those
sensors are equipped with the microphone
with the Bluetooth and an infrared
sensor and an accelerometer what we did
again is that basically we we recruited
the volunteer actually entire research
units in a private research center and
we gathered 50 to 55 participants over
six weeks they were wearing these badges
monday to friday on working hours and we
used an experiential sampling strategy
so that every day three times a day they
would feel they would receive on their
mobile phones or on their email box a
short questionnaire meant to be like two
minutes three minutes and so we have a
bunch of variables logged in to survey
data we have the phoneme email logs and
of course the sense of slugs the data we
get is a behavioral from from the badges
and from the mail info logs so how
people interact with each other by
technological means or physically in the
case of infrared sensors that detect for
example the face-to-face communications
on the other hand we have the survey
data which are pretty comprehensive and
they
include the personality effect and
loneliness creativity and productivity
and situational items which are which we
will use in order to reconstruct the the
mood the destitute the context in which
the person was acting within so this was
just a quick glance and now I will start
to a paper represented the couple of
months ago in a new castle which is
quite different from what said before
it's still related to behavioral
analysis automated behavior analysis in
this case instead of using smartphones
and data gathered through mobile phones
we use basically a webcam a webcam and
the user is made is actually a subject
testing a new prototype for for a
software system so a new internal
interface so in contrast with the
picture you have on the on the left
there in user experience studies the
emotions which are listed are typically
a lot low intensity mix nature they're
dynamic and simplified the the the
research goal for this work was trying
to understand how emotion-based mirror
measures could support user experience
of elation try to find the validation
for new measurement tools and the
overall goal was basically to build some
no intrusive methods encounters with the
EMG for example to stick on the on the
subjects face in order to exploit
emotion in a user experience evaluation
so emotions are used to be measured in
in different ways one way is the
question are mesh measures which has
and cons so it's on one end it is
ecologically valid on the other hand it
doesn't capture interaction dynamics
because it totally happens afterwards
when the interaction is over on the
other hand psychophysiological measures
like EMG sensors have the benefit of cup
to capturing interaction dynamics but on
the other hand there they require
expensive equipment and they're not
psychological as well it because you
have to call a subject call you mean in
the lab stick the stuff on it which
might bias him and and so on so what we
propose is a a system that basically
automatically monitors the emotional
state of the users during the
interaction it is cheap in the sense
that it only needs a consumer level
webcam and a computer it's not invasive
because there's no sensors attached to
the to the users it can potentially be
run at the users place what is provided
by the core of the system is basically
the detection of minor changes in fact
EVT during the interaction so this is
how the the the initial prototype is
designed so in a very simple way there's
a the user in front of the camera the
camera gets the video feed there's the
module who tracks the the fashion motion
and those fashion motion features were
extracted they are indexes so basically
there's a post processing step then
there is a we devised a calibration face
and the prediction face basically in the
calibration phase we follow the
literature and designed to really quick
tasks who were prone to a leech it to
elicit the reactions that we wanted to
predict on the 44 automatic aux
assessment so I will go into details now
so the the facial features are based on
the on the seminal facial action coding
system by Eggman which is 78 to define
the set of more than 40 action units
that are responsible for forbidding
facial expression taxonomies our system
uses motion units Marshall units
basically are a subset of those action
units and the relation between motion
units induction units is that while
action units gives you a coordinate of a
certain point in time our system gives
you also the magnitude component so the
amount of distance you had from the
previous position to the next one so
this is an example that shows the
maskers on the face of a human face
which are the most important moscow
synonym very by the resolution ok anyway
this is what what the system looks like
this picture here only shows that it
works that it used to work with really
low low five cameras which are not in
commerce anymore right now so that's a
good thing that that's how it looks like
for real and now I will show you a video
so this is the the tracking system in
action so basically how it works is that
it fits the 3d mask on the on the user
face and basically we use it in order to
track certain points which are the ones
that the joints of the face which are
most related with changes in the in the
facial expression like this one is an
impression that we want to take we want
to detect exactly those kind of things
what the user is playing with a new
interface
there should be another one
like this
so those are we think those are signals
that might you know convey some
information about the problems by user
is experiencing with with your new
interface okay so basically sorry for
the mess with the video so basically we
have the our focus was on usability and
in the literature we found out that some
combination of other features of facial
feature motion were found to be
correlated with the confusion and
frustration since those were relevant to
our study we decided to basically
following the litter to build compound
variables over the features that we had
so linear combination of them and so we
computed also indexes for confusion and
frustration but it's important to say
that we don't want to detect frustration
or confusion we only use previous works
in order to build a new feature based on
the features that we extract and then go
on with it the activation indexing stage
that we did I spoke before basically it
uses a technique which was which we
found the literature to be very common
on EMG senior signals so basically a
feature would be considered active at a
given frame in time if its values above
its mean plus the standard deviation
value so we sticked with that definition
and we post processed all the features
of start and that's how we built our
vectors of features so we run a couple
of studies for this for this software
and the first one we used 15 master
students who had never used for a set of
four major players that we chose we
gathered performance measures and user
experience self reports and of course we
we got
ux made output from the video data what
we found is that there were significant
control relations between the data we
extracted and the number of errors we
identified which were the relevant
motion units which were mostly related
to the mouth corners and the eyebrows as
expected there was a weak correlation
between subjecting evaluation and the
number of errors and it looked like the
the questionnaires were biased by the
last task which was the most challenging
also there was a strong interior
individual variability what we also did
is that we took one third of all the
face videos that we recorded and we gave
it to three observers and ask them to to
do you xmas job to see if she could say
okay the guy is experiencing some
difficulties and what turned out is that
the two of them were kind of random one
was performing well so we asked her what
do you have any specific training on on
the Fox system on act months kahless's
when it turns out she had so we were
like okay this might work because I mean
if you were random as well then it
doesn't make sense that we try to make a
system that approximates that stuff and
then but this actually gave us a
motivation to further investigate the
problem so we designed a validation
study with twice as many students so we
got 31 undergrads we use three academic
social working social networking
websites as because we didn't have the
resources to build the interfaces and so
those were academia and I'm researcher
and researchgate and we introduced
introduced the calibration task so we
designed to tasks in order to get base
with the training data
or building our models and well the both
the the screen action of the user and
the synchronized face video are have
been released so they are online for if
someone wants to work on it so this is
an example of the calibration faces so
basically the the guy would randomly the
subjects would be a random is shown this
sequence either first that one or first
that one the order would be random and
here following to list you can see that
the wild one is the clutter it over
there so it's most difficult to find a
double room at the Holiday Inn in
Bradley in that set up rather than in
this stuff where everything is like you
know visually organized so we use these
in order to gather our training set this
is an example of what happened to the
guys so that's what guy is watching so
the non cluttered one that's you know so
there's nothing there and actually when
we check the numbers we had we found
that so these motion units are the ones
related to eyebrows into the mouth
corners those are the compound ones that
I took before the frustration and the
confusion one so you can see that in the
difficult condition there's higher
activation levels of the passion motion
so we ran we build our models we try to
predict using only the calibration phase
data we try to predict the actual
experience of a user on the three
networking website results were not so
great even though not either to bed for
every first run so we plan to actually
improve your experience and this can
happen for example in trying to fit
better
calibration tasks more sweet for what
you want to detect on the real on the on
the rear of tasks probably we should
extend these two other interaction
feelings for example engagement during
video games might be an option and
probably new compound vara variables
needs to be identified in order to
extend it so after all this is from the
your face now well you so we the outline
is that represent a cheap non-invasive
way to to try to get automatic user
experience assessment and we release the
database in hopefully someone will use
it so that's it now there's for
improvement in terms of the actual like
mark about facial features and I mean do
you think that tool is good enough in
and try like missed a little day how do
you develop that too okay so I think
there is a I mean the tool does a good
job but right now I think in that field
you have a lot of tool that to actually
probably also better job so Acme not
from our search front of you able to go
in improving that too because there's
not much researching yeah I mean even
just like looking at the video for
example like it wasn't looking that much
at the forehead where it looks like a
lot of these kind of confusion wrinkles
are so yeah I don't know I mean what
when we were looking at here like how
how do you pull the actual numbers out
from so busy with the number represent
yeah is that at each frame you will have
a displacement which give you the
direction and magnitude of a movement of
a certain partial Fisher point with
respect to any saturation point which is
the moment before the calibration tests
there was a cross on the thing please
stare at me screenshot
but yeah I mean this this system is not
perfect but it works reasonably well for
our purposes it's a is true that there
are a bunch of other symbols or
commercial systems or I mean think of
the the ones that Google as Microsoft
ours facebook has I mean there for sure
ten times better than this one but we
don't occur after to themselves have you
considered like how this thing will play
out in like more natural settings
instead of like this is fairly
artificial you bring people in no this
is uh okay these are some of them are
running the offices but oh you mean
Patricia here the guy I mean it seems
like I don't know see you later on much
just distractions the person is really
like doing what they are doing right oh
yes in all natural settings it might be
more complicated where you are in a in a
social situation and there are multiple
different types of signals that you're
in supposed to wish ya more noise soon
yeah which I mean and I'm detecting
emotion from facial features do you have
any ideas well the thing is that here
the the whole point of these is to have
some evaluation of a new interface
prototype that i have so i would call
people in say a with what we foresee is
that with the system like this which can
run on your laptop i can just give you
access to my interface prototype and
tell you hey do it at home when you have
five minutes you whether you do it of
course if you start drinking a coffee
and doing other stuff then we will get
random results but yeah it's the the
trade-off with the you know ecological
validity and
right how how much does it depend upon
them if i move the camera from k to the
dell monitor the cameras on top of the
10 this is a lot to put this so you have
the embedded camera the people are
really having fired at a common set up
yeah i mean it seemed like that it's how
since it was it too I mean then I guess
all the laptops of the cameras over
there but
give me on the position of the camera
what is I mean it's I would say like you
have at least alone if you talk about
tilt I think you have a kind of it my
distance really yeah i mean it it gets
up to i would say in this distance like
one metre half from the camera should be
fine and the the problem is with the
partial occlusions like if you start to
do this I mean the tracking would still
be there it is quitter of quite robust
to it but you should filter them out I
guess you don't minutes I'm just
wondering so do people actually show a
lot of expressions during these tasks or
it sits low intensity so I'm just
expressions good spending effort and
facial expression analysis when people
are I mean there are other things that
you can be right you can look at maybe
their keyboard movements may be some
urology that might be easier signal then
something just just a part yeah probably
but i mean the the idea was coming from
HCI a professor in Oran she was like
look evaluation studies are usually done
with two mg sensors one on the head and
one this what do they measure they
measure the activation of those marshall
which way we can't which we can't really
measure because if it's not visually you
can get it to the web
the psychology of nutrition this is from
body of like falling you cited in that
is down but i think you're right i mean
that was the pre-computer use time so
it's not clear how those things play out
and today's information was so maybe
like if you're like you have those
badges when people are interacting with
each other it seems that people will be
more expressive with their facial
expression which they try to communicate
a certain thing to the person so in
those kind of situations these might be
more explicit yeah so this is where for
example for this so for this study so
you have both the videos of the guy and
you have the video of the screen of what
the guy is doing because that's what
annotators used later to say a it didn't
take the right part to upload the photo
over there but of course i mean you
could Deb I mean you could devise your
interface prototype whatever in order to
log if the guy was doing wrong actions
then you wouldn't need facial expression
you do ninja it will be a self-contained
story
thought about just running this over
time with what works and logging how
they feel from out there so I know that
I get hathaway frustrated English that
I'm frustrated when I'm working we
really just need to go back and see that
I was frustrated when I was writing this
email or when like this person texted me
or all right like that no I worked with
good you think you'll find people to
participate in experiments like I think
people would be interested in doing it
for them so I think in the social
setting you have a more loudly expressed
facial yeah no communication but I think
on your own you have a more honest one
because there's no one there so you
probably you're less bias yeah I have a
feeling better when I'm on my own I
don't like but I may be wrong it might
be like a subconscious way see I feel
that way and then when someone walks in
I'm like oh and mr. just my face there
was um did like an art project where she
constantly took pictures of himself and
he gotten a lot of trouble because he
took pictures of he got although all the
laptops at the apple store in Manhattan
electric or everyone in yellow in a lot
of trouble but he said he wanted to do
that project first because he recorded
himself and he found that he didn't have
any change in facial expression so that
kind of goes along with what yeah people
of international exposure that's one
example
okay okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
