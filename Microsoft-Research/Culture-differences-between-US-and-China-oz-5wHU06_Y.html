thank you for coming and my name is
Debbie Lu it's my privilege to invite
mr. Wittenberg to vow unto to Microsoft
time counter tasks serious so he's here
to share his own experience during the
China Cultural Revolution he will also
discuss the cultural differences between
China and the United States as well as
giving some advices to time members on
how to fit into American mainstream mr.
Rotenberg is founder and president of
world class China consulting team
Wittenberg Associates Inc he lived and
worked in China from 1924 to 1979 he
witnessed firsthand of what occurred at
upper levels of China Chinese Communist
Party and he knew many of the leaders
personally from Chairman Mao judo don't
lie to thumbs up you gentlemen an
decision team now please join me to give
him a warm welcome
thank you I apologize for being late
it's the fault of my GPS the GPS brought
us to this neighborhood 20 minutes early
which is fine then it just leaves you
you know it doesn't tell you where the
building is it says your destination is
ahead on the left so here you have this
whole part of this whole city of
Microsoft buildings and how are you
supposed to find building 99 well anyway
we finally made it
actually I prepared to talk in Chinese
and all my notes are in Chinese so
they're pretty well useless but I
understood that there were going to be
foreigners present so I was asked to
talk in English but I will do something
there in the old days in Shanghai there
was an English professor who spoke to
his class like this he said some
foreigners who've been living in China
has a terrible habit of showing off how
much Chinese they know so while they're
talking English they throw in some words
in Chinese just short this I'm happy to
tell you that I do not have that Moby
so my talk is gonna be a little like
that I'll put some terms into Chinese if
I think about it and if I say something
that anybody doesn't get doesn't
understand if you just raise your hand
I'll be glad to translate it at no extra
charge well I was asked to talk about my
experience in the Cultural Revolution I
don't think there's anyone in this room
who took part in the Cultural Revolution
aside from the two of us is there I
think you were all much too young yeah
but anyway that was ten years and that
was a new thing in human history that I
don't think has ever happened anywhere
before the pity is that it's not being
studied in China today or very little
studied very little even talked about in
school it's a blank and that's a great
pity because that was a very important
part of Chinese history and of human
history I think it showed us what people
do when they can do whatever they like
no holds barred sky's the limit for a
limited period of time so here's sort of
my own experience I joined the American
Communist Party as a student at the
University of North Carolina we knew
nothing about revolution we knew nothing
about foreign countries including the
Soviet Union we were working for racial
equality against prejudice and
discrimination
we're working to give people in the
South the right to vote maybe you think
that every American has no problem
voting not true if you're in the
southern states still today and you're a
minority you may have trouble voting so
anyway that's what we were doing then in
World War two
I left the Communist Party I join the
American army and that's how I got to
China because the reason I went to China
was that I did not want to go to Japan
reason I studied Chinese was I didn't
want to study Japanese
it was very simple I was picked out of
the infantry because of a language
aptitude test and I was sent to Stanford
University to learn Japanese and to be
sent to Japan for military government
after the war this was 1943 so there was
still two more years of war left so I
didn't want to be overseas after the war
I wanted to come home right after the
war and I didn't want to be in military
government government of any kind didn't
interest me at all still doesn't so I
went to the Chinese professor and I
persuaded him to get the army to
transfer me into Chinese language so I
could get home right after the war China
was an ally and it worked very well in
only 35 years I was back home
there's a kind of a gift of prophecy
what I didn't realize would happen
happened my first day in Chinese
language studies I just totally fell in
love with that language and never
recovered to this day I remember when I
was put in jail locked up in solitary in
China when the door slammed shut one of
the first things I thought of was you
could lock me up you cannot take away my
Chinese language I already have it so
you know it's not like any idea that we
ever had of a language it's not like
it's just another language it's a whole
new world so anyway so when I went to
China in the army after the war I stayed
in China and I managed to get myself to
Yen an and in 1946 I joined the Chinese
Communist Party which is a completely
different kind of organization the
Chinese party in those days was like our
ideal of what a communist party should
be like there were mainly poor people
very little difference between the
leaders and the non leaders very little
difference and life was very simple in
yen an if you met Martha doom walking
down the street or Joanne lie you came
up and said hi and struck up a
conversation no big deal no big deal
happen all the time so and they worked
very hard to help the farm people get
back into production half
to the war when everything was destroyed
and he carried out the land reform that
gave everybody land and so on so I was
very much impressed then I had in
February 1949 all of a sudden I was
arrested thrown into a pitch-black cell
lived in darkness and solitary for one
year and then five more years not in
darkness and the effect on me was I
decided I didn't know that I'd been
accused by Stalin by the Russians of
being an American spy I thought it was a
Chinese problem which it was not so I
thought to myself the reason they
suspect me is that I'm not a good enough
revolutionary so in prison I'm gonna
make myself into a better pure communist
and then sooner or later they'll see Who
I am
so six years that's when I came out I
was really a very dogmatic doctrinaire
communist party member anything the
party said was fine and I saw the
tremendous changes in life in China
especially in the first five years from
1949 to 1954 55 these tremendous social
reforms eight-hour day the end of opium
it's back now of course but in those
days it was wiped out and a prostitution
which is also back now they had some
foreign businessmen on Chinese TV not
long ago
tearfully exposing his sins of
make an appointment with a prostitute
that's really the height of hypocrisy
because prostitution is all over as you
know everywhere from the five-star
hotels to wherever the streets its back
but in those days gone
and I went I did a study of that I went
to the schools for retraining
prostitutes teaching them useful work
helping them find husbands and get
married and it was beautiful the way was
done in the 50s but by 1960 61 I began
having some deep suspicions that
everything wasn't as good as I thought
it was I was working to translate the
works of mouth doing into English and
actually with some things that he wrote
that were very stimulating to me like
Mao writes and you can see in his
collected words that a communist should
ask why about everything you should
never take anything blindly on faith to
never obey just because someone in
leadership says it's right you should
use your own head to think about is it
really right or not the things of that
sort you know and also he wrote that the
a new truth a new discovery in the
beginning is always the property of one
person or a very small group of people
and everyone else says they're fools
but gradually the truth proves itself it
comes to be true and gradually it wins
the support of the majority so these
people are considered no
the fools their wise men but by that
time a new truth has appeared that again
is in the hands of just a small number
of people who are considered fools
therefore it's very important to protect
the rights of the minority that's what
he wrote just imagine how nice it would
have been if he had carried it out
instead of just writing it down but as
we know for most of the time he did not
carry it out but anyway those things
were very stimulating and I began to
raise questions in the party we were you
and I were both working at the state
broadcasting administration radio
Beijing and I wrote a letter to the
director of a state broadcast the
administration saying that our structure
is all wrong the people who decide what
can be published and what cannot be
published know nothing about journalism
the people that understand journalism
and I'm working on actually writing the
programmes have no authority to decide
what's used and what's not used so it's
all upside down the result is that our
broadcasts are very boring not only
don't win friends but often antagonize
people so this was a personal letter for
me to him but he circulated it among all
the leadership which got me labeled as a
right-wing opportunist and a series of
struggle meetings began against me well
that only lasted two days and then the
loudini who was minister of propaganda
and actually a very lively democratic
minded person he telephoned the director
rady
and cursed him out and said stop that
nonsense immediately so they did stop
and they apologized but I felt something
was very wrong later on in 1965 so one
year before the Cultural Revolution in a
party meeting I raised the issue of why
should the party watch what people are
saying watch what the masses non-party
people are saying why should we exercise
surveillance over them why should we
have people reporting on what he's
saying and she's saying so on they
should be watching us the party members
not us watching them we're supposed to
be the servants and they're the masters
and now it's the other way around we're
behaving like the Masters and they're
the servants well I was a minority of
one but that got me marked at the
beginning of the Cultural Revolution as
one of the three most dangerous people
at radio Beijing which also didn't go
anywhere however so when the cultural or
the reason I'm saying this is when the
Cultural Revolution broke out it seemed
to me like a gift from the gods
it seemed like a wonderful new day when
the party was being criticized party
members were being demanded that they
behave as servants of the people and
people were free to elect anyone they
wanted to the leadership of their
institution of their work unit they
could criticize anybody they wanted
except for a chairman mao and his little
Cultural Revolution leading group they
could write speak say anything they
pleased and they could form political
organizations with anyone they wanted
long as you felt that you agreed with
this guy you and him to be a two-man
organization and at radio we actually
did have two of the editors who formed
their own political organization as well
as lots and lots of other political and
this was all wide open free nobody could
interfere so I thought that this this
was really the great day this was the
day on which what was written in the
Constitution was actually coming to pass
people had freedom of speech freedom of
organ organization freedom of
publication and so on and actually Mao
himself this is one of the things that
set the fire that ignited the Cultural
Revolution when he came back from
swimming the Yangtze River are actually
mainly floating across the Yangtze River
in 1966 he called an enlarged meeting of
the political Bureau of the Central
Committee in which he said he said we
have a beautiful Constitution and all
the other socialist countries had the
same kind of Constitution none of us
have ever carried it out and he said
don't you think it's about time that we
carried it out and so at that meeting
they cancelled all the limitations all
the restrictions on writing big
character posters where you could put
them up and who you could criticize and
it was all canceled so I thought well
this is a great day freedom under
socialism where the main thing is not
what the individual can do for the
collective but what the collective can
do for the individual and that was the
way in my mind
Marxism was supposed to be so with that
I threw myself enthusiastically into the
support
the rebels it's all vampire
enthusiastically speaking and writing
and doing everything possible including
taking considerable risks because I
thought it was worth the risk and I
became a very popular figure that way
which was easy because here's an older
kadra from the enn days who takes the
side of the rebels and that was rare
very few people did that in those days
and also an American who spoke fluent
Chinese that added some color to it and
so very popular now I saw the bad side
of what was going on I knew that people
were being killed innocent people were
being killed innocent children were
being tortured
there was great destruction of property
and so on but my head was on flame I
thought this is making a new world of
great freedom and you know that famous
quotation you may or may may or may not
know from Jeb and Maya a revolution is
not a dinner party can't be so polite so
gentle so courteous and so on so I
ignored all of that I thought that's bad
but it's a necessary evil when you untie
people and let them make revolution
things like that happen I've made some
protests very feeble to the leaders
central leaders about the way the senior
cadra were being treated at the struggle
meetings and so on but very feeble
basically I went along with it and took
part in it
so in February 1968 I ended up back in
solitary confinement on renewed spy
charges and that was another 16 years in
solitary which frankly speaking I
thought was too long I don't like to be
a whiner but I really thought it was too
long what brought that about well I had
a quarrel with John King I think that
helped you know see when the this is one
of the negative things that destroyed
all hope in the Cultural Revolution I
found out that you can't just let people
alone to decide what to do and you're
going to have a perfect democracy not
going to happen one basic reason was
that everybody understood that democracy
means majority rules
so we have a decision to make we take a
vote whatever the majority wants okay
that's what we do
very few people understood that you have
to protect the rights of the minority
even in Tiananmen Square in 1989 we were
there same thing the student leaders who
were in charge that day often really
didn't let other students who had
different opinions speak or didn't give
them an equal right to speak so the
minority view was suppressed by these
rebels just like the minority view was
suppressed by the old bureaucrats only
worse because they were cooler
they were cruder they didn't know that
certain things that you can't do you
have to follow the the rule
and the ordinary moral norms and so on
so that was bad what happened at the
radio was typical of what happened all
over and I'll give you this as an
example so the rebel regiment comes to
power we was one of the eight people
walked into the central editorial office
and told the senior editors on duty you
stay at your jobs but for now on you
working for us no more party committee
no more director vice director that's
all going you working but he's kids
really except for me I was only one
wasn't a kid and that was very smooth
but here's an organization the radio of
7,000 people and here's a bunch of young
people from the editorial groups from
the carpool from all over who have no
experience in managing that kind of
organization they can't even make the
motor pool work so the reporters can't
get cars when they need to go out to do
an interview so after a few days people
that elected them people in the rebel
ranks began complaining saying hey you
promised us a wonderful new democratic
organization with no bureaucracy and so
on and so forth and look what's
happening now it's worse than it ever
was so then these young people who had
fought hard battles for the right to
speak for the right to criticize and
finally came to power what did they do
they were terrified at this opposition
and these complaints that were getting
and they suppressed the people who are
complaining them and they did it more
crudely than the original bureaucrats
had ever done
they broke open their drawers in their
in
in their deaths at home confiscated
their correspondence read their Diaries
looking for proof of the conspiracy they
hauled him up on the stage and
interrogated them to answer questions
really crude stuff and I opposed that
openly and John King came to their
defense and I told her at a session that
we had in the radio that you're
supporting the wrong people these people
are not fit to be in charge of an
institution that's supposed to have
democratic management they're
suppressing their opposition these are
my own comrades my own colleagues
they're suppressing their opposition and
that's not right that was not considered
healthy in those days to argue with John
King but I didn't and I was not the only
one I was not the only one there was
another one of the announcers a young
woman was also very brave and stood up
and told spoke truth to power
but anyway from that day on a secret
investigation of me began which ended up
with me in going back to solitary well I
was put under house arrest on Christmas
Day of 1967 which I thought was a nice
touch and hauled off to prison in
February of 68 so and as you may know by
nineteen by the second half of 1967
Chairman Mao found that this red guard
movement which he had created and
supported did not obey him they talked
day in and day out about Mao was a god
Mao was the
red red sun in my heart and so on and if
you listen to what they said you would
have thought they were his most loyal
followers but if you looked what they
did they did not obey Him they fought
civil wars against each other they stole
they destroyed public property they
tortured people from the opposing
organization not all of them of course
but some of the major red guard groups
and he found that they were out of
control that his new world was not going
to happen with these young people in
charge so what did he do he sent all the
student youth out to the villages to
work on the farm and be transformed by
the poor and lower middle peasants that
was the saying at the time and who was
in charge he sent the Army in to take
over in all the units where the people
had elected their own leaders so
students out army in and that was the
end of that stage the first year and a
half of the Cultural Revolution from
then on it was all power struggle and
play-acting it was nothing worthwhile
was really going on so you know and I
learned a lesson from that because I
used to think that all you have to do is
give give people the right to do
whatever they like and they will know
how to behave democratically and I saw
in the Cultural Revolution not true
people need to have a certain amount of
political experience to know things like
the fact that you must protect the
rights of the minority a lesson which
has still not been learned but the fact
is if the minority has no guaranteed
rights nobody really has guaranteed
rights
it can be you can have the right to
speak today and it can be taken away
tomorrow the only way of guaranteeing it
for anybody is to guarantee it for
everybody that's just the way it works
and I learned that I think from the
Cultural Revolution but this was a great
experiment I think the first great
experiment in Chinese history of trying
to maintain trying to set up a perfect
democracy a really popular regime and
making it work and it showed what it's
possible to do and it also showed what
can't be done until until you reach a
certain stage of development
I mean democracy is not a simple thing
look at us
here after what 800 years since the
Magna Carta in England which was the
first step forward and in democracy in
the West and all it was it gave the
nobles the barons the aristocrats the
right to present appeals to the king
that's all it provided for they had no
power but the right to appeal and even
that was abolished by the king sometime
later and had to be restored so it after
800 years of progress we have a
government that makes wars that most
people are against that we have a
Congress a majority of which opposes
even the most minimum public health care
which most people are for and that's our
democracy it's not that we don't have
any democracy we do have we have the
right to speak and publish you have the
right to publish your own use paper if
you have half a billion dollars to pay
for it so actually at the end of the day
you have as much right as you can pay
for and that's what you have if you
can't pay for it you basically have no
rights it's like a policeman in
Birmingham Alabama told me when I was
arrested in connection with a
progressive movement way back in 1940
and I said I I have a right to be here
and he looked at me with pity in his
eyes and he said son you ain't got no
rights rights is what you think you got
and so that that's the way it was so
democracy is a long long struggle to
implement a real democracy the Cultural
Revolution showed what is possible and
it also showed that it's only possible
under certain conditions which I believe
we don't have at this point there's
still room for a lot of progress I think
I mean about China my my feeling is I
don't think I would not like to see a
multi-party system in China today I
really wouldn't because I don't think it
would make things better I think it
would make things worse I think the best
hope is to try to improve this one party
for the time being try to make it better
but they're there two things that I
think personally are very badly needed
one is a free press allow the press to
discuss all your debate about anything
it is not going to lead to chaos really
if it would lead to chaos there are
thousands of chat rooms as you know
Chinese chat rooms some of them are
really extreme but it doesn't lead to
chaos people learn to listen to all
different kinds of opinions and not get
carried away
so but I think of free
very badly needed and the other thing is
it must be protection for whistleblowers
what we've had so far you have a
reporter even Xinhua news agency
reporter or a lawyer or someone who
exposes a bad guy
they exposes something bad the bad guy
may lose his job but the reporter goes
to jail for tax evasion or whatever and
the lawyer loses his license very hard
to have progress until you protect
whistleblowers recently the government
set up a special website you may know
about and they promise that anybody that
exposes bad people are bad things on
that government website will be
protected so I don't know whether that's
gonna work or not but it's a it's a it's
a hopeful move it seems to me so
cultural revolution the other question
another question I was asked was about
how to fit in with the American
mainstream you know we had the same
problem actually III came back after 35
years in China speaking basically only
Chinese and my wife came back him came
here after never having been out of
China and never having traveled much
even inside China well I had all
comrades old friends and some family so
that made things easier but I would say
my personal view I would say two things
are important
number one it's very important that you
continue to be who you are
you do not want to change who you are
you want to be basically the same person
that you grew up being stick to your
roots and don't try to transform
yourself in something that's not real
because it departs from you it cuts off
your roots and you'll be very sorry
later
I've seen some individuals like that not
many who are like they used to say about
some foreigners in China they're more
Chinese than that than the Chinese you
could say about some people that come
here from other countries they're more
Americans than the Americans
it's a tendency it's also a tendency
among our children growing up they don't
want to be looked at differently they
don't want to be discriminated against
so they do their best to be more
American than the other American kids
but this is kind of unfortunate we want
to be who we are because that's your
integrity and your integrity believe it
or not is the most important thing that
you will ever have if you ever get
locked up in solitary which I don't
advise you have to sit there and figure
what is there that I really can't live
without and what are the things I used
to think I couldn't live without but
actually I don't need them I can get
along without them
and the one thing that you can't live
without really is your own integrity
that means that you are who you seem to
be you do what you say basically and you
mean what you say you want to continue
to be yourself and you're Chinese
originally so those of you who become
American citizens
so you're Chinese Americans and it's
fine
that's the first thing the second thing
is of course you want to learn the way
is the habits and customs but you don't
want to you wanted to pick and choose
which ways you want to learn you don't
want to learn always you you don't want
to learn the habits that other Americans
are trying to get rid of they throw them
down and you pick it up that doesn't
make sense so I think it's not that hard
what's hard is to break out of your own
little group that maintains your own
little culture and you don't associate
with other groups you don't associate
with other people that are not part of
your little mini culture so that's not
good because you get stuck in that in
that rut it's very hard to get out of
you want to be you want to expand you
want to be open to everything listen
everything and be able to make friends
with all kinds of people and deal with
all kinds of people I think I'm really
talking a lot of nonsense because
everybody knows these things
but that's all I can say for us coming
back was a great adventure and it was
fun you learn how to get along you have
to learn how to get along and at the
same time don't stop being you you're
still you my wife I think if you put her
in another country for 200 years she'd
still be the same
it's a very tough customer just imagine
a young Chinese woman marries this
American foreign expert who is then
hauled off to prison and denounced
everywhere as a hidden enemy an
imperialist spy and she refuses to say
anything against it and she's treated
like a traitor she betrayed her nation
she sold out to this foreigner maybe
even part of his spy network so she's
beaten spit on curse dad sent to labor
camp at hard labor for years doing labor
that was harder than any other woman and
tamp was given because she was a traitor
she never bowed her head any job that
they gave her to do she made up her mind
she's going to do it so well that it was
shut their mouths up they won't find
anything to criticize her for you know
at work and she survived and she raised
our poor children the ten years that I
was away and I think she's kind of an
angel where's she Yulin stand up
so I really lucked out there was a third
set of questions I'm gonna see how I had
to shut my phone down
Debbie what was the third set of
questions Oh
cultural differences well I think the
main thing is even though this is
changing China is changing very rapidly
but basically I think it's still true
China is a we society America is a me
society a lot of talk these days about
the Chinese dream Chinese dream is a we
dream it's a dream about us China
Chinese the progress that we're going to
make the resurgence of our nation the
American dream is a me dream it's me
becoming rich and successful and famous
and so on that's a very big difference
it's a very big difference because the
the whole mindset is really different
now of course there's a lot of
individualism in China today there's a
lot of me also going on but it's still
essentially a we society and you can see
that all over the place I think that's
the main difference in the culture but
of course the traditions are very
different but they're compatible when we
were married 57 years ago 1956 a lot of
people were against it including the
director radio ruling she who was the
head of the Xinhua news agency at the
time invited me to lunch specially
to advise me that I should not marry one
you live why well because cultures are
two different she don't want to talk
about Peking Opera and you want to talk
about Shakespeare and it won't work well
we were talking ourselves the other day
in 57 years we have never had this issue
about Chinese and foreigner it's just
not there we learn from each other's
culture I learned from her to love
Beijing opera and she learned for me
about Western literature and culture and
it has never been a problem and I really
needs to be a problem we went to China
with Billy Graham you may know the most
famous American Protestant minister and
we had a session with drew G when he was
vice premier before you put in premium
and Billy gave him an autographed copy
of a Chinese Bible it was printed in
Nanjing at the big Bible press there and
drew ng thanked him and said as a matter
of fact I have an English copy at home
which I read from time to time because I
believe that we should know the great
literature of all peoples not just of
China and I think that's the way it
works you learn to understand and
appreciate the best of American culture
lots and lots of junk you're not likely
to appreciate that and even more
important you are every one of you is a
living ambassador from China really a
kind of cultural ambassador because
ordinary Americans learn about China
from knowing you if you come across as a
good person they have a good impression
of China and your characteristics are
going to impress them with what China is
like and that's something you can't
escape it's a natural thing
I don't know we have any time for
questions
not a really question that I thought it
was a thought about the recent
opportunity events
Jimmy Kimmel well that that has to do
with American culture too I mean it was
just nonsense really it was a six year
old child who came who just blurted out
that statement which her parents would
not necessarily approve of might or
might not we don't know and
unfortunately it was on national
television so it was something for which
the TV station had to apologize and they
did apologize and that was right but I
don't see much in it beyond that the
Jimmy Kimmel himself is not a person
skilled in political maneuvering and so
he didn't handle it properly he didn't
know how to handle it he just made it he
repeated it and made it into a joke when
he should have pointed out immediately
that that was something very wrong and
very bad but he didn't well that's his
fault
that's his failing as an entertainer
itself or some outside force yeah can
the one party become better itself or
just require outside force I think it
does require outside force I think both
inside and outside together have some
hope of making that party together we
don't know yet for sure whether it can
be done but I think it looks hopeful if
if the leaders are determined to make it
a better party and if there's not
pressure from the people
to porce them to do it and to put
pressure on the opposition I think it
may happen but it's gonna take both of
those popular pressure and action from
on top you know I think one job all
recent premium I think he sincerely
wanted to carry through some political
reforms but wasn't able to do it he
couldn't get a majority in the
leadership to move forward against the
opposition Xi Jinping is a different
kind of person and maybe he can do it or
maybe not I mean my opinion I I don't
know yet but if I think if the party is
not able to reform and really thoroughly
reform then one day the people will get
up and reform it for them there's no
other alternative I don't think because
the the system needs to be reformed
anybody you talk to in Beijing will tell
you that everybody right left or Center
they all say yes yes yes but they mean
different things by it and I think the
big the big conglomerates the big
monopolies and the big banks are all
against real reform so we'll see this
Central Committee plenum later this
month supposedly according to what
they're saying in advance they're going
to break through the opposition and
reach agreement on basic economic
reforms if they can reach agreement on
and carry out basic economic reforms I
think you'll see the political reforms
will follow
because you cannot run a free-market
economy without more political freedom
long term I don't believe it works so if
they really free up the economy a lot
more I think we'll see that the pressure
on expression of opinions on will go
away that's what I'm hoping I I think
this guy is trying to work up all the
possible support you can get from people
and to sort of paralyze the opposition
so that he can carry through the
economic reforms is this right or is
this wrong we'll see
yeah
so she came completely into negative
intention back to me and take the
Huracan put up about how good good and
good at her look what happened I think
is his attitude towards mother dome I
think what he said sometimes on the
speech he said we should not we should
not negate we should not wipe away the
memory of martyrdom even though he made
those terrible mistakes the Great Leap
Forward the Cultural Revolution and so
on but looking at his whole history
coding the founding of the PRC unifying
the country so and so forth we should
not make him into a completely bad
person we should continue to respect him
I think that's right and I think it's
very important to study some of his
writings critically study them
critically because the man was a great
thinker in my opinion
I mean his strategy and tactics in the
war is something as studied at West
Point in this country it's something
that is was a marvel no you read is his
lecture on protracted war it's a
masterpiece of how to analyze the strong
points and weak points of the other side
your own strong points of weak points in
how to use your own strengths against
your own weaknesses and use your
strengths against the other guy's
weakness instead of trying to deal with
his strengths with your weakness
use your strength against his weakness
not the other way around these are works
of Deena's and incidentally in solitaire
I got a great deal of support from
studying on protracted war and figuring
out what my own strengths and weaknesses
were in that situation and how to deal
with it
so I think it's important you know you
have this cultural treasure in China the
only time in history I think where the
top leader has tried to educate the
entire country in a philosophic
viewpoint which if you take away the
part about class struggle and the
politics of the time was really a
brilliant version of the scientific
method do everything through trial and
experimentation you know that the
leadership should be a processing plant
for processing the demands that come
from the people and forming policies
that meet their demands masked line
these are brilliant things and to have
this national treasure that nobody else
has and not to study it and carry it
forward seems to me that's a great pity
and I think he's trying to correct this
and I I hope it works all right Sydney I
have a question so do you think that is
true to the Chinese Communist Party or
any communist party for that matter is a
democratic entity or is that more of a
totalitarian regime this party
definitely not democratic
definitely not democratic they don't
pretend to be democratic the the old
party before coming to power was much
more democratic than this I mean I've
been at meetings in
in the tie ha mountains in 1948 where
there was strong criticism of Mowen in
his policy and it was normal
was no big deal
you couldn't do that later and I don't
know about right now but until fairly
recently couldn't do it either party
members even a party meetings were not
really allowed to criticize the
decisions of the central committee or to
oppose them you weren't supposed to
that's what my friends tell me anyway
so not democratic I think it needs to
change itself into a democratic party
and that's what some people are working
on but the great they're great obstacles
there's so much corruption so much
corruption how many people are there in
the Communist Party that are really
interested in communism how many people
are there in the Communist Party that
really are dedicated to serving the
people there are some but how many I
went to lecture at Jing hua university a
few years ago at a seminar for graduate
students studying how to be
entrepreneurs and there was a young
woman in the question period she at
Ching hua she said I joined the
Communist Party here at school because I
believed in the ideals of communism and
I want to work for them but all my
classmates laugh at me they say I only
joined because I want a career I want to
get ahead you know in life and she
started crying she said I don't know how
to deal with that so there are people in
it
that are not just in it to get ahead in
life but it's very very corrupted and
that's what you have to start with so
how far you gonna get in reforming at
open question I think nobody knows I
think you can't say in advance or you'll
never you'll never be able to do it
because you don't want to do that if
somebody is really trying you want to
support them as much as you can but we
just don't know for Sheila I think poor
Sheila has been known to be a bad egg
for a long long time and so there are
two questions in my mind about that
trial first one is so how did he get so
high me in the Cultural Revolution he
was part of the cruelest most brutal Red
Guard group in the cultural Liendo you
know they used to drive in in these
three wheel trucks through the streets
of Beijing with the big bass drum in the
back of the truck somebody's sitting in
the back and boom boom boom boom on the
truck on the side of the truck was
written home so combo red terror and
they were going grab people and killed
them torture them whatever they were
actually the only red group that was
against mouth but not openly they were
taking revenge for their parents who
were being struggled against so you had
boy boys sons and listen son that one's
sons defending their parents whose way
it started
so even John King put them in jail for a
while because it was so brutal
later on she pulled him out and cried
over them and said you poor children and
so
they went back but so he's always always
been a bad guy
so how did he get up so high secondly
none of his really major crimes were
even mentioned at the trial I mean I
think the trial was fine and great that
it was a lot of the stuff was published
but what was it
550 million US dollars and corruption
chicken feed
chicken feed that nothing to what they
actually stole everybody knows had
someone in the Ministry of Finance said
last year we will protect his name that
of all the nine members of the central
Standing Committee at that time it was
nine is now seven every one of them not
one family has less than 100 million
u.s. dollars not one so that's what you
have to deal with that's that the facts
of life but this was not touched in the
bush lie trial you know and he kept his
part of the bargain he didn't say
anything about it when he spoke about
his other wealth and other people's
wealth so you know it's the old saying
is true Deidre nanfan
you got such an accumulation of problems
that it's not going to be easy to deal
with them but I think they will be dealt
with China is a country James Fallows so
I think there's one of a really good
American journalists has said this about
China there's a tremendous momentum of
forward movement in China you don't feel
here I'll give you an example we went to
we went to this there's this
big building in Beijing called by no
wait I don't know if you know whether
all these electronic devices are sold
and so we went to one of the Apple
stands there and I was getting an iPad
which the Apple store didn't have yet
so I asked the woman yeah this
middle-aged woman who was the boss I
said where do you get them she said we
don't know they bring him in suitcases
and we buy him this was an efficient
this was a registered Apple product not
counterfeit okay so I said to her I said
you know some people think that in five
years the GDP in China will be larger
than in America and she said oh won't
take five years you try to find somebody
in this country that will say something
like that about our economy you can't
find them so in spite of all the
problems all the corruption all the
backwardness there's tremendous forward
momentum in that country and I
personally feel certain China will
continue to move forward very fast and I
think it's the best hope of the human
race really because the Chinese in spite
of all the ultra nationalistic hollering
are a peace-loving people they don't
want to fight wars they don't want to
grab anybody else's territory you know
they want to get along and do business
and I think that's the best hope that
the world has as the continued growth of
China
I think the last gradually I rather you
also treat a lot of Kassadin job to help
American business do physical channel no
brain case is here so what do you think
of the economic independence of China us
in other 50 years now so that's decided
the second question is my own advice do
you have two young people to do business
across two countries I'm sorry I'm
missing
what's your quick advice to young people
young people doing business to thank
well on the first yo the economies of
these two countries are competitive in
some areas but they're much more
supplementary it's supplement each other
much more than they compete I think this
process will continue we'll do more and
more business with China and we will
reach strategic agreements on world
resources with China I think like
petroleum and a copper and things of
that sort will reach agreement on how to
export these resources there's an old
saying the course of true love never
runs smooth so we will continue to
quarrel and argue and shouting each
other over all kinds of issues
especially trade issues that's part of
the bargaining negotiating process but I
think the relationship will move forward
it's actually moved forward in every
administration so far every president
when they're campaigning the oil curse
China and they're going to be tough on
China when they actually get in the
White House and they have to deal with
the real world they do what needs to be
done
so I think the outlook there is pretty
good young people there is a tremendous
need for people that can communicate
with both cultures and who are honest
who have integrity to act as marriage
brokers as go-betweens between American
and Chinese business both for Americans
going to China and for Chinese coming
here they need to have someone that can
help them because the issues that
Americans have going to China very
simple really first of all you you have
to find the right people to talk with
and you have to find dependable people
people you can rely on to keep their
agreements and to do that the only way
you can do that is by investigating
internally after that people that know
what they're doing so I think it's a
great future for young people in
us-china business and if you fall in the
ocean and drown don't blame me for
saying that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
