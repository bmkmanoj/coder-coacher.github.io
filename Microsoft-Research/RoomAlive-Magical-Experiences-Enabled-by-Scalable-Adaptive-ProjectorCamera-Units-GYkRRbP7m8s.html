Rome alive is a proof of concept pro
transforms any room into an immersive
augmented magical gaming experience room
alive uses projectors and depth cameras
to cover an entire room including the
people in the furniture inside with
pixels that can be used for both input
and output with room alive users can
touch shoot and dodge augmented content
that seamlessly coexists with their
existing physical environment our system
consists of multiple projector camera
units or programs for short each unit
contains a depth camera a commodity wide
field of view projector and its own
computational unit these prochem units
can be used individually or combined
through a scalable distributed framework
to cover an entire room the prochem
units are auto calibrating and can self
localize within the room as long as
their views have some overlap the auto
calibration requires no expertise or
calibration fiducials so the pro cams
can easily be installed by end users one
just positions the programs in the room
and the system does the rest the system
automatically creates a unified model of
the room by combining the depth maps
from each prochem unit in addition to
the 3d model our system automatically
extracts the surfaces in the room
identifying vertical and horizontal
surfaces and the floor plane we expose
this information together with a 3d
model and the program controls in a plug
into a Unity game engine this enables
game designers to author rich immersive
gaming experiences to show how room
alive can transform your living room we
have created four interactive
experiences room alive supports
procedurally texturing the living room
transforming the room into a new
environment here the living room can be
transformed into a holodeck an indoor
factory or can show a river running
through the floor with dynamically
generated raindrops virtual critters can
also be procedurally generated to appear
around the living room the whack-a-mole
experience shows a virtual animated mole
appearing around the living room to play
through the experience you
can move around the living room touching
the virtual moles to gain points in
addition users can also shoot the malls
with a gun controller users can also
control a virtual character that
performs non physically realistic
interactions in the living room with a
standard game controller the virtual
character can move up and around walls
robots randomly appear around the living
room to chase the virtual character
lastly as a user walks around the living
room darts emanate from the walls that
the user must avoid when the user is hit
visual elements are shown to indicate
health damage these experiences are just
samples of what is possible with room
alive in summary room alive enables any
living room to be transformed into an
augmented interactive display
