you
a pleasure for me to welcome r &amp;amp; R o R &amp;amp;
R 0 comes from RTI and is a senior
economist there and has done very
interesting work on understanding
software economics how much does box
cost how much does the transition from
ipv6 for to ipv6 cost and he will talk
today about analyzing investments in
innovation looking into implications for
private companies as well as for the
government thanks a lot for coming by
all right thanks for from okay so my
name is Britt row I'm going to senior
economist at RTI work in our San
Francisco office a brief little bit
about RTI we are a not-for-profit
research institution formed originally
by Duke NC state and unc chapel hill as
a place with a similar mission 22 MSR
our mission is turning knowledge into
practice which i think is fairly similar
to what your mission is here over that
past 50 years or so we've done a great
deal of work in public health in
technology innovation as well as
technology management and understanding
of economic issues and social issues
surrounding public health and new
technologies as well as international
development so some of the key areas
we're involved in we've got about 3,000
staff worldwide the majority in North
Carolina working on lots of different
issues with lots of different
backgrounds so just a little information
for you on kind of where I'm coming from
so what I'm going to try and talk about
today is a few different areas one is
kind of starting out thinking about just
how to analyze innovation and I'll start
kind of thinking about this from private
perspective and then talk about where
there may be a role for government a lot
of the work that we've done is focused
on for NIST and for other organizations
in the government where their role might
be how the government might be to
support industry in terms of Technology
Policy be that regulation subsidization
or in this case new standards new kind
of supporting
structure and so I'll talk a little bit
about why that role might be necessary
or might be useful in certain cases what
might motivate a role for government
talk a little bit about some studies
we've done such as ipv6 such as some
work we did on software testing and our
back role-based access control and then
I'll talk about some future kind of
research needs in the Software Assurance
type of space okay so starting out with
kind of a framework for evaluating
private investments so I think pretty
much all decisions that are made within
an innovation focused organization could
benefit from a cost benefit mentality
but that doesn't mean that all decisions
should use a cost-benefit mentality I
think the thresholds that you need to
think about when deciding how rigorous
to to do an analysis of any type of
investment be it spending a small number
of hours on a new project or be it
devoting an entire group to a new
project I think depends on the
organization and it really depends on
whatever thresholds you like to set in
terms of how great those thresholds are
what the benefits might be but I think
more organizations could could benefit
from spending more time on using
cost-benefit and economic frameworks for
thinking about everyday decisions I
think a key feature of any cost benefit
analysis any economic analysis is that
you don't have to solve everything I
think lots of organizations shy away
from doing economic analysis and
cost-benefit analysis because they don't
feel comfortable estimating certain
components of that analysis what you
should do is set assumptions right so
there's certain things that are going to
be very difficult to to understand and
that's okay setting those things to the
side and focusing on what you can
analyze is a good method to to do some
kind of introductory work on or in some
cases for smaller decisions that could
be all the work you do is make some
assumptions and then do a cost-benefit
analysis of what makes sense so that's
my spiel for for--why more economic
analysis should be done so
sure so these are Annie's are really
just kind of placeholders so it depends
on the organization and what numbers
make sense so I kind of threw in these
numbers thinking about the size of
Microsoft and ms are so potentially
under a fifty-thousand-dollar investment
you may not want to spend a lot of time
analyzing it maybe that's to be 25 you
know it's it's kind of up to you to
decide but you may just want to do some
qualitative analysis so think about
who's going to be affected and I'll go
through the different pieces of this
type of analysis but who would be
affected by a decision what the
different cost factors might look like
and just do a rough calculation of what
the cost benefit might be once you get
to a little bit larger investment you
might want to actually go out and
conduct some interviews to do some type
of data collection from affected
stakeholders be that internal external
to see how your investment both how much
the investment might cost internally as
well as what the implications would be
if it's successful orbit is not
successful right on people both
internally and externally and then if
it's a much larger investment obviously
you should spend even more time thinking
about that so really my suggestion would
be to ramp that up to set certain
thresholds in terms of the amount of
time and effort you put into the actual
economic analysis so if you if you're
spending weeks and weeks on an economic
analysis for a project that's very small
that doesn't make a lot of sense because
then you're just increasing the cost of
the investment okay so you've decided
that you're going to do an economic
analysis or a cost-benefit analysis of
some port what are the kind of key steps
you might think about so one would be
assessed the component so this is who
are the stakeholders whether they're
different costs metrics what do you
really want to succeed and how likely is
success then spell out within each of
these what are all the different
cost-benefit metrics that you'll you'll
think of and I'll step through these in
a little more detail collect that data
analyze that data and make the decision
fairly fairly simple but within each of
these it's it's it can be a quite
rigorous process depending on how much
time you want to spend so I you know
said is kind of an example should MSR
invest in research in a new model to
improve software testing ok so I'll kind
of go through here what that might look
like so assess the components what's the
research
aim what's what's the go what's what are
you actually trying to to change what a
success look like who are the
potentially affected steak or so you've
got the staff conducting the research
you've got the staff who develop
software the staff to evaluate software
pre-release and then you've got all the
post release costs then you also have
business customers then you also have
home customers my suggestion here and
this seems very kind of trivial and
simplistic my suggestion here is that
even something that's fairly early stage
kind of a basic research projects to at
least think about all of these potential
stakeholders even if a project seems
like it's it may or may not work in its
very early stage thinking about these
stakeholders could make you decide that
a project isn't worth investing in very
early and then it's money is saved
similarly what are the alternative
investments right so maybe MSR marker
soft more broadly would invest in some
new technology that would potentially
make everyone more productive so
thinking about what else could be
invested in at some level is a useful
way to say is this a good investment so
who are the stakeholders what else could
we do with this money all right so
thinking about the actual cost benefit
metrics underneath that so what are the
explicit metrics for the investment so
you've got the research costs to MSR and
you've got the cost to all the other
staff that might be affected so
developers staff if you have the time
interviewing surveys that sort of thing
to try to get actual data on what that
impact might look like because maybe the
impact is so greater so small that even
if the research is successful it doesn't
matter cost to other groups and this
could be up or down so maybe pre-release
or post release you end up figuring out
during this process of seeing what the
cost of benefits are that it's a reverse
of what you thought right so maybe you
think that the costs of some new testing
architecture would benefit would reduce
pre-release costs maybe it actually
increases pre-release costs same thing
on post release so kind of testing some
of your own assumptions is very
important to making sure that that some
of these early thoughts are useful so
cost of reducing patching costs of
reducing a reduced cost of evaluation
and then also obviously starting to
think about consumer satisfaction
willingness to pay so
you've got more time and effort go in
actually talking to customers if you
don't setting some ranges you know we
think customers might change their kind
of satisfaction willingness to pay by X
percentage if so that makes this
worthwhile here's the threshold we think
we can meet that threshold so coming up
with some metrics to basically help
think through this process even if the
end result is not an in number that says
this is how much the benefits are going
to be if you set some ranges for the
different metrics a different cost
metrics that would affect different
stakeholders that helps your decision
making because maybe you're your best
case scenario is outside of one of those
ranges and you know the process the
investment doesn't make sense ok so then
collecting the data so going out talking
to staff going out calculating salaries
calculating again based on the time
available number of staff involved in
something time spent on things as much
information as you can to understand the
current situation and also what the
situation might look like in the future
and again the deeper you can get into
this the better but that's time spent
right so the more ideally this type of
information is available is readily
available so in these types of projects
or investments are thought about you go
to a kind of central source you get that
data and you can run this fairly quickly
if that's not the case certainly on
salaries that should be the case in
terms of time being spent that's a
little more difficult right you might
you might think you know how long is
being spent on a certain activity it
might be longer it might be shorter it
might be a little more nuanced so those
are things that you would dig into and
then on the benefits side you know some
of those things again are setting ranges
for the potential benefits doing that
from the investment standpoint but also
asking the potentially affected
stakeholders what the benefits they
think they would see and those may match
up they may not and then obviously going
out and talking to at the end whoever
the end user is so be that home users of
some product be that corporate users of
some product going on actually getting
some feedback to again test your
assumptions and and if more time is
available actually coming up with dollar
figures coming up with levels of
satisfaction when
would buy or when they would be more
satisfied or less satisfied and then
what's the likelihood of success that's
the obviously the most difficult
question and and for especially for
smaller investments I'd recommend just
setting setting ranges so if you know if
the likelihood of success were below or
above this range we do it or we won't do
it and then you know in some respect you
have to kind of make a call there but at
least if you have the rest of this
information on what the costs and
benefits would be if successful then you
can make a better decision of what that
threshold should be versus what
traditionally is done in situations like
this a research team might say okay we
think this is a complex problem that
needs to be fixed it's going to cost us
this much to do it and there's this much
likely to success and those are the only
numbers that are that are oftentimes
used in these type of situations but if
you have the actual cost benefit numbers
spelled out you can make a much more
informed decision okay so analyzing the
numbers and this is again a very
simplistic example you know how much the
research project should cost you
separate out different factors of what's
being spent today what's being what the
price of a certain product is and then
you look at how those costs are going to
change how that price is going to change
and you decide you decide how to invest
based on those numbers it's very
simplistic but because each of these
components can be so difficult to to
estimate often times people just scrap
the whole thing whereas if you if you
spend a little time at each one of these
components you really can't improve your
decision-making dramatically okay so
some key takeaways first thing you
should do is make a list of all the
stakeholders all the costs all the
benefit categories and try to make sure
you're not forgetting something think
about who's going to be affected how
they're going to be affected because
normally someone is forgotten about some
type of cost category or potentially
benefit category is not thought about so
as much time as you can spend on
thinking about all those factors you're
only going to benefit the decision
making and the think about what you can
control so some of these assumptions I
talked about there sometimes things that
you really aren't gonna be able to
estimate you shouldn't spend a lot of
time trying to estimate them if it's
you're fairly sure it's going to be a
very long process it looks like I had a
typo on my slide there alright so the
role of government well let me just stop
there any any questions kind of about
just the decision making an investment
decision making process may be a
relatively well when the chances of
success when it's a front group and the
feature centers can be delineated and
scope
customers are here if you think about
the basic research then
much more chaotic process where it's not
even here
so do you see that this paradigm is also
applied in research that's maybe our CIA
sometimes or does rtifi it all this so I
would say the general framework can work
for any project now now in a basic
research project you might not have that
end number what instead you might have
is only a threshold meaning that you are
starting this project and and you still
I would suggest should list off who
might benefit who are the stakeholders
that might benefit and and if the
project if the success of this project
if it's successful and one of those
groups would benefit enough to justify
the investment then then maybe that's
your decision right there but without
thinking about who those customers are
in any fashion I think you're and
certainly the level of the investment
matters as well but I think by thinking
about those customers and thinking about
a low-end if one of them benefits would
that be enough and also thinking about
the negatives right so think about who
would be negatively affected if this is
implemented and whether that negative
impact would be so much that you
shouldn't make the investment so really
setting baseline thresholds of a minimum
level of benefit right and a minimum
level of harm in some sense because some
things are going to negatively affect
certain groups internally and externally
right so so setting minimum benefit
thresholds and and maximum you no harm
thresholds and trying to see if the
investment would fit summer in the
middle that gives you a basic framework
that allows you to think about basic
research with some of these same thought
processes yep sure so in your experience
like what you what you justice
like displayed there's a lot of
estimates going on have in your trains
have you seen groups that go back and
revisit those estimates later to kind of
say okay were we close where we not is
that done and and if if it is what do
you see are they close other mistakes
common common pitfalls that people make
one make adjustments I think it's very
very rare for a private company to do
that because everything's
forward-looking my so Mike I would
certainly say that there would be
benefits to doing that especially larger
decisions I think would greatly benefit
you know obviously a really small
investment decision that you made you
decided to go or no go if you know go
you're not gonna look back at it
probably unless you see an environmental
change but if you if you decide to go
for an investment and either works or
doesn't work and it's large enough I
think there would be a huge benefit
looking backwards and trying to see how
that might affect your future investment
decisions but I haven't talked to many
private companies that are doing that
that the government does and I'll talk a
little bit about some of their looking
backwards and looking forwards but I
think more more private companies could
benefit from that even if it's a simple
simple look right just just a quick look
back and say okay we're some of these
numbers roughly what we thought they
were going to be why might we have
gotten it wrong and then the next
forward-looking decision-making process
can benefit from that okay we'll move
into talking a little bit about the role
for government so first a little bit of
background on on why the government
might be helpful might might be used for
the government to get involved so I'm
going to talk about a few of these
different economic phrases here so cost
externalities if I maintain an incident
gonna use kind of security as an example
to talk through some of these so if I
maintain an insecure secures computer
other people are hurt right so
potentially if my computer is insecure
it might be used to attack other people
but I don't that doesn't hurt me at all
I don't bear any of that cost so because
of those costs that I'm exposed I'm
imposing on people external to myself
that's a cost externality
if the government for example put
attacks on my ISP and said that they had
to help secure me then that would help
to internalize some of those costs so
sometimes that's an example of a role of
the government being involved in
internalizing a cost externality a
pollution is it is a common example of
this right when I pollute something when
I when I run my car unless there's a tax
on on gasoline that tries to internalize
that I'm polluting the larger group the
society but I'm not paying that cost
taxes on gasoline help to internalize
that cost spill overs or network
benefits or another type of market
failure so if ISPs software providers
hardware providers make more secure
products they may not receive all the
benefits so you may create a very secure
product but your customer may not be
willing to pay for it because it made
the benefits may be spilling outside of
an individual customer right so if you
make a Windows more secure for example
it's going to benefit more than just a
single user it's going to benefit other
people that are then not attacked by
that user so he may not be what one user
may not be willing to pay for the costs
that it took to make that more secure
let's see do the up close yeah no
problem and so the government could
potentially subsidize more secure
software x in x and this is just an
example requesting more secure software
themselves being willing to pay a higher
premium so this is kind of the
government as a buyer model the
government did this a little bit with
ipv6 where they said we want products to
have ipv6 we know that could cost a
little bit more we're willing to pay it
so they bear some of the costs of
implementing a new feature and then the
price should eventually drop as the
product is then offered to to a larger
group of people information is a
symmetry so this is essentially saying
that not everyone has the same
information that causes a market failure
so in the
in the example of security consumers
don't always know the cost they are
imposing on other people they also don't
know how to increase their security they
don't know how to compare products which
is more secure which is not so they're
not well informed enough to make a good
decision on the security of products
they're buying software makers don't
have perfect information they know more
about the quality and security of their
products but there's not a good kind of
system in place to allow that
information to be shared so the
government potentially and this hasn't
happened in insecurity in an effective
way but has happened in other ways the
government or nonprofit organizations
can get involved and help to standardize
or provide an evaluation framework so
the comparisons can can happen so UL you
know laboratories is an example of a
nonprofit that helps to kind of put a
stamp on something so that people know
it is it is of a certain quality level
so in security that's something that
people talked about for a while it's
obviously a lot more difficult because
of the change in security environment
but in some sense creating a way to
decrease those information asymmetries
would be useful in matching up the the
supply and demand based on security
features another way to do that to
improve the situation with some people
about education so educating corporate
users but but probably more importantly
small businesses home internet users
about security so that they can make at
least a little bit better informed
decision than they do today because they
would have more information might align
those supply and demand a little bit
better okay and the last one the weakest
models so this is essentially saying
that there are groups particularly in
security home users and small businesses
that are particularly not well-informed
not financially able to invest enough
the costs may regardless of their
knowledge regardless they still may not
have the money they may not have the
resources to be investing for society so
they may invest at a socially sub
optimal level so maybe a role for
government to help these weakest links
by subsidizing in some way
by education something to help bring
their private level investment up to a
level closer to the societal this is
socially optimal level of investment and
so all of these things influence the
market supplied of trust so these are
just some examples of why government
might get involved here's some ways
government's can and get involved so at
the top level you know government could
say industry you are solely responsible
for this that's the regulation model
liability in terms of kind of legal
liability can be imposed which obviously
doesn't exist for software in most
places today but liability can be used
to establish that framework which would
then get insurance involved as well
standards and best practices this is
where NIST gets involved they set
standards and best practices to try to
improve information flows and then
research and development so the
government invests in NIST and other
parts of the government in research and
development to help improve security and
the government as a buyer as I mentioned
where they just say we want secure
software we're willing to pay more for
it please make it more buy it and then
they help create a market that may not
exist for more more secure software so
in this Software Assurance world you
know I think there is a need for
government to stay involved but what
that actually looks like is tricky
regulations are certainly very difficult
they tend to be prescriptive and
flexible insurance markets and liability
legal issues in the software space is
extremely difficult so figuring out what
the government's role is I think the
government as a buyer has worked in some
cases in the past that may be a model
that they want to pursue more right now
though the government is specifically
related to security is looking to get
more involved in what private companies
are doing there several current pieces
of legislation which the government
could have a much larger hand in what
private companies are doing with their
products
so that could be could be coming but I
don't think enough research has been
done on what that exact role should be
so just thinking about kind of some of
the misalignment in the software world
so developers are obviously going to and
this is very simplistic but software
developers are obviously going to supply
what maximizes profits whereas users are
only going to pay enough for what they
perceive as their benefits that exceed
their costs so thinking about these kind
of trade-offs from a social perspective
from a government perspective you want
to create a structure where these things
can align better okay so and I'm going
to get into this a little more at the
back end of the research but there I
think there is a large role particularly
in the security space in the
trustworthiness space quality of
software to do more kind of analysis
both from the private respective but
also from the government perspective for
example what is the total cost of
ownership for users how much does it
cost a user to own a piece of software
to maintain a piece of software what are
the testing costs is costs within an
organization outside an organization by
organization I mean a software producer
software company versus within a user
community winner users or water users
most able to evaluate the time of
purchase this gets in that information
asymmetries problem I talked about so so
not a lot of research has been done
there obviously it's an area that I
think it's very obvious that there's a
lack of information but figuring out how
what information is used how it's used
in other fields I think could benefit
this this field and then what're
developers able to appropriate what type
of how much can you invest and then get
that money back in in trustworthiness
how is that money recouped KenKen
trustworthiness be used simply as a
branding feature is its something that
you then put a stamp on and say we are
secure or is it better as a separate
business of services model that sort of
thing so thinking about those issues
from an economic standpoint I think is a
useful way to think about
trustworthiness from the private
perspective
so questions yeah so what and part of
that model is such as the easy way to
distribute the software but another is
also to establish trust I think
competitors that have a very good job
and their app stores to make sure that
software has a certain quality and
others don't have the same kind of rigor
in their acceptance process and you see
in something and many more software
failing which yeah leads then to list
that there's no longer trust in a new
platform have you looked into the change
that comes with learning to the rise of
extras how that changes with respect to
trust and knowledge yeah so I I haven't
I can't say that I've actually done done
research in the area I will say though
that this the app motto is obviously
creating much faster reactions so if you
if i install windows on my computer it
would take me a long time many crashes
probably before i decide that i might
want a different platform whereas with
it with a nap the numbers i've heard are
somewhere between kind of two and three
times something crashes or something
doesn't work and i'm going to give up on
a nap so the the timelines on on for
something to work are dramatically
shorter with a particularly a free app
you know given that a lot of apps or
free a paid app it's a little bit longer
people willing to to stick with
something a little bit longer but it
definitely changes changes this this
whole model dramatically and i don't
think there's you know there there's
some you know daddy you can get from
these app stores to kind of understand
how long how long people keep a product
before they stop using it that sort of
thing but i haven't done done more
research into that area any other
questions on role of government right
someone jump into to some of the studies
we've done a little bit about kind of
NIST and other govern agencies are like
this but some of the kind of ways they
use economic analysis to think about
their planning so one is strategic
planning what we do in the future or i
guess i will start the left side here so
what's the role of kind of policy
analysis when should miss get involved
in something so what is the economic
rationale for NIST to play a role in
something so they do studies and kind of
think about why the government should
get into a certain space that's kind of
step 1 once you've decided there is a
role for government a certain space you
do kind of strategic planning what
should that role look like what are kind
of the potential benefits of going after
a certain space so for example we're
doing a study right now for NIST on
cybersecurity looking at
from this perspective where should they
invest their dollars to potentially have
the greatest economic impact right so
not just one of the most complex
problems not what do they want to work
on not what are they being asked for but
where specifically if they solve problem
a B C or D where could they have the
greatest economic impact on industry and
on society so and then after they kind
of use that in terms of actually making
investments this does work on on
retrospective analyses they look
backwards and say we invested in this
standard this new policy this new
standard practice what was the benefit
did it actually benefit people the way
we thought it would did it not should we
invest in something more in this area so
they have a very kind of cyclical
analysis they don't do this for every
investment they make but they pick and
choose investments to do this and I
think this is structure even thinking
back to some of the kind of private
investment ideas I talked about before
even if you don't have time to do this
in a very rigorous manner thinking about
investments in this fashion I think is
very useful you know starting with my
private standpoint why do we want to
invest in this you know a very basic
question but you know making sure you
have a clear definition of why you want
to invest in something making sure you
have a clear definition of who would
benefit and who would would be
negatively impacted by a decision then
you make the investment based on that
determination then afterwards saying did
we did we do a good job there and not
doing that with every single investment
but but picking investments of a certain
level and doing that I think would have
great benefit to private organizations I
think and and certainly missed i think
has has really bought into this model
and does a lot of work in this area i
had hoped actually that greg tassie the
chief economist sadness was going to be
able to join me today but he wasn't able
so hopefully he'd like to come back and
maybe make another presentation to you
all in the future but i'll talk about a
few studies that we've done for nest
that that fit into these two boxes so
two of them are retrospective and one of
them well ipv6 was kind of a mixture
prospective retrospective role-based
access control was retrospective and
then software testing
a study that I think will will be
particularly of interest despite it
being a little bit old was perspective
you know what's the what's the potential
benefit of changing the software testing
framework so I'll go through the first
two relatively quickly spend most of the
time on the software testing study so
ipv6 we were asked by Department of
Commerce the NTIA and and NIST to
conduct an economic impact assessment of
ipv6 we went out to both the software
community hardware community to
understand what the cost of actually
implementing ipv6 would be so how much
would it cost for ipv6 be integrated
into current products or future products
and services and then also went out to
users and asked them about the adoption
costs on their side we also talked about
what some that benefits would be the
benefits were a little more speculative
particularly because security was one of
the benefits that that was talked about
the other benefits included kind of
reductions in certain networking costs
that companies might have as well as on
the the production side hardware
software producers might have lower
costs of maintaining products once ipv6
is fully adopted and so the numbers we
calculated it was a fairly fairly easy
decision that ipv6 was a good decision
for society now this does not mean that
any individual organization sees a
positive return on investment from ipv6
what this means as a society we found
that it made sense for ipv6 long term it
doesn't mean there weren't going to be
lots of potential problems in the short
term security problems and other
problems but what we found is in a base
case which means but we heard that
people were saying how they were going
to start implementing ipv6 starting in
2005 over the next five or six years as
well as an accelerated case in which
they did a little bit faster we found it
would cost about 25 million to implement
ipv6 within a base case and 76 million
if we ramped up all the time lines by a
couple years and they tried to do it
faster for the most part it seems like
every product these days you know
looking backwards on this study has ipv6
integrated the use is still not as high
as people were saying it was going to be
at that point so that's one of the
studies we did which you know we were
looking kind of forward and haven't done
a backwards look but i think you know be
interesting to kind of look backwards
and see how some of this is actually
panned out our back we actually did a
study on role-based access control in
2002 that was mainly prospective and
then came back and did one for nest and
2010 that would mainly retrospective and
and largely the benefits ended up being
much greater than we then we originally
anticipated in 2002 role-based access
control if you're not familiar is a way
that organizations can decide how to
provide access to different resources
than an organization based on their
roles it has a whole framework for how
this works lots of products and services
have been kind of built on the are back
framework and so we went out and
surveyed organizations that create those
software packages as well as
organizations that use them to find out
what the benefits of the are back
framework existing to the companies that
made products as well as users of our
back and if our back didn't exist how
when some of these things might have
happened without nist's involvement in
our back because before our back some of
these kind of processes we're happening
on their own so we try as much as
possible to to not just say for example
our back versus know our back we try to
say okay if our back didn't exist what
would have happened otherwise some type
of role management would have happened
anyway so it's not just this baseline of
no role management versus our bag we try
to set a baseline of something that
would have taken a little bit longer to
establish versus nest investing in our
back and what that ended up doing and we
found a pretty enormous benefit of six
billion dollars from the are back
standard itself about a billion of which
was attributable to NIST based on their
level of investment as compared to other
people's investment of time and
resources and that sort of thing so a
quite a large benefit from that
investment that they made alright so
moving moving to sure so
our bag hasn't been
why if in terms of the net benefit is so
astonishing good why is the doctrine and
so yes so again some of these benefits
are totally accrued by by an individual
organization right so so different
organizations different players tend to
benefit more so this doesn't mean and I
don't have the break out of this but a
lot of the benefits did go to some of
the makers of the products right so they
so an individual company and this is
aggregated across all us organizations
right so an individual company adopting
our back may not see an enormous benefit
it may be relatively small when you add
it up across all industries it becomes
very large but for an individual company
the more they may have they may roll
management doesn't work in every company
right if you have an organization that's
very that has lots of roles as many
roles people change roles frequently
it's not a very systematic way of kind
of just in different kind of employment
categories auerbach doesn't work as well
so number one you have our backs doesn't
work in some places number two where it
does work it may not be an enormous
benefit to an individual company it may
be an incremental benefit or they may
not see all the benefits themselves
that's the other thing is is in this and
this goes back to the kind of investment
decision-making we talked about before
sometimes people don't see all the costs
and benefits of of an investment so they
may just be thinking about this is this
is typical who would implement or by
could be an IT group so that I t group
may simply be thinking if we adopted our
back it might reduce a little bit of our
cost but they're not thinking about the
users outside of their organizations so
for example if our back were implemented
it may be easier for me as a staff in
that organization to access resources
without without having to ask five
people to get that access but the IT
analysis of whether to use our back is
not going to incorporate that right so
it's there are a lot of reasons those
are just a few yeah okay so let me talk
through this study on software testing
so basically NIST came to us and said
it seems like software testing doesn't
always work there are a lot of bugs
after a product is released where are
some of the cost borne within companies
and for people that have thought a lot
about this within your company some of
these numbers may not seem that shocking
particularly on the software development
side we also collected some of the users
side that may be more of interests but
this was interested in both this was
interested in what are the costs within
an organization how do they change as
you go farther along the development
process once a product is released what
are the costs where the you know what
others look like for users so we went
out and collected information on both
sides so similar what I was talking
about with our back we do this kind of
counter factual scenario what's going on
today where current types of investment
today we did kind of a hypothetical
improvement so we said we kind of
shifted and I'll show you what this
means we shifted some of the times in
which different bugs might be found
marginally and then we shifted it you
know much more significantly to the very
front end of development to look at kind
of a half way case in a perfect world
you might say development case in terms
of wind bugs are found so are those were
kind of counterfactuals the what-if
scenarios we worked with for both of
those we collected information from
developers on how that would affect
their costs as well as from users in
terms of if fewer bugs came out within a
software product how that would affect
their their costs and then we for this
we talked to specifically the automotive
and aerospace industries and financial
services on the user side and then talk
to software developers obviously on on
their side okay so very basic analysis
of software incentive incentive
structure for software companies again
this is information that I'm sure is
obviously pretty straightforward for you
all this is how you make money you know
maximizing revenue keeping testing low
keeping production low and maximizing
you know keeping after sales low as
possible right so maximizing on it so we
wanted to look into each of these pieces
and see how they were changed by
winbugs are introduced and when bugs are
fixed okay a little bit more and i might
breeze through this but this is again
just kind of some background on the
marginal cost of finding stuff on going
after bugs and when they're found wind
costs are incurred how that affects
sales prices so the kind of marginal
cost and marginal benefits both to
software makers but also to end-users so
we as we talked with different software
makers and end-users we made sure we had
some of this kind of conceptual
background before we went into things
and understanding i think these the gaps
between what a consumer would want
versus what the company wants is
something i think that it's still an
existing question for debate I think
understanding these issues is something
that I think more has been done since we
did this study but I think some of the
kind of thought processes and the
conceptual frameworks are still more
work needs to be done okay so defining
these two counterfactual scenarios one
is this enhanced framework of reducing
it or making sure errors are found
sooner in users experience a reduced
number of errors so so on the software
testing side we say you find things a
little bit faster but end users still
have some problems then we looked at
kind of a perfect infrastructure testing
situation where all errors are found in
a same development stage in which
they're introduced oh whatever
development stage that is there always
found in that stage this is obviously
perfect world and probably extremely
expensive than in years experience no
errors right so what are the total cost
that end-users are currently spending on
fit you know dealing with bugs okay so
some of the basic assumptions you know
the same number of bugs still occurs we
could have assumed based on what was
going on in 2002 that there wouldn't be
some major trend changes and bugs right
me some major trend changes so we kind
of said we're going to look at today and
what's been happening in the past year
similarly the improved infrastructure we
said that didn't change if you improve
the image doesn't change location where
the bugs are introduced they're still
gonna be bugs introduced in each phase
so we're just talking about win
they're going to be fixed when they're
going to be solved and so we set up
those two scenarios i talked about
improved infrastructure and what we call
it a perfect infrastructure ok so as we
went out we tried to find out the
distribution of where those bugs are
found we try to determine the cost of
finding them and fixing them and
figuring out kind of a cost as a
function of how long it takes to find
the bug and I'll kind of skip through
some of this ok and these are and I'm
sure some of this has has changed but
these are kind of the broad categories
of development of software that we use
to establish wind bugs may be introduced
and when they should be fixed or when
they could be fixed so this is that the
the model that we developed based on
interviews with companies working in the
software field and then I'll show kind
of moving forward what we heard in terms
of wind bugs are actually introduced and
when they're solved ok so the total
cumulative distribution of error
detection here obviously it grows very
dramatically fairly quickly within kind
of the implementation unit testing
stages what we heard through our through
our interviews and surveys excuse me and
then kind of levels off and then
obviously there there are some bugs that
happen after release and this framework
is is aggregating software development
very broadly versus being very
disaggregated ok so this is typically
what we what we heard in terms of the
types of software we were looking at
where different testing costs were being
incurred within an organization so the
costs if you look on the left there you
have the average cost per bug it goes up
over time the farther you get along the
process and then the distribution of
where bugs are actually detected so this
is kind of the framework we came up with
and once we had some of these basic
assumptions once we had kind of cost per
bug where it happened the distribution
of when it happened we could then
basically run all of our analyses on how
this could change right how the
different cost frameworks which could
change so there's my tables will kind of
go
through what we saw so we said okay in
this kind of better this improved
implementation scenario we just shifted
all these curves right so if you found
things a little bit faster you could
lower costs by by a certain amount and
and thus overall potentially reduce your
costs of detecting those bugs and this
is a combined you're seeing a kind of a
combined cost of your you're spinning
less when you find it earlier but then
your end user is also incurring less
cost because there are fewer bugs coming
out of the system so the 15 percentage
man so these are these don't don't
necessarily mean that that these time
that these phases are taking longer the
the horizontal here is the percentage of
where bugs are detected so that's not
time necessarily right so that's that's
a fraction of the where bugs are found
so what you're doing is you're making a
higher percentage is found earlier in
the development process right okay and
so you know essentially we want to kind
of think about what so we kind of dug
into this you the user side of things I
think this is an area that that more
work needs to be done on but what would
it were the actual user costs right what
how does the user how's user impacted by
not having having buggy software so they
have to have they have favored cost
obviously something breaks their system
goes down what that does to them they
also need to have redundant systems in
case those failures happen so they're
kind of a variety of costs and pulling
all those together in terms of
understanding willingness to pay for
reductions in bugs conceptually is
fairly straightforward now actually
figured out what people willing to pay
is much more complicated for for
increasing the quality of software okay
so what we found in terms of time being
spent so this is the hours to fix a bug
based on the point of introduction so on
the left you see the where our bug was
found on the right or top there you see
this excuse me the left you see where it
was introduced the top you see where it
was found and you see the time it took
to actually fix a bug so as you see it
go kind of grows over time based on how
long it took to find a problem okay this
is given that a bug was found where was
introduced right so obviously if you
introduced it in requirements one
hundred percent its founding requirement
so this is a breakout of where things
were found so we take these numbers and
we basically start kind of adjusting
them and seeing what the economic impact
is whether whether that's an economic
impact that is feasible or not kind of
coming up with ranges of what those
impacts would be so okay so here's
here's our scenario so we see kind of
where where bugs are found we have some
of the numbers i showed you on how the
different costs relate to those areas so
we came up with this improved
infrastructure and this perfect world
infrastructure so improved
infrastructure you see some of the we
basically find things a little bit
earlier that ends up shifting the
average because we know that how much
time it takes to take up a bug to find a
bug within each of these areas when
you're the cost per bug and hours for
using these areas so we can come up with
an average number of hours to fix a bug
and so if we improve the the
infrastructure marginally you see a
reduction if you go to a perfect
infrastructure you see a much larger
reduction so again you this is that you
all these numbers up here at the top
because these are you know just just set
numbers of testers salaries certain
things but down here at the bottom you
have a percentage reduction in the
average hours per bug right and so the
savings ends up being quite a bit for
developers in terms of cost savings for
finding things a little bit earlier it's
a very simplistic situation here okay so
this is where we went out and looked at
in user side so we looked at air major
errors minor errors we looked at
decision costs we looked at installation
cost maintenance costs redundant systems
costs and kind of added up how much
banks spend in the financial services
sector on dealing with potential bugs
potential errors so this is a breakout
of what they were able to estimate again
this is back in 2002 I'm sure the
numbers would be where I would think
they would be a little bit lower at this
point but you can see where they where
most of the costs are major errors
comprise a large majority of the costs
you see a little bit of difference with
banks and credit unions but pretty
significant costs that there that they
are seen on software developers and
users within the financial services
sector I'm you can go find this whole
report online and it's it has a lot more
information on each of these different
sectors if you want to take into it but
I fold out put out a few key numbers
here so if you move to this kind of
better system you start to see well I
guess the way this is set up I'm sorry
on the left here this is the total cost
of an inadequate software testing
infrastructure so what this means is no
errors go out to end user so end users
you see the numbers there at the bottom
of seven or 89 million and 216 millions
are if in user salt no errors no bugs
because the total cost that they spend
on bugs up in the software developers
side there's the cost that were
estimated with router and switch
developers and with Clearinghouse
software developers in terms of how much
they could save if they then started
doing testing in earlier phases and then
over here to the right this is kind of
the marginally improved system so suffer
developers look and try to do things a
little bit earlier in the process so
some of their costs are reduced on the
user's side the cost reductions are
smaller because you're still reducing
errors it's just a smaller number of
errors that actually get out so again
for a company like Microsoft the
software developer numbers it's not as
simple a story right these guys
especially back in 02 they had very
i would say kind of unsophisticated
software testing processes right so
simply thinking about where they were
putting their software testing costs
they could vary dramatically start to
see it change and they and they start
making changes after this study that's
obviously something that's very
different within Microsoft I feel you
know pretty comfortable that you guys
are calculating these costs and probably
have a pretty good sense of where those
numbers are but the user side is an area
that I think still is very not well
understood in terms of software users
and what their potential impact of bugs
are how that changes in terms of when
they're introduced how they're
introduced both for home users of any
type of software products as well as
corporate users and the framework I
think here still still fits okay so
future research needs so these are just
a few thoughts on kind of software
quality software security that may be of
interest so as I mentioned before I
think kind of total cost of ownership
for users is an area that needs a good
bit of work the incentive structure the
cost structure for software developers
and companies which which is very
different right a software developer may
not feel the incentive that the whole
company feel is for investing in in
additional testing in additional coding
and then thinking about kind of
information and risk issues let me step
through each of these a little bit so
total cost of ownership so what are the
costs to the user of an adequate
software if you don't have good software
what does that actually mean to an end
user what what can I do what don't I do
as an individual if I don't have good
software how does that change what I'm
doing in terms of services I might
interact with both provided by the same
company provided by other companies how
does that impact how does that impact me
as a company in terms of what I'm able
to do if something crashes what is that
does that mean I lose business that mean
I I'm not as productive what are the
different impacts there and then
generally how much people are willing to
pay you know what is the cost of more
secure higher quality software what are
people willing to pay to get more secure
or higher quality software so digging
into that further you know taking
business activities and productivity and
saying we're going to hold those things
constant and then thinking about what
the different cost categories currently
are of owning software right so you have
to search for software and that because
some company spent a lot of time on this
they pay companies like Gartner and
other companies like that to understand
more about you know how good somebody's
software is and is it going to be better
and should i wait or should i buy now
that's actually a huge amount of money
that companies spend simply on searching
right so can that be reduced by some
change in quality or some change and
information flows the actual person to
purchase and license fee obviously may
go up should go up if quality is
increased then additional support fees
so most companies obviously are charging
their end user some type of support fee
for working with them could those go up
could those go down if the purchase
price your license for you goes up so
for for users thinking about kind of
what all these costs are and testing
that's what we talked about before kind
of what people are spending when they
have problems you know testing
beforehand certain companies spend lots
of time testing products before they
even release them to their staff and
then obviously fixing problems after
they they come back integration issues
maintenance issues indirect costs so if
I as RTI if we adopt some new software
and it causes us something not to work
and we can't provide our customers some
product or service in a timely fashion
we look bad that makes us then think
badly about the the software that we
purchased so reputation risks for the
company as well as for the software that
they purchase that they may blame so
thinking about the benefits side is
quite difficult thinking about all these
costs of owning software is is at least
fairly simple to list to list all the
different factors estimating it isn't
totally simple but but is something that
can be done estimating the benefits can
be can be trucked quite difficult so if
I'm more productive if my if software X
moves faster if there are fewer clicks
for me to get to
what I want if I can implement some new
product faster if I can purchase another
piece of software that I couldn't have
purchased because this core software is
better those are much more difficult
things for users to analyze and for
companies selling software to users to
analyze but particularly productivity is
something that I think can be assessed
but software companies aren't doing that
and neither are end-users largely I
think companies that are adopting
software are doing it out of an IT
framework and many of them are not
thinking much about the impact on their
users so that's something that I think
software companies could do a better job
of saying if you buy this software not
only will it save uit costs it will save
your customers X number of minutes hours
per day that they currently spend
because something's not working well X
number of minutes hours per year when
something crashes so communicating those
those benefits especially the corporate
users is something that I think could be
done much better helping corporate user
think about the whole process of their
total cost of ownership because largely
they think about it an IT framework and
thus software makers do as well but I
think selling more secure software
selling higher quality software should
entail convincing and talking to buyers
about what those total benefits might
look like ok and this can be thought of
so willingness to pay this can be
thought of from a business standpoint as
well as from from an individual
standpoint thinking about actually how
much people are willing to pay for more
secure software and what features or
higher quality software that may include
security and what features of quality
people are actually willing to pay more
or less for is security something that
people care about does do they know
enough about it to care do they care
about something running more efficiently
understanding exactly what different
types of end-users are willing to pay or
what the benefits would be
to them of adding new features that are
part of additional quality is is
something that that's needed more from
the software standpoint but also needed
more from from companies themselves
because again they do so many things
from the IT standpoint they don't always
know how much their users may or may not
benefit from additional security so
thinking through those issues and there
may be a role for government here in
terms of particularly security i talked
about i'm certainly not a proponent of
just slapping regulation on to something
because there's certainly a lot of
consequences to doing that but there
could be a role particularly as i talked
about before government has a buyer for
example the government could request and
they're doing this right now more secure
systems more secure software to help pay
for some of the rd work that companies
would need to do to make a security
excuse me make software higher quality
possibly more secure so that then that
could filter down to other customers and
then thinking about what the what the
trade-offs are so you know how much
might bright half-priced have to
increase from a software maker what do
you lose by being first to market right
so you may have some product or some
feature you want to release if you
release it too soon it may not be as
high quality but you may get some users
out of it you know thinking back to to
the kind of app model that's forcing
people to to use something and maybe
drop it faster if it's what's the kind
of quality threshold that someone's
willing to accept before they drop you
and move on to somebody else so thinking
about all the trade-offs between price
per first to market and quality a lot
more needs to be done there to
understand from both the user standpoint
what they should do but also from the
software developer standpoint what makes
sense and there's no no
one-size-fits-all for this every product
line I think is going to differ every
customer line is going to differ which
makes this a very complicated stamp
issue however if you think about all
these factors within each of your
product lines I think you'll uncover
some things that may not have
currently been thought about okay so
software developers what's the cost
structure what does it cost actually if
more higher quality software were
desired if more secure software more
desired what exactly would that look
like how much does it cost in terms of
testing that's where thing I think these
are things you all probably have quite a
good handle on but if not should for
each of your product lines understanding
what all the different cost breakouts
are and how those different cost
breakouts could be tweaked so it doesn't
mean you just have to say we're going to
increase the quality of software there
may be a certain piece where it's it's
cost effective to increase the level of
quality within some certain testing
component development component that may
meet that got the users willingness to
pay right so you may be able to match up
the willingness to pay with a specific
increase in quality but it may not be
that everybody needs to increase what
they're doing okay and then thinking
about this from a corporate perspective
you know how do you make sure you're
going to keep customers how do you going
to make sure you're going to keep
partners and relationships by your level
of quality so it's not just the purchase
decision of we want somebody to buy our
product it's now we don't want them to
drop our product we don't want this
institution to drop our product we don't
want this partner who sells our product
to drop our product how do we figure
that out so it's not just what are the
time what's the time that's being
imposed on an end-user how do we
minimize that it's when the people think
about switching products and when do
they win two partners think about
switching vendors they're working with
so those are obviously very complicated
decisions that I think quite a bit of
work needs to be done on from from an
external perspective not a lot of
researches is really done in two has
been done in the quality kind of
trade-off standpoint both from companies
perspectives as well as users
perspectives and then finally think
about somethings rich excuse me
information risk issues that I've kind
of talked about throughout throughout
the discussion here how can we improve
information
flos this is a role I think that
software makers can do a better job of I
know it's a little tricky because if you
for example put a stamp on your product
you introduce the possibility of
liability issues coming into to the
situation and courts may be getting more
involved in they are now which could be
problematic but thinking about ways to
better inform users about the quality
you're providing even if you're not
providing a perfect product I think
would only benefit software companies
because right now there is not a lot of
information flow I think that creates a
lot of creative a user side a lot of
thought that companies are just pushing
out buggy software without a lot of
thought so increased information flows
and understanding doing more kind of
analysis of those communications doing
kind of surveys and interviews to
understand even if you're not going to
change the quality of a product how can
you communicate better the quality of
that product in a way the customers
understand that the price they're paying
is an appropriate price or if they'd be
willing to pay more for that product if
it were more secure so understanding
those trade-offs understand how to
communicate better is a role that I
think the whole software industry needs
to better job of is there a role for
third parties in terms of analyzing
evaluating software quality software
security and what might that be is there
a role for government helping in that
and then are there kind of licensing
models that could be changed so you know
software company like Microsoft licenses
their their product to an end user and
there's normally kind of a service
agreements right to come along with that
if the product went out more secure
would companies be incentivized to pay
more so looking at but you know kind of
not just how much companies willing to
pay but the total cost of ownership for
companies in terms of both licensing as
well as services as well as their
internal cost structure thinking about
that from both sides is something that
needs to be done more and I think that's
all I've got hopefully em hit about
right my 45 minute
time here so additional questions on and
we asked a few coming through I don't
think we can get some from anybody else
watching but you guys have additional
questions here in the room so what you
spoke a lot about security there's a lot
about the implication for privacy of
users have you looked into that space
for example many people believe that we
are to restrict one privacy
our head markets doesn't work in our ad
market center subsidizing substance the
free software that we use in our search
engine
so how does such as privacy get into
this
yeah I mean I think there have been
quite a few examples where companies
have not been clear enough and there's
been a pretty significant backlash so I
think I think if you I think information
sharing and clarity is is is the
solution if individuals know that their
information is going to be used and thus
they're getting something for free or
something in a lower price most research
that's been done suggests that lots of
users would be willing to allow that
would be willing to allow some of their
information to be used in some way not
always but some ways to be able to have
a free or reduced-price so i think it's
i think it's all about information and
clarity I think any model could work I
think some countries are being a little
too restrictive on what can be done with
data because I think that what should be
done is it should be communicated what's
being done with your data and then users
should be allowed to decide whether they
want that and want the benefits cost
free that sort of thing that comes along
with it or not I think that's the
perfect situation my mind
so for example today the default is
so right now there's a new dog track
initiative that's going on it seems like
we're getting towards this the solution
that the user will have the ability to
opt out give me leave today you know
user doesn't even know I the information
are being subsumed or being taken by the
ad network by the advertisers and now
there's going to be a button than saying
that you want the user may be present to
now on retract what would be the writing
fault and what you know what they
thought would be acceptable in some of
these scenarios there is also the
question is is the user who wants the
privacy or is the add you know privacy
advocate groups or is it the government
yeah it's tricky because when you ask
users they want total control right so
that is pretty clear research on users
want to be in crow and control of their
information so I I think it seems fairly
likely that the legal and regulatory
frameworks that are kind of moving in a
certain direction are going to give
users the majority of the control the
issue is communicating the benefits of
allowance right so I think users when
you give somebody an opt out and say do
you want your information to be shared
most I think the research has been done
shows that most people are going to say
no I don't want my information to be
shared but if you communicate what you
get out of sharing it you get more
tailored products you get a free product
you get a highly integrated product
something like that I think I think so i
think companies that are using data
today on the web within products where
they're tracking things that sort of
thing i think a lot of work needs to be
done to be very specific very clear
about why you should say yes because if
not most people are going to say no and
you're going to see some dramatic shifts
in revenue streams very quickly for
companies that rely on that rely on ads
and you and I mean I've seen in my own
interactions with with different web
services that companies are doing more
of that so certain web companies are
saying you know you want to allow us to
do this because it lets us Taylor this
more for you and so I think that message
is getting out to users so the the kick
reaction of not allowing your
information we use may may be changing
so two years ago if you asked it I think
the vast majority of people would say no
I know what my information to be used
today it may be a little bit different
because people are starting to feel I
think a little bit more in control and
they're also starting to see the
benefits so I think that communication
needs to continue to get the balance
right but I think that it seems like the
government kind of regulatory and legal
frameworks are definitely moving in the
direction of giving most of the control
users
tricky for the user to actually
understand indications you know how much
their data work and where the data is
going
whoo-hoo they really trust us
even if
so I mean even presenting all those
information to the user and can be
tricky when it does it mean yeah so I
feel it feels like the industry it's
coming to this junction point now I
think that's right I think you're
exactly right and I think as much as you
can like I said jump in front of it and
try different ways of communicating
right try different strategies and see
how people react see if you can change
people's opt-in or opt-out by different
communication models I yeah I mean
that's how it seems today is that that's
the direction thanks you're heading into
it's not as much you know is that the
right direction it's more of how do we
deal with the fact that things are going
that direction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
