you
I'm John Boylan I'm recently come into
to help coordinate some of the studio 99
projects and you probably seen you you
will probably see more of me this
afternoon we have Laurie Frick who is a
data artist has been working as an
artist for I guess almost ten years and
deals a lot with with a data about the
self and self tracking data lives in
Austin works in New York and and
recently was featured in an article in
the Atlantic which I believe I don't
know if that was an invitation or not
but it's easy to find it was a good it
was a good it was a good a good portrait
in any case I'm not going to stand up
here too long and we'll just say welcome
to Laurie have you ever thought about
what's known about you you're you not
just not just if you google yourself and
it's like right here's what's public but
what's you know some of the juicy stuff
like every time you've ever used your
credit card or every video you've ever
watched or maybe you know every time you
swiped your ID here on campus every
single time every you know Itzik how I
work with self tracking data and it was
a couple years ago and I thought all
right what's really known about me
privacy was starting to really heat up
and I started to make a list you know in
real quantified self fashion I you know
I scored it from one to five depending
how public how private and I you know
hundreds I mean if you really hundreds
and hundreds of things and every couple
days I think of something else you know
it's just I'm recently I realized amazon
knows how fast i read a book
they know if I cheat if I read the end
right and so you can kind of get creeped
out by this but I actually looked at
this list and I thought it's kind of a
like more compelling more complex more
thorough view of myself than I can even
remember and so it's some of this it's
caught me to really see that maybe this
data that everything that's collected
about you all the surveillance all this
stuff can start to be a way to see the
hidden part of you and so I'm on a
mission to to get you to think about
your data in a totally new way so I've
got 20 minutes to convince you and let
me just start by explaining I'm a data
artist and I make hand-built work from
data you know so I counted i measure it
I chopped it up a lot of it starts you
know digitally I use data viz vigil is
tools I'm super hyper organized and I
have a background in tech I have a whole
nother life I have been to this campus
in another life I have pitched Bill
Gates in another life I have been here
so let me let me just tell you a story
and it's kind of the story of how I came
to this and it all started with time I
you know as a few years ago and felt
like something had really shifted you
know everything started to feel like all
these little bits of time and there was
a writer Linda stone and she describes
it as continuous partial attention and
it really describes like everything was
in these tiny little chunks and so I was
starting to make work based on that
little bits of imagined time forward
backward and I always thought like the
perfect painting was 24 hours right you
get if you think of it like it's a
metaphor for a day these big quiet areas
of sleep and then you have this like
perfect then you have this ugly argument
then you have the boring part where
you're sitting in your car and and I
knew that if you really want to study
something you need to measure it so I
thought all right I'm going to buckle
and really measure my own time and I
started and I don't know if anybody
who's anybody it's really hard and out
he was really amateurish attempt so I
googled it you know how do you measure
and I found been lip quits and Ben has
been measuring every bit of his time
every one of those horizontals is 24
hours and he's put since 2005 he's put
it all online and I'm sorry holy
this looks like this looks exactly like
the way I imagined time all these little
bits I mean it turns I've now become
friends with them he's developers
parents are neuroscientist he has a
whole theory about why he's doing this
but I I didn't even hesitate I just I
scraped his data and I started to make
drawings from it you know based on real
time and then I started to chop it up
right color coded and you know at the
same time I mean I really love this but
Marco but I really wanted to measure
something of me and I knew that right
measuring time is really you know hard
but I use same time I had this consumer
tech new products background and I
thought all the sensors this is all
going to get much easier and my net very
next i bought a co which so sad they've
gone out of business it's a little dry
EEG sensor and it measures your sleep
and I thought this is so easy I couldn't
write I can measure all my time right
when I'm asleep in bed I don't actually
have to do anything and I was really
surprised as I started measuring sleep
so each one of these verticals is the
night of sleep I mean the first thing
was sleep is not so different waking
sleeping it's all in these little five
and ten minute bits it's really similar
I'd always heard the sleep cycles were
these big 90 minute chunks it turns out
no waking sleeping not so different and
I was also really was kind of taken
aback I mean you don't really know it's
one of these hidden things about you you
go to bed eleven o'clock you wake up at
seven you think you got 80 or sleep but
you don't remember I mean I don't
remember anything and you know it was
this moment where I had a thought I was
this really good sleeper and it it was a
moment where I realized I wasn't the
person I thought I was it turns out I'm
a terrible sleeper and I you know I was
like I was I was kind of isn't he was
right I'm measuring it's real data it's
about me and it turns out I'm bad at
something which was sort of not my
nature I was like you know I'm
accomplished I could get but it was a
moment where data was kind of you have
to really confront it and it was kind of
it was sort of this weird conflict I was
sorting out and so then I got really
really really interested in sleep and
realized everything good happens when
you sleep you know people talk about you
know I'm a power sleep or only need four
hours it's horrible everything good
that's when if you're sick it's when you
get better you're on a diet it's when
you metabolize carbs if you're a little
kid it's when you grow it's how you
reorganize long-term memory I mean
everything good happens when you sleep
so I when I was pretty into it and I
started to really come up with this
whole system for sleep so I created
these rules so I had a rule system so
red is the deep sleep and yellow is
awake and I pink is REM sleep and I took
all the light sleep which is really
trashley full
it up by the way and got rid of it and I
put all right so these all these rules
like little art algorithms and I put it
in a show in Los Angeles and it was kind
of a big moment because it got a big fat
review in the LA Times and then it got
picked up in New Scientist and engadget
and Boing Boing and it went all right
all over the net and write all these
reviews if you know zipping around and
the guys at Zeile right that made this
little sleep device they saw this the
right they saw the reviews online and
they send me a note Lori love your work
what can we do to help you and I said
send me more data and it was the first
time that I could compare my sleep so
before I had it vertical I've switched
its horizontal every single one of those
horizontal is a night of sleep just like
a month of sleep from each and it was
the first time I could see other people
sleep and I realized they were very
individual it's like a fingerprint you
know and so you're actually looking
purple is the really good stuff that's
deep sleep orange is waking up and you
can start to see people have a very I
mean look at this poor guy I realize
like and you know and so I asked the
research guys at z 0 and they said oh
yeah yeah yeahs very identifiable sleep
is very unique you know I can exactly I
can see your sleep I know exactly who
that is and you know it was funny it was
the right about this time I am I'm
wearing this thing on my floor I have a
thousand nights of sleep data we're in
this thing I my forehead and I didn't
want to be the only one that was jumping
into bed every night so I got one for my
husband you know ding and he goes I'm a
terrible sleeper i have insomnia and he
wears at the very first night and he
scores 140 I didn't even think it went
over 100 I'm scoring like in the 60s and
right so it turns out you know he he
sleeps great most the time and every now
and then it's horrible but he only
remembered the bad
and I thought that's so him that's like
that's so him right so he has this huge
standard deviation I have a very narrow
standard deviation and I thought it's
not only like a fingerprint what if it
actually is measuring his like
personality so I doubled down and
decided alright this is so cool I mean
I'm going to measure everything I'm
gonna so I really started measuring
things like the sleep like the zio if I
could live in the future particularly
things that are really easy you know
it's living in the time where it's just
ambient data things are going to be
collected about you internet of things
right everything that I'm doing is just
going to be automatically so how can I
live in that world so I got a Wi-Fi
scale I spit in a tube I got my DNA
right i log all the time on my computer
i put apps on my phone I mean anything i
could find and there's I mean this is
sort of a short list otherwise I look
crazy and I decided to use myself for
research and in really pay attention
right I'm measuring this how does it
feel and there's a tradition of artists
both using themselves for their work but
you know sometimes artists have the you
know they've anticipated a scientific
breakthrough where art precedes science
and I I have a fantasy that some of this
is going to really prove out but I but
artists can also imagine themselves
through research they get to make stuff
up that's their job and so I decided to
really watch notice pay attention and I
studied patterns in the data right so
this is you know it's human data pulled
out and I started to see it was sort of
these rhythms of me almost like a neural
fibonacci right the patterns the
proportions of me played back to me and
at the beginning I was really convinced
i'm going to you know cause and effect
i'm going to be able to correlate this
many steps you know i slept this much I
weigh this much even if there was a lag
effect I was pretty sure I was going to
figure it all there now it turns I mean
humans are really
a noisy like really noisy data objects
it's not so I kind of let go of the
cause and effect it's very hard and I
thought well let me just look at the
pattern let me just look at the patterns
themselves it's me reflected back to me
and I started to think of them as data
portraits there are comments kind of
joking the column data selfie so I'm
really you know and I realized it's sort
of this there's a familiarity there's a
fluency to it and I started to see the
data okay pay attention and and think of
them in spaces right what if we lived
with these patterns what if they covered
the walls that we live like intelligent
wallpaper you know what if our right
what if our patterns the texture of that
pattern is something we spend time with
you know it's not so hard you could
write laser cutters 3d printers little
CNC machines a little Rocco vacuum on
your walls the big XY axis you know I
started to think about art in terms of
texture the physicality of it and you
know I'm imagine damn recyclable it's
kind of ephemeral it can update you know
what kind of slowly goes against the
wall and you know ends up in the little
bit bucket recycle of those comes back
but I really thought there was something
important about getting the the actual
texture of them and there was something
about this it just had this familiarity
you know there's something about our
patterns we repeat the patterns I think
the patterns of our behavior are
beautiful we go the same places all the
time you know I look at the log data you
know I have this intense period in the
morning when i'm online and then I have
these longer stretches in the afternoon
you know people always say to me Lori
might you know my patterns and my travel
are so boring I just go to work I just
go home maybe the grocery I know but the
intense those intense areas are actually
the good parts and so for months you
know I have this cut drawn patterns in
my studio we month the walls are filled
with this
and I realized I really liked it it felt
like me I mean it felt recognizable it
felt human it felt personal I really
felt soothing it had this comfort
quality it was recognizable and I
thought maybe that's the point maybe
this data is a way to see this hidden
part like sleep it's a way to see this
hidden part of you the Pete the part
that you just don't see you don't notice
when you're kind of trained to ignore
yourself maybe there's this idea that
the hidden patterns of you write all
this data that's going to be collected
that's collected now right all this data
of us gets played back to us abstracted
and it becomes a shortcut to mindfulness
kind of this crazy way it's like a
technology boosted immune system you
know your brain doesn't know the
difference between meditative
self-reflection and you know the intake
of a data selfie it just knows that what
it's seeing is somehow playing back this
sense of self you know it's feeding the
human loop it's you it's grounded and
you know so I imagine right there's a
whole connection there's a huge
scientific work around meditation and
immune systems and how you know immune
systems are fed I think in the future
it's going to be a really really big
deal and so you know along the way you
know people are buying this they're
right this stuff's in galleries as you
know people are taking it home it's kind
of crazy because it's my data but you
know sometimes it's a it's you know in
this case is the lobby it's actually
it's actually a team of developers and
it's all the chat metadata of a group
that works together and you're looking
at in the lobby it's 24 hours all of the
the chat sessions the time the timestamp
and the length of the message all the
developers or yellows and oranges all
the designers or shades of blue the
management or shades of gray right so
its end it's kind of the interactions
it's like the human data of a group of
people but I realized in doing this that
it got people to really look you know I
try to think art makes data sticky it
gets people to look at it much much
longer and you know I realized that
these these pattern I mean they mean
something to me but I realized they mean
something to other people too and so I
worked on and launched an iphone app the
team the lobby the guys they helped so
we made a trade so they worked it was a
digital shop and frick bits is a way to
to take your I was kind of an experiment
it was a way to take back your data and
turn it into something meaningful I mean
for the most part there's all this data
collected about us but we never get to
see it we don't know it doesn't come
back to us and nose for frick bits it's
live it's in the apple store it takes
your location data keeps track of it you
get extra bits for the places that you
live all the intense colors are the
places that you go all the time and it
uses that art algorithm the rules some
of those rules that I started creating
when I did the sleep right sort of
assigning colors and sort of coming up
with an algorithmic way to produce art
and it was you know so at this point I
kind of paused and I thought why I mean
I'm working like crazy on this and I
thought
why am i doing it Laurie your footing
Wilson I know I've got a Fitbit on
you're putting these little sensors all
over you you know you're you're trying
to figure out who you are I mean I'm
using these external means to try to
figure out who I am an artist
residency's we used to the artists we
would sit around and analyze other
artists work to try to sort of decode
them or analyze them I mean this
actually works for you guys to looking
at what people work on it says a lot
about them and and then I thought you
know i'm using all these external means
to figure out who like who am i but i
think we all do this it used something
external to figure out who we are you
know I completely changed jobs but yeah
you move you get a new place you get a
new apartment you get a new boyfriend
you know you change cities I mean you're
trying to use these external means to
try to figure out who you are do I like
it do they like me do I like this new
place I mean you can't know and I
thought well maybe maybe this is it it's
you know it's the way data starts to see
this hidden part of us a way to reveal
the part that's really hard to know
about ourselves there's this really
really wonderful book called strangers
to ourselves Timothy Wilson and he
describes you know right the you the
other you the you that your friends get
to see the one that you don't get to see
and so you think well maybe right maybe
you know what would you know so maybe
you know all this data comes right comes
back to me you know what would my right
whoa right what were my what would my
day to say about right what would it say
about you you start thinking all right
what if I got all my data back what
would my sleepover to look right right
is it going to be like my husband right
who swings wildly or what would your
data right if it sort of measures
something about you what would it say
about you
and me you know I just think it's that
it's this really compelling story this
really interesting possibility to use my
data to understand and answer this
question that I've been trying to sort
with its Who am I so what if I could
figure out a way right take back my data
what if I could get all my data and not
just understand who I am but the
possibility of who I can be you know
it's like I'll make you one am i up am i
down drive my mojo today you know I
always I'm super super interested in
data's ability to predict not just how
am I feeling now and the data showing me
you know here's my stress level at this
moment but how am I going to feel
tomorrow at eleven o'clock you know it's
almost like this weird smart drug what
if I can know that at a certain time in
the future I'm really really on and you
know I just am so curious about what
data could be and I start to think of it
as this irresistible possibility you
know it's funny you know human data data
the Fitbit all these companies that are
doing self tracking data they keep
describing it in terms of health or
fitness it's very Calvinist really
purposeful what's the purpose of this
data you know we won't get people to
walk more I mean it's very but I don't
think it's about that I think that human
data is going to be and it really is
about identity Who am I you know so if
data is a way to get to know ourselves
if data is the way that I'm going to
figure out who I am why am i running
from it why would I hide I say take back
your data turn it into art thang
trick question I hope this is where I
was like I'm dying to talk to you guys
about this so you learning a little bit
too cause and effect do you think doing
all this work looking at your data has
changed you in other words has changed
the data so you feel like there's been a
feedback we butter bars it literally
just been no I think no I think it's a
fair question right if you measure
yourself to what changes I mean one of
the things because I've measured so many
things for so long I don't stress over
it short term but the thing I've I mean
there's a few things that I can tell my
behavior is like stepping on a scale
every day you manage your weight just by
having the data just so just the
presence of the data makes a difference
you know one of the things i learned
about sleep its kind of anti intuitive
the early you go to bed the better you
sleep people think of i'm really tired
and I go to bed late i'm going to sleep
better you actually sleep better if you
go to bed early I I also know just kind
of intuitively now if I stand longer
during the day if I stand in my studio
and I stand not only can I get 10,000
steps in but I sleep better I mean so
there's a level of self-knowledge that's
that you just sort of start to
intuitively understand and I'm not sort
of consciously you know writing down you
know I'm more productive or so but i
think the knowledge and the exposure to
the data subtly affect you but I
understand but I don't think I honestly
don't think that's the point as much as
the sense that art can show you back
your data in a way that you care about
have any extension of that question if
feedback is a big part of this
experience and we see something like a
wallpaper which is right relatively
fixed do you think you'll expand into
like animation or other forms that
change so that there could be a kind of
feedback in something that's not many
months or you know iterating on many
different data snapshots they're doing
something a little bit more continuously
right so how do you how do you get the
data to actually be real time and update
you know part of me wants to do that
with physical work right so the
physicality of it I mean I'm really I'm
kind of a mind that it's a trick but
it's like a shortcut just to go to a
pixelated screen but if there was a way
to maybe projected on something bumpy or
have a way to have the physicality of
the work updated all the time I'm
serious I think it should be you know
recent and current but I'm still
figuring out a way to make that physical
and make it I mean could it you know so
could it be interactive and move and
absolutely yeah yep I notice that a lot
of the pieces that you showed you have a
very judicious use of color effect in
the center and also numbers appear a mod
and I'm kind of curious where those come
from we're in your work well some of the
pieces are based on walking tracking and
I'll make drawings as I go and I'll look
at the Fitbit and what you know it's
like steps from that time or numbers I
also have this weird sense that the
things that you see all the time some
things you forget some things you
remember it sort of seeps in and so then
you know the the numbers come from that
of the amount of stuff that you're
exposed to in the parts of it that you
actually remember
I mean the judicious I actually think
I'm making stuff pretty bright I mean
I'm I'm trying to I'm trying to inject
as much color as people can stand in the
pieces yeah the period I mean did this
like the background piece of the wallet
and some of the other ones and a lob get
some work look very very colorful but
then some of them especially with roses
o youth are very subtle they got there
just a little bit here and there I know
just kind of curious what your
exploration where that was that coming
from something in the data to you or was
that something from slip from how you
felt about well one of the pieces with
the data they were about time and it was
winter sometimes it's about place and
the color relates to the sense of time
of that place but I also have this
theory I mean a lot of color is what
people like about color is based on the
fluency of what people seen before I
mean people's music tastes and their
food tastes come from what they've
tasted or heard is really young so I
thought that you know color taste comes
from what you've experienced and seen
and I started realizing that super
saturated photoshopped color so much
media that is so bright there's so much
media now that's really not nature
colors it's just way more and I almost
can't get enough in fact sometimes I'll
make stuff and then I'll have to like
paint over the top of it or take it back
or do something to dial it back because
I like color that's like I want to take
the saturation knob and take it to 11
yes we spoke about how beta awareness is
a shortcut for mindfulness and it seems
like you learned how to sort of read
data and how that expresses how you feel
yeah but you must have also done that
relationally with your husband what
other people have seen their data and
and sort of that must have influenced
what you how you interface with that
Lord all right I wonder if you could
speak to a bit to that when you saw
other people's data out of it what's
your thoughts about them oh there's like
I was like I'm now I'm getting sort of
like this fri and shrink in sight so
everything hard
yeah you know somebody asked me once it
was like all right if I you know if I'm
really super stressed can I see somebody
else's data to calm me down or there's
you know there's also the question of
you know if you're really mad and the
person that you're talking to you know
sort of meats you with that same you
sort of calm down as opposed to somebody
patronizing you it's something so I mean
it's so I've always thought like you
know I don't know the answers to this is
like what part of that Expo experience
or feedback to yourself do you want to
get like four light or like four
different hmm I think I think the
question of you know looking at other
people's data
yeah i'm i'm not i don't know i mean
yeah i don't know it's a fair question i
don't know yeah I don't it's sort of
like the you know the answer to the
universe I do so some of it I honestly
I'd oh yeah I'm not sure I mean the
truth is I've probably spent I mean
here's so here's for example been lip
quits there's one guy and I probably
spent hundreds of hours with his data
and I've gotten so I really like his
data um William varies it goes for years
and years there was this whole one
section where cuz he also he sleeps on a
26-hour clock so his patterns go on a
diagonal which is interesting and then
there was this one chunk for about six
months that he was getting up at the
same time he's a software developer and
so when I saw him one day I said did you
get a job what happened then yeah why
are you getting any guys no no I was on
a bike trip I had to get up when the Sun
got up I was sleeping in a tent you know
so there's something about him and it's
he has an interesting variety to it and
then I've been doing these pieces based
on time use data and they're anonymous
people and some of it I go through them
and it's like oh no I don't like this
guy I start looking like yeah so there's
there is a response to some of the time
based data and it's interesting because
there's I think to me is you know i'm
sitting here sort of answering it like i
haven't thought about this before
there's a certain amount of variety that
makes the person interesting you know
and maybe the thing like you've marry
your opposite because i'm pretty steady
and thing with my husband this it's like
oh yeah oh yeah love him
I almost feel the cell phone bill
self-help book coming on oh god no don't
make me I think this is because I
struggle really hard to not step into
New Age crap I mean I really because I
think that's hooey but I think there's a
science I think there's a scientific
connection here no no what I didn't mean
that an occasionally sure that's not
like please don't take me there who I do
me is the idea that it's almost like
they're pure there would be rules for
what you want your data to look like in
terms of you just said something about
variety does desert d'Italia a variety
is not there to variety does variety on
certain axes indicate someone who is
better able say to deal with everyday
life or something like that again I'm
not suggesting the book but it's that
idea of like a self you but you know it
heart rate variability to people you
actually want highly variable so it
could be that what makes you human has a
certain amount of variety in terms of
you know time heart rate breathing much
more than other parameters friday
intensity in certain cases i mean if you
should go through life and years no
fluctuation you gave at all then what
kind of pursue a robot yeah robot well
yeah okay you know what i love about
this group usually cuz I you know I talk
about the slide and usually the very
first kids are like oh my god you know
we are not data you know I you know we
can't reduce humans you know there's the
mystery of bringing human but nobody's
asked that this group is like data I'm a
you know you're like oh yeah well cuz
people say cuz you can be I think we are
gonna be statistically understood I
think there's a point where we will be
known yeah yeah yeah yeah it's what
you're asking yeah there's going to be
norms yes this kind of work as anywhere
my arm is going we're just like curious
if any of this you're you're in geom dad
founded super interesting one of their
cases where it's telling you think you
wish you didn't know about yourself
because this
a certain have to this is probably
responsible related to but we need a
certain fiction about ourselves and work
yes we maintain our sanity but it's
sometimes the truth is to start to just
kind of just depressing really i watch
TV way woke up thought I did like well
you know I didn't I started tracking my
time like really track I turned a couple
apps on my phone and I had manic time
running on my laptop and then I started
keeping a little grid I was trying to
get at things I did simultaneously and
one of the things that did surprise me
because people always talk about oh god
you look at your phone too much I
realized most of time on my phone I was
reading stuff that maybe actually I felt
better about it but I think there is
like you don't hear your own heartbeat
you you barely I think what you see in
the mirror is not there's all kinds of
things that you just cope with just yeah
just yeah yeah clean kind of back to
work side of it a little bit curious in
this image here and some of the others
in your presentation this has both this
absolutely a lot of the work that you
should you have either color or
extrusions of some sort of coming off of
it yes surface and wall typically and
then sometimes you have like these
frames that you're seeing through that
have data punch through or negative
positive yeah and I'm just curious like
what leads you one direction or another
and how do you think about this to kind
of they're old they're pretty different
expressions right I'm just curious how
you think about that yeah yeah um I took
the thing that makes it live in the
world of art for me is there's the
experience of the data and then the data
itself and there's data viz right thats
tends to take the data and represent it
really accurately and I try to stay I
mean I showed a few examples that I
actually work from like the real data
but I try to find something in the
experience
like when I did the walking it was the
time of year what the color of the light
was sometimes I wore these selfie
cameras and did pictures as I went and
looked at all the images you can wear
these will you just you can run the time
lapse i wore my iphone around my neck
for a while you know I would look for
something in it you know it's funny
because you know the sleep i took the
bad sleep and folded it out of the way
and made it missing but then other times
i would make like the time with stuff
with it would poke out would be
something that i felt had more emotion
you know so i mean i used the same
metaphor to mean completely different
things but i was trying to get at like
it's almost like you've got color size
so i was trying to find more
dimensionality to play with is there
anything that needs you chew up all
those lines that leads you towards then
if you will the negative space of these
sort of frames and the battles that you
look through is there anything that
typically do that way or is that just
whatever whatever the spirit of the
spirit was what you're trying to express
yeah i'm all know well Oh a lot of it
was because I was playing I belong to a
laser cooperative so i get like in
endless amounts of laser time and so I
just experimented with laser cutting and
could I draw with the laser cutter and
could I their hand you know handmade
with a laser color you know late cutter
I mean I underst I haven't I I don't
have a great deal yeah good tell i can't
figure i don't know i mean one of the
things that I did figure out is I've
tried to sort out how to represent bad
data it's you know right it's different
than just something you don't want to
know but every now and then things are
not okay or I used to for a year and a
half if I had an upset stomach you know
one was good I was a bad and you just
score it every day and you know I went
back and looked at the data and I
thought how do I represent those fives
and I took the data and stacked it and
when something went bad because I'm that
really tidy person I would let it spill
out and I thought if it was live and I
was getting the data real time I
probably could make my stomach feel
better in order to stack that stuff up
Neath my desire for neatness was so high
that's why when I looked at your office
ashes like are so horrified um my house
is clean and and I thought kind of a
secondary way to represent data to give
it to him not just smack him like you're
bad but it's messy and if you want to
clean it up you might have you might
have the dial to switch it the other way
what too neat I'm Tyler so well exactly
so I know where everything is but that
is memory cuz memory has a cron lot no
wait as I organized it I don't know
where did it no no no no cuz
chronologically it's historically
time-based and the stuff on the floor
yeah I know cuz even that has a location
and it has something associated with
that occasion you've read about them at
the rats in the maze that store location
base where they are this is in your
little neurotransmitters so I should
that correlates my question is it feels
like hell maybe at least when you
started a lot of this was representing
your data to yourself but when you think
about this space like dataviz on one
side and something
abstractly are on the other there is a
there's a big trade-off between how
interpretable it is right and I'm
wondering if you thought about lady you
know how would you present some this
somebody's data to them based on their
particular personality right so you know
would it be what I if you were if I
commissioned you to do something with my
data you knew me would you do what would
what were the things that you might
think about her very it's like it's like
the art algorithm of the future writes
back that you know art can be it can be
literally you know could be coded to be
a learning algorithm with the set of
rules that I don't even have to
intervene right it makes art for you you
know what does it measure in these
particular instances at least for your
solving are there things like it well
you've mentioned want the sort of
spilling out effect are there other
things like that there's you kind of
coded for your understanding it's almost
what you're trying to get at is like the
amount of humaneness how much hand how
you know how much edge you know where do
you you know it's in that super messy
super tidy right it's sort of a
mechanical how mechanical how handmade
that's some of it I had this project
that i started working on and it's part
way through was to be able to look at
the person and gather data about them
that then would feed into the algorithm
the speed that they walked how fast they
signed their name the pitch of their
voice I thought there was something
interested in people's their basic
proportions you can measure like
people's basic you know sort of just the
amount of this to the amount of this
based on the proportions of their hands
hands have a lot to say about people you
can start it was like all right what are
the things that I can very objectively
measure about you repeatedly and use
that to feed into the algorithm it's
some of its personal the speed thing or
the pitch
thing and it was like the colors that
they wore and you know what are the
things you can start to gather about
somebody that are unconscious choices
about them but are very insightful could
you know so how do you start to make
yours you know I I also imagine in the
future you could have like the super
abstraction are the super realism you
can start to make stuff you know I know
I don't you know I don't want any like
the filter in Photoshop hyper sharp
little bit fuzzy I mean I think there's
something in that I don't have all the
ant you know and some of this I don't I
don't even figure out in my own head
until later I realized there was
something that was causing me to make
something in a certain way that felt
right and then I sort of analyzed why I
mean this artist will tell you sometimes
they figure it out while they're making
or soon after they made it they don't
exactly know why have you done this for
your husband made something again okay
so what has been his response and
interaction with it um he like some
better than others um that's his
interaction yeah I did a lot of his
sleep stuff yeah he
it's possible he didn't tell me except
you know I mean I'm sitting here
thinking he goes honey I liked it thanks
um he knows enough not just you know say
too much maybe I guess it to combine
those two questions that when you did do
some with you I mean in a sense your
husband was Neil in a way I mean you
produce something for someone else yeah
then i sholde it it looks like he laughs
it's all gone were there were the
different colors you use different
textures different materials mm-hmm
you're right there were his colors were
duller not dollar cuz he stole but he
doesn't know he wears you know tan tan
and gray it's sort of a common color
yeah I didn't make miss bright you're
right I didn't it's something I don't
think I thought about it but it still
came out that way yeah yeah yeahs corn
yeah cancel have you thought about using
government open data to do I based on
CDs like 911 calls for our cards like
all the implements publicly available oh
yeah yeah because i really like Dana
that sort of human race right so that's
sort of that big about individual people
can you create portraiture of individual
because there's once you start going
into the land of data its bottomless yep
like CDs how might then be liked by your
concern well it was partly why i started
using time use data from tiniest org and
then i wrote to the people at the
university of oxford and they have a
time use database and I've been
gathering data that was anonymously
gathered about how people spent their
time but I haven't looked I mean like
911 calls it yeah I haven't you can I
mean part of it is it's the date is
overwhelming yep ah so I think we'll go
with bengkos question and maybe in maybe
that's great oh so what I
the physical manifestation of the data
that you've made obviously there's
there's great many artistic and
aesthetic qualities to it do you and as
you're creating it to you ever know I'm
said if you ever worry about what how
much better information the person needs
to know to understand the piece because
there's obviously oh yeah oh yeah if you
go to a space then you look at this you
can just think about it purely from
artistic perspective I don't know that
it's about data and do you like how much
of the design goes into that direction
how much how much do you think you
gained by knowing your meta information
this is really my sleeping babe yeah and
and my secondary questions like how do
you actually convey to people or do you
make people that it is your sleeping
data no it's a really good question
because I have a show up right now in
new york and i put legends in the show
for one of the first times and i used to
put little clues because if i was at the
beginning I thought it's enough that I
know what it is and I would name it
something that would kind of be a clue
or i would put dates in it i mean i
would do little things because i thought
it was kind of cheeky for me to know
what it was but not so much for other
people and now i've decided to be a lot
more straight up i've got i do these
seven days of time use made out of
leather and then I little hand draw I
give them exactly what the colors are of
what each of the categories of time I
show what's happening a thing it I
thought it would ruin it because it's
like kachunk kachunk and actually people
like ah so it seems to help so I've
started creating these little legends
and what's kind of weird because as I
look at Maps or other kinds of things I
always read The Legend I want to know so
maybe I decided that the legends are
kind of part of it and i've started to
explain more
excellent question the I these are like
little baseball cards their business
cards would honestly think of it as more
like a little party favor it's like you
get a little and looks like there's the
common different ones there's a ton of
them if you run yeah collect them all
