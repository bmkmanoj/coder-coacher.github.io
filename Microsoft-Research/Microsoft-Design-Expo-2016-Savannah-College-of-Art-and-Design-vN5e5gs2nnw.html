College of Art and Design with code the
story building companion my name is
Scott and this is Andrew Ashley and Maya
and we are from scat it's a van a
college of art and design and thank you
very much for inviting us to the X Expo
we've had an amazing week and really and
excited about showing you guys house cat
does cui so let's start off with our
process we begin in an early April with
some initial research they gave us these
kind of eight areas and topics that
senators around Cu is and we boiled that
down to our four pillars and these four
kind of foundational pillars gave us
direction on our initial ideation and we
came up with these two concepts of
memory and friendship and then we pushed
and pulled on those two concepts and
boil it down to something we'll talk
about with you today
companion and then while doing this
research where of course we're looking
for our area of opportunity we're
looking for our problem to solve and
things like family interaction and a
conversation that happens between a
parent and a child that could have
started rising up to the top but not
just family interactions the barriers
and family interactions like scheduling
work school and of course our lovely
digital devices families would come home
plop down on the couch and bury their
head in the digital sand but nobody
freaked out everything's fine we
actually believe that technology can
bring a family together we do know we do
know that parents and children are our
target audience now and we hit the
street we went out and ever you then
talk to them and we found some really
great nuggets of information that helped
us we found out that stories
storytelling is one of the most powerful
mediums of conversation that can happen
between a parent and a child but more
than storytelling the
idea of story building the stories that
are built together between a parent and
a child have much more meaning also we
learned about a companion that a child
can take a toy they can take a prop and
they can give it a voice personality and
they can give it life and so our
insights are directing us toward this
idea of a story building companion I
mean there is in front of us right I
mean can we all say it together now
story building companion thank you very
much and so we took our story building
companion and we named it Co and this
little guy here has a personality it's
very friendly very helpful very
approachable and he is our story
building companion for families and he
uses a conversation to facilitate the
creation and the archiving and the
retelling of family narratives thank you
Scott hi everybody my name is Andrew and
I grew up in New York in the 90s I
remember as a child I was afraid of fire
trucks and policemen and people outside
my bedroom window and my mother she
would tell me stories of wildlife and
tigers outside her bedroom window when
she was growing up in South Korea her
mother my grandmother would tell her
stories to calm her down of walking
amongst tanks and soldiers during the
Korean War
and I realized that there's an
incredible gap everybody knows an
excellent storyteller but not everybody
is good at telling stories
I personally have been screwing them up
my entire life but conversation in the
form of a story building platform can
bring families together and they can
build and hold on to those narratives
that are irreplaceable
code does this through a projector this
projector it brings your story to life
on the fly Co all so has an IR emitter
and an IR depth sensor
to give it a sense of where it is it has
a camera so that you could take your
selfies it'll recognize your gestures
your face it has an LED at the bottom
that changes color
this increases intensity it blinks so
that Co has a personality and it gives
mood to the stories that it tells it
also has a wireless charging pad at its
base
on the back Co has another camera with
the same functionality as the one on the
front it has a microphone array so that
it can pick up where you are and have
the conversation with you it has Wi-Fi
so we can stay updated and it has a
hi-fi speaker to give more life to the
stories so how does Co learn well it
does this through four components Co
understands language through natural
language processing after it's been
trained on very large datasets these
datasets include children talking to
children and children's children talking
to adults three examples are kids Corpuz
t-ball and child's it also has a curated
database this is the content inside of
code this curated database is made by a
curation team that makes sure that
everything that Co says is
family-friendly and appropriate what
about concepts and words that Co doesn't
know that's when the named entity
recognizer comes into play this named
entity recognizer separates recognizable
words like Seattle from generic unknown
words and it applies it to the metadata
algorithm this metadata algorithm this
metadata algorithm applies new
definitions to unknown concepts and
unknown words based on contextual
relationships this is how Co words thank
you Andrew hello my name is Ashley and
the core of are the hearts of our design
is retailing building and archiving we
wanted to be built Co because we wanted
to bring the family together but those
barriers that we mentioned before
like store school and work sometimes are
undeniable and we can't get away from
them we wanted to build a separate
platform to allow parents to get
connected to those memories and those
stories that they build with Co when
they're not in the same room so maybe
they're in another room cooking dinner
or they're here at a one
full business trip here at Microsoft we
called this platform Rico which is a
content management system that's cloud
based and is specifically designed to be
paired with Co this reco application
allows parents to be updated on their
children's interests and their ventures
while they're away but also acts as a
sort of administration and archiving
tool that gives parents the ability to
fully take advantage of codes
capabilities so with archiving parents
are able to access a weekly update or a
calendar like interface where they can
access these stories that has the images
and these stories as texts that are
recorded during their adventure and they
can either download this to their phone
or they can print it out as an artifact
reco also has the ability to generate
infographics that give parents a sort of
analysis of codes interactions with the
children and that includes how much time
ko has spent with the family how much
time ko has spent with a child alone and
then how many words has Co learned
throughout its interactions as well as
how how many times they've used that
word and finally ko is uh excuse me Rico
allows parents to establish restrictions
so for instance they can talk to and
chat with Rico through a conversation
interface that kind of accent was
inspired by Microsoft's very own chap
out showers Thank You Ashley hello
everyone my name is Maya and I had the
pleasure of working with Ginny Claggett
and her children to validate Co so
during our initial meeting we were there
to observe the family partaking in
storytelling and story building
activities what we saw is that the
children's level of engagement really
increased during story building so after
a few weeks and a few foam iterations we
revisited the family with our final
prototype and what we wanted to learn is
whether at its bare minimum Co has the
ability to suspend the user's disbelief
that this is a story building companion
it's not just a plastic shell with a
bunch of electronics inside so using
voice functionality only cowan the
family built a story about a polar bear
who wanted to visit his friend the
wombat
in Australia and to the children this
was enough in their words Co was like
magic we also introduced Rico to Ginny
and as a mother of four and I'm sure the
parents in here can relate she expressed
that you know sometimes you're just too
exhausted to remember the stories that
you tell your children and to her
Rico's greatest benefit is the ability
to archive these stories it's really one
of the things that makes Coe and Rico
special you know it's to create archive
and retell stories not just with parents
and children but with grandparents and
in turn this creates a really valuable
family artifact story building is a
collaborative experience one that brings
families together Co is our story
building companion for families to
create archive and retell magical
stories no parent child's grandparent
for anyone in here should be without
little magic thank you guys so much for
this opportunity and we hope you enjoyed
meeting Co thank you savanah now let's
go on to the judges comments rob would
you like to start
thanks very much guys you did a really
good job with the presentation you guys
must have rehearsed this one hundred
thousand times very slick
nice job I I'm curious about the you
know the formation of this industrial
design piece in terms of what went into
the thinking around its shape and form
and what's inside it and all of that but
you know we don't really have time to
get into all of that but I you know it's
kind of an interesting provocative
device it's sort of friendly and
benevolent and it's a projector and a
recorder I guess the only question in my
mind is is so what is the experience of
reliving a story you know I don't and I
don't know
that was something that was emitted for
time or that you created as an example
of the kind of thing that would be
captured conversationally and then and
then you know what would the output look
like how did you what was the output of
a co-created story with Co that would I
think have been emotionally the kind of
the cell in terms of you know that's the
output that's the value that it brings
to a family to relive memories so so
again congratulations it was really well
done thank you thank you you told the
story well but you didn't have a story
tell I'm curious good to give this
snapshot like a I have it haven't I want
to understand a bit more about what the
role the projector plays in and how the
visuals come and and absolutely I can do
the first one so so a girl named
Samantha she walks into a house and she
or her house and she hears a new voice
coming from the kitchen
and in the kitchen she hears the voice
of CO that her parents have bought her
she walks up to it and this is the first
time they've interacted and the very
first story that Co builds is a
personalized backstory it's the hero's
origin story and it's what makes Co
unique to every family in this situation
she which Co would ask Samantha what do
you think I look like she would say
maybe an egg and based on that key word
the projector would come to life Co
would ask Samantha to step aside pointed
in a right direction and the picture of
a nest perhaps would come up to the wall
and then based on that they go on this
journey almost like a mad libs exchange
where new images are applied to the
environment based on their conversation
and what state is it in at this point
like I don't expect to be a product I'm
just curious um how what was the level
of refinement you got excuse me what is
the level you've got in terms of
implementation that you could actually
test it Oh fully functional at one point
but we ran all the hardware all the
pieces yeah
we got all the pieces working and we ran
this through a Raspberry Pi using
processing and Python
unfortunately wires are very difficult
to get on a plane we realized none of us
have ever had that problem so that's
great thank you thanks a million yeah I
can agree amazing presentation and you
the beginning of the presentation really
sort of you know got me emotionally as a
parent and I think I agree that I I
wanted the story I wanted the experience
and actually and if there were more time
you know and I would have been more
interested in opening to the detail
around the UI and the features so that I
agree was the one piece that could have
hooked me it was the pitch but
beautifully done we have some time I
mean I would agree with that too I mean
I I'm sort of curious a bit like there
there is like there was this layer that
you guys thought about in terms of like
the emotional quality of the story and
the sort of idea that light would play a
role in helping lend a kind of emotional
kind of commentary over images I'm
wondering like how you actually imagined
that experience happening yeah I think
the LED light could be something almost
like a welcoming kind of a warming light
when someone enters the room that our IR
sensors can tell yes someone's coming in
the room and the LED like just slowly
glows and also perhaps during a story if
there's really an exciting time perhaps
the color changes and blinks and gives
the story more personality so it's kind
of a visual aid that can happen during a
story and also again as a greeting
perhaps yeah I thought that was a really
wake up potentially like a fruitful sort
of thing like to develop as a kind of
you know every every object
if it's going to have some emotional
import has to have that one detail that
feels like it actually the personality
of that thing lives there yes and it
seemed like that could actually be the
the outlet for that okay yeah totally
absolutely thank you very much for the
thoughtful comments thank you Savannah
