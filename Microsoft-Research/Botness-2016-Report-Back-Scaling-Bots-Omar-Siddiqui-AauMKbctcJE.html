and there were three main topics of
discussion one was I'm the business and
marketing hurdles to scaling bots
specifically around discovery that was
one notion that everyone really
struggled with is not just how our bots
discoverable today but even in trying to
get some consensus of a fantasy universe
where discovery was solved really
couldn't come to terms or consensus
there some lessons from the telegram
world though that were discussed one is
specifically the ability to add bots to
group conversations as a key discovery
mechanism along with user to user
sharing of bots get a forward a bot
output to a friend and have the
attribution of the bot follow it along
follow it around those are things that
have worked at least for some level of
discovery on telegram that are still to
be figured out on you know on more of
the core platforms in the u.s. there's
also the challenge of enterprise
marketing for BOTS so how do you balance
going to an organization trying to do an
enterprise sales deal with a suite of
bots each of which solves a micro
problem like just the go to market for
enterprises from some of the enterprise
focused folks was also similarly
challenged the second topic was around
technology and operational hurdles as
you're scaling the key one there two key
ones there one was just the cost of
maintaining a bot especially as they
become increasingly multimedia oriented
one of the cases that one of the folks
mentioned was as video BOTS emerged just
how expensive it is to actually stream a
video bot to consumers and how just how
to kind of manage that the second was
how to do updates on bots in real time
when you have a stateful you know
conversation how do you kind of
interrupt consumers in the middle of it
and generally the consensus was that for
the time being
you know the solutions are around being
able to bleed consumers off from the old
version of the conversation to a new
version at key break points that can be
designated but again a kind of a hassle
from an operational standpoint the the
the final point there also was that
there was general consensus that we're
going to be in a world where we're
having to figure how to support
microbots rather than mega bots and so
generally you know everyone's fixated on
what's going to be the first you know
million da you bought or million da you
or 10 million da you bought or mega bot
but really the likely model and I think
everyone generally resonated with this
notion is that the vast vast universe is
going to be microbots that solve
something important for someone or a few
someone's and that's the model that we
need to try and figure out how to build
in our respective businesses around and
then finally there was a discussion
around work Flobots versus communication
BOTS and this was something that
surfaced as a result of the diversity of
opinions and backgrounds of people there
and try to understand what BOTS even
mean to each of us so to some of us the
fact there's a bot means that it's
interacting with a consumer but there's
actually BOTS with conversation but
there's also bots that are just there in
the background that ideally never talk
to a user but are still automating some
key workflow and solving a problem for
those users and that really led to the
notion that BOTS can add value both by
being additive to consumers lives by you
know either exposing a new medium or a
new mode of interaction but also by
being reductive and taking away things
that consumer that users or consumers
are having to deal with in their lives
their crap work and I'm solving it for
them so that was another interesting
learning just from the conversation
because we all come into it with our
respective assumptions of what BOTS can
be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
