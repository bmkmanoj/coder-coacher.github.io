hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
our first speaker is dr. Peter Lee he is
the corporate vice president and he
oversees operations of four encompassing
about thousand hundred and fifty phd's
that we have worldwide as part of
Microsoft Research and that covers
thirteen labs across the world under
Peter's leadership we do a basic the
fundamental and applied research in
computer science and related areas and
peter has been in various organizations
before he joined Microsoft Research in
2010 he was part of the Carnegie Mellon
University and was with DARPA with
witches Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency which is a very
well-known agency in the US and he got
his PhD from University of Michigan and
though he is on various committees which
includes presidents what he called PCAST
which is President's Council of Advisors
on science and technology and his member
of advisory council of Computing and
information science and engineering and
I welcome dr. Lee to come and deliver
the address thank you video and thank
you on and on it's really thrilling to
be here and a great honor to speak to
you today I I thought I would try to be
a little bit of a little bit personal
and give a personal set of stories about
research and one of the reasons is that
today you will really be treated to a
whole program of some wonderful lectures
by some world-class researchers on a
variety of subjects and as you listen to
those things some of the topics will
sound very inspiring some will sound
mysterious and maybe strange some will
sound very interesting to you but since
we're here to try to explain to you why
a career in research might be
interesting I thought I would start off
the day today just to talk about what is
research and why is it important
what makes people like us want to do
research and it's actually a very
interesting question it's a difficult
question to answer in fact I find that
even researchers themselves sometimes
don't fully understand or aren't able to
articulate clearly what it is that they
do in fact one of the most famous
researchers in history Albert Einstein
is quite famous for saying well if we
knew what it was we were doing we it
wouldn't be called research wooded and
that's just a statement of admission
that part of the process of doing
research is involved in discovery and
when you're trying to discover something
you knew sometimes you don't exactly
know what you're what direct in your
heading you don't precisely define what
problems you're looking at you're just
seeking somehow new knowledge just
constantly trying to advance a little
bit every day how much people around you
and how much you yourself know but that
process is rather mysterious and so let
me try to explain a little bit about
what it feels like and I thought to
start where as a first example I would
just described one interesting computer
science research problem which is also
we just known as the pancake flipping
problem so how many of you have heard of
a pancake flipping problem not too many
of you it's a it's actually a problem
that used to be taught quite extensively
in schools and it involves the following
suppose you have a stack of pancakes as
you see here on the screen and imagine
that each pancake has a unique number
written on it so if we have n pancakes
we have the numbers 1 through n written
on the pancakes but the pancakes are all
scrambled in some random order and so
now we can have the problem can we sort
the pancakes so that they are perfectly
sorted 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and all the way all
the way to end how do we sort the
pancakes and we are allowed to do only
one type of opera
mission which is to stick a spatula
anywhere we want in the stack of
pancakes and flip that part of the stack
of pancakes over and so we can do that
flipping process as many times as we
want in order to rearrange the order the
pancakes so that at the end we have the
perfectly sorta stack of pancakes and so
now the pancake flipping problem is
posed as follows for any stack of
pancakes of size n what is the minimum
number of flips that would generally be
needed to sort a stack of such pancakes
and that is a problem that has really
perplexed computer scientists for a very
long time and computer scientists have
been researching this problem for a very
long time and it might seem strange to
you why on earth would people work on
such a frivolous and I would say even
fun problem such a fun and silly problem
is flipping and storing pancakes well in
fact one of the first important research
works on this problem was done by our
own founder Microsoft Bill Gates and in
fact this is a snapshot of a research
paper that he co-published with a very
good colleague bars at the at berkeley
christmas papadimitriou that actually
first posed an analysis of this problem
as well as solution to the problem four
stacks of pancakes of size 1 through 13
in fact provided closed form solutions
up to size 13 and then analysis beyond
that and in fact while the idea of
flipping pancakes appears to be rather
fun and frivolous and it is sort of a
fun problem think about in fact it's a
fun problem to talk to children about it
turns out also to be highly relevant to
a wide variety of resource allocation
problems in this case in operating
systems in the early Microsoft systems
disk operating system and so we see here
in research that oftentimes we think
about solving a practical problem in
this case
solving some type of scheduling problem
in an operating system but we talk about
research in more fun terms and so one
thing that's just cool about research is
we oftentimes try to have fun with our
problems and talk about things not
always so seriously but in this case in
terms of pancake flipping it's something
I really admire about researchers now of
course it's not just fun that inspires
researchers to work hard and to study
hard but sometimes beauty and here this
is I think a really beautiful photograph
of the part of the Mediterranean Sea and
the Mediterranean Sea has inspired
countless numbers of artists but maybe
you might be surprised to learn that the
Mediterranean and it's absolute beauty
have also inspired some of the most
important research of all history and in
fact it was the first sight of the
Mediterranean Sea by CV Raman that
directly inspired ramen to think about
the problems of spectroscopy and this
diffraction and scattering of light
through materials that ultimately led to
Robin winning the nineteen thirty nobel
prize in physics and so as he stated in
fact in the very first paragraph of his
nobel lecture in nineteen thirty i
voyage to europe in the summer of
nineteen twenty one gave me the first
opportunity of observing the wonderful
blue apple essence of the mediterranean
sea and this was just so inspirational
to him that beauty and what we see here
is that researchers think not just of
fun and frivolity but also beauty as
sources of inspiration and so sometimes
if you think of researchers as being so
Stern and and always very very
disciplined and always hard at work on
problems that's all true but researchers
are also always looking for some
essential beauty in things and in fact
the best
researchers in the world believe that if
something is truly beautiful then that
thing is probably also very important to
know and we see this over and over again
research now I want to say something a
little bit about my own start in
research and unfortunately unlike ramen
when I was growing up I never had the
chance to see something as beautiful as
a Mediterranean Sea in fact this is a
picture of my hometown in Michigan and
now I do have one kind of common
characteristic with ramen which is that
Robin's father was a physicist and my
father was a physicist also and my
father studied the physics of lattice
and crystalline structures and in
particular properties of snow and for
that reason we all had to live in a city
in the United States called Houghton
Michigan that actually has about 300
inches of snow every year and that's of
course a very important thing if you're
a researcher studying snow and so this
is pretty much what it looks like right
now in my hometown well so I couldn't
really look to something like the
Mediterranean for beauty but i was still
attracted to the idea of beauty in
research but it's a different kind of
beauty and let me give you an idea of
that and i'm going to assume here that
you have a little bit of familiarity
with the idea of computer programs and
so if you understand computer programs
then you can see what I've written here
as a program a very simple program that
computes when you execute it on the
computer the factorial function now of
course as I was growing up I wasn't
growing up as a computer scientist I was
growing up with a father who's a
physicist and my mother was a chemist
and so I was thinking of this as just a
simple mathematical equation and if you
look at this as a mathematical equation
we see
that we have the unknown very variable F
on both the left and right hand sides of
this equation and with that unknown
variable F this is simply a statement of
a math problem which is the problem to
solve for the unknown F and a little bit
of thought if you look at this will
convince you that F is simply the
factorial function that if we substitute
the factorial function for F and both
the left and right hand sides of this
equation then the equation will hold and
so as I was first being introduced to
ideas in computing this seemed quite
straightforward there is nothing new in
computing it was all just simple
mathematics well later on in my studies
in college I ran into work by other
computer scientists most notably some
one man named Dana Scott and Dana
started to pose more interesting
questions and one of the questions he
posed is well here's another equation
and if you look at this equation is an
equation with an unknown F and the
factorial function solves this equation
just as it solves the first one and yet
if you look at this second equation as a
computer program it does not give you
the factorial function and as I started
to study what computer scientists were
doing it I started started to dawn on me
on me that mathematics that ordinary
mathematics was not adequate to describe
computational functions or the notion of
computing and for me as someone who
really grew up in life of physics of
chemistry of mathematics the sudden
realization that there was something new
that couldn't be described with physics
or chemistry or meth
in computer science struck me as
intensely beautiful thing and so this is
of course a completely different notion
of beauty than the idea of looking at
the Mediterranean Sea and it's
magnificent blue colors but it's a
beauty nonetheless and for me this
beauty also seem convincing that somehow
understanding why and how these kinds of
equations must be something new in
computer science it also convinced me it
must be something useful and in fact
decades later even in companies like
Microsoft the theories that arise I was
trying to understand those kinds of
equations lead to very practical tools
and in fact one tool that almost every
microsoft developer around the world
uses this has something called a static
driver verifier anesthetic driver
verifier actually uses the principles
that come out of the kind of study of
these kinds of equations that every day
make microsoft windows and microsoft
windows phone much more reliable and
much more secure than they have been in
the past and so it's just to me an
intensely beautiful thing to see such
beautiful theory lead to such practical
results now we see researchers trying to
have fun we see researchers really
attracted to beauty but again that
doesn't mean that it's easy for the
world understands why research is
valuable in why research is important
and why we do our do research and in
fact as I finished my PhD studies and it
went on to be a professor at Carnegie
Mellon University even though I was
hired as a professor Carnegie Mellon and
I was very well respected by my peers
even my manager my department head
didn't understand why I was attracted to
such things and in fact I remember one
day my department head at the time told
me he asked me why do you do this kind
of research and I told him I do this
kind of research because i think it's
just so beautiful and of course then he
made me feel not so secured my job by
saying well if you think that beauty is
important maybe you should be a
professor in the school of art instead
of computer science luckily he moved on
to a different job and I had a later
department head who understood the
importance of beauty but the point here
is that again we see the how hard it is
sometimes when people that really
understands what it is that's important
about research okay so moving on from
fun and beauty and the challenges of
that kind of understanding what I'd like
to do now is to give you a simple test
to illustrate yet a third principle
about research okay so what I will show
you on the next slide is a picture and
the picture will have a bunch of dots of
different sizes and colors and I will
show you the picture for just five
seconds and what I would like you to do
is within that five seconds I will take
the picture way and I want you to tell
me how many red dots there are okay
everyone understand all right so here we
go concentrate hard five four three two
one okay so how many blue dots
so it's a dirty trick but there's a
point and what is the point here look
when we're working on pancake flipping
when we're just consumed with the
fascinating beauty of these mathematical
equations that aren't easy to explain
with ordinary set theory when we're
doing these things in essence we're
wandering we're exploring we're playing
I gave you all a job and your job was to
count the red dots and I'm sure you're
all very good at as students you're very
disciplined and when you were told into
a good job you do a good job and there's
a level of focus and discipline that you
all exhibited in research there are
times when we also exhibit such focus
and discipline but it is just as
important in research to at times step
back and just let your mind wander and
just to let your kind of soul be free
and to explore new concepts and try to
be so-called out-of-the-box thinkers and
this is important an important role for
research in Microsoft and in fact in
many places in Microsoft we have many
product development teams that every day
are doing a very disciplined job to
build and design new products to develop
them so they're reliable and that
they're a joy to use to create great
advertising so that customers know that
they exist in what they do to sell them
in all the best stores and that
discipline is equivalent to counting
those red dots but the thing is
sometimes the world changes and
sometimes we need as a company to know
something else something surprising
and this is where research can come in
and so is researchers when we're
exploring pancake flipping when we're
exploring something but the
Mediterranean Sea that is very much like
wondering what other kinds of colors are
there and why are there different kinds
of colors and all these other questions
that are present in that picture those
are just like all the other questions
that are present in the world of
computing in the world of research and
it is a role of researchers to be
curious about those things and to look
and every once in a while as we'll see
in some upcoming examples knowing those
things can come to the rescue knowing
those surprising things can help you be
more competitive and to be more
successful in the future and so a third
role of research is to have the kind of
ability to be an early warning system to
know more about the world and have group
broader curiosity just in case it's
necessary and just for the goodness of
knowing more about a world to push the
frontiers of human knowledge now a
fourth thing I want to say about
research and that is of course we can be
involved in research in many different
disciplines as I explained before I grew
up in household where I had a father as
a physicist and the mother as a chemist
but why did I end up in computer science
and there are many reasons for that but
one very important reason is illustrated
by the following a little parable that
I'd like to give you and this parable
goes back to the year 1969 which is
arguably one of the most important years
in human history in science and
technology development and the reason
for that is there were two major events
that happened in 1969 the first event
being depicted here which was the first
time we put a man on the moon and so
this is picture of Neil Armstrong in
1969
at the first moon landing a tremendous
scientific and technological achievement
a huge number of problems encountered
and overcome 50,000 people all working
together on a single goal to put this
man on the moon and the spin-off effects
of all the technologies and all the new
knowledge that came out of this have
really transformed all of our lives now
what is less known is that in that same
year 1969 there was another major
technological achievement and it was
much more humble at the time but in the
fullness of history we can see is every
bit as impactful and that is the birth
of the internet and in fact in 1969 we
had the first demonstration first of two
nodes and then a four nodes being
connected together across why distances
to connect computers together using the
early versions of the Internet Protocol
and then something that happened at the
Stanford Research Institute to use that
network to give what is commonly
referred to in computer science as the
mother of all demos and this was done by
Doug Engelbart who basically used this
early for node internet at the time
called the ARPANET in order to show the
capability of a person in Utah and a
person in California collaborating
together on a document and so what was
really just visionary here was the idea
as Doug langeberg put to hear that we
might be able to use such networks of
computers in the future to augment human
intellect and just again like the moon
landing and then
amazing technological and scientific
achievement one that has had just
long-lasting impact now what I'd like to
do here is just ask a question and it's
a little bit of a silly question but I
ask it for a reason as you look at these
two major accomplishments in 1969 well
looking back over the last 40-plus years
which of these two events ended up
having more impact on our lives and of
course it's a silly question in fact let
me admit that I was nine years old at
the time that these things happen and I
was completely fascinated by the moon
landing I watched it on television every
day and in fact I think I was inspired
to be a researcher and the scientist
because of that but one way to ensure
this question is to ask how many of you
have a sister who's been to the moon or
brother or or any kind of relative or if
you are a parent how many of you have a
child that's been to the moon and of
course it's a little bit of a silly
question but the point is that the
internet had the effect of being
democratized was a technology and is a
technology that can touch almost every
person on the planet and this is in
contrast to the moon landing where the
Saturn five booster technology or the
lunar landing technology is something
that is just so rarefied and so exotic
that its broad impact on people is
somewhat limited and so for me as I look
at the possibilities of computing
computing research one of the things
that's so wonderful about research and
computing is that new ideas and new
research knowledge in computing have the
potential to reach almost every person
on the planet
and that potential is just incredibly
important incredibly exciting and so
even the most humble ideas in computing
can have such broad impact and for me
this is something that gets me up every
morning makes me excited to be involved
in the computing field in computing
research and so let's run through a more
complete example and for this I'm going
to really know focus on examples of
research drawn from Microsoft and
Microsoft Research and to set up the
problem i'll use this image from an old
star trek movie the star trek the
journey home and i don't know how many
of you love the movies or have seen this
old movie i think this movie was
probably made before most of you were
born but it was a favorite of mine some
years ago and the setup of this movie is
that the Star Trek crew from the 24th
century finds out that the that the
universe inhabited by mankind is in
serious danger of being destroyed and so
they have to save it and in the process
of figuring how to save the universe
they realize that they have to go back
in time to today's earth and fix some
events that are transpiring and only by
going back this four or five hundred
years in fixing these events can they
avoid the Cataclysm of destroying big
part universe in the future and so in
this scene that's depicted here the crew
of the enterprise Starship Enterprise
goes back to modern-day earth and they
quickly find a computer because they
need a computer in order to help fix
things and they find a computer and
immediately they want to start using it
in order to hopefully save the
universe and in this scene Scotty who is
the best person to use a computer to
save the universe encounters this
machine and doesn't know how to use it
he starts talking to it of course
nothing happens then he sees the mouse
and he figures oh of course that's how
you use it so he picks up the mouse and
starts talking to the mouse and so it's
it's funny now it's funny though because
any of us who have ever used a computer
have had the frustration of how to
interact with viri and of course the
frustration of not being able to talk to
a machine and in fact it is a real
problem in computer science research to
have machines that we can talk to that
we can converse with and so I'd like to
describe a little bit of the work that
we've done at Microsoft on this problem
now before I can do that I have to
explain something about a field of
computer science called machine learning
machine learning is a part of computer
science research that involves the study
of computing machines that get better
with experience and one of the first
machine learning problems that people
worked on was to try to build a computer
that could look at an envelope and
understand the address that was written
on them and so if we have an envelope
like this and we look at one of the
digits that's hand written on the
envelope we want a computer to be able
to look at that digit and understand
that that is the digit 2 now that has
turned out in the early years of
computer science research to be very
difficult problem in fact there were
many researchers working on this problem
and really struggling because of the
huge diversity of ways that people write
their addresses and digits in the huge
number of ways that that people put
addresses and things on envelopes and so
in fact it turned out to be very very
difficult and so as people trying to
write computer programs to recognize the
digit 2 they ended up having to write as
huge know
rules you can imagine a rule that says
well if you see a little loop in the
lower left-hand corner of the digit it's
a tube but not if there is also an
opening on the upper right then it might
be a 60 and if there's a loop on
something it might be an eight and so on
and after a while you get more and more
rules that start to interact with each
other in bad ways and a certain
brittleness and the systems really don't
end up working very well so an
alternative way to solve such problems
is to use this concept of machine
learning and you'll hear much more about
machine learning from some really
world-class machine learning researchers
at Microsoft later today but just to
give you a little bit of a primer on
this imagine we want to use machine
learning to solve this problem of
writing a program that can accurately
look at a handwritten digit and tell you
what digit is that would be called an
accurate digit classifier what we do in
machine learning is instead of writing
down all those rules we instead provide
a huge number of training examples so we
gather a large number of handwritten
digits we label the correct answers for
all of those training examples and then
we feed all those training examples to a
machine learning system and machine
learning system then trains or analyzes
all those training examples and from
that automatically produces the digit
classifier without the need to manually
think about what all the rules are and
that idea of machine learning now has
become so successful that accurate
digital ossification in fact is used
routinely by the postal services around
the world as well as
on mobile phones to to read menus and
street signs and so on and so it's been
wildly successful so coming back to
speech recognition and being able to
talk to computer we can imagine trying
to use machine learning to understand
what it is that people are saying when
they're talking and in fact there was
quite a bit of research to do this in in
the computing research world and so in
fact what you see here on this graph is
the progress of machine learning-based
speech recognition the ability to of a
computer to listen to someone speaking
and tell you what words are saying and
on the y-axis what you see is the error
rate the number of words that are miss
recognized and as you can see as you go
down you're getting fewer and fewer
mistakes being made over time and so
this has been really a great another
great victory in a great example of the
applications of machine learning to a
very hard computing problem now of
course one thing about research is that
sometimes we get stuck because
researchers will tackle the hardest
problems that we can find and in fact in
speech recognition as you see along the
x-axis the years go by we did end up
having a period of about 11 years where
as a research world we made almost no
progress in making speech systems get
better and better and this is yet
another point I want to say about
research is that researchers are patient
and researchers are persistent and so
even though we as researchers didn't
seem to be making noticeable practical
improvements in computers ability to
understand what people are saying when
they're speaking we kept working on it
and kept working out and kept in
increasing our knowledge and after many
years finally we were able to have
enough knowledge to make new
breakthroughs that led to new
improvements and so that persistence in
that patients and the long-term view is
another hallmark of great research and
great researchers so unlike many parts
of the business world where people want
quick payoffs quick answers quick
solutions researchers want that too but
researchers who can also understand that
sometimes you have to work maybe for 10
or 20 years in order to have a big
payoff and that persistence can be
important now in fact that dramatic
improvement just a few years ago was a
result of some great work between the
University of Toronto and Microsoft
Research where we developed an idea of
using a form of machine learning called
deep learning to speech problem and we
published many papers on this that have
become quite important in the field and
that led about a year and a half ago to
a wonderful demonstration where the
founder of Microsoft Research Rick
wretched was able to give a speech in
China to an audience very much like this
and it's important to note that Rick
wretched does not speak Chinese and yet
we were able to use our computer systems
to translate his speech into Chinese as
he spoke English and translated and then
speak it in Chinese in his voice and so
I'd like to do just play a few seconds
of that demonstration so watch this
and so maybe we won't see that but the
but the speech was just an amazing thing
where he just spoke and out of the
speaker system just as you're hearing me
came Rick's voice in Chinese and in fact
I remember sitting in the audience and
that I looked back at the students some
of the students were in tears just at
the dream of using a computer to
eliminate the language barrier what a
wonderful thing since that time we've
taken the results of that kind of speech
recognition and applied it to many of
our products and so if you use the Bing
search engine you can search using your
voice and if you have an xbox you can
also control your games using your voice
and this is all using the same kind of
technology and furthermore the ability
to use machine learning to translate
different languages is empowering many
businesses to do better and so for
example if you are shopping for dresses
in russia on ebay you get very precise
translation of the unique language of
women's fashion design through machine
learning provided by Microsoft Research
incidentally I wanted to get back to the
fun aspect it's not just all inspiring
people by eliminating language barrier
it's not all just helping businesses
like ebay but it's also fun and in fact
knowing that this all was sparked by the
dream of speaking to computers as
depicted in this star trek movie we even
use our translation systems to allow you
to interact and speak in the Klingon
language which is which was created by
Star Trek and now looking ahead we have
bigger dreams of enabling tools like
Skype to provide rapid translation of
what you say and so imagine if you were
to speak in English in skype to someone
in German but all that your German
counter
here is is is is German in your voice
and so we're very hard to work on that
kind of technology now and so as you
look at this you see that we move from
very blue sky research where we're
really just trying to understand how can
people understand speech and how did I
translate to a computer to making a
great demonstration that inspires people
and it's very disruptive to bringing
business value in projects like Bing and
then thinking ahead to enhancing our
projects like Skype we see a pipeline
for basic research to tech innovation
and in our management of Microsoft
Research we put these things into a
quadrant system where on the x-axis we
look at short-term to long-term research
research that where we want a short-term
quick payoff to research that has
requires more patience and a long-term
view and on the y-axis research that is
reactive to everyday practical problems
all the way up to just pure exploration
just to understand something better or
the search for beauty and in our
management discipline then we look to
make sure that in our microsoft research
labs around the world we are doing all
of these different kinds of research
that we are looking at bluesky research
disruptive research very mission focused
research and sustaining research to make
our products as best as possible and by
doing this we hope always to be the
smartest people in the industry and in
the research world to always be the
first with brand new disruptive ideas to
be responsive to society's needs and to
our company's needs and to make sure
that we're the best at what we do and
for all of us at Microsoft Research
we're all motivated as researchers to
Jeep all four of these kinds of of
traits and characteristics and so to
summarize basic research can be hard to
understand it can be hard to understand
why people engage in
research and what is that they do but as
I take a step back and i look at the
qualities of basic research i see that
it's fun it's beautiful it can be really
quite challenging it's always
unpredictable you never know what you're
going to get and ultimately particularly
in computing research it has absolute
ability to impact everyone in the world
and put all together I conclude that
basic research is just the most
important thing that you can devote your
life to and so I hope many of you will
think about that and make your own
decision to devote your life to research
too so thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
