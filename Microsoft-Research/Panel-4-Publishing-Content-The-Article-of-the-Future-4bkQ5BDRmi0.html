hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
hi I'm Alyssa Goodman I'll explain a
little bit more about who I am and what
I'm doing here in a moment but before I
do that I just want to say thank you to
someone who isn't here anymore but then
some of us knew very well and who would
have really liked to be here today so if
you don't know or you didn't know the
dierks he was a wonderful member of the
microsoft research team worked very
closely with alex and he was the one who
put me up to sponsoring this
transforming scholarly communication
meeting that Amy alluded to before and I
just wanted to thank Amy and Caitlin and
everybody else for organizing this
meeting and showing me that their can in
fact be progress because it's been three
years since that meeting and what Lee
and I said when we hosted that meeting
was that we wanted to do something some
one of the speakers in the previous
session said oh I can't stand it when
people talk about all the theory of
everything and then it gets into the
nitty-gritty and gets boring and people
don't know what you're talking about etc
but we wanted to actually focus on
working tools and what it was that you
could communicate to scientists and
other researchers that they would
actually use and the problem was that
there was still a lot of theory but not
that many tools to choose from so there
were some but nowhere near as many as
there are now three years later so thank
you all very much and I'm surely thanks
you too so what I would like to do now
is just explain the plan on here so we
have five people on the panel who you
see assembles in two groups meaning
nothing here um well if you wear a
darker color maybe you're on this I
don't know anyway and since this is the
last session of the day I'd like this to
be a little bit goofier and freer than
the other panels I'm getting thumbs up
from the audience okay and so what I'm
going to do is you can see the Twitter
profiles and other profiles of our
speakers and what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to introduce myself and how I
got here and then I'm going to ask the
panel members as they give their
presentations to do a similar
introduction of themselves okay and what
I mean by an introduction is how did you
wind up in this room and why are you
talking about
what you're talking about okay so I'm an
astronomer that's my day job that's a
joke to be an astronomer during the day
um but I had a bunch of other people
including dr. Clark over there started
some trouble at Harvard about a decade
ago that led to this research computing
institute called the initiative and
innovative computing which is how I met
many many of you and wound up hosting
this meeting with Lee a few years ago
and I should say that my main interests
are in making the research process much
less painful than it is now and not just
so that life is less painful but so that
people will actually take the extra step
in terms of doing things in their
research that would have been just a
little bit too hard or a little bit too
time-consuming before and so our slogan
for the IIC timbal remember was
accelerating the pace of science and so
I really think that that's what the goal
of this enterprise should be and so
anyway I run a group at Harvard called
seamless astronomy which makes a bunch
of tools like that one of the spin-offs
is Mario and Alberto himself a birth so
Pepe one of our speakers and Chris
erdman and the library at harvard is a
very big part of that group as well as
is the 80's team and there are some
people Michael Kurtz and Alberto aku
masih who are here from 80s but anyway i
will stop rambling and instead i'm going
to show you a couple of videos in one
video how many people here know chris
linn taught okay not that many but you
should know him he started the
Zooniverse so where's your hand if
you've heard of the Zooniverse okay he
didn't really start our font started his
universe our funds right there so our
fun Chris and Rob Simpson where let's
say in on the ground floor an orphan can
tell you the story later of how it
started because I actually don't know
the details but our phones important in
the story and so anyway I was at this
meeting um in 2012 I believe January of
2012 with a bunch of friends the
american astronomical society meeting we
were sitting around in a bar and we were
talking about essentially the subject of
this meeting and how is scholarly
communication going to change in the
future and how can we get rid of this
antiquated model that we have now and we
had such an interesting conversation
that I made Chris and Alberto repeat
what they said okay up not Albert yes
there's a problem here there are three
people named alberto in this story one
of them is alberto pepper who's right
there another one is alberto alkmaar see
who's right here and another one is
Alberto Conte who you're going to see on
the screen right here ok so let's hope
the sound works here well let me go to
the video which I left open over here
there's a bar in austin texas so it's a
little noisy wedge reduce people say it
again would you say i'm predicting by
the time we sit here on the Wednesday of
ss 2016 in Austin and there will be a
github like a sweet science thanks to
figure that's my phone
and it will it be Bell don't buy some
Democrats caplets buddy not with
something with understanding not with
anyone running around somebody I just a
cute together we went yet horn car I
concur I think I think it's not gonna be
in astronomy so I disagree with it in
the world oh alright Oh mrs. mark we're
gonna borrow it on someone else anything
I can say in this video for four years
alright so we're coming about three
years I've managed with YouTube has
managed to save the video for three
years um woman so what's happened is we
an astronomy like to think that we're in
the vanguard and that we can do
experiments that other fields can't do
and 80s is a good example of one of
those experiments and I think that the
reason we can do this is because our
data have no economic value whatsoever
so people don't really care what we do
until they want to emulate it later and
so a group of us who are interested in
astronomy tried to we've written sort of
a draft of what we think the paper of
the future will look like the near
future not the distant future and
there's a video that explains this and
shows a thoria which is the tool that
Alberto puppy is going to talk about
demonstrating this paper in the future
and so I could either demonstrate it for
you live or I could play this wonderful
video that Josh peak made and I'm going
to Caitlin think play the video so okay
i'm going to play the video and that's
pretty much the last thing that I'm
going to say and then I'm going to turn
it over to the panel so let's just go
back here to video world and I should
emphasize that this paper is available
online but it's not meant to be a
scholarly paper in the way that we're
discussing scholarly papers and I should
mention one other thing which is that we
wrote another paper like this earlier
this year which some of you may have
seen we wrote a paper about ten simple
rules in Phil Bourne series on sharing
your data and to the point of the
previous session that paper I think has
18 or 19 thousand views in the metrics
and like one citation okay so ciation
counting is not not always perfect
anyway this one
we has zero citations or at least I hope
it does because it's not it's not a real
paper but anyway let me let Josh do the
talking because he's more eloquent than
I am so here we go play future this this
is a video introduction to the paper of
the future this document online with
authority by Alyssa Goodman myself Josh
peek along with our co-authors is
designed to both discuss our vision of
what the future of scientific journal
publication can look like but also to
demonstrate a number of the features
that are already possible with current
technology I'll take you on a short
section by section tour of the document
highlighting specific features that go
beyond what most journals currently
support while this investigation is
likely relevant to a broad range of
scientific disciplines we focus here on
our domain of expertise strongly in this
brief section we motivate our work
research has shown that while the
standard linear story in a good journal
article is compelling to readers it can
be greatly enhanced by offering
communication on a number of different
sensory platforms including data and
code linkages interactive figures audio
video commenting and other rich features
can allow readers to engage with the
work both more broadly and more deeply
while this work focuses primarily on the
final journal article in this section we
discuss new platforms for document
production these platforms were
primarily designed to aid in
collaborative article writing especially
as authors are more and more distributed
around the globe we provide the table of
a number of resources currently
available to astronomers share lay tech
and write late egg are largely designed
to provide co-authors access to lay tech
in a simultaneously editable version
controlled environment Google Docs is a
much more general tool capable of
generating documents with very little
barrier to entry thoria
the tool we have used to generate this
document aims to retain latex strength
while going beyond its authoring and
output capabilities in for instance
allowing markdown editing Authority has
a number of rich features that we won't
explore in detail in this work but as an
example co-authors can comment on
sections of the document or individual
parts of a given section the direct
citation of data within an article both
the input to and product of a scholarly
investigation allows researchers to
efficiently assess the results as well
as produce new research based on the
findings and data products historically
this has been done through the
footnoting of URLs which degrade over
time and do not allow the citation of
the data sets themselves digital object
identifier long-lasting handles pointing
to movable URLs have been used for many
years to track the journal articles
themselves these same do is could be
used to point to data sets and there are
a number of services including senato
dataverse and fig share allowing
researchers to do this today computer
code is now inextricably linked to the
scientific process especially in
astronomy to allow readers to easily
reproduce and advance publish results we
can now provide direct access to
underpinning code bases the
astrophysical source code library
provides frozen versions of codes that
are directly sizable with in astronomy
through 80s while github ins anoto
provides similar service across
disciplines using do I advanced article
platforms like a thoria can provide
users direct access to the specific
scripts that generated the results of
the paper as in this case where we can
read and modify the code for a
particular figure
one of the main motivations for
enhancing journal articles is to provide
the ability to tell better more
compelling stories audio and video can
be used to enhance any existing paper
simply by providing a summary or
abstract directly supplementing the
storyline of the work audio and video
can also be used more creatively
providing sonic or video representation
of observations or simulations these
technologies already easily available on
the web and in PDF can dramatically
enhance an article when used in the
right context chart interactivity as it
might be seen today in the Washington
Post or New York Times provides an arena
in which readers can explore the data or
high-dimensional results of a paper
within some limited guided space the
technology shown here was enabled by D
Threepio and is currently available
through glue and plot lee our universe
is by nature three-dimensional but
three-dimensional objects are very
difficult to explore on paper 3d PDF
capabilities already exist and some
authors have already used them in
published work one common problem unique
to astronomy visualization is connecting
discreet observations of individual
regions to the sky as a whole it is now
possible to see images in context using
the worldwide telescope
this section points out the advancements
being made in citation and bibliography
manipulation by more sophisticated
software for journal article writing the
days of maintaining a local library and
manually managing site keys for favorite
publications are waning it is now
possible in many applications including
authoritah to cite with ease further
removing technical impediments to
writing science is by its nature a
conversation it's a conversation in
which formal journal articles play a
crucial role but are not the only form
of communication today this conversation
is happening digitally all over the
world and we want to capture it at how
it links to journal articles in this
section we discuss identifying
researchers with orchid and how today's
researchers are interested in actively
discussing journal articles with social
networks like Twitter recently the world
wide web consortium has decided on
standards for annotation layers on top
of the web as a whole these layers
designed to provide commenting
capabilities for web sites could be put
to use with scholarly articles allowing
for discussions to happen on top of the
articles themselves these standards are
designed to support commenting engines
such as hypothesis and domi 0 while much
of this may seem like futurism
annotation layers have recently seen a
huge community involvement in commercial
success in rap genius and the genius
brand
this work has focused on existing web
based technologies that can be used
today looking to the future it's not
hard to imagine that we will develop
better devices for consuming interacting
with scientific journal articles these
devices may provide a haptic and spatial
relationship with the media we consume
and create we close by pointing out that
scientific documents serve not only as
ways to communicate with our peers but
also as archival records many of the
modern technologies we've discussed in
this work are not designed for
persistence and while services exist to
preserve these kinds of data you must
also keep in mind that feature rich
articles should maintain printable forms
for austerity great so josh is I think
excellent and making videos and I hope
that you got that that was supposed to
be a tour of the actual paper and you're
welcome to go look at the actual paper
and there's all sorts of ritz hyperlinks
but better than that we can produce the
people who make the kinds of things that
were discussed in that paper and so let
me start let's just go in the order that
people are sitting in so Alex come first
so I I do have a last name despite with
this slide my name is alex johnson i'm
i'm one of the founders of plot lee
which is a primarily a browser-based
graphing and data analysis platform but
since Alyssa asked me to talk about how
I got here I'm originally a physicist
the PhD just up the creek here and I
kind of expected I would be doing
physics for much of my work but as it
turns out I kept getting pulled into
this this task of helping all my
colleagues work together and doing that
through better software and so
eventually came around to just doing
that full-time when I started out as a
PhD student I had collected a bunch of
data and went to my my advisor said
great I'm writing my paper how do I do
that you had a very simple answer to
that question number one make all your
figures
less like influence detail and get that
all completely done and number two
explain them and that's basically all he
said which it has a really powerful
message behind it I think right yeah I
recognize that this is not necessarily
the case to the same degree in every
discipline but in many disciplines
anyway visualization is the core of your
article right physic the figure is the
most compact representation of the data
it's the most complete representation
that you're sharing with everyone it's
what pulls people in you know for myself
anyway when I read a paper I tend to
read the title then I'll go look at the
figures then I go read the abstract then
i'll probably go look at the figures
again and then maybe i'll read through
the paper right that sound familiar and
and lastly and the one that I think
might actually be the most important is
the figure is where meaning is tied to
the data in the most intricate way so
what does this have to do with the
article of the future well first off
absolutely absolutely let's keep the
data with the figure right there's this
there's this great moment in the kind of
traditional desktop based research work
flow where you're making your figure and
you know you you've executed your
commands to make it and it and it shows
up and right at that moment you've got
your data and your figure together and
then you go publish it as an image and
that's all lost right so we want to we
want to get to a situation where that
data stays with the figure forever it's
always part of the part of the package
and then we can expand on that and say
well if we're keeping the data with the
figure why don't we keep everything with
the figure why don't we keep the network
of sources we're all that data came from
let's keep the scripts and all of the
analysis that you did you
with the figure and any related
information anything that you feel is
important to fully understand where that
came from keep it all there and the
other thing that you can do as a result
of keeping the data with the figures let
each reader interact in the way that's
most appropriate for them with that data
so here's here's a possible article of
the future if this is in a browser then
most of the rest of what I'm going to
talk about could happen right there in
the paper if it's not in a browser you
know you probably have to follow this
link at the bottom in order to get to
the more interactive aspect to this but
first off what can you do if you're
keeping the data with the figure well
right off you can see anything that
people that the figures author has
associated with each individual data
point right you can see the exact value
not just you know this is somewhere
north of 5 but you can see that this is
five point 0 4 and that corresponds to
you know in the year nineteen forty six
141 million people ate 714 million
gallons of ice cream you can see all
that right away you can zoom in you can
you can move around all that's possible
if the data is connected to it in real
time you can see the raw data itself and
get a copy of this pull it down and
analyze it every bike and then you can
and you can look at everything else that
went into making the figure now what's
cool about having a analysis platform
that's all built in to the browser is if
people are working this way all of that
information is naturally available and
naturally sword with the figure right so
in this case we can see that to make
this one figure I have three different
plot lee data sets and each one of those
actually came from a quand elle dataset
clonal as an online data aggregator so
you can follow that whole tree of events
that went into making this data I can
also see that my friend jack has forked
my figure and made his own data set oh
sorry stands for the screen right so my
friend jack has pork this and made his
own data set and made a plot out of that
and then my friend matt has has made his
own plot as a fork of my plot right so
you can see everything that's happened
you know the whole community using this
data and then whatever other information
I have chosen to include by hand along
with the speaker okay so that's that's
pretty cool it's our deal allowing a
much richer interaction with the data
than was ever possible before you can
also just you know if you see this
figure and you want to do something with
it on your own you can pull it in two
flatly and say you know say you're
colorblind and those two those two
traces look the same to you can't figure
out which is which you can just go in
and change the colors and you get your
own figure that that represents the data
in a way that's more meaningful to you
or you can renormalize it what you know
whatever you want to do if you want to
go a little bit further one of the
things that we've tried to do with plot
lee is to make kind of a universal
translator between the various different
plotting analysis systems that people
like so you know here I'm showing the
Python version of this figure but but
because it's all just based on a
standard JSON format in the end we have
if you like MATLAB if you like our if
you like Julia and we'll be adding more
languages as we go this allows people
who otherwise wouldn't really be able to
work together to work with the same data
without all this headache of you know
going back out through a CSV file or as
well
and then less a I supposed to talk about
the article the future would not be
complete without the social aspect the
not onlys you know social media the
ability to share this with whoever you
like and also the ability to comment you
know wow that was a really big post war
party that's what happened in 1988-89
some some really interesting questions
about ice cream production plants or
came up in this and things like you can
you can star this graph which not only
lets the Creator know that you're like
it but lets you see what happens with it
in the future join the conversation on
so with that I think I will finish
thanks flatly graphs are embeddable in
still an interactive form inside of both
oriya and so now Alberto is going to
tell us about himself and about
authorial so normally I do every single
presentation I make it's always a demo
you know if I have 10 minutes I'm just
gonna go ahead and like just keep the
demo for 10 minutes but today I think
you saw enough of a demo in the initial
video at the beginning so I'm not gonna
like do too much of a demo instead I
want to talk a little bit about the
motivation of what's behind authorial I
we're doing what we're doing and but I
have to start saying a couple words
about me what am I doing here I was here
in Boston I worked at a CFA is a paw
stuck with Alyssa until nine months ago
I think my background is in astronomy
but then I'm a bit of an information
scientist that's what I've worked on for
my PhD and I joined a cfa here a Harvard
for about three years and I was the
in-house information scientist so
working with astronomers my old people
but doing more information science data
science stuff and throughout the postdoc
I
got interested in the idea of creating
an authoring tool that somehow would
accelerate the pace of scientific
research and scientific writing and
collaboration but before I talk for you
know for a few minutes about the future
of a squat by the way that the thing is
not working so it's still in 10 minutes
so maybe just otherwise I'll talk
forever before I talk about the future
of the of the article I want to sort of
like blast from the past let's look at
the past of the article and this is an
article that at least and I have been
looking at and using in a lot of
presentations and I just want to talk
about it for a second because in order
to understand how we're moving towards
the future and what the future of
scholarship and authoring looks like I
think it's important to look at how
things were being done 400 years ago so
the slide that I normally start present
my presentations with is this one and I
just look you know ask myself what do
scientists do today so here I'm
preaching to the choir I don't have to
like tell you that science is cool we do
cutting-edge stuff by nature science is
innovative original and cutting-edge so
we can say that science scientists
produce 21st century research but when
it comes to writing up a science the
tools and technologies we use they were
built and designed in the past century
so there are all 1980s products from lay
tech toward you know this systems these
tools were intended for single use so
one guy or one girl working at a
computer and the computer is mostly
offline so they were not built for
collaboration they were not built for
the web but most shockingly when we
package research we're still using a
format that hasn't changed much in 400
years this paper is 200 years old it
talks about a lunar eclipse and you know
looking at it it's like well yeah it
looks familiar so question is like 200
years from now four hundred years from
now are we still going to be producing
articles that look like that well I
don't know but if I look four hundred
years back one of the pages of the
Galileo article that i showed you before
looks like this so for the longest time
I listen I would talk about the pie
of the past of the article so the
article of the of the past as you know
something that we want to move away from
but then one day we decided to actually
look at what's in this article by
Galileo which by the way is a
revolutionary one is one of the first
scientific articles ever published in
which Galileo presents the results of
his research he was one of the first
users of a telescope and he noticed that
there were four points of light orbiting
Jupiter so he discovered essentially
that there were planets orbiting Jupiter
and he found out that you know
essentially they made profound
implications on the way we think about
ourselves in the universe in our solar
system if you look at the paper you will
see a narrative account of what Galileo
was seeing on that night and he actually
you know there's a lot of text in the
article that is essentially metadata so
the leo says like I was sitting in my
room observing through the telescope at
that time on that day and this is what I
thought and it would actually like
present is his own drawing so he would
look through the telescope and the raw
data that he was collecting which was
his own drawings that's what he was
presenting in the paper so the final
article the galileo published was
essentially an odd book he's on
scientific notebook and notated with
metadata you know which is had like this
is what I was doing this is what I saw
so all the raw data there was that
Galileo was collecting eventually got
published so the idea of publication
that you know gelila we can say is one
of the founding fathers of publication
as we know it actually started with
Galileo publishing all his data so
gorilla was doing open science
essentially uh today we don't do that
anymore because the data most of the
time is too large and it doesn't fit in
the scope and format of the paper
anymore so I'm so happy that Alex
actually mentioned the idea of attaching
the data and publishing all the data
that is behind a figure because that's
actually what is getting us excited
auditoria and that's probably the one
feature that i'm going to show you just
for a couple minutes at the end of the
presentation so here's just another like
close up screenshot of what the sort of
like the data the may
data and the figures in Galileo's paper
look like so we already talked a lot
about the this idea of the paper of the
future and how authority we're trying to
incorporate the concept of including all
the raw data that is associated with Dia
with the paper within the paper itself
so we're trying to rethink a paper not
so much as a PDF something that you know
you can disseminate and circulate with
your with the public / York others but
as a repository so a place where data
actually can exist alongside text and
images and we're also built on get so
that every single thing that you do to a
paper every single action edit gets
logged and you can get a you know I you
can keep track of everything that is
changing to the paper so I mean normally
what I end up doing is like end up doing
a demo for you know two hours but I'm
not going to do that today so I only
have a few minutes a couple of other
things that I didn't mention at all is
that in addition to trying to rethink
the article as a data-driven interactive
living breathing entity we're also
trying to alleviate the pain that a lot
of authors have today when they're
writing papers we've talked a lot about
latex so i think i can make fun of latex
and it's fine so you know one of the
first problems that a lot of authors
have is that you know they have to use
later because they're co-authors are
using latex but at the end of the day
it's as i said before a tool that was
built in the 1980s and this is like
1990s i think but you know there's a lot
of problems that you're dealing with
when you're working with latex which are
essentially 1990s problems later it was
built for typography so essentially to
put words and images on paper and here
we're talking about the paper of the
future which hopefully will not be paper
it can be paper as well but it will be
something that exists on the web is
that's where we work these days here's
the last late i created a joke probably
a lot of you are not laughing so you
don't probably you Sladek too much the
the second problem we're trying to solve
is the idea of
brave and simultaneous editing it's
happened to you if you're working on
papers today probably the best majority
of you is still using email to
communicate on the different changes
that are happening to the paper so you
end up sending the you know your latest
draft to your cutter and then you know
if you send an email and said like hey
I've got a plan author you know Bob will
work on it next week and then its author
you know George whatever and you sort of
like try and create a workflow like how
the paper is going to go but then Bob
doesn't occasion or you know kind of
work on the paper eventually takes you
know six months to write a paper where
it could only take six weeks if all the
authors could be working on the same
paper and you would avoid things like
you know versioning conflicts and
emerging complex and like brushing
problems and so on the other problem
that we're trying to solve is that of
you know really giving credit where its
what it's do so if there's multiple
authors working on the paper you should
be aware of all the edits that are being
done by done by all the other authors
we've seen this problem a lot I've seen
it personally myself I would send a
paper to a Calder sometimes maybe the
third or fourth other I was working with
and they end up and end up doing changes
to the tech or to the word document
whatever it is then it's any back by
email I have no idea because I cannot
keep track of everything that is
happening to the paper so your second
author or third my end up doing changes
that you weren't really expecting and
finally one of the most rewarding things
we're doing auditoria is working with
large collaborations when I say large I
mean really large one of the latest
papers actually sound for like 3-4
months ago that was co-authored
auditoria has 300 callers and 300 is a
lot if we can solve the collaborative
problems for those guys then we can
probably solve it for a number of other
disciplines because you know high energy
physics is Ayia is a discipline that is
not arias for a you know being large and
collaborative so up before okay here's
pretty much to them I'm gonna do and I'm
just going to do this for a minute
so if i go to my own authorial profile
that looks like this i just made a this
morning a new paper which awfully still
there it is there and it's got some all
my quarters are the people here in the
panel and as you can see you've already
seen otherwise i'm not going to do
anything at all but you know as I said
before if here I'm a quarter so I can
double-click anywhere and start editing
I can also highlight any part of the
article and just add comments comments
here so that works but in addition to
all of that there's two images i have
here the first one has data behind an
ipod a notebook and the second one is a
d3.js figure i can just interact with it
right there you know so for example your
i'm adding dots in the network nodes in
the network and just connecting them and
you know I can keep playing for this for
with this for hours but I'm just going
to stop there the idea is that it's a
paper that can have an interactive
component if you actually go to this
paper right now you can go to a Toria
calm / 12 619 you can either make in
very offensive comments and they're
going to show up on the screen or you
can play yourself with the way the
graphic and this is a cool way to just
create content that isn't interactive
and data-driven all the data that is
sitting behind this images is actually
on a Dory and i'm going to show you that
in a second before i do so i just told
you that there's an I fight on notebook
behind this image so I'm gonna launch
the ipython notebook dress is associated
with that image and I'm going to show
you how it works this is going to take a
few seconds but here it is I launched
the ipython notebook and all the code
and all the data that is associated with
the image is now available to anyone any
user that can produce the article and
the data and code behind the image now
you can actually execute the code and I
can reproduce the same plot that I have
in there I can change whatever I want
here the labels this is map will live so
it's all Python or I can change the data
play with it and then see how the
graphic out of the plotted image changes
by doing that the last thing I want to
show is that as I said before we're
built on get and every article is
essential
rendering / repository here's the
repository that has all the data files
that i showed you before so for if i go
to the figures i think it's called
figure it's a great name you can see
that there's the python notebook right
there so that you know you can actually
download play upload another ipython
notebook and the same thing for the
d3.js if you go to the d3 graph you will
see all the data behind the image right
here ah and that's about it sorry turn
over ll open your PDF if you tell your
life story while I do have to so you
don't rather you don't want the PDF the
browser and so high is that were
comparable yep let's cool and so I'm
Tiffany I'm the co-founder of standard
analytics we're a startup based in New
York City and we're focused on
publishing infrastructure and we took
the advice of a speaker earlier today
the heart and that a publishing company
should be barely visible and but watch
that space were producing some more
things to showcase what the
infrastructure can actually do just a
bit about myself and why I'm here up
until last year I was in academic
research I left Princeton was doing a
postdoc in applied mathematics in
epidemiology and I met my co-founder
there Sebastian and we were both just
frustrated with the speed of publication
and the way in which scientific
information gets disseminated and wanted
to address that and fix that focusing on
the actual infrastructure of the
publishing workflow and how things are
submitted so the question that we obsess
about is if you could redesign the
publishing workflow and the submission
system in particular today where would
you start what would it look like and
what would be important and one of the
things that we think would be incredibly
important is format and structure and so
we obsess about that in particular
thinking about web standards and
building those into the format of
publishing science this works
okay and I just want to start with a
disclaimer that I'm not introducing a
new standard we have lots of standards
and formats for publishing and so we're
not adding yet another one to the mix
and I think this is appropriate okay and
that's because we already have many
different formats for putting scientific
information on the web they're pros to
cons too many of these and we've heard
about different ones throughout today
and we've all use various forms for
putting this information online one of
the problems that I think a lot of the
folks we've heard from here our dressing
is the fact that we're missing
information when we're publishing some
of these formats for the rich data and
code and underlying resources don't get
brought along with that with the article
and linking across all these different
resources is becoming more and more
important and the other major problem is
that of discoverability our researchers
and folks are on all sorts of different
devices and they're searching for
science on Google and yet a lot of the
the format's that we're publishing in
aren't always picked up by the search
engines so how can we improve the
discoverability of scientific content
themselves the paid drank issue that was
brought up in the metrics talk but it's
a piece of the puzzle for sure and so
what I wanted to ask is if we could make
this mythical unified document format
what would it look like and again we're
not introducing a new standard it's just
kind of what what are the
characteristics of something that could
be underlying all these solutions and
the infrastructure behind the
information that we're publishing and
the first thing is is having machine
readable metadata actually in the
context of the final document is hugely
important another piece is it has to be
fully accessible and finally needs to be
responsive and work cross-device and be
easy to share and collaborate with so
these are just a few of the many things
that we might look for in a format and
structure and I would argue that to some
extent we have a lot of those pieces if
we look to some of the web technologies
that exist so html5 and css3 bring us a
lot of the way and what we're injecting
in particular is rdfa into the HTML to
help bring some more of that richness
and metadata that we're looking forward
to this format so we're looking at this
as a way of kind of underlying all that
the information that's
put online and I'll dive into that a
little more deeply so just starting with
the machine-readable metadata portion of
this potential format and so with HTML
and rdfa we start to gain some
understanding of the actual pieces of
that document and the data sets that are
inside a scientific article and making
that information more discoverable so
that we can then build collaborations
around it and really start to think
about how do we aggregate information
from different sources when we now
understand that a data set is indeed a
data set in different papers and I want
to just show you what you can get with
just putting HTML and rdfa together for
a scientific article so I'm going to
switch to play and then say how do I get
this out of full screen did ya oh there
we go all your secret notification okay
in touch regularly okay so i have this
is an HTML version of an actual article
and so i'm just going to copy and paste
that so it's HTML plus rdfa so we put in
our hour mark up in here and this is
just an online tool where you can see
what happens and when I paste it may be
no there goes okay so it's not there's
no style attached to it but this is the
paper on this side so you see the
article authors the background just the
basic structure of the document which is
all described in the HTML plus rdfa here
and below what's interesting is that
this now becomes essentially a graph so
an article can describe multiple layers
of content so we have authors here and
you get their person their email so you
understand the things inside that
document is no longer just top-level
metadata so it gives you access to a
whole new level of information that's
incredibly valuable when it comes to
search and discovery that's just what I
wanted to highlight about the metadata
that we're inserting into
these articles and that was the demo and
so the next piece is accessibility and I
won't talk long on here but it's
incredibly important and there's a whole
working group dedicated to accessibility
standards in HTML and rdf a and so you
can check out that spec if you're
interested but it's it's available and
it can be part of this format and
finally it just needs to be responsive
and cross device and this allows us to
collaborate not have to download custom
software and to really start using this
information and so epub is winning one
of many examples of formats that this
content needs to work across and HTML
gives you a nice starting ground for
doing all this conversions so the future
with this sort of unified format for
documents is really exciting and we've
seen pieces of this so with plot lee we
can get into interactive data
visualizations and d3.js as well and
authority asserts looking at ways of
bringing life to this data and the
figures behind articles and it's
scriptable we have JavaScript programs a
web and then we can start to get into
some really interesting extendable
behavior like web components and my
co-founders in particular are incredibly
excited about this and would love to
talk to you more about it when we have
more time and just to give you some
visual views of what we're thinking
about in terms of what this format can
give us one exciting thing is to really
start auto generating some some of the
meta information about these articles so
the semantic understanding within the
content so once you understand what's in
it then you can start to present this
information to others and the other is
just enriching the figures and things
that we've already seen so providing
links across all these different
resources directly in the articles
themselves native into the format and
the missing piece and the thing that
we're really focused on is the
infrastructure so how do you move from
existing formats and workflow today
through this nice flexible future format
and just to highlight this is a very
much a group effort this Sebastian and
Brian and myself working on this full
time and we're we're around session will
be at leweb
you're going would love to talk more
about this and with that I just like to
say thanks thanks Tim ok so one version
of how I got here is so so I'm a
computer scientist by training but I've
spent the last 25 years working in life
science informatics I was at the NIH at
the NCBI in the early 90s before there
was mosaic actually and I sort of date
myself by saying I worked on the PubMed
prototype which was running on a spark
10 and i spent about 10 years in a
start-up biotech company up here that
was relatively successful and it sort of
took a year out and was doing some
consulting i did some consulting for a
foundation that wanted to help
understand what the knowledge management
needs of neuro scientists were
particularly neurodegenerative
researchers and the boston area and i
also was doing some consulting for the
Harvard CIO at the time and I met Alyssa
and we sort of you know psyched each
other and doing some this project and
this I I see project that he that she
talked about which was really
interesting but so there were these two
things that were kind of coming together
with me for me which were how do you
help scientists manage and communicate
their knowledge especially in a complex
field where knowledge really isn't a
fixed thing it's always evolving things
that are asserted a and believed to be
true for some time or not but do not
remain true for all time there are
different opinions about what for
instance is the cause of Alzheimer's
disease and and then also the whole just
the whole question of innovative
computing approaches so I'm going to
talk a little bit today about a project
that we have done and my colleague pollo
chicken AZ here who is the
principal architect of this project and
you can chat with him at the the clock
at the cocktail hour he's the principal
architect of this project it's called a
netopia and it's a universal open
annotation services platform for the w3c
open annotation data model and it
provides fine-grained permission appear
to peer robust provenance and security
and supports any client that couldn't
communicate using this data model so you
could use what have you on the client
side and we have our own client but we
don't insist people use it our client is
called domi oh you saw this before the
old annotation model is oh you're
reading something in the New York Times
are on a blog or something and then you
add some comments and they just stick
there they stay there they're tied to
the server and the application the new
model is that there's a separate
annotation services layered the
annotations are are held separately from
the article and they the article or the
or in you know more advanced
applications anything really could just
be a URI someplace or a row in a data
set is targeted by by the annotations
and and the your application knows how
to position these properly so what we
said is oh well these annotation
services they have to consist of clients
and you know annotate ojs hypothesis
tomio which was mentioned in Utopia
documents etc and all of these guys
right back in service a back-end server
code and everybody's sort of wrapping
writing their own server you can see why
people need to have their own clients
right there's just a multiplicity of of
you is and applications but why
replicate everything why not have some
kind of common services model here and
we've been working on this for quite
some time it it's ready to go people can
people can contact us if you
want to use it we have it a number of
installations up and running and it
communicates using this data model which
you see there's a there's a is is a
triple or a set of triples it there's an
annotation that you are either points to
the target and then it has a body which
can be simple or complex it could be as
simple as a highlight or a comment or
could be as complex as a whole semantic
model right so here's some complex
annotation this is about some gap a
galaxy cluster if I know what that is
actually I think it is a galaxy cluster
and it it not only points to the URI of
the image but it has something called a
selector that actually describes a
region in the image that it's about and
then the the body or the payload of the
annotation instead of being a textual
comment it's a series of versions of
videos about the those clusters so very
complex annotation can be done so so
what we do with it and autopia is manage
this annotation for you in a lot in sort
of do a lot of interesting things with
it so we we support aggregated querying
and browsing permission engrossed we
have text mining connectors you can do
mashups and delight right so it D silos
the annotation so it can if the goal is
to make it a really a fungible first
class object on them on the web its own
is a first class object no longer
dependent on being attached to something
as a second class object so here's an
example I don't know can you see the
yellow that says open annotation this
this was done using de mayo platform
it's a hot just a simple thing of a
highlight of that it's written to the a
netopia platform and then we go into the
utopia documents PDF viewer and retrieve
it and it positions it in the PDF right
so it figures out all the formatting and
just does that and then as an example of
complex annotation here's
an article that's about Alzheimer's
disease the pilot highlighted in the
dome EO viewer you can put comments on
it you can put semantic tags on it you
can do very complex claim evidence
networks to say what's the graph of the
evidence supporting this assertion and
you can do a granular security model
that says okay this is this is probably
my private annotation but this is just
for this lab group and this is what
actually gets published and all that's
handled in the back end so here's a
quick example of why that sort of 81
among many use cases how many people
follow the OVA kata difficult oh not too
many so avocado was a researcher right
Kent Institute in Japan who published a
paper that said oh we can get
pluripotent stem cells from somatic
cells in a really simple way much better
than they laughed the elaborate ways
that are used today just by immersing
them in a low pH solution and turned out
that that was not reproducible she was
the only person who could do it and a
lot of people tried to reproduce it and
there was a tremendous amount of
discussion on the web in various forums
right kind of disconnected in a way but
there were blogs out of people's labs
and there was a pub here and PubMed
Commons and him grew and so forth and
the people finally started looking their
data and it turns out i will she
photoshopped that really terrible and in
fact the right hand report actually used
the post publication peer review on
these blogs to derive the evidence that
they used you know against her right and
it is very very very tragic I mean the
whole Institute's that did this got shut
down and I'll also say it was accepted
by the peer review process of nature
nature had no interested I mean they
just said oh that looks good to us look
at those great gels right they didn't
we're trying to reproduce it so let's
take a look at this and do some
and complex annotation first we're going
to put semantic tags on it from some
vocabularies at the national center for
biomedical ontology at Stanford all
right so we just tagged these inducible
pluripotent stem cells and stem cells
now let's do bike republication
argumentation tag so we're going to say
that this geez I need my just what I'm
going to say that this here is the claim
or the assertion has a relationship
supported by to this which is the data
okay and that's a really simple way of
doing an evidence graph and it helps you
in the following way so now we have an
evidence graph for this month for this
paper says here's what they reported
here their statements here the data that
supports the different statements okay
and now let's say that we did all of
those guys on all of those blogs had
simply published dear Aunt dear and
comments as open annotation and adopted
a few simple conventions so now we have
a we have a whole different kind of
thing here because we have assertions
here that challenge this this data and
another one that challenges this data
there is supported by this data so you
have an argument graph for the challenge
and the original assertions so this is a
more complex kind of thing that you can
do and there it's just one example of
stuff you can do with open annotation so
just to sum up a netopia is a universal
annotation server it's compliant with
the w3c open annotation data model paulo
is one of the editors of the spec and it
provides a back in technology so you can
focus on the user interface and not
worry about the persistence provides
granular permission text mining hooks
and oh
security so thanks okay so why am I here
six months ago on day six at big share I
presented at Amy's last event at the
University of Chicago so retribution but
also our founder and my colleague mark
Hanna was supposed to present or
actually wasn't even supposed to be here
and when it came out that he was
arriving and he was asked if he wanted
to present he said no so delegation um
so I'm going to talk about kind of the
open data landscape and where we see i
guess was point number three in linked
data and what's kind of driving all of
that and where I think that open data is
going so what you see here is what if
you've ever seen a presentation from
mark is the open access wave and in that
there are six points one is recommended
open access and recommended open data
mandated open access and mandated
opening data and then enforced open
access and enforced open data and as I
was talking with Amy today we're kind of
riding in the middle of the wave at
point number four which is enforced
building data or mandated open data and
we're seeing it in the UK one of the
nine main Thunder bodies is recommending
that all research outputs that are
funded by the government that they
receive from that institution be made
openly available by May first of 2015 or
they will not give funding to those two
to those institutions we're seeing in
Canada who recently announced that
they're doing a open data policy that
will be enacted and even here at
Microsoft the bill melinda gates
foundation announced earlier this week
that all funded projects from the Gates
Foundation will be open so and Microsoft
Research there we go thank you so who's
taking notice you can see here there's a
spike in searches for interest in big
data over time and then all of the
individual publishers who have popped up
we're now working in the big day
and opening data scene and then also
there is research around open data and
what exactly it means to individual
researchers so here you can see these
findings from this paper the number of
reuse of papers started to grow rapidly
several years after the data archiving
rate started to grow so you make your
data openly available citations will
follow but this is where we stood about
three years ago so you have data and
metadata that are being kind of lost in
the grand scheme of things send up to
write the paper the paper is then
accepted and is available on the web and
this is where we are today kind of a
plug for PLoS because actually work with
fig share but it's taking all the
metadata and making it openly available
and pulling it away from the standard
PDF so what this allows you to do is
instead of just being in a browser
working through PDF and there's an image
of the data you can then access the
actual file in its original format as it
was meant to be so you can really take a
look at the initial data in its initial
format if it's made openly available so
how do you get there there are a couple
points here data fairport is a
stewardship that is saying that all fair
data is the way to go that is making it
findable accessible interoperable and
reusable or fair but then there's also
the five-star data info and right now
we're kind of in between steps one and
two and I think in the short term step
three is three stars is really the goal
that we should be shooting for which is
making it out of data available on the
web it's available as machine readable
structured data and as a non-profit in
and I'm proprietary format so it can be
double-checked and now I kind of want to
explain data at the center of a larger
story as you can see from my twitter
picture i do like cycling and this is
the only figure plugged I promise the
data is at the center of research so
what we're trying to do at fig share is
capture all of the data that is
generated from point of research so
point of data management plan point of
Grand point of assignment all the way
through to public
and allowing the researchers not by
owning it ourselves but empowering them
to be one click away from making it
openly and publicly available or
archiving it but what this allows you to
do is if your data is openly available
there are other tools that are then
slowly starting to take a look at what
your data is doing if it's made
available are people tweeting about it
our people is it being published
actually in news articles and then once
your data is actually published how is
it being used beyond that and then it
becomes very very popular so you can
reproduce that data or reuse it and
build on top of it which again leads to
additional publications so that's kind
of the goal in the short term for open
data and I guess I don't really need to
preach the room when why open data is
really important but figured I'd mention
it slide so yes when we're talking about
what's essential for the article of the
future the first pieces repositories are
essential we're completely agnostic as
to where you put the content as long as
it's made openly available and as long
as it's linked so here if you create an
experiment and the data is generated and
thrown into fig share you can then pull
that data that is similar and a bunch of
different tags and throw it into potli
and create an open and an open
experiment and then the second piece is
a pis are essential so we were talking a
lot today about interoperability and you
really do need to make the API is open
and accessible to the community in order
to work and create those links that
we're just talking about in the previous
slide an example that I always like to
use when I present fig share is one of
the professors at the Imperial College
of London dr. Henry zepa who uses his
crystallography machine to automatically
fill in all the metadata fields once he
runs an experiment which is then pushed
directly to his fig share profile and
auto populates it and makes it publicly
available with one click so it's just
some of the cool things that you can do
once you make your API openly available
also persistent identifiers zar
essential so I think all of the authors
of this paper actually in the room so if
you have question
you may want to direct it towards them
but what this is showing is astronomy
papers and the amount of broken links
over time so if you take a look on the
left side here as recently as almost
about 15 years ago fifty percent of
astronomy papers had broken links and
when you hear broken links are like oh
well that could be from anywhere but if
you look at where it was coming from you
have harbored NASA Caltech MIT so few
eyes persistent identifiers making sure
your data doesn't go away if it does
move around is really important and I
believe open access and liberal licenses
are essential so making it accessible to
reuse and reproduce the data as needed
and then finally what does the future
hold for the paper of the future this is
funders will mandate I say immediate but
you know post-publication data sharing
journals will enforce data sharing
liberal licenses for all web based data
will become a standard and data will
live and a linked hopefully open
discover a bowl repository so
hiding end of the afternoon session so
this is where you're going to ask your
crazy questions so go ahead right
there's back oh wait we have a
microphone it's a little hard to hear
from their second I thank you very much
um what I have initially is really are 2
comments um I think almost I mean I
really love Galileo Galilei but
publishing of material that you could
say going along with technical um it has
at least another hundred years before
him so I would say if one ever bother to
look Ariana tacular 1300s or your nada
da Vinci Code axis you know which is
about 100 years later we'd see a really
not a whole lot of technical material
being published now it was understood
that's a different thing but it was
published and available and that was how
they market their services so then I
think you know we should you know take
it with a grain of salt and then I think
we should take a bucket of salt
pooh-poohing lay tack and tack the idea
that you know later cause boot boot here
I mean it to me is absolutely horrid
okay Leslie Lamport was feted in this
room few months ago when he got tutoring
prize and that was built you know in the
top of work that was done for Don come I
mean poor cry out largest people want to
Rainey Awards these people make Grace
Hopper awards its people have written
the foundations what some of of work is
done there you know what our analysis of
algorithms you know the father of
detailed analysis of distributed
computing I think we should take this
you know step back we have great tools
to die but we should honor those who
build the first step in and I think what
have been doing today it's a lot of
progress there is a worldwide things to
do and I think it's wonderful the
opportunity is the idea of the Semantic
Web and linked data I have coordinated a
team that won the first joint that TD
out and his group had a prototype of
course during AIP RMIT what four or five
years ago my team is smallest he warned
this great if i can if i could working
on that and i think we should put a
little bit more respect in goregaon our
founders sure so so on the UNAC LMAO
point as the astronomer here i think
i'll answer that question and so so i
don't think that's really a question I
think Alberto was just trying to make
the point that Galileo embedded his data
in the publication and I don't think
you're really trying to say that that
was the first time that that was ever
done the interesting point about Galileo
which I were to did not mention is that
when the manuscript was published rather
than his hand drawn drawings you
actually could not correctly reproduce
the orbit of Jupiter's moons because the
movable type was not movable enough to
put the points in exactly the right
place only the hand-drawn drawings are
actually right from his notebooks and to
me the important lesson there is that
you don't want technology to limit the
communication of the raw data I think
that's the takeaway message for today on
your second point about pooh-poohing
tech I think we were pursuing the
usability of tech compared to other more
recently developed systems and I don't
think anybody would try to insult the
founders you want to say more about that
okay probably your paper was in markdown
but anyway uh we're just making fun of
ourselves and other stuff but we're not
being incompetent tech users yes hey so
we have another anyway well so maybe I'm
coming from completely the other side of
the spectrum then then the woman back
there come for the biological sciences
where no one uses tech they use horrible
non interoperable things like Microsoft
Word and and so
for example and so uh I'm sitting here
thinking about you know authorial and
you know overleaf and all these kinds of
things thinking you know wow this is you
know this is really neat this is really
futuristic but I can't see a single one
of my colleagues ever like actually
using these tools because it's so far
beyond what they know they don't even
use latex you know they you know there
is there really a long way from this so
how do you go from the really really
like you mean I love this stuff because
I'm super geeky right but how do you go
from there to the actual outreach to the
people who really only know you know
Excel in Microsoft Word and those sorts
of things yeah so I think these these
questions are actually more related than
they might seem at first right we
wouldn't be talking about Leigh Tekkit
all here if it weren't like the most
beautiful and powerful system there is
and and we wouldn't be talking about
Microsoft Word if it weren't really easy
to use and really better than good yeah
make make good things out of and you
know I'd say for for all of us here the
goal is to make these platforms usable
by everybody you know flatly is really
proud about the fact that actually our
largest user segment is high school and
middle school students you know doing
their physics and chemistry experiments
I'm just you know putting in a few data
points that they took by hand and doing
a best-fit line right you can do that
really easily and I think the same is
true of the goals of authority ax and
many of these other platforms did you
want
no I mean I guess I was going to say
that I think these that the point here
for these tools is is if you go what why
how could you write latex and make it
really popular is because as part of
this whole unit secret system at the
time right and so the point here that
we're that for for us is being part of
an ecosystem where people are kind of
sharing components and reusing each
other's stuff and and that's how things
get used and reused and hack to modified
and refined enough to end to to be part
of a useful sort of chain of value right
I'm curious you designed it built these
systems I can a lot of lot of value
especially in the collaboration
components as a user of your own system
how has it actually changed the way your
lab works communicates achieves its
outcomes sure sure um so I have a group
that has anywhere from you know about
four or five graduate students and at
the moment we have 11 postdocs which is
too many don't tell them anyway anyway
um and what we do when we write
collaboratively with people all over the
world and we typically like the last
paper the first paper that was actually
done in authorial was this paper about a
new way to measure the structure of the
Milky Way that's called the bones of the
Milky Way and actually got a lot of
press for the paper and forth aria and
that had 11 authors and so I can tell
you the experience of working with those
11 authors on authorial when it was
brand new about six of them embraced it
and the other five I opened it enough to
get their name not rent if you notice
some people's names are read that's
because they didn't sign in okay um and
then when they did embrace it they
realized hey wait this is great like I
can edit this section and then you're
locked out of editing that section when
I am
you know I'm editing it and they thought
that that was better than google docs in
the end that paper was written in latex
by the way inside of authorial and then
it was extraordinarily frustrating to
get it to the final final submitted
bulverde had to take it out of ORD we
couldn't just there is no submission
system from inside of authority so this
is where there's a connection to what
Alberto is around what tiffany is doing
and in the next iteration of all of this
those kinds of systems would be
connected and all of the figures would
be you know formatted the way a journal
wants them and all of the late egg would
be exactly in whatever style file the
journal want and there would be a button
that says submit this instead there's a
button that says export to latex and
then you have to start editing it and
the issue is then you get the comments
back from the publisher and then you're
not going to go back to authorial so if
you go find that paper on the Thorian
now it's being published in the
astrophysical journal tomorrow actually
coincidentally if you go look at that
it's not exactly the same as the atharva
and we had to put in the authorial
version the archived version of this
paper is here and tomorrow we'll put the
apt j version of this papers here this
represents a collaborative first draft
the paper so right now for a kind of
willing audience it's a really good way
to make a first draft with a lot of
people working on at the same time just
like upper to said and then I don't know
you tell me a couple of years you know
they'll probably be a button that says
submit it to the journal and Amy asked
me to make some comments at the end and
I will and one of them is something that
I think you pointed out which is that
you have to make it easy enough for
people to be better than what they had
before a lot of people have mentioned
that today and I think when there's a
button that says submit this to a
journal then those five people whose
names were still read unless I made them
change it don't do it or is it just the
publication process I believe you might
have seen well it's cool sorry is it a
tool that's actually caused your lab to
start collaborating before research is
ready for publication you're like oh
it's so here are some results and i'll
type it here and we can edit
and sort of iterate on it before we even
thinking about publication i would say
that in our lab we've been doing that
with google docs for several years and
so it's just a question of whether
people prefer auth Aria or Google Docs
and the ipython functionality actually
now makes people prefer Authority
something I just had one thing to add to
that having having a good way to make
use of the metadata and the connections
between data really does enhance you
know some of the other speakers have
talked about instrumenting your your lab
equipment and having it spit out all
this information having a good way to
use that as a really good incentive for
the or the researcher to collect it in
the first place and to get those kind of
systems in place because you see value
of it in your own work before you start
publishing and then it it contributes to
the community as well and I just wanted
to add on I mean in our own studies from
a microsoft research perspective I think
completely reinforces what you guys have
done we we have worked with full
knowledge of Leslie Lamport often times
in our building to try and understand
what it is about la tech that set
certain communities are continuing to
hold on to and the whole that the top
two things are either it's what we
submit to the journals but more often it
was I want to have a much more granular
control around the way that figures and
images are displayed but what I also
want are they shouldn't use led to
connect day's work you should use Apple
pages but anyway it's certainly not
worried even though word and a lot of
progress in an handling of mathematical
equations that was one of the areas but
they also wanted in line commenting they
wanted to be able to send drafts around
to bring them together so let me a lot
of examples that we saw today are
addressing those usability concerns with
teams using late Agnes so one of the
themes that I heard relatively
consistently especially in the first
three presentations was distributing
data along with the figures that were
being presented I've played around a
little bit with ipython
book and every time I've seen that
happen in the things that I've been
experimenting with the data was nowhere
close to being ready for analysis not
only because it was difficult to
download and run on my own personal
machine and like getting the right
software in order to run it but also it
was kind of on not very clean or any of
the systems that you guys are
representing offer tools to help with
really getting that data shareable in a
way that analysis can happen right away
either because you're hosting the
analysis machine or like stuff like that
so is your question about the data being
in a poor format when you when you first
get it and like what's so format is a
little bit of it most of it is so
ipython notebook has a a place where you
can just read the notebooks but if you
want to mess with the data you have to
then download it and do a significant
amount with it in order to actually you
know experiment with matt expert but um
mess with the day to yourself and i was
wondering if any of the systems that you
guys are talking about make that easier
if we're talking about good user
interfaces and share ability and
portability of data that seems like a
big thing yeah so um I can I can answer
that from motley side anyway we we have
a couple of ways that people can get
their data into our system you know if
you're coming in through ipython or some
through one of the language api's it's
it's up to the original author to bring
it in but once it gets into a figure
it's it's in a standard format because
it has to be for us to be able to read
it and we also accept people just
uploading files through the web
interface and in that case we'll we'll
go through a full cleaning before it's
anything else is done with it so yeah we
take that problem very seriously I can
just say a couple of things I was a
little rash the representation so I
didn't cover it but there's a way to you
know every time you add an image into
authorial you can act
data by data right now we mean any CSV
tsv or you know a JSON file d3.js I by
the notebook then just to answer your
question what we're doing when i
launched the ipython notebook is that
we're actually spinning like a dedicated
server it's a daughter instance
container and we were actually you're
essentially it's like the same as
running the scientists work bench on
your machine but you're running it on on
a virtual server so in the cloud and
another point I wanted to make is that
the reason it's funny that I'm actually
sitting between Alex who's like a little
more early like life cycle in research
and Tiffany there is a little more like
that towards the submission ready part
of like the research writing life cycle
but the reason that we're we're trying
to include data together with images and
in the paper is that I think that you
know we've talked a lot about
reproducibility and I think that one
important thing is that we need to try
and capture data as early as possible in
the research lifecycle a lot of data
management data management plan ideas
that I've seen revolve around going to
go ask for for data after the paper is
already published and that's too late
you know by the time I published a paper
Alyssa wrote the bones of the Milky Way
paper about a year ago almost ready two
years ago so if Chris earn money from
the cfa goes around asking for the data
that alyssa used in the paper that's two
years ago that she in the date of birth
it's in the data versus that's your
Alyssa that's why but otherwise a you
know it would be already too late and
probably the data is gone already or
it's like sitting on a server that it's
not accessible anymore so the idea is
that I think that when an author is
writing the paper the beta is available
the research code that is associated
with an image and that's the moment that
we need to capture the data and then all
the data management plans requirements
will be a lot easier to satisfy so so I
think one of the issues that comes up is
a you know the date data so in a lot of
molecular biology papers the data is a
bunch of images right like the paper I
was talking about earlier but you know
if you're talking about a next-gen
sequencing study or something you're not
going to include
the data with the paint or wood and in
what you know my colleague here was
talking about the from pick share was
what was I think precisely what NIH and
a lot of other places are going towards
which is the notion you're going to put
it in a stable repository it's going to
have a direct citation the same way that
a journal article would have they have a
citation that's actually contained in
the references and a plot it's not just
oh here's the data for this paper but
it's this assertion it is based upon
this data and the other thing that I
think NIH is really interested in and
there were a lot of discussions about
this recently is is citation of proper
citation of methods that includes
software right so I know that the szon
odo guys have this whole collaboration
with github where you can get a DOI for
your right for your software there's
also work that a colleague of ours in
that's associated with force 11 mary ann
martin is done to to cite research the
agent they in a way that they the
citation goes right to a massive catalog
that tells you exactly what was used and
it's kind of astonishing but when people
are trying to reuse antibodies or cell
lines and things in some of these
studies the way that they're described
in the literature is often terrible and
you just really can't figure out what
people actually how they actually did
the experiment and that's to me by the
way that's the hugest reproducibility
issue is not being able to reproduce
methods and I think what we're going to
take one more question but I just want
to add in honor of my librarian friends
that Chris erdman here is one person I
know who runs a data scientist training
for librarians but he also tries to
educate the researchers at the Center
for Astrophysics about ways to store and
archive and reference their data and i
think that there's a really large
component of trying to educate the next
generation so that they won't find
themselves in this position for too much
longer so
just one quick comment there's some
interesting stuff going on in the social
sciences to with empirical legal
research and a lot of stuff going on
reproducibility and political science
that we've been involved in and to get
back to your original question
victorious dog into a lot of people in
the room no she started with some money
from Sloan and some others to create a
company run my coat to literally do the
different things in different platforms
on the cloud and that's been kind of
recast as research compendium so those
may be two things to look at as far as
being able to take data and play with it
in different applications in the cloud
kind of the next step beyond what these
tools are doing with figures and grass
thank you inspired by your bar video
since I'm holding you back from drinking
oh the appropriate question could you
each speak very briefly about
prognosticating five years from now in
your work in your area in your space
what is going to happen because it has
to happen now that you have the solution
in your mind but what unbelievably
annoying problem in your space just is
going to get solved by somebody kidney
dorm room etc start from dan caster
that's ever way you want I can pass it
or just taking it um what problem I kind
of talked about this when we were
talking about the wave which is once it
be curious to hear from anyone in the
room if they don't think that point six
will be reached which is mandated open
data mandated open access we still do
have a way to go but I think it's going
to become more of the popular lexicon
within from researchers themselves and
that just starts with advocacy it's it's
really about making sure that everybody
knows that making data open isn't a bad
thing um my girlfriend got published for
the first time two weeks ago and she
didn't publish open access and I asked
her why and she said it's because her
tenure committee does not accept open
access publications so I think we still
have a really long way to go
she's at Queens College and CUNY and it
was digital humanities that that is all
okay yeah I'll go so I brona's time to
speak no i think i think that i think
the the data data and resource citation
is going to be mandated by by nih with
over the next five years for sure for
sure and i also think that I'm kind of
taking a bet on the web annotation thing
it I think it's transformative all the
sort of early digital hyphen hypermedia
systems that preceded the web had a
characterized links like this right they
had type links and and they were sort of
factored out by berners-lee to kind of
make it all simpler which was a good
move but I think now you know you can
restore these back and I think it really
makes it gives a lot more power to the
web once they take off I think one of
the things that I think would be amazing
and maybe we're not so far up is
thinking about kind of automatically
generating some level of meta reviews so
getting the same like when you search
for a restaurant today you get all the
information you need without having to
click five times through and getting
that same level of kind of information
about a research topic with a single
kind of search query so getting that
that meta level of information because
we have such a good understanding of
what's inside of all this published
content so kind of rethinking search at
least at the highest level in search
results I'm fascinated by what a lot of
young scientists are doing and by young
I mean a lot younger than me I know that
you always refer to me as the younger
bet though because of like all the other
editors in your life but i'm thinking
like like 20 year olds scientists that
just don't understand why a lot of
science is still published the way that
is published and submitted to the
journals in a certain way so a a lot of
young scientists are doing sign
that is clearly more computational and
data-driven so for them it's just normal
to include data alongside text and
images when you're writing a paper and
the second part is that it's a lot more
collaborative you know they're all
exposed to git and github so they know
that you know their work is
collaborative in nature so I think that
these two components of like you know
more data-driven computational work on
one on the one hand and on the other and
it's also the idea of more collaboration
yeah the thing I see that's already
progressed quite a ways but I think it's
going to get a lot farther and to the
point of you know dirty data and stuff
the ability to take any work that was
done on or connected to any computer and
reproduce it on any other computer
anywhere we'll just that that
transformation will allow everybody to
to have much more confidence in what
they see and and it will allow a lot
more interdisciplinary connections to
happen I want to mention something that
I don't think so mention except for the
public buys or publicize I don't know
how you pronounce it nice presentation
earlier today which is I think that the
other thing that younger scientists are
interested in today more than they were
before is really communicating their
work to the public and I think that as
data become available and figures become
interactive and more data supported that
you're going to see kind of spontaneous
citizen science where people actually
start manipulating what they can get out
of literature and that these new
services that you hear about to
translate articles and just sort of
purposely put public outreach
information out there will will
facilitate that anyway so thank you all
panel members
uh d for joining us today I want to
thank the folks who joined us online as
well and I mostly just wanted to get
this captured in the video but I really
appreciate I think that it was a
wonderful discussion and you know except
for some comments by William oh really
well I hope that we can help continue
this mention force 11 so i think i
really think that the you know the next
continuation of this conference is very
in january and oxford so if people are
continued interested in continuing to
participate in this sort of discussion
do look for the horse 11 conference yes
I just wanted to add my thanks and
especially to Microsoft for hosting this
wonderful day what am i drinking is a
midori sour so these these are glasses
you can take home go enjoy
each year microsoft research helps
hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
