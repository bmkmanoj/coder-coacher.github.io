there are similar ones and that's to
paint the new thing is the painting is
actually done physically simulating
every aspect of the painting the brush
the paint how they mix and before
powerful computers that people have in
their homes now this was not possible
but now it is
hi I'm bill Baxter with the ex EG
application incubations group and we're
here to tell you about project Gustav
today which is what we've been working
on it's a realistic painting experience
so if you think about painting programs
they've been around for a very long time
but really in some ways they've just
been a caricature of real painting so if
you think about real painting it's very
very complex you have something like a
brush with thousands of individual
bristles that all deform you loaded with
paint and each one can interact with the
complex texture of the canvas to create
you know really exciting and interesting
organic kind of forums on the canvas and
it's not really been possible to do that
kind of thing until fairly recently
because of the amount of computing power
that's required to do that so we've been
working on on algorithms that almost let
us do that on current machines so
Nelson's going to show you a quick demo
here hi I'm Nelson Chiu also from the
exergy group so here is our application
it is currently running on the this
affordable pc here so we work off to
make it this application runs very well
on this computer and here i can show you
with the latest touch capabilities
available on the pc we now can show you
this for a natural touch-enabled finger
painting like this and you can just you
can see i can smear the painting like
this right on the screen freund rich
color blending over taking over flex
here and this is very quick fun for kids
and everybody actually that's right even
for serious artists and designers the 3d
brush simulations we offer really give a
lot of control over strokes that hasn't
that hasn't been possible before so we
can take our 3d brush and come over here
to the palette and mix together some
colors here and we're not just creating
a single color we actually load the
brush up here as you do this with a
complex blend of color so that when you
come over to paint on the canvas you
have this kind of rich mixture of
different colors with natural kind of
streaks that all these little simulation
parameters are available
to the artists to make their work kind
of more like the real thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
