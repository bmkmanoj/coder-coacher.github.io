you
so five years ago this week I was in
Mimi itõs office you may not remember
this this is a true story and and I was
explaining to me me why it's so
important for me to teach people how to
search and she said to me dan you don't
understand it's like teaching people how
to turn on the light switch you remember
this yeah you have succeeded your
company has succeeded in making search
boring get over it and I thought in my
usual suave and illiterate and
sophisticated way I said but but but but
and now I have an answer it only took
five years and the answer is that there
are a lot of capabilities in search that
people don't realize and so I want to
help you be a smarter person through the
mechanism or our cognitive amplifier
called Google right so what I do now is
I help teachers understand how to search
more intelligently so this is me way in
front of that room teaching a whole pack
of teachers the intricacies and the
beauty of doing search in a way that
uses some of you know there's this myth
that we use ten percent of our brain the
truth is you use ten percent of Google
let me tell you the other ninety percent
right and so this is what I do so I do a
lot of this kind of training um if
you're in Palo Alto during the january
i'm teaching every thursday night come
to the mitchell park library so one of
the things i do is i teach people this
thing that you think everybody knows how
many of you have ever searched for text
an electronic document raise your ok ten
percent of you are lying right the
reason i know this because this is
command f that is control up depending
on how you swing okay and if you go to a
document like this and say how long did
it take me to run this race i know
because i do experiments i know that it
takes some people a lot longer so here's
a nice sample size this is the response
time in second
okay in seconds that means there are
still people searching for Helen took me
to run that race after 300 seconds what
are they doing that's five minutes right
i mean think about it um what's really
fascinating though to me is that when
you look at the people who took more
than two minutes a quarter of them are
wrong this is for a trivial problem it
is not trying to understand the
relationship of Palestine to Israel
right this is just trying to figure out
how long it took me to run this 8k race
so that fascinates me and it tells me we
have a long way to go because when i did
this big survey a ninety percent of us
english-speaking internet users do not
know this what's more half of all
teachers in the united states don't know
this your teachers in your school your
kids teachers right they don't know this
ok nalysis 50k firefox users 93% have
never done this really how do you
function reading electronic documents
and not knowing how to find a text trip
right there are people that you know who
books that you have read there in your
classes that do not know this it floored
me so this is why I teach because
there's so many things to know and one
of the things I do is I go around and I
teach a lot of people the various tools
that we have right ctrl f is sort of the
simplest one it works for everything I'm
telling you now if you don't know this
it works in PowerPoint works in Acrobat
works in firefox works in chrome works
everywhere and a lot of people don't
know that so so one of the things I do
is I go around and teach people things
like how to use Google Translate or how
to use you know spreadsheets or whatever
right and it's fascinating to me to
realize that the depth of ignorance is
astonishing it's just astonishing so one
other thing I do is I like I said I
teach a lot of teachers but I also keep
my hand in by going to schools and so
not very far away from here is foster
city and for people who are not here
from here foster city is about halfway
down the peninsula it's a super diverse
school district right you have 30 kids
in a classroom you have 30 different
languages spoken at home Farsi Hebrew
German you name it there's a kid in that
class so I went in to miss Rama swans
fourth grade class computer skills class
right and they're mostly learning Excel
and control laughs and things like that
um so I went taut and I one of the
things I taught since the classroom
language space was so diverse I taught
them how to use Google Translate makes
sense right and so since this was a
fourth-grade class two weeks later I get
a package of thank-you notes from the
class you know it's very sweet right
thank you dr. Russell for showing us how
to use Google Translate and the best one
was from this little boy named armando
who said thank you for showing me how to
use google translate because now i can
write letters to my grandmother in
Honduras see his parents don't want him
to know Spanish it's a downwardly mobile
language for his family so I taught him
this one little trick that allows him to
write letters to his abuelita's in
Honduras and that made me incredibly
happy thank you
okay me me a story about you and then a
talk by you it's that was not actually
planned so it's been about 25 years
since we've started to try to engineer
digital environments to support learning
for kids and I haven't been following it
for quite that long but almost that long
and what i found is that a lot of the
scripts that genre is that we use to do
this are incredibly resilient over that
time so back in the day when i was doing
my dissertation research it was titles
like jumpstart to does anybody I don't
know you guys weren't tracking this back
then so you know this is about
achievement anxiety about you know
standardized curriculum fairly down and
we have Khan Academy and then back then
we had like puppets great adventure
pajamas Sam I don't know if you guys
remember these today you have most of
the apps that kids play with on iPads
and then every once in a while you have
something like some city which breaks
the genre between those very resilient
categories of entertainment versus
education that structure most of kids
experiences with anything that might be
considered family friendly or learning
software and a Sim City isn't the only
one obviously like if you're old enough
to remember logo programming and today
we have scratch I'll give a shout-out to
scratch because Andres is in the room or
I don't know do folks know little big
planet it's yeah it's one of the better
ones out there and then DIY door so
there have historically been these
titles that live in the space between
entertainment and education that tend to
have a very loyal but relatively small
following and that enables kids to not
only have fun Butler
and stop and ideally learn stuff in the
context of problem solving and making
stuff and things that a lot of
progressive educators care about so oh
so what makes minecraft different in
this lineage and so I don't know you
guys probably all follow this the 2.5
billion dollar acquisition by our very
own Microsoft and this is notches house
he bought us 70 million dollar home the
most expensive home in Beverly Hills it
it's rumored that he beat out jay-z and
Beyonce for this house and the the
greatest thing is the candy wall of
course so part of what makes minecraft
different is that notch is a rockstar
right so we have never had a title in
this genre before that has achieved this
level of success I mean of course
minecraft is the most successful indie
game of all time but you know all of us
who have loved SimCity on these other
titles suddenly we've been handed an
opportunity that's never existed before
in the sense that this is a game that is
not only in the constructivist
progressive all of those things that you
know us left leading progressive
educators care about but that kids are
playing at a massive scale and in fact I
think one could argue that notch is
probably the only game designer ever
that kids know their name like an
average kid asked a twelve-year-old ask
a fourteen-year-old do you know the name
of a game designer this is the only game
that they'll be able to come up with the
name of the designer so it's it's epic
right for those of us in our space this
is a tectonic shift in our opportunity
space for using digital games or digital
media in general to support not the
drill and practice content focus stuff
not the oh it's keeping our kid busy
while we're having dinner stuff but the
stuff
that those of us who care about
creativity and problem solving for kids
might actually want to support and be
able to leverage not just for our own
children but for regular kids who aren't
part of the teco leads in the creative
class so that's what's exciting about
Minecraft and why you can ask Lily
around reyes or Lars we've been running
a minecraft camp and this is just an
example of you know the kind of learning
that kids are getting which is not only
about them making stuff which is great
but also about the social learning and
civic engagement and learning to get
along with others and learning community
organizing that we get in the open
Internet ok I'm going to apologize ahead
of time because my slides are the least
pretty ones here and it's because a lot
of the work that I'm talking about was
taking place and really boring Excel
files and purchase orders and how about
shopping pages and none of those things
are very pretty um but so I'm going to
start off by telling you guys some
advice that my dad gave me once which is
that every startup in order to be
successful needs at least one of its
founders to be kind of an asshole and I
used to every now and then tell him
about okay this friend of mine is
starting a startup with a couple of
co-founders and my dad would be like
okay well which one of them is the
asshole so when I told him that I was
starting one with my co-founder he
didn't ask so so I'm going to give you
this caveat which is that for the most
part I actually really enjoyed my
experience manufacturing a hardware
product in China the factory that we did
most of our work with was really great
they cared about quality they taught us
how to work with them and and we had a
mostly pretty good experience but I
think there's a lot of unbridled
optimism in this area and I really enjoy
raining on parades because see previous
slide so so I'm going to talk about a
few things that I saw that were just
kind of shady and underhanded and
dishonest
in a few different domains so the first
thing is in prototyping um what's great
about being in China when you're
prototyping is that you can pick up
electronic components super fast from
the markets if you're based in shen jen
you know you basically go across the
street and buy yourself some you know at
megas in this case this happened a
friend of mine where they put together a
prototype and mysteriously for some
reason they're PCB was not working and
he lost two or three days to debugging
this thing until he found that there is
actually no power coming out of their
boost regulator so he took out that
integrated circuit and he's super glued
it to a little bored and he just sanded
off all the plastic basically trying to
get to see what was inside we didn't
have an x-ray so that's normally what
you would do and basically what he found
was that he had been sold a chip that
was solid plastic with just a couple of
like the metal solder points and that
actually this is not the worst possible
thing that could happen the worst thing
that could happen is you have something
a counterfeit that works intermittently
which makes it actually much much harder
to bug and then you lose a couple of
weeks so so this happens sometimes it
didn't happen to me directly so and the
reason I didn't happen to me directly is
because we had a sourcing guy that we
trusted and what was great about this
guy he was pretty transparent with us
and see you can see in this column over
here that he'll tell us if he's getting
us apart that's new and original and
gotten all aboveboard through official
channels um or if it's refurbished does
anyone here have a guess as to what he
means by refurbished yes it means stolen
so refurbished can mean that someone has
taken it off of a board and that it
actually is a recycled part but our guy
does not tell us those he will only sell
a stolen product because he is an
ethical businessmen who wants to make
sure that he only sells us things that
will work reliably so so we like this
guy uh we we don't buy the refers to so
more sourcing this is another fun one so
this is from an Aliexpress page that a
friend of mine found and I want you to
pay very close attention to this because
it says it shows 128 gigs and it can
save 16 gigs
and this is another kind of fabulous
example of like transparency in your
shadiness so so this is I love this
quote cheap must has its reason it's so
cheap must has its cheap reason so they
basically point out that like this is
not a full capacity card it will report
is being 128 gigs it actually has 16
gigs and if you want it to be that cheap
you better not expect anything different
um and that if you actually want
something that's better quality they can
also sell you that at a higher price um
so what I love about this is that these
are not unethical people they just have
a very specific kind of business ethic
which is that you don't screw your
immediate customer but if your customer
wants to screw their customer that's
their business and then you maybe don't
pay too close attention to like what
your source is doing to get the things
they're selling you but it's but it's
actually interesting because there's
there's you want to have a long-term
relationship with your clients and so
you treat them well and so that's that's
kind of what that ethic is based on so I
was really amused by these just sort of
transparently shady dealings going on
like in full view on Aliexpress so one
thing that happened to us while once we
got to kind of the manufacturing phase
something that you may hear happen
sometimes as your manufacturer will kind
of bait and switch you on price so these
are two versions of the same purchase
order and this was what you're buying
some LEDs we got the quote first in
dollars and they quoted us 1000 hundred
eighty dollars and we said I don't know
it's you know we can we can pay you we
can pay you in RMB so they sent us
another quote that was 8500 RMB ok so
remember the u.s. price they just kind
of tried to hide a price increase in the
exchange rate and like hoped we wouldn't
notice and that they had an actual
reason there's like a value-added tax
they just didn't want to tell us about
and actually have that discussion so
what I did was uh there's this technique
um so this is this is we're now getting
into like kind of shady things that I've
done um so what sure it's not none of it
is that bad none of its illegal so
but so so what happened was I just kind
of stalled and didn't tell them anything
one way or the other until they'd
actually made the batch of LEDs for us
and had them boxed up and ready to go
for us and then I said I'm not paying
that extra tax what do you plan to do
and I heard that actually later read
about this apparently that's an actual
thing that people do it's called
knocking up your factory um but um
anyway and this was like a little bit of
a risk on my parks is essentially a
commodity product they probably could
have found another buyer for it but it
was just more expedient for them be like
okay fine like fine we won't charge you
the tax this time just just take it okay
so um so anyway so that was not that bad
there's another another instance we've
had with a factory where we had sort of
gone through we done or tooling with
them they had they had our molds which
if you don't realize they're like super
heavy and they're pretty expensive
they're very very hard to move so you're
kind of committed to a factory once you
do that and then once we got to actually
and we got in a quote for our first run
of injection molded parts and then when
we got to actually doing the purchase
order it ended up costing like twice as
much as they quoted us because they
added in a bunch of stuff they never
mentioned which was things like a
surface treatment packing things up
assembly time that kind of thing and
that got added by the boss at the very
last minute and it's still unclear to me
whether he was actively dishonest or
just really disorganized but at any rate
they basically had us over a barrel and
we couldn't afford the amount that they
want to want to increase the per piece
price so what happened was I actually
realized at some point during this email
exchange and we were trying to argue
them point by point based on like actual
rational things which never worked with
your factory don't do it um I found out
that our sales manager was actually
really disgruntled because this is
something that her boss did all the time
and when that happens customers get
upset and they yell at the sales manager
who has absolutely no control over this
kind of thing and the other thing is the
sales managers are usually ladies um in
my experience and their clients are
almost always dudes so I was like a
rarity in this situation so when we
wanted to have meeting with these guys
what I did was I said um hey Julie um I
really need to pee
where the bathroom is can you show me
and so he went and had a little bit of
girl talk and then I pumped her for
information I found out because she was
pissed off at her boss uh here's how
much money they're actually making off
of you per piece here's how much they
would have made if they didn't do this
price increase and so I was actually
able to negotiate them down and claim
that we were going to do a much bigger
wrong with them liquor and that really
we can make this happen for the
long-term relationship um so anyway so
that was just a few of the kind of shady
things I've seen shady things I've done
um fun times I hope if anyone here is
planning to do a manufacturing run over
their first product wait till I have a
couple more drinks and then come talk to
me I'm shocked but not that shot cuz a
lot of people Ike to hear about it so
this is how I lost 60 pounds in nine
months right the best benefits is that
one glass of wine really really works
i'll tell you as i can attest the worst
thing is your favorite leather coat that
you bought like seven months ago doesn't
now the doors are closed i don't really
need it but all right so it's what
relates it to the conference i would say
it's a i'm a beta tester for this thing
it's just a little over a year old and
i've been using it for almost a year now
it's freeware it's an app on android or
I you know itunes social media it's on
facebook and it also then forces you to
use your iPhone or any phone or your
tablet every day to consult it to figure
out what you can eat and until you
understand it and then after you do lose
the weight it to learn to now eat not to
lose weight put to stay healthy and and
stay where you're at so uh my vaio fit
biofit which is right here the doctor
invented is jeff dunham harvard trained
doctor and mighty PhD in low it's about
low glycol science helps people with
cancer diabetes
hark these heart disease as well good so
here's a low-tech just some architect
print here so biofit 60 pounds so look
this is the 10 inch and we all know
these things right the science I won't
talk about I'll talk about how to do it
I'll give some stories but we'll start
with the first the story so a year ago
my birthday a friend showed up hadn't
seen him in five months and he was like
60 pounds lighter yeah he did it
hardcore he went to a doctor wasn't
feeling good he'd hit 50 years old and a
doctor made him strip like a normal
physical except he didn't take his
measurements or check anything he just
grabbed him by the shoulder and turned
him around into a mirror and said here
you go 50 is the hill everything is
downhill from there is this the mountain
you want to start the rest of your life
at so and that was the motivation for
him he had no app he had to just use the
doctor's recommendations and and the
math and paper for that but then the app
showed up in you know right before my
birthday and when I saw him three weeks
later we had lunch and he gave me the
free app and it changed my my life I've
tried some other things and we all I
wasn't really fat when I say 60 pounds
it sounds like a lot but at 25 pounds
off I look great it was you lost that
little extra weight you gained when you
do a project for two years and eat wrong
but it's the iceberg effect I look
normal and fine but fat wherever you see
on the outside of your body two-thirds
of its on the inside like an iceberg in
the water right so Kobe beef it's
delicious it's a marbled fat if you're
fat on the outside whatever you have
skinny people are fat too inside there's
there's all this marbleization remember
this doctors dealing with heart disease
and diabetes and things there's fat on
in all of our insides and that's what
he's trying to counteract for a healthy
life in a long-term living right my
parents are 80 and their parents were 60
when they died their 80 but they're on
medicines to stay alive and I hope that
we're 90 and 100 when you know we don't
need those medicines if we're doing it
right so those are the fun facts all
right here here it is tell you how to do
it we all know these things
right a glass of water we've heard this
for forever at a client went to a
seminar spent twelve thousand dollars
for two days she came and said Tony just
three gate glasses of water this is what
she learned I followed I'm from LA a lot
of healthy people in LA and their minds
and I followed them around and nobody
drinks more than six lasses of water a
day you can't do it unless you're
actively trying to do it because that's
you're sipping you take a big bottle of
water drinking it maybe get other one so
then you learn to drink water finally
have to learn to eat water I drink three
glasses at a time the smart water or
other bottles about this tall you know
you down those like a gerbil and a
Habitrail that you write down use that
like the beer bong principle right just
take it right down it's amazing so so
the technology or the science that this
doctor developed is combinations matter
really carbs slow the metabolism and so
the body resets itself every two hours
so you should be eating food groups and
and and combinations that allow the body
to process every two hours and then at
night it's in a streamlined fashion and
it will it will take all those amazing
amino acids and everything else you ate
and make building blocks and regenerate
you in the morning p it out and wait
yourself and you'll be pounds lighter
from from once you've urinated and I
lost the pound a day for the first three
months and then half a pound after that
and then maintain turn the slide please
so this is what I really learned nothing
tastes as good as thin feels nothing
nothing tastes as good it didn't feel
when you revisit your favorite foods all
right if you eat for the body huge
amounts of food if you eat for the soul
very small amounts of food I ate ice
cream every other day pizza every other
day but it's very little the three bite
rule that's when you taste things turn
turn the slide so here it is really
quickly it's green yellow red diet
maintain bad next one just going to help
you out with this real quick it's a nap
pull it up search index all here go
ahead next one well it's blurry but
those different categories and pull it
down next one I I never use those I only
use the search engine typed in the word
in fact the searchers to be at the
bottom they put at the top for me I ask
them once you put on the front page I
spent half my days going one layer over
to get the search engine I just want the
search engine I type of my own names go
ahead next one
25 breakfast and lunch as you know you
can eat more breakfast you've got all
data process it I think there was one
more thing after six o'clock only half
will you ate next one this is one glycol
you can have 25 look at this now if you
can read this it says a pound of meat
cheese onions lettuce mayonnaise fat is
fine with within this system and it's
two points you can have 25 next one all
right look at this one ounce of corn
chips is what it says this tortilla chip
don't onto that 52 you've gained two
pounds you gained two pounds in the
system it's one cracker one thing just
one little carb just gums up the work
this race car you're an engine your body
wants to be processed we eat all
healthier obvious eat healthy and dodi
McDonald's in the food that the middle
America obese but even for eating Whole
Foods hooters in the wrong combination
is just adding to your body I thought
there's one more let's say alright so my
name is Drew I spent a long time in
boston this is Fenway Park they do a
thing in Fenway Park where they sing
ok
okay so although I grew up in Boston
baseball was never my true love the
thing that I really love to watch is
people playing video games people were
very very good at playing video games
they don't play in Fenway Park they
playing stadiums that look like this
this is the key arena in Seattle I
wasn't here sadly but you can see
there's like stage stayed up there
there's five people on each team there's
a bunch of screens a lot of people
watching the game that they play looks
like this that guy there earned a
million dollars by being right there and
clicking a button it was amazing it was
the million-dollar dream coil they
called it so when I watch this I'm not
there it's not on TV i watch on a site
called twitch and the thing that's weird
about twitch is that when you're
watching there's a chat room so it's not
that there's not a chat room the way
you're used to a chat room there's not
conversations going on here because
there are tens to hundreds too many
hundreds of thousands of people watching
at the same time so this is just a
screenshot i took today i think and
there's 20,000 people watching this
right now that's relatively low for
these kinds of events and when you get
this many people together they do all
kinds of weird things so they love to
sing so you can't hear it but they're
playing let go on the audio track and
everybody just like spams a chat room
and they love these little graphical
guys that's the theme and you see some
people like trying other things like
there's trying to say let it go Bulba
that's the name of a player that they
like so there's this kind of like
iteration that happens people will shout
things into the chat room some things
take off and you'll just see it
scrolling like crazy I have some
screenshots of that later but it's just
like unbelievable massive amounts of
text and it's often the same text or
some like slight variant of the text
they also love to sing along with the
song this is a very simple song I don't
know if you know sandstorm there's this
guy named darude it's like a late 90s
techno kind of hit like not really loves
this song but chat loves this song and
that's the refrain is do to do to do
and if you just watch just like it flies
by it's a little weird chat also likes
to dance so people like copy and paste
these weird like dancing emoticons and
chat when music is playing there's also
you'll see other people trying to chat
in the middle and like there's little
crying faces they're like complaining
that this is what's happening in their
chat room there's also these like
graphical emoticons that people really
like these art which specific but
basically people on the screen have a
cut out of this little image that
happens in chat and when it's on screen
then everybody just spams a chat room
they're like I love that the image that
I can make in the chat room is something
that I can see on the video ok so that's
all just like weird right now what I
think is really interesting about this
is this question of spam versus what I
think of is cheering like I would
basically place all of that behavior in
the cheering category it's like when
people are at Fenway Park and they all
know the worst of the song right like
they know what they're supposed to do as
the crowd and that's collective action
right it's like people getting together
and doing a thing at the same time they
all know what they're supposed to do
that feels great right like that's like
a really primal human thing to do but
what's interesting is it in chat rooms
there's only one channel like no one in
a stadium is like like why are you
singing along to this song like I want
to talk to my friend and you're singing
Sweet Caroline like you're an asshole
like that's not what happens but in the
chatroom that happens constantly and so
there's this like really interesting
social contest that goes on between
people who want to spam chat like that
and people who think that that's wrong
and they should have like a reasoned
like discourse around the quality of the
gameplay and obviously the spammers win
but it's interesting to see how people
construct like what it means to be in a
chat room right because we've been in
chat rooms that have a hundred people in
them and we have nice conversations or
10 people or whatever like chat is as
old as like computing technology is like
the first thing people made when you had
two people on a computer was I want to
talk to the other person
but something crazy happens when you put
a hundred thousand people in a room and
you lose that ability but you gain this
other ability which is we can all do the
same thing at the same time and we feel
connected I think that's awesome so
that's it hi I'm Gina I'm going to teach
you how to read tarot cards um my
disclaimer this is prediction but it's
not actually the information is actually
not for prediction so most people think
of tarot they think of someone who looks
like this this is a a depiction of a
Roma woman a gypsy fortune-teller but
really tarot come from kuroki a medieval
Italian game that was essentially meant
to carry around with you little life
lessons the tarot it was instructional
it was reminders of life and it was to
help you learn to live a better life 78
cards and tarot deck there were little
pieces of art on each one of them if
that jack looked familiar it's because
our current playing cards our poker
cards are derived from the pit okey we
also get kings queens and aces from this
game the game emerged in the 15th
century and it's evolved a bit from
there so taro was never set out to be a
fortune-telling game rather it was meant
to tell people little things about life
about universal life about everyone's
life so there are four suits in the
Tarot in the Minor Arcana the suits are
cups wands coins and swords and those
have equivalents to our current suits or
poker cards or playing cards there would
be hearts clubs diamonds and spades but
what I want you to think about as we go
through the rest of the talk is that
each of these symbols represented and
meant something to people in medieval
life so clergy were represented by the
love
the cups the peasants were represented
by the hard-working sticks and ones that
were carried around the emerging
merchant class of early modern um Italy
was represented by the coins or
Pentacles and then the nobility the
Warriors and the kings and queens were
represented by the power literally of
the sword when we think about the Tarot
though we think about these other cards
that I'm sure many of you have seen and
thought about or had some interaction
with those cards that aren't represented
on our plane deck this is from the Tarot
soap ruffino actually a relatively late
deck in 1835 deck that was made in Milan
it was designed by Carlo de la Roca I
have a hand-painted reproduction of this
deck and I'll talk about that in just a
minute but this is the what we call the
Major Arcana now indulge me a moment
these are 22 cards that are supposed to
represent the phases of life for
medieval life you start out the fool in
the beginning and you go along life's
journey and these 21 different stops
that the fool makes on life's journey
are supposed to represent things that
happen to you in life now literally the
early designers of the Tarot have made
well a little explanation for every
single thing that can happen so um you
can go through a transformation you can
encounter death you can encounter
calamity from above you can understand
love and happiness and finally you can
come to some sort of acceptance of
universality and the world literally you
can reach nirvana in this deck and
that's the goal of life for medieval
life they would think you're actually
getting to heaven in the deck it's
represented as the world you're
literally in heaven on top of the world
in this deck so I have two decks with me
today and I asked for people
I will talk about them to choose a card
from the decks to show you how the Tarot
works now my first deck is the medieval
scampi knee this is a very early dec
it's based on a 15th century deck so
it's based on one of the earliest decks
that we have the deck that it's based on
is in the pier point Morgan Library and
it was the deck itself was actually
designed in 1985 so it's inspired by
this 15 30 I've got one minute ok Lily
five of wands Lily this is a conflict
card there's some kind of competition
but five of one's always teaches you
there's much more to this competition
it's not as serious as you think Lily
had a question I don't know what it is
Liz nine of cups nine of cups is about
deep deep inner and outer peace and
happiness with the world it can be
romantic but really you are deeply you
whatever this question is it is very
deeply i'm at peace with the world so i
don't know what your question is but
nine of cups is great you are in a great
spaceless elizabeth fabulous card in
bagatelle 0 which is alternately the
juggler or the magician the trickster
but also highly highly creative so this
is the first stop in the fool's journey
it's both entertaining but you learn
something from this trick story huckster
II whatever your question is think about
what it is you're juggling and think
about what it is you can create and make
it finally Linda the Hanged Man the
lesson for all of you the Hanged Man the
lesson for all of you this looks like
it's terrible right but look he's
smiling it's not so bad hanged man is a
half way in the fool's journey and it
always reminds us that you should have a
different perspective I mean look he's
hanging
I his foot for goodness sakes you should
always have a different perspective on
your problem so the hangman encourages
you to literally turn your perspective
upside down what do we learn from this
we should use stories as analysis
literally we should be able to take
stories from everyday life and think
about the ways that they might apply to
the current situation oh sorry um we
should marshals oh we should marshal
spurious correlation for good so think
about the ways in which we can take the
elements around us and make into a
better story for better prediction hey
guys um so I'm going to tell you about
this new project I'm working on but
first I need to tell you about an
addiction I have which is to Kickstarter
I've backed way too many projects on
Kickstarter I think it's up at about 130
projects right now I back things like go
ahead and search for a hoverboard
literally like from the movie back to
the future the hoverboard I've backed
that on Kickstarter hasn't shipped yet
there we go yeah up this one but it's
okay um search for um search for a
finger surfing um you know when you you
know you put your hand outside the
window your car and the wind's going you
do this right it's literally a surfboard
that you put on your fingers and surf
outside your car right I backed that
they've shipped that I own that go ahead
and search for um err umbrella this is
literally a a stick you hold in your
hand there it is and it blows the rain
away like straight-up air I have no idea
this is supposed to work the English in
it is questionable um it hasn't shipped
yet either but uh it this was another
one and I've even backed um go ahead and
search for a desktop jellyfish tank um
I've always loved jellyfish and I
thought oh here's my chance to own a
jellyfish aquarium and this was really
cool any fedex you jellyfish um the
thing about jellyfish
they can't touch anything if a jellyfish
touches anything it just shreds so uh
it's it runs on this principle called
laminar flow it shoots water up in a
circle and the jellyfish sting in the
center but holy crap is there a giant
design flaw see these rocks at the
bottom why would you put those there so
the jellyfish hit these rocks and they
just get obliterated so much so that
after they shipped me ten different
jellyfish to try to keep these things
alive a local San Francisco paper
published a story called local startup
ships jellyfish slaughterhouse yeah it
was so bad okay so that's part one of my
story keep it you know sort of take that
put it in a box and then tell you about
part two part two is that um I you're
done that's all I need thank you Thank
You Liz yeah um part two is that I'm a
game designer and for the last few years
I've designed some of the most
ridiculous most complicated games
imaginable um I just like a sickness
like these games are way way way too
hard I've designed games where the
entire game was embedded inside a
firework show literally people had to go
out and watch things explode in the sky
and interpret the colors and orientation
and shape of each firework to solve the
puzzle I designed the game once I'm
embedded inside a nine inch nails album
and had to literally go to Prague to
unite Inch Nails concert and then go to
men's bathroom where there were little
USB sticks taped to the insides of the
urinals like stupid crazy complicated
dumb things and that was sort of a
former life of mine now I've got this
new mantra I've been telling all my
friends nothing is too simple there is
no such thing as too simple I want to
design games that are so simple and
beautiful that that they signify the
shift for me and I keep talking about
Kickstarter so a friend of mine came to
me and he said got it this is the
simplest game there's I was like yeah
well sure hard to get repeat customers
but um very very simple indeed um he
said no no no we're gonna play this with
cards here's
how it's going to work we're going to
take a deck of cards we're going to put
a single Joker at the deck I'll put it
down on the table and we're each going
to take turns drawing from the stack and
whoever draws the Joker dives and you're
out on the other guy wins I thought um
it turns out there is such thing as
twosome that's no fun at all so we but
he assisted and we tried it and it turns
out it was no fun at all um so there was
something really special about this
though and we decided to keep tinkering
with it and try to figure out like how
do you make this more fun like what if
what if instead of having to draw a card
you could play a card that would let you
look at the top three cards of the deck
before you drew one now you have a
slight chance of knowing where that
Joker is and hopefully not draw it okay
we're getting somewhere now what if
there was another card you could play
that lets you skip your turn so you see
what the top card is oh my goodness
there's the Joker you play this other
card and your friend has to go instead
well what if there was another card
where he could then play and shuffle the
deck before drawing what if there was
another card that reversed the order
there was another car on and on this
went as we started to build strategies
around this game and we assigned each of
these special powers to these cards and
it started to get really cool like the
ten had a special power in the jack and
the Queen and the king and we're like
all right we're ready to put this up on
Kickstarter until I woke up one morning
and realize what we're literally doing
with the regular deck of cards is just
giving you a ruleset we're literally
trying to raise ten thousand dollars on
Kickstarter for a piece of paper and I
thought once again it is possible to be
too simple so um instead of publishing
that game I thought what we need to do
is create a custom deck of cards what if
we put the rules for what each card does
on the card itself then we're dealing
with something pretty cool and and we
started printing out some prototype
decks and the next part of this story is
with the oatmeal do you guys know the
oatmeal the online comic the oatmeal
yeah um so this guy here one of my
favorites um
I'll let it sink in go ahead yeah um the
UH so everything on the oatmeal is drawn
by a guy named Matt inman who's an
incredible hilarious creative mastermind
and I've been a huge fan of his forever
and so I went to him and said I need
five minutes your time you have to try
this crazy silly game that I just
created with a friend of mine and he
said sure I've got five minutes let's do
it we played for five minutes as soon as
it was over he said I want to play again
very good sign we played it again two
hours go by we're just playing and
playing and playing and he really fell
in love with the game and he said listen
I had there's two things 1i have a book
publishing deal coming up in about two
months and I owe this new manuscript and
I'll tell you what I will call my
publisher right now and cancel that if
you let me illustrate the cards for this
game just as a side note when matthew
inman makes that offer to the correct
answer as hell yes and the second thing
he said was uh we have to change the
name of your game right now it's called
bomb squad we have to change the name to
something like exploding kittens because
I'm really good at drawing cats so uh
the final part of my story is we've been
working on this for a few months now and
we are putting up a Kickstarter page
next week I think maybe Brady is perhaps
the only person on earth who has seen
this video but i'm going to show you
guys for the very first time ever so you
can see this insane thing we've been up
to is there yeah okay hold on let me go
full screen and back up so we come on
hi there my name is matthew inman I make
the oatmeal and this is along Lee chain
small they make really cool games the
three of us got together and create a
new card game called exploding kids
here's how the game works you set our
deck of cards facedown and take turns
drawing to one of utah's the exploding
kitten cart dress exploding kitten card
explodes they are dead and they are out
of the game unless that player has
diffused card can diffuse the kittens
using things like laser pointers kitten
therapy and catnip images in addition
their various action cards can be used
to move mitigate avoid the kids
throughout the game such as skipping
your turn by wearing a portable cheetah
but attacking other players by deploying
the thousand-year back here thinking
card from the draw pile by rubbing the
belly of a pegacorn or seeking out the
wisdom of an all-seeing and goat wizard
you can also deploy the taco cat April
crap Lincoln magical meet bikinis and a
fearsome cataract to win this highly
strategic kitty powered version of
Russian roulette you have to decide
which cards to play will end up light
them and which of your opponent's the
target the gameplay allows you to
develop fun or cruel strategies against
one another the game is kid-friendly
super fun and super easy to learn but
that doesn't mean exploding kittens is
simple with every card you draw you
increase your chances of getting one of
the exploding kittens and being booted
from the game along you play ready your
odds exploding and the more tense the
game kids so if the type of person who
is into games kittens laser beam
sasquatches explosions enchiladas that
sometimes goats please pack Arctic star
in exchange sin you are king thank you
very much um thanks so that's been sort
of the whole journey what you guys can
do on the very first prototype deck just
finished printing I'm having it fedex
here tomorrow morning if anyone wants to
play and what you guys can do to help me
because this hasn't actually launched
yet is go to exploding kittens calm and
just follow us on Twitter and that's
where we'll make some announcements
about when it goes live that's it thanks
yes
so awesome okay everybody stand up
getting a big circle I know there's
furniture in the way but we can move it

my teaching assistant so Jeff Hancock
will be my teaching assistant today
thank you everybody my name is Liz oh
yeah come on in join the love thank you
okay so um so I I asked to go after Evan
and because i love exploding kittens and
the reason i love it is one it's going
to be a great game but secondly it kind
of started off as a half-baked idea any
any shared it with a few idea a few
people put it out there and now it's
something that's going to be real right
where's Evan I'm looking for you where
are you I've on you know exploding
kittens that's what I remembered right

going to work um you can like over each
other's hands although it's really cute
I that was kind somebody made that
suggestion okay um we could do a squeeze
but here's how it's going to work um
this is the way it's going to work is
when I look around this room part of my
research in my passion is trying to
figure out okay hold against again is
half-baked I love when people have kind
of half-baked ideas they're not quite
sure what to do with and when other
people jump up and say I can help you
with that half-baked idea or let's just
discuss it let's see what it's about and
so I'm going to take advantage of the
untapped resources in this room and
right now all of you committed earlier
to having
kind of a dream maybe a half-baked idea
