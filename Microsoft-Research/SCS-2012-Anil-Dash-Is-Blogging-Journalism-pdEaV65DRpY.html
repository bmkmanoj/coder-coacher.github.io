later in the meantime we have any
attention sole purpose in life is to
make my life miserable good talk about
blogging journalist how I was right
before Danny was right Facebook is
invading our privacy right this is our
refrain and the good news is we've
solved this problem i replied post-2000
23 freddie was before games of us that
he Roberts and I said really easily set
up your own site control your identity
problems all okay so we don't ever have
to worry about privacy let's move on is
the more current problem is Facebook is
invading our publicity like a lot of
equal in replacement there we care about
our velocity and there is not the
ability to create a public with
contemporary tools as there was in the
school blogosphere dangers of the many
people here participated in so i'm going
to indulge in a little bit of nostalgia
there will be a point later but mostly
just remind entertaining so if we go
back even further table gee that's one
to show somebody else's blog post this
is a guy named Jason Aldean he was a
medical resident at Columbia at the time
and he blogged about
uncharacteristically thoughtful thing
about the first time he saved a little
babies like blossoming doctors very
moving a lot of people blog about it and
observe didn't become shared on
metafilter back when I was a thing and
this guy somil was at wide pipe one i
plug this up as i still in the hell this
guy is is the only avatar I've ever seen
her hand in the last ten years I
wouldn't know if I'm sawing street from
you just that's racist and we shared it
was somebody else and then it got caught
on from there and one of the interesting
things that happens with that kind of
sharing in the old passers-by way for
people who didn't have a like
relationship with you and working one in
return for sharing is you would connect
unexpectedly another so one of the
readers I think it was in DC dead and
one of his readers or somebody else from
DC and that was this woman she had in
Culberson that's Jason who wrote that
book blockbusters now doctor and that's
their little boy it was going for you so
that's ten years later the new married
six years that's their second kid this
is what happens when you have that sort
of serendipity that happens unconnected
undefined relationships as our boarded
buses
don't make you supposed to find
relationships and this is my son
expressing his excitement at me baby so
besides indulging in this collagen there
are reasons that we actually are
probably a little bit justified and
looking back at a golden era at that
time which is we could do things then
that we are not able to do now and we
have lost that ability but it's not that
the technology can't support it because
you used to have it we just don't know
these much and some of this is you know
the usual complaints about how Twitter
sucked all the energy out of our blogs
and things that maybe some of that's
true but one of the biggest things we
were missing is that the structure
dividers for participation don't really
afford transgression and I had a whole
diversion hear about how unreal
straightest how do you remember Marco
Marco function so technology guys at
Google and what he did is read the whole
thing about the kind of digging a
militant open-source guy and that's
really great and I was going to show it
to you but he demonstrated a
transgression in both in all born and
purpose and in connection because this
is what is I had the place where that
post was that I wanted to show you and
this is great he took it down he took
down his entire web presence check out
all those web presences but the thing is
like on facebook it actually has a like
this profile has been deleted page which
is not what he wants this is from his
standpoint as is his expression of these
embracing me
morality of all things but as my
standpoint is just like an area monster
but the point is he has been able to
control what is there and this is the
most transgressive then is a digital
suicide right this is a fantastic form
transgression and you can only know
because this is his face that he
controls I can't control what's left
behind them being on most of the public
spaces of what passes for public spaces
in social networks unwanted behavior and
that I also don't have the same
opportunities for intersection that I
had once idiotic snailed ocean passed
last night so once the old oh she had
passed along that link i don't have the
opportunity for these sort of passers-by
with whom i have no relationship we're
not I don't think he's a maybe possibly
put but I don't have any relationship
with him on on any of the exclusive
declarations where the asymmetric Algy
that is great but yet I was still able
to send message hey if I was blog post
in 10 years ago you did this thing and
that's how this couple men isn't that
great and then that coupled used to be
my wife look at all that you have to
babysit all our kids is your fault so
the nice thing about this is that on
represented relationships can yield a
lot of them this is not an unfamiliar
concept of people but it's one we've
even abdicate abdicated the ability to
to fight for like we don't have a word
naan bread unlike yours if we don't have
a concept for how to represent
software and the other part of this is
that that's capability of the
intersection of unexpected people and
our ability to transgress is where you
get the great publicity right this is
what studs are you do something mildly
transgressive in a way that others who
didn't expect to see concern and this is
really fun and the network's why we have
right now and you're Scott would suck at
it you're terrible at this is all the
good stuff when we can't do it and some
of the goods forms of this or general
assembly-general aceptas are using the
public space they're using a public
space to be slightly transgressive in a
way that is still within the structure
was acceptable in society but something
that was unplanned and unexpected and we
we lose a lot because the people who
have this ability don't happening so one
of the examiners what Jason did after
this point in his residence is he became
a doctor and what he does for a living
does he helps babies with cancer that's
a good job
it's horribly hard job but he has to
work and he does that at the National
Institutes of Health which is
continually creating significant budget
cuts so that's been a couple years
thinking you know what we're going to
tweet out and that will fix it it
doesn't work and in fact that I age is
screwed for money and they tweeted us we
can't make visible the fact that we
support the work of helping babies in
cancer which is what he does and
commensurately if we want to say to them
we think you should change any more
efficient so that you don't have to
worry as much about budget cuts they
can't listen to us because our general
assembly's online are not visible stream
of replies and tweets is imperfect as
Daniel educating surgeon so we don't
have a way of showing our force and
demonstrating useful and we don't have
any important
we've completely lost our public spaces
toriana call the captain Adrian you go
to midtown and have all the day dreams
that are they this is public spaces
assignment you have to put the
sign on it it's not public space this
happens all the time go up and there has
never been a single occupy demonstration
even though these big financial
companies that have these nominally
public space open atrium underground
floors in midtown has a nap maybe you
look over dust but it doesn't happen and
why I think is the captain the captain
spaces we know their business control
and this is owned and owned by the norms
and the rights and privileges in their
company even if they have a declaration
exclusive that virgin public space signs
on and they do not afford unexpected
behaviors they don't have any in the old
features that we have on the social
networks the ones they never can
anticipate anything and so they don't
have a way of saying here's how to do
something transgressive by the sudden
it's a problem to problem dell has to
deal with I'm not blaming them it's a
hobbit that they don't want but it's a
problem that we should be able to create
and this is specifically about the loss
of Danny's public not Davis secret
secret spy secret section pretty long
handle secrets really good if you're not
even online keep it all heart but the
public space where I can do something
like improv everywhere does not exist
the angry mob policies
the eyes on the street public space that
I can observe without being a creep in a
way that's helpful does not exist the
performance space where I can just get
attention by boss game designers and we
had we had it as recently as a decade
ago so that combination of intersection
and transgression is what I'm obsessed
with because I don't care about my
privacy to economize people work I care
about my probably being compromised and
I don't know how to fix it so our on a
desk yuuka hand is restricted all right
what we know is we have to have we have
a lot of tech to make their networks in
these pieces this is sincerely question
what are the techniques by which we pry
open these systems that we have their
great hours we should keep them to add
in public spaces that are uncontrollable
or transgression it is possible isn't it
being her to some of the pieces let the
right are we start with those networks
and we add a bit bits that are not
controlled by the network providers I
think that requires deliberate breaking
the terms of service again sorry no I
think that we have to have a way to
continue to participate in their
networks without average obey their
preference
and I've not a technological problem
it's about making a killer active
incidentally brings the terms of service
anyone thats Sarah soju and what's so
striking about the facebook thing is you
have to login to view and that that
single design pattern has officiated a
lot of the public which you're talking
about a thing of my violin terms of
service of you so I'm just going to put
up another address it will just spider
everything because on my facebook page
you log in as me I'm just populated over
to here this is my public mirror right
so we have tools to do that and they're
explicitly violation of the terms of
sites Facebook and I'm not troubled by
that but I know they can shut me down so
I have to have a million of those so one
of the things that's very my pilgrim was
was the king of this something that we
had and we kind of lost or didn't
sufficiently spread his things like a
rhesus monkey great things where people
can take what they're looking at which
they own it's their view of these things
pull it out and transform it and use it
in other ways and that's the violation
of the terms of service that's really
the for all of the sort of exporting of
data that facebook allows they never let
you get the email address because the
email address is the thing that would
enable you to own your own network of
cute you could get away from facebook
and the thing that Google+ doesn't do
which I
interesting is that it's API maybe this
will change into the future isn't a
thing that lets you build your own
Google+ from that network thing which
you would have thought that Google as
something that sits to preserve present
preserve the internet and searchable
internet would have done search Russian
is what's the nature of social search
engine there who's the sacred ground
everly facebook okay and
Largent question and how much mrs.
searchable what's the nature of change
the character register yeah then it's
interesting because Denny said you
expect Google to do the thing that that
would be more when I think that does
everybody still have this option I sure
tell me more you know at some point the
other part I think is very important
miniatures language from architectural
standpoint our browsers are a user
agents right it's the agent of the user
and and that is still remarkably
sacrosanct it hasn't been that corrupt
even the Google provider user Asian I
have a lot of enormous amount of agency
over and very little has been done
around using that my best protect any
interesting to think of it in terms of
technical terms of what is actually she
is not technology but how scale banach
publishes complicated matters and what
happened is the decade ago yes it's for
public but not
attention which meant that those
partitions would get asked what without
overwhelming those who are making things
public now what happens now is the sting
of attention has become some great
dessert you know there's these massive
issues in terms of how you're different
levels and layers of visibility and in
terms of the ability to grasp stuff a
lot of the conversations that we have
resemble the early blogosphere could go
slowly teachers work marinades when they
do find a way to our voices on top now
it doesn't pop open on twitter is dead
when I that there's something weird what
we South by is now dead conference
because 50,000 people swarming over
every little idea so I think part of
where I'm struggling with this is that
how do you deal with these different
levels of public who you do different
levels of scale and I think that that is
naturally I totally out and with the
scale issue needs hold a messy we like
that what you're asking for is how it is
not a public what's more about me and I
was it is a safe up a coffee shop a
coffee shop of the person's what we
caught in which is friends only or
psycho well we take the last question
like that along set up introducing this
things more uniform right game or people
and conserve your website then you go to
geo cities with it a little more it gets
it takes a little more books to the
floor Twitter's under for sure but I
think we should jump you can tuck orders
of magnitude or users of the limitation
that uniform dating service dealer now
they're like these services that are
just adding these speed bumps like you
know absolutely we gonna add like 50
people before you can even look that
photo be they think they're right well
we get harder to actually share certain
types of photos and that the new
services are adding the value out with
creating limitations to what would
otherwise sort of be open right and so
it's almost like that if there's a
service work it's like I look at it like
this be off in some way where I go okay
I told is what you do if you're not like
it almost do if all the ways to open my
social network my number would be the
last hey right now we're pleased</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
