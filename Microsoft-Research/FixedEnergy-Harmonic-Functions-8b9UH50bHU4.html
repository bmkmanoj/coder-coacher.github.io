you
alright good afternoon everyone we're
delighted to have Rick Kenyan here I've
heard a short version of this talk
before and already based on that you're
in for a treat Rick please thank you
well this is joint work with my
colleague Aaron Abrams and please feel
free to interrupt if you have questions
or comments or ideas so I want to start
with a just a little story or
motivational story if you have a string
of Lights right all identical light
bulbs you you hook a hook them up in
series and you put a battery across from
one side to the other then they'll all
glow at the same rate that the same
brightness but if you have a more
complicated grid like a for example if
you have an electric blanket or
something right and you have a bunch of
resistors in some sort of network some
graph here it's a planar graph doesn't
have to be planar but no and you know
you can hook up your battery at two
locations but then the no not all the
even if the bulbs are identical the
amount of current that I'm not a voltage
drop that one bulb is going to see is a
function of all the other resistances
and you know they won't all be the same
brightness yeah right so pick one of the
questions why can they ask is can you
design a set of bulbs or set of
conductances on the edges set of
resistances put in some you know
stronger bulbs here and weaker bulbs
there or something so that the all the
bulbs will glow at the same brightness
and and by glowing at the same
brightness I mean the energy dissipated
across each resistor is the same okay
so bet that is a solution in the linear
case but you know one may wonder if
there if it's a if it's possible and how
many solutions are there and Tony so
this is so to put this in a mathematical
setting here this hopefully this is
familiar to everybody you know stop me
if you if it's not familiar but I guess
start with the graph G right set of
vertices and edges and on each edge I'm
going to have a positive real number
called the conductance and I'm going to
there's a subset of the vertices be
called the boundary vertices and for
most of the talk is just going to
consist of two points one at the top of
the bottom the boundary versys and on
the boundary I have some function let's
call it you some fixed function fixed
once and for all and now we're looking
for a function f on the rest of the
graph F on the vertices which is
harmonic in and harmonic means that the
value at every point is the weighted
average of the neighboring values so
weighted by the conductances on the
edges so if all the conductances are one
you know it's just going to be the the
actual average of the neighboring values
and I want of course the function on the
boundary to be equal to you so that's a
classical dear sleep problem here's the
by the way the underlying equation for
harmon icity is this weighted laplacian
so the laplacian of the of the function
f that where we're looking for is is the
sum of the f of X minus F of Y so you
look at all neighbors for each X you
look at the neighbors Y of X and you
multiply f of X minus my x the
conductance there and you want that to
be equal to 0 at every internal vertex X
right and standard fact is that the you
know the there's a unique harmonic
function with those boundary values and
it's given by it is the function which
minimizes the so-called girish light
energy the dershlits by by definition
the sum over all the edges of the graph
their conductance times the difference
of the function on the two vertices
right so for every for every edge you
look at the difference of the function
you square it multiply by the
conductance and you sum that up over all
the edges you can take Deerslayer energy
and we're going to call this quantity
the edge energy the thing you're selling
out and so one more ingredient we need
to discuss is the so-called orient
orientation of the edges whenever you
have a harmonic function on a graph
there's an induced current flow in fact
if you think about the the you know the
current in the in the lightbulb example
right the current is flowing from higher
voltage to lower voltage so on every
edge there's an orientation which tells
you which direction the current is
flowing you know if I put voltage 1 here
and 0 there and I let the thing relax to
the equilibrium state then the current
will flow this will be a source of
current this will be a sink of current
and then at the intermediate vertices
well there won't be any sources and
sinks in the in the graph because the
current has to be there's no loss of
current in the interior all right so
each interior vertex has to have some
incoming and some outgoing arrows okay
well there may be some edges which have
no current but at least if you choose to
sort of generic conductances then there
that won't happen I mean 0 having zero
current is sort of a non-generic
situation all right so that that's an
orientation of the edges it's an acyclic
orientation meaning that you know it
goes downhill down down potential and
we're going to be interested in this set
of a cyclic orientations which could
potentially arise from these boundary
values so remember we have a fixed bound
set a boundary vertices
and has fixed function you on the
boundary and given that data there's a
certain set of a cyclic orientations
which can happen and those it's not hard
to show that those are obtained from
well okay maybe I should have expanded
this a teeny bit but let's call capital
Sigma the set of orientations a cyclic
orientation Sigma what I mean is by just
a choice of orientation for each edge
such that well which arise from
functions on the vertices which have no
interior extrema and are equal to you on
the boundary so look at functions which
are equal to leave you on the boundary
have no interior extreme and no maximum
axes or mins inside and then the and
who's such that the signature of the
derivative on an edge that I remove the
direction versa current would flow under
F has to be equal to Sigma okay so
that's a finite set of a cyclic
orientations a stick like with with only
syncs and sources on the boundary is
that definition clear but what I mean by
those kind of orientation if you if you
only have one source and once think like
in this example then it's a set of all a
cyclic orientations with only that
source in the way that sink okay so we
are going back to our original problem
we want to choose conductances so that
we get whatever desired vector of
energies we want right so let's call
this map cap Lopes I the map from write
a vector of conductances which are
positive real numbers to a vector of
energies right so the energies are
always going to be non-negative that you
know for some special choices of
conductances you may get some current
zero and then the energy will be zero so
you have to include the left zero
awesome ability over there and just by
way of example right here
just a non-trivial graph you might
consider right it's got two boundary
vertices V 0 and b 1 and you know we're
just going to put you is going to be 1
here and 0 there so I think of the
current is think of this circuit is
being hooked up to a 1 volt battery
across those two vertices and let's call
a through E are the five conductances
right and then you can write down an
equation for the energies as a function
of those five variables a through e 25
conductances and you know it's a little
bit complicated but there it is right
that's the energy on edge one energy on
h 2 and so on energy up to energy 5 and
know how do you invert this equation
right now if I give you a set of
energies can you solve this for a 1
through 8 I mean a through E that's the
question is just an algebraic algebra
question now right invert this mapping
and you know I did just just you know
for illustration I did in this
particular case it's not actually so
easy right I wouldn't want to do this by
hand but the computer could handle this
this example and I just if you look at
this equation here this so there's I
took five energies eat little e 1
through 5 and I solve for a so this is
an equation what's a polynomial n square
root of a quadratic polynomial going
square root of a which determines a as a
function of the five energies and well
it turns out your skin of an opposite
that's right if you stay if you scale
all the conductances but I constant then
please get this image you get the same
energy scale also by the constant
squared so well by the same content on
it so yeah so there's one one fewer
parameter then is apparent then look but
nonetheless it this kind of interesting
if you if you if you stare at this
equation a little bit for well for one
thing it's not going to be obvious but
there are two roots it's a quadratic
equation
if there's one root then there's going
to be another route yeah both routes are
positive right because you can tell that
these are the you know the constant and
the quadratic coefficient are positive
numbers right so in fact there there are
two solutions to a and in fact if you
invert this for any set of energies
there are exactly two solutions which
also happens to be the number of a
cyclic orientations of this graph if I
look at a cyclic orientation which is
which has a source here and a sink there
then there's two possibilities right the
center guy can be directly I mean these
a and B have to be down DNE have to be
down so you can go either way so it's
not really surprising that there are two
solutions here but there are and you
know that's the general statement is
that if you have any a cyclic
orientation which is compatible with the
boundary and whatever your favorite
choice of energies are which are
positive i forgot to say positive here
strictly positive then there's a unique
choice of conductances which realizes
that data ok there's a unique choice of
conductances for which the associated
harmonic function realizes this data so
in particular if you if you want all the
energies to be one for example then the
number of different choices of
conductance is number of solutions to
that equation is exactly the number of a
sickly orientations which know some
people are interested in you know
counting a cyclic orientations of graphs
just what sort of one way to do it is to
just find the number of solutions to
this equation alright and so David other
than any D for a book complicated so
this is the easy west this is actually
an empty hard question so you know you
shouldn't dismiss it too quickly
but yeah so good I understand right ok
so uh well so if you like a number
theory algebraic geometry you may be
interested in some topological features
of this rational map the rational map of
the type that I that I you know give an
example on the previous slide you can
think of it just as a map from complex
numbers two complex numbers right you
don't have to restrict a positive real
numbers and then it has a you know you
can show that actually the topological
degree is exactly the number of
solutions the number of a cyclic
orientations so this this theorem has is
a stronger than their one because it
says that there are no other solutions
besides other than the real ones the
ones that are given by thermal in the
waiver doesn't imply it very well no it
doesn't it prompt them knowing ok so i
should say stronger i should say or
gives you more information about what's
going on but in particular if you if you
plug in if you're if you have rational
boundary values you and suppose that
you're interested in finding rational
energies for example all the energies
one which is sort of natural solution
and that natural condition that we're
looking for then the you know you're
solving this algebraic system of
polynomial equations for every gallon or
automorphism of the you know absolute
Galois group the group of totally good
proof algebraic numbers will give you a
new solution because all the because the
rational function has rational
coefficients the Galois group commute
produced the solutions in fact the gal
are good the relevant Galois group here
is just a group of the totally real
algebraic numbers because you never see
everything is always real the solutions
are always real you never have to deal
with complex numbers anyway that's just
a something but my tears number two is
ok any questions about the statement so
in order to illustrate our draw pictures
of these solutions it's is it as a nice
construction due to rob these four
author paper Brooks Smith stone and Tut
and they called it a Smith diagram
apparently was discovered by one of the
those were people in the late 30s and
Smith sorry okay so suppose I have a
planar graph now and it's got a harmonic
function on it right and then so from
that you can draw a tiling of a
rectangle well okay so this is the case
when the boundary just consists again
just consists of two vertices to v-0 v1
then you can draw a tiling of the
rectangle which geometric e
geometrically realizes that harmonic
function and it goes as follows you well
for each edge in the graph you're going
to have a rectangle over here and I call
it I've labeled the rectangles according
to the edges over there and for each
vertex over here there's a horizontal
segment in the sort of maximum
horizontal segment in the union of the
rectangle boundaries and so each
rectangle over here has a upper boundary
and a lower boundary and those that
corresponds to the two vertices which
that edge connects and the you know the
lower boundary is the V 0 and the upper
boundary is b1 and the the so far is
just that that's the top logical
description of the tiling but but then
the once you have a harmonic function on
the graph and you can assign a height to
all the rectangle boundaries which is
the corresponding voltage of the
interior vertices the value of the
harmonic function tells you the height
the y-coordinate here
alright so the voltage is the
y-coordinate and the width of the
rectangle is the amount of current going
along that edge so the know you you have
these boundary values 1 and 0 and then
you solve for the harmonic function each
edge has a certain current so it has a
certain that corresponds to that gives
you the width of the rectangle and you
know for each vertex the rectangles
above it corresponding to the correspond
to the current coming in and the
rectangles below correspond to current
coming out and the sum of the current
coming in equals the sum of the current
coming out so that makes sense so that
the sum of the wits above each each edge
is equal to some of the wits below the
edge that's the kickoff no loss of
current rule ok and so if you know
though if you know the width and the
height you can get the aspect ratio of
the rectangle that corresponds to the
conductance the width divided by the
height is the conductance that's what we
big call of the conductance and the
energy is the height times the width as
the area of the rectangle so the you
know if you if you ask for a solution
with where where the combinatorial to
the graph and all the rectangles have
the same area this is you've solved for
the harmonic function which has the
correct all the energies equal ok
except clear so how many people know
this construction already after you okay
and of course you can read off the
orientation from the from the tiling
because you know no for each vertex you
know which which vertices are above it
which are below it okay so now we can
just play the game here's here's a
particular graph sort of my running
example it's got happens to have 12 a
cyclic orientations and for each
orientation the theorem says there is a
because it's a planar graph there is a
tiling of a rectangle with all the
rectangles of area one that's that and
that's one of them so it's kind of a
cute way to relate the energy fixed
energy problem to the area area one
rectangle a shin problem and what you
see in this example is that well okay so
it's it's significantly more complicated
to solve this system in this case and
you know if you look at the width of the
first rectangle there the amount of
amount of current going along that first
edge it's the root of some nasty quite
large polynomial which you know
mathematic I spit out for me and you
know I didn't spend much time thinking
about this but each of these
coefficients here has some common throw
meaning some mysterious combinatorial
meaning is the each of these
coefficients is a positive polynomial in
the energies here the all the energies
are one so that comes out to be an
integer but if I written it out as inter
with 12 variable energies a 13 12 then
you will see this as a did that this
coefficient is a positive polynomial in
all those things with two equations with
integer coefficients yeah and so there
is some interesting comment or a meaning
which I wish I but I don't know what it
is
I mean you kind of saw that in the
previous example here right each of
these coefficients is as all the
coefficients all the coefficients are
integers and they're all all that with
the same sign the science alternate but
okay and as I said in this case there
are 12 orientations right so there are
12 rectangle Asians all sort of Comet
orally equivalent to each other but you
know if you go back to this to this
polynomial this polynomial has 12 real
roots and the one of those roots is the
width of this of this tile and the other
11 roots are the widths of the tile
labeled number tile number one in the in
the other 12 tilings because the you
know the Galois group / mutes the roots
of that polynomial it / mutes the the
tilings as well and it will move one of
these talents to some other tiling I
mean it produced these 12 objects always
taking you know if you look at all the
widths of tile one there's 12 wits and
they they together form the roots of
that polynomial it's kind of a kind of a
cute two very intriguing number theory
of connection I don't know if that this
is a very useful observation or not but
to him yeah
well how many acylic orientations does
the graph have I mean what is the size
of this thing this number of compatible
a cyclical orientations of graph and
well so this is something that people
have studied and it's a in that if we we
can add an edge between b0 and b1 if
there's not one already it doesn't
really affect anything about the problem
then the this number the number of a
cyclic orientation compatible with these
two boundary vertices is called the
chromatic invariant of the graph it's
somewhat you know reasonably well
studied the graph invariant it's the you
know derivative at one of the chromatic
polynomial is here if you happen to know
what the chromatic polynomial is or if
you know what the Tet polynomial is is
the derivative at zero the X derivative
at zero but in particular to NP hard
thing to compute but you know the yeah
in fact you know when I I just took this
graph somewhat randomly I plugged it
into the mathematic guy I it spit out
this degree 12 equation and I knew at
that point that there were 12 solutions
so it can't is somehow it counted the
number of solutions you computer the
number of solutions to this NP hard
problem by some mysterious means right
but let me uh let's move on though there
were this theorem that the main theorem
says that you know for every a cyclic
rotation and set of energies there is a
solution so and the proof really just
fits on one slide here we're looking for
a harmonic function right here's the
laplacian but you know we're not giving
the conductances the conductors are are
are unknowns but we can rewrite this
siiii times d h as e over D H because
the energy the energy remember is the
conductance
times the d h squared and so instead of
looking at our standard harmonic
equation here right we can rewrite the
equation like this because the energies
are what we're given so now we have now
our our unknown because our unknowns
become the the values of the harmonic
function so we have to solve this new
equation 0 equals was the system of
equations right one for each vertex X
you sum over the neighbors of X H of X
minus H of Y inverse times the energy so
we call this the in harmonic equation
which is short for energy harmonica
because we're given the energies rather
than the conductances and well how do
you solve this equation now it's it's an
nonlinear right we have to you know
unfortunately it's no no longer linear
but it still has some nice properties
and one of the one of which is that the
solutions are critical points of a
certain functional just like in the case
of the harmonic equation right we had
the dearly energy was our nice
functional and the harmonic function
with a minimal of the deerslayer energy
here that the solutions are critical
points of the following functional which
is the product over the edges of the you
know H of X minus H 0 y to the power the
of the energy e e sub e well why is that
true well you know I just just
differentiate this well take the
logarithmic derivative of em you know
and you get that for every for with
respect to H of X and you get this this
equation well like separately you have
to worry about the the absolute value
signs which well what's going on at
those absolute value signs well that's
that's when the you know the thing is
not differentiable but but it's only not
differentiable when H of X equals H of Y
right and that's a place where the
there's some edge with with energy zero
so as long as you avoid the places where
energy is 0 this is not going you're not
going to have problems and in fact let's
we can restrict ourselves to a certain
set of functions eh let's restrict
ourselves to the set of functions H
which have the correct orientation on
each edge right remember we have some
some boundary conditions and if we fix
the orientation ahead of time we're
looking for if a solution which has this
particular orientation so we only need
to consider functions age such that the
value here and the value here this one
is bigger than that one so that
essentially determines for each absolute
value sign which which which one is
bigger each of x-rays or why but that's
and it's also a polytope is a polytope
of the set of functions with the fixed
signature I mean you fixed different
zone along each edge and on that
polytope this function is in fact
strictly concave because as well if you
take the logarithm it's a sum of log of
h of x minus way a log is a concave
function it's the sum of concave
function so it's concave and because
it's while strictly concave and on this
poly to open on the boundary that
polytope it goes to minus infinity
because you know the log of 0 is minus
infinity when you get to the menu when
you tend towards the boundary so i guess
the relevant picture the relevant
picture here is that you look at the
space of all possible functions H it's
it's divided up into these polytopes
like that and on each polytope that the
function is strictly concave and
therefore has a unique it goes to minus
infinity on the boundaries and therefore
it has a unique maximum one inside each
one for each polytope ok so that gives
you for every orientation that is for
every polytope a unique maxima maximizer
ok and i just want to highlight this
this equation this is going to be the
most important equation here the
harmonic equation
okay well okay so 02 is not not also
very short if you're called theorem 2
says essentially that there are no
complex solutions all the solutions are
real how do we see that well here's the
equation we're trying to satisfy the
energies are positive real numbers we're
just trying to show that any solution to
this equation has H real and there's a
one long there on the Gulf Lucas theorem
says that if you have any polynomial P
the roots of the derivative of P are
contained in the kind of Excel of the
roots of PE itself anyway some classical
theorem the proof is like one line is on
the next slide so once you accept this
theorem then you can see that if H
satisfies this then h h of x is a root
of p prime of Z where P of Z is this
polynomial here you take Z minus the H
of Y where H of I runs over the
neighbors of X think of that as a
function of D it's a lot its almost the
polynomial except these maybe you know
real numbers but looks then like a palm
oil generalized polynomial and right if
you just differentiate p logarithmically
you get that equation for H of X so that
implies that x the gals Lucas theorem
that H of X has to be in the convex hull
of the neighboring values the age of
wise so on my graph you know for every
point
the value of h NN point is is inside the
convex hull is about the boundary value
its neighboring values but all the
boundary values are our real numbers and
therefore everything has to be real and
if anybody had a positive imaginary part
for example then you could find a
neighbor which had at least as large
imaginary part and so on essentially the
maximum principle ok sir Clark here
somebody want to see the proof of Gauss
Lucas dare somebody showed this to me it
was not was somebody in my in this room
was it you al no ok and where you can
find it on Wikipedia is just one line
here's here's my anharmonic equation I
just took the complex conjugate right
but it's the same because because the
energies are real it's also true right
conjugative 00 but then I multiply the
numerator and denominator by H of X
minus H of Y right so the denominator
now becomes real this is real and H of X
minus H why those may be complex but
then you put the age of X on the other
side then it has a real coefficient here
and so what you see is that H of X is a
convex combination of the age of wise
right the this this sum is equal to that
some without those guys so the h of x is
a convex combination of the age of wise
and therefore it's in the convex hull ok
that's pretty cute and very easy all
right well let's see maybe I'll skip
this guy well okay we can I already give
you an example but the nice thing about
this variational principle this
maximization scheme is that it's very
easy to construct explicit examples now
so what I did here is I took a grid of
40 by 40 square grid
right i turned it 45 degrees and then
you know i don't know why but I I took
one source here and one sink there so
you think this is a very dense 40 by 40
grid and I oriented all the arrows you
know south and west what used to be
south and west and then given that
orientation you can ask well how do I
find conductances so that all the
energies are one or in other words how
can I find a tiling of a rectangle which
has the comet Oryx of the square grid so
I said all the rectangles at area one
and while there it is it's a unique
solution once you fix the orientation
right you know it's it's just a few
seconds on your computer to maximize
this thing but look what can you say
about this when there's a look there are
lots of questions if you like geometry
now you know is this sort of converging
to some interesting mapping so this this
is really a you can think of this some
sort of mapping from the diamond shape
to the square which right which know the
top / text sort of goes to the top
boundary but you know it's sort of
continuous inside each each little unit
of area here goes to some unit of area
in the square it's an area preserving
mapping but you know I don't actually
know what mapping that is it converges
to be kinda interesting to find out but
you know you can play you can play
around with these things because it's
very easy to do local deformations right
here here I just imposed a row shape on
that previous picture and then I I
suppose you suppose you're interested in
some you know property of that picture
near Sun location you can just re re
solve for the solve for the Thai
language which increases the area of
some rectangles rectangles near the area
near the region of interest right that's
what I did here is I I just blew up the
areas of some of those rectangles
according to some you know and and so
this part of the picture blows up the
rest of the picture gets a little bit
smaller but it's a it's a interesting
sort of deformation which is you know
not conformal which is that's why it's I
think it's kind of interesting and novel
right okay and yeah you can hear I just
playing around with these things this is
a sequence you know if I just change the
area of one of the rectangles you can
see how the other rectangle sort of move
in that under that deformation so turns
out that there is a nice scaling limit
of these mappings right if I take a
larger and larger or a finer and finer
grid and I do the same mapping into a
rectangle I can I can see what happens
as the as the mesh size goes to zero and
you do get some very interesting
solution in the end that is the the
functions converge and they convert to
some analytic functions which satisfy
the following sort of twisted the
cauchy-riemann equations no here u and v
are the x and y coordinates of the image
x and y are the x and y coordinates of
the domain and the U and V had to
satisfy these this system of pds here
which resemble the cauchy-riemann
equations for complex analysis but
they're nonlinear yes for this movie
does it say that these permutations that
you showed the slide where there were
three by four of them but if you make a
small modification then it's kind of
local I understand press yes if you make
a small modification of the orientation
then I believe I haven't proven anything
to this effect but I'm pretty sure is
true that the picture will just change
locally like you say that is the effect
of so what I did when with the big
picture as I took the sort of a nice
periodic orientation where all the edges
were oriented south and west but what Al
is suggesting is what you know
what happens if I just change the
orientation of a single edge will the
picture change in a in a drastic way or
will change in a local way and I think
it just changes in a very small location
sort of exponential decay of influence
there but I don't know how to analyze
that so yeah the usual cauchy-riemann
equations are over here there are some
nice linear things here I Kathy that's
the constant conductance laplacian or
you know analytic functions here's
here's the Koshi Riemann equations in
the constant energy case they do
resemble it but you know here the
associate laplacian is our our friendly
laplacian here that there is an applause
Ian nonlinear I don't know what to call
that guy if you have some good
terminology for these things I'd be I'd
appreciate it we call it the end
harmonica laplacian but I don't know if
that's good any good either now so both
the real and imaginary part here
satisfied the same just just like in
this case right the real and imaginary
parts U and V both satisfy the same
level plastic equation same thing here
but that doesn't mean I know how to
solve this equation okay and you know so
just playing around here I I took a
random orientation of the square grid
and I packed it in a rectangle with area
1 rectangles of course it's not so easy
to find a random orientation this is a
there are no no good algorithms for
sampling a random orientation of a large
graph random a cyclic orientation but so
i teed it a little bit here but it's
best i could do i used some glabra
dynamics and waited a long time yes is
this rotated wouldn't we expect to see
the brain top line in a very bottom line
to leave the full width you look at all
the previous examples they the right top
on the right bottom one hour this is a
slit that's the yeah I think what I did
in this case is high I
apologize I took different boundary
conditions which is that I glued all the
lower the left and lower boundary to a
single vertex and all of upper and right
boundary to a single vertex don't look
too closely okay but one thing you can
do which you just flipped and sensor the
move it created a cycle yes that's right
let me write so that the this is a
well-known way to connect the space of
orientations bipolar or bipolar
orientations which is to choose an edge
and reverse its orientation if it's
allowed one thing that is known as a
little bit so this picture creates a
bipolar disorder Hey exactly so if you
don't fix the graph but if you take a
random graph with a random bipolar
orientation I show said why pester
should start saying bipolar because
bipolar means there's a single source at
a single thing then this these objects
are in by jection with some well-known
combinatorial objects called Baxter
permutations people know how to count
them people know how to generate them
and here's a exact random sample of a
triangulation with I don't know 40,000
rectangles of a square all equal area so
I don't know if you can see anything
interesting going on here but the help I
was kind of pretty but yeah so there are
some there are things you can say in
this case but not which we can't see in
this case of the grid and you know just
a one last thing which I'm working on
and hopefully will lead somewhere soon
can we count the bipolar orientations of
the grid right remember the bipolar or
additions are basically orientations
with no sources and sinks or rather with
just one source on one sink and so
here's a sort of a scheme plan of attack
right using this technology new
technology right so what it is i took a
cylinder right and i glue the left all
vertices on the left to a single vertex
which is going to be my sink and all the
vertices in the right that's going to be
my source and right so I'm interested in
how many you know orientations are there
where this with that sink at that source
that's working that sink and the the
theorem says all have to do is count the
number of solutions to that end harmonic
equation right the every solution gives
you an ecori entation and vice versa so
so let's call xij the value of the end
harmonic function at at an interior
vertex IJ and then we get we can get a
recurrence relation because the value
here just depends on the four neighbors
right the the value to the right is I
can think of that as a function of these
four guys it's a rational function of
these four guys so you get a recurrence
x i plus 1 j is equal to x IJ plus this
rational expression right so you start
with some initial data here on the first
row and then all the other all the other
points did just depend on those on those
on the values on the first row at the
end you want them all to be equal to 1 X
you know n plus 1 comma J so using this
recurrence we can write x IJ as a
rational function of the X's on the
first row first column there and there
are techniques for counting the number
of slu so then you get some at the end
of the day you get some I mean when you
get to the end of the cylinder you get
some system of equations you have to set
them all equal to 1 and you know
algebraic geometry right when i joined
compute the number of solutions to some
big polynomial system it's the of the
mixed volume of their newton polygon
newton polytopes and the essential thing
to do is to is to compute the growth
rate of xij as a rational function of
the initial data and
I spent some time doing this calculation
and but unfortunately came out too big
so i probably made a mistake but it
seems to grow as for to the eye which
would indicate that there are four to
the 4 to the v where v is the number of
vertices orientations but that's clearly
too big because you know if you just
orient each edge both either way then
that's already for per vertex so that's
two way too many so I probably just
missed something obvious but the sea I
mean I feel like that should be
something I can complete sometime soon
okay well unless people have questions I
have just one last open interesting open
generalization not generalization but
the related problem which is about
triangles right since we as we dealt
with the rectangular Sheen's with area 1
rectangles you can ask is there a
analogous result for triangulations in
fact this the reason I mentioned this is
because this was actually our motivating
problem right Aaron asked me this
question about triangles which is sort
of an old problem and I suggested that
we look at rectangle ations because
they're often easier but so so right for
example if I take this triangulation
rectangle can there there are seven
triangles can i assign the areas
arbitrarily and the answer is no and
well like i tell you why the answer is
no but the here's a related question
sort of well known among people who know
well that theorem of muskie which says
that there you can't dissect a square
into an odd number of equal area
triangles
this is a fun fun question to think
about if you don't believe it and the
reason it's so mysterious is that the
the proof uses the axiom of choice this
is what axiom of choice what the proof
uses the axiom of choice axiom of choice
axiom of choice but the right so for
example here's a triangulation with nine
triangles right and it does pretty well
right so the area of each triangle is
not quite one night but it's pretty
close how close can you get the function
of the numbers happens so there's a
paper but this was taken from a paper
and I I apologize for forgetting the
reference but I have the reference on my
computer I will pull it up after you
afterwards so yeah that's the
interesting question how close can you
get us on the number triangle so you
can't get arbitrarily those there will
be some complex issues that's right you
can't get arbitrarily close so there's
some gap but we don't I don't know what
the gap is but sometimes there are
solutions and sometimes there are
combinatorially equivalent solutions
just like in the case of rectangles so
here's two triangles which which know if
you define the comet or appropriately
they are comet or equivalent all right
each I try to label them so you could
kind of see what's going on basically
what I've do this is a so you see this
this edge this edge here which is
adjacent to triangles for six and seven
there's an edge over here which is
adjacent to triangles for six and seven
too but the you should think of this
black edge is some sort of degenerate
triangle right it's got three three
vertices on it and they they sort of
this is also a triangle three vertices I
so that there's some sense of how these
are common to really equivalent and
sometimes you can get two solutions
sometimes you get many solutions but the
number of solution unlike the cases of
rectangle Asians the number of solutions
is not always constant sometimes there
are complex solutions sometimes there
are no solutions so so this is this is
still we still don't really know
anything about this problem but there is
a nice analog of the harmonic function
we're correct the relation between this
the network and the tiling and here
instead of talking about a symmetric
Markov chain we do an asymmetric Markov
chain so that so you have a you still
have a gret a planar graph each each
edge has a in this case it's a mark
think of it as a markov chain rather
than a resistor network what is other
than that is roughly is fairly
equivalent let's have two outgoing
outgoing arrows from each vertex except
for the top on the bottom and well ok i
don't know if i need to go out and do it
what are you being what enter it also it
just let the green one your info those
are two out like a two out number vein
is not specific I've never been is not
that's fine but so so the way you the
way the mapping works this mapping
always works is you you take each
triangle let's let's rotate the picture
so that no there are no horizontal edges
except maybe the bottom in this picture
ok so just take em sort of generic
rotation so there no horizontal itís
then each triangle has three vertices
you know a top one a bottom one in the
middle one and from the middle one you
draw this dotted line and to each reach
triangle there there's a vertex over
here and the you can think of the the
top part of the triangle as as having an
outgoing arrow to the upper and now
going out to the lower one so the green
triangle
which which corresponds the green vertex
connects to the purple one and to the
bottom like here and then there's a way
to assign a you know transition
probabilities to the edges let's see it
should be down here also so every
geometric concept over here corresponds
to some probabilistic concept in this in
this network the y coordinate of y
coordinate over there is a harmonic
function our main function is one which
is you know the value of the point is
the average of the weighted average of
the neighbors the here you know each
each edge has a slope and the slope
corresponds to the winding number of a
random walk you take a very long random
walk where you add an edge from the top
to the bottom and yeah yes for the
expected winding number around the face
and that gives you the slope over there
and so on the areas are the energy so
there's this kind of nice nice rejection
just like in the previous case and one
hope is that we can use some I use this
by dejection tues to say something
interesting about the existence of or
non-existence of fixed area rectangle
triangulations in that case but hasn't
been done yet so I'm going to stop here
thank you
questions or comments yep follow me so
in the problem with dividing dr square
into equal area triangles is again that
if you assume maximo choice you actually
can't do it no no theorem is that there
are no dissection right they in order to
prove that you need the accident twice
so if you assume that the negation you
replace take the negation of the
accident no one has no one has that okay
to say that the proof uses the axiom of
choice is a little bit too strong
because yeah what is it too strong or
not no one has been able to give one day
Siddharth you can't disguise where we
know that you need the active choice
this is not one of the right you have no
proof that you can who would love it
that's that's right it may be possible
to prove it without the excellent thank
you every time you use integration of a
university I'll see his excellence no my
computer does not use the excellent
choice when it integrates function you
can strike the lebesgue measure of that
bass no choice I never not gonna try to
any other comments or question is not
let's thank Rick again
