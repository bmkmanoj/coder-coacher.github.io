hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading

lectures freely available
you
ooh Amanda and Brady who have put
together an amazing thing this morning
on hardware startups and I am so excited
about this session so I'm going to give
this to them why thank you I am also
excited to see how this session turns
out it is all it's already awesome okay
so we have a pretty exciting lineup of
speakers um so we've got Nancy Chen who
gave that awesome talk about genetically
modified foods in China last night so
she'll be talking she'll be setting the
context talking about China's regulatory
environment and then Sylvia Sylvia do
you want to wave so people know who you
are so Sylvia and I will be doing a tag
team talk on China's maker startup and
manufacturing ecosystem so she has a
great broad view of it she's been doing
field work there for some time I'm a
case study since i'm doing a hardware
startup right now now one of the reasons
that we wanted to do this session is
because as you may have seen in the
press and bugs fear hardware is hot and
so I a couple of I guess about a year
ago I feel like Peter Brady and episode
where they do the acapella group there
anyway I jumped in and started doing a
hardware incubator and so myself and
Bjorn are going to talk about are two
methods of doing hardware incubation and
then bre pettis homeboy Brooklyn done
good is going to talk about MakerBot
then we're going to have some breakouts
and then we will have a skype in from
the man who hacked the xbox and is now
kind of the go-to person for hardware
startups buddy Wang and he'll be skyping
in from Singapore well we'll show this
to you again when it's time to actually
do the breakout groups but and the
lovely and mcleod will be talking about
the role of large corporations in the
hardware startup ecosystem she's also
been
a lot of work interviewing startup
founders and hang out and China to sort
of understand what that ecosystem is
like go unleavened john de Matos and
hayes Matt Matt's here okay well uh
he'll he'll show up anyway so those guys
are going to be talking about creating
technology in public the impact of
real-time feedback between creators and
backers on product development so John
is from Kickstarter go on and Matt have
successfully delivered Kickstarter
projects so that's sort of where they're
coming from and then Brady and I will
talk about hardware accelerators so
we'll be doing breakout sessions in
which three rooms are we using I think
there's two that way in one right over
there so um okay so I think Nancy's up
you
great so good morning everyone what I'd
like to do is actually talk a little bit
about the regulatory environments as I
was asked by Amanda and Brady I want to
thank them very much for inviting me to
participate and what I thought I'd do is
actually talk about three different
industries to get a comparative context
in thinking about you know I don't know
as much about the hardware contacts but
i think these in different industries
would be a useful comparison so i'm
going to begin with the pharmaceutical
industry then i'm going to talk about
the food industry and then lastly about
environment in thinking about the ways
in which these three different contexts
help give us a better picture of how
china regulates certain industries so
with big pharma which really took place
in the 1990s most of the major
pharmaceutical firms refer to this
period as the gold rush this was a
moment in which China was reopening
after tinumin to the world and there was
a way in which the pharmacies really
became the primary site for consumer
citizens to reinvent themselves this was
a place where they began purchasing many
different kinds of over-the-counter
drugs as well as prescription drugs at
the same time however there was a grave
concern about fakes constantly whenever
I was interviewing people either in the
street pharmacies or in the hospitals
they were constantly referred to the
concerns about well you know we don't
know if this is real medicine or fake
medicine so provenance was a constant
concern people would be inspecting
labels not just the the drug officials
but actually ordinary consumers that
would try to really understand Belgium
or if this was actually produced in
China and actually just happen to have
the label as made in Belgium so one of
the things that the Chinese government
did was to create the equivalent of the
FDA so that they call the FDA and they
created a drug approval process where it
talks about
at every level different stages of you
know inspections but also trying to make
sure that the drug was actually
effective and so the guarantee was that
within six months a drug should be able
to go to market so one of the ways in
which the FDA however has been involved
in it in those that they actually
directly imported several FDA not only
the structure of drugs to market but
also really trying to get FDA officials
involved in the process so this slide is
actually from the FDA itself and showing
how they've actually imported their
offices around the world which includes
China and this is actually one of the
outcomes of the concerns about fake
medicines during the 1990s was that
there was a the GMP the good
manufacturing practices which was really
trying to think about what are best
practices for the testing of drugs as
well as the certification of drugs many
of you however probably might have heard
however and I decided not to show us
light of this during the worst of the
drug scandals which people began to
experience not only side effects which
are you know if you read or if you view
any commercials here you know you have a
whole long list all the side effects
people actually began to die of their
medications the head of the FDA in China
was actually executed so the regulatory
environment in that context was very
simply well you know we're going to get
the you know whoever is at the very top
the buck stops here this is the end so
in this particular context the
regulatory environment was such that
initially drug firms we're able to come
into China be able to sub shop sell
their drugs and then very quickly make a
killing the sfda was not set up was not
developed until a decade later and so by
the time this infrastructure was
developed it was incredibly difficult to
really have any impact however going
forward
I the entity has gotten a lot more power
as we speak now going from there to the
the past decade in the 21st century
there's been a whole range of different
food scandals it began initially in 2004
with contaminated milk formula parents
in various provinces across central
China began to experience concerns about
the infant formula that actually had
Melanie I was tainted with his chemical
substance and subsequently after that it
was not just contaminated milk it was
also pet foods it was toothpaste heparin
it just every year it seemed like the
scandals got worse and worse some of you
might have were called pictures for
instance or stories of the 10,000 dead
pig bodies or was floating down the
wonka River in Shanghai as well as the
more recent concern which is of gutter
oil in which they take reclaimed oil and
basically we refine it to to serve again
as cooking room so ordinary citizens
have actually been very very concerned
this is another image that was amazing
and i always think wow if you go through
all this effort to make a fake egg i
mean it would be it would be so
wonderful to bring this innovation to
other possibilities but um but there's
been this huge concern about adult ones
food and so what's been interesting in
this context is that in fact again the
fda has been very involved and trying to
think about how to develop regulatory
infrastructures to try to think about
how to manage this it's not just
stopping the fake or contaminated foods
at the border but again you know going
to manufacturers and trying to find out
how they can to capture those
individuals as well as officials that
might be involved in contaminating foods
so they're increasingly more watchdogs
but in effect it's actually the ordinary
citizen
that have been involved one of the
slights I showed last night was actually
this website created by a student who
simply got tired of seeing all the
different food scandals and concerned
about the foods that he was consuming so
he created this website where people
could actually type in there think that
i have found any fake foods or
contaminated foods one of the major
changes that has really taken place over
the past two decades has really been the
role of the chinese media we tend to
think of the chinese media as being it's
very contained that it's very difficult
for them to actually have access to
information but in fact they've been the
most vociferous group and watchdog they
really come into this investigative
reporting over the past two decades but
especially this past decade and this is
actually a site the survey that was
taken with chinese youth and actually
reported in the official media so the
Chinese government has increasingly
recognized that the media has an
important role to the point that they
actually use the media but they've also
incorporated more visible signs here you
actually have the food police going to
inspect labels to make sure that there's
no its you know again in this regulatory
environment it's there's a saying in
Chinese you you kill a chicken to scare
the monkeys and so this was simply
trying to show if you can find any
examples it's very similar to the FDA I
said the SF da where the the head was
actually executed those individuals that
have been found to produce fake goods or
contaminated goods have also been
executed as well so again this is a very
specific response to this i do want to
mention however there's some interesting
results as a consequence as a result of
the fake food scandals
and that's basically the implementation
of the food safety law which was
initiated in 2009 and actually just to
some two summers ago there was another
revision and so very similar to the
pharmaceutical industry where the good
best practices you know the GMP was set
up the food safety law is also trying to
set up new possibilities for best
practices however every consumer and
purveyor that one might speak to in any
part of China they often say we have
it's great we have these laws but really
it's the implementation who's going to
be looking at this and actually
following up so I just want to end
however and briefly talk about one more
context some at the environment of
course on everyone's mind over the past
30 years the unfettered you know
development across China and especially
at cities have really led to this
unbelievable impacts on the environment
and this is actually just so slide from
ordinary daily traffic in Beijing is
actually not as congested as you would
think it looks like they're actually
moving so it's not too bad but this is
actually one of the examples in which
you know both software and hardware can
make a difference in terms of the the US
Embassy has this website where you can
actually check the air quality for the
day and actually compared to what they
what the official government says versus
what the meet the measurements at the
embassy says Oh yep so one of the
numbers it says 356 the bottom one on
the bottom says 356 and the one at the
top says 426 so it just shows you the
discrepancy between how they might
measure yeah your quality index and
actually this is a final image that's
just a
unless collecting water specimen from a
polluted river in China so again this is
really where in a rub in a context in
which there is very little regulation or
oversight it's really up to ordinary
citizens and especially now the Chinese
media increasingly are taking a role so
in transition to thinking about hardware
however had a great conversation of hat
yesterday talking about regulatory
environments and what he said is that
well our company is so small as still
under the radar and I want to end with
this particular image this image that is
very iconic his representative came out
in 1978 during just after the Cultural
Revolution and it has been it was
concerned to be very subversive at the
time the artist long known you was
struggled against and he claims it's a
self-portrait however as many scholars
and activists of the time intellectuals
died in China at the time they really
took this a statement about the state
and so the winking owl is a metaphor of
the socialist state in which on the one
hand there's an ever-present gaze in
surveillance but at the other on the
other hand there's also this willingly
ignorance or not so much ignorance but
overlooking not in choosing not to see
particular disasters that are not only
only in the making but also fully blown
at this time so I just want to leave
this image with you to help think about
possible different regulatory contexts
in thinking about the ways which who are
the active players and potential
activists that can be called upon to
make a difference so thank you very much
anyone has any questions coming up next
this was awesome yes so ha I think that
it's again very similar to any other
context in which you know there have
been a number of executions but you know
it hasn't stopped the multiple thousands
of manufacturers the problem is in the
food industry in particular it is very
there are many many small scale
manufacturers not just large scale
manufacturers and so simply catching you
know individuals in one area one
province it will never necessarily reach
others obviously it's an example but it
hasn't really made a difference in terms
of really stemming those launching the
flow of production of contaminated goods
yes
I I think it has to endure actually have
been quite a few I mean just wait there
actually have been dramatic changes over
the past 20 years things that I never
would have expected having lived and
worked there for 20 30 years so but I
think that if not food and drugs then
actually from environment I really do
think that there was some incredible
programs right now we're through the
most of the leading universities which
they actually have citizen science where
they collect data and they'll actually
input the you know though every day
they'll collect information or samples
you know water samples air samples and
they'll input it into you know software
that shared around a particular
community yes
and that was very determined
yeah and i think that the there first of
all thank you for pointing out those
similarities between 19th century
america as well as what's happening here
and i do think that the the more public
information particularly not just the
executions but also these different
scandals is really this you know push to
try to make knowledge more accessible
right and so ordinary citizens are
saying we meet we deserve to know we
need to know because this is affecting
not just our children's health but are
very there are very lives whatsoever so
there is this increasing you know push
to because the basics they say it's
basic survival but what continues to
amaze me is the resilience and that's
actually something I've been trying to
document and look at not just examples
of dire you know disaster or crisis but
really how do ordinary people respond in
such a context in how do they create
avenues of resistance but also
resilience at the same time so
thank you so much all right hello
everyone my name is Sylvia I'm a
researcher at UC Irvine and Fudan
University in Shanghai and also a
co-founder of hacked matter which is a
research hub based out of Shanghai I'm
super excited to be here many thanks to
Lily Liz and Dana who made this all
happen and to Brady who invited me I
mine and I today we'll be talking about
making with China and disconnects in
many ways to Nancy's talk already
there's actually quite a bit of effort
in terms of citizen science and air
pollution amongst China's makers and DIY
makers but I want to start with this and
I'm sure this is something that all of
you have seen before in 2012 papal watch
raised more than 10 million u.s. dollars
on Kickstarter being the recipient of
the single largest Kickstarter campaign
in history what was very crucial der
about this moment besides the fact that
a star job was able to raise millions of
dollars for way cool idea through
crowdfunding was that it created a link
in people's imaginary between
crowdfunding and hardware startups and
while many people sort of know that
China's manufacturing business has
become a crucial element in all of this
relatively few people know what is
actually happening on the side of
China's DIY makers and manufacturers
does that has led up to this development
so our goal in this talk today is really
to give you a glimpse into this world of
JY making and manufacturing in china and
i will be drawing in particular from
ethnographic research that i've
conducted over the last four years with
the DIY maker community and how it is
beginning to intersect with
manufacturing in china so i will kick us
off by taking us back about four years
when i began my research in china in
2010 i was working at the time with a
group a collective of artists designers
geeks and hardware enthusiasts who
regularly met at the co-working space in
shanghai and in the fall of 2 2010 what
happened in this community is that they
began focusing on
what could DIY making mean for China and
then out of these conversations and
regular talks at the co-working space a
group of people rented a room at the
co-working space and started China's
first hacker space and you see an image
of that room here on the screen which
was basically a table equipped with
MakerBot 3d printers Arduino and so on
the community around this hacker space
had grown to such an extent very quickly
that only six months later the
hackerspace moved into its own building
a former manufacturing site in shanghai
and when i interviewed the co-founders
at the time what motivated them to start
a hacker space in China this is how
David Lee one of the co-founders put it
he was saying our vision is to build a
hacker space with Chinese
characteristics now what does David mean
baddest a hacker space with Chinese
characteristics is a pun on the popular
phrase socialism with Chinese
characteristics a Postma rhetorical
strategy to promote this notion of to
modernize without being westernized so
in other words here David Lee suggested
that hacking and making practices or
something that's inherently Chinese and
the choice Chinese people have been
doing already for a very long time so
more importantly do with this phrase
David Lee articulated a particular
future for both China and DIY making one
that takes seriously China's own version
of make by which he referred to its long
expertise of manufacturing repair
workshops on the street a kind of making
that was driven out of necessity rather
than counter cultural ideals which David
associated with the West so in many ways
David's vision from 2010 has already
materialized by 2012 so with a
continuously growing number of hacker
spaces in China and large-scale make her
events that draw international
participants the community itself has
gained international visibility but in
addition a series of hardware incubators
in a new generation of hardware startups
has begun partnering with manufacturers
located in the south and part of China
in particular so this is around jenjen
region
in 2013 I worked as a researcher with
the 10 startups that participated in one
of these first hardware incubators
quality accelerator located in gin gin
and this is a picture of the demo day
after 15 weeks long of hardware
prototyping engine gin where the
startups presented their work in front
of Silicon Valley investors and news
media and you see em and then myself
actually here in image now turn it over
to Amanda to give us a glimpse into this
world of start where all right we look
so happy in that image I'm going to go
back to that for a second so look at how
happy we look this is before our
Kickstarter is all succeeded so this was
this was the bunch of people that we
were in the hardware accelerator with
and we were all we spent about three
months in China prototyping our products
forming relationships with manufacturers
and basically gearing up to almost all
of us around Kickstarter campaigns and I
think everyone in that picture who ran
one ultimately succeeded so um I'll show
ya oh wait hold on i'm going to press
play on this and then you can watch and
listen
so that year we had two Chinese teams
and a bunch of American teams and i
think one from britain the cohort after
us i think also had a couple of chinese
teams and people from various parts of
europe and the u.s. so it's a pretty
cross-cultural bunch um that's a good
question so I think Sylvia dude i think
they usually have like it's usually a
mix in each class so i don't know if
it's becoming more chinese it's becoming
sort of more broadly international and a
lot of the foreign startups who come in
end up hiring chinese people to work for
them because it helps so much to have
like local help especially in dealing
with suppliers and manufacturers because
a lot of them have limited English it
depends it actually depends a lot on who
you're dealing with so well we'll get to
it we'll get to that in a few slides so
the so the product that I was just
showing is the one that my startup is
making it's a smart lamp that's
programmable it's outfitted with sensors
that can detect touch and light levels
and that we put a lot of effort into
making it not just interactive but also
very expressive and and sort of Hell in
a way to like sort of make you form
emotional attachments with it as well as
being programmable and connected so I
know that there's some people here who
back this project can if you recall
backing us can you can you raise your
hand oh you guys thank you so much
seriously like I thank you so much for
kind of running my life so I actually
want to talk about like we're kind of a
case study here so Sylvia has given you
a lot of really interesting background
on the on the scene on the sort of
ecosystem between making and
manufacturing and what I want to talk
about a bit is the transition from being
a maker who makes prototypes and cool
projects to actually manufacturing those
things and how it is really actually
very different so what we really do all
day if those are the
those of you in the audience who have
Baptist have gotten updates where you
see a picture is kind of like this where
we show you all of our like really
exciting moments or like we just got
some samples off the mold isn't that so
cool that is not actually the majority
of our time but it is not spent doing
things like that it's spent doing things
like this so those are like various
different versions of my bill of
materials one is for the guy who sources
for us we've got some specifying how you
assemble our boards that goes to our
manufacturer we've got another one for
purchasing and I just I spend days days
at a time just wrangling Excel documents
it is so fun I spend a bunch of time
this is actually one of the more
effective ways to communicate with our
manufacturers so this was me giving them
feedback on samples from our mold we
have to do a lot of pictures with sort
of simple phrases so that it's very
clear what we need this is almost always
followed up by us meeting them in person
but you know we also need the written
record I spent a lot of time doing like
really really specific requirements for
manufacturing I don't know what this
means this is just what people told me
to put so the board house would know
what base material to use for our PCBs
so and then I have a lot of
conversations on QQ with suppliers this
is with people who do our solder
stencils for for our boards they don't
speak any English they make great
stencils though and they and we get them
in like 24 hours and they're like twenty
dollars um so anyway so I always have
these crazy conversations with them that
I don't understand and people that I
know who actually speak Chinese have
told me that their Chinese is even kind
of weird so so like i use google
translate for this a lot I've tried Bing
Microsoft guys Bing is not actually any
better and so I spent a lot of time
doing that um so this is like what the
actual content of our typical days look
like what we're trying to get things
manufactured
so the other thing is that for
everything that we want to build we end
up having to build half a dozen things
and prototyping is kind of an obvious
example of this where you have to do
like lots of different versions of
things to get it right but that that's
the part I know the part that I don't
know about is all the stuff you have to
build to properly assemble and test
stuff so I'm going to give you examples
from this board which is basically just
an ir emitter and receiver that creates
a beam across this like silicon die and
then when you like push the eye and it
interrupts the beam and turns the lamp
on so that is by far a simplest board
it's very simple there's like four
things on it so in order to assemble it
correctly the ir emitter and receiver
have to be aligned and i can do that by
like very carefully balancing the board
and soldering it really carefully and
you can't expect someone to do that you
know 1,500 times on an assembly line so
we make rigs to make sure that
everything gets aligned straight and
like you know we send the designs out to
be laser-cut and like label them and
then so that way you can assemble it in
a more foolproof way and so that's
that's one bit that we have to do the
other thing we have to do is test this
board and i actually have to really
thank matt for his guidance on testing
because he's done it more than I have
and he gave us really great advice on
how to do this and I may have kind of
copied his board um so that's the board
that we're using to test it has a few
different relays on it that makes
different connections we can test if
things are shorted out we can test if
the sensors are working so we have to
make a whole nother board for every
board that we make in order to be able
to test those boards and then in order
to just sort of mechanically you make
the connections we get these awesome
testing jigs which get made in like
three days for 450 qui which is like how
many dollars that like 75 bucks for this
really cool machine and if you've
noticed like one thing is that a lot of
these extra parts that we have to make
to make our parts are batch manufacture
their laser cut their cnc and so there's
a lot of batch manufacturing support for
mass manufacturing that we really rely
on a lot so our board gets put in this
jig there's a little black box in there
so no light gets in to interfere with
the IRB and they made that for us custom
it's got a little empty spot there where
we can
put our testing board so this is like
for the simplest board in our assembly
this is how much extra stuff we have to
make to make sure that it can scale up
and actually work so that's been
educational by the way backers I
apologize for the delay this is why so
and lastly there's a ton of relationship
management so people who are supporting
our project this is basically what they
see they talk to us we talked to them we
look like we're the people who are
making the product but in fact we have a
lot of partners so one of our main
manufacturers is AQS I think they also
made the second version of the chumby
they make little bits so they're doing
our PCBs and assembly hell optical lowes
doing our injection molding and lenses
these guys are doing the wooden version
of our lamp it's a limited edition these
guys are doing the gooseneck legs so
those are all custom made and the
silicone eyes and the-- and the nuts and
bolts like me like literally like the
screws and stuff power supplies USB
cables LEDs and then we have this guy
who's like kind of a magician with
sourcing and any time a part costs too
much or has like an eight week lead time
we call him and he gets it for us in
like three days and he's amazing but
anyway so there's a ton of relationship
management and if one person in this
assembly messes up or has a small delay
that can affect everybody else so so
that's been an actually really
interesting challenge where there's tons
and tons of relationship management
going on when we manufacture great so if
you put this into context what we just
heard from Amanda when it comes to
explaining the meaning of innovative
product to a design the quintessential
example commonly used is Silicon Valley
China on the other hand is often invoked
as its unimaginative counterpart Silicon
Valley comes up with the ideas and china
manufacturers them right so many of the
computers in front of you for instance
are labeled like this designed in
California and assembled in china and
what I've
my research is that China's makers are
currently working towards changing that
image they're really moving from this
very common image of what innovation
means from this image of made in China
to that there's a process of making with
China and this really speaks to some of
these partnerships the demand also talks
about when i talk about china's makers
here I really speak about both startups
that come from China and from abroad
start working with manufacturers but
also the manufacturers themselves and
coming back to James questions there is
a growing number also of Chinese
startups as also series of incubator
programs now at the Chinese universities
including Ching hai University so you've
seen over the last several years arise
also in Chinese startups so to put it in
a context of the location so jen jen is
crucial in four deaths it has long been
a particularly unique environment in
china declared a special economic zone
upon his inception it was designed and
built with the goal to actually attract
foreign investment for example foreign
corporations were attracted with tax
reductions and other benefits so that's
why many of the factories actually
opened up there in 2012 there's a series
of new policy regulations and that makes
it easier for Chinese startups to open
up in gen gen so this is one of the more
recent developments and this is her one
of the Chinese startups put it in an
interview with me he told me shangela
feels much more open and any other city
in China it's a place where lots of
people begin to think about starting up
a business that's why we like to be here
and it's really important to recognize
how different it is from a city like
Beijing and Shanghai to come with a lot
of history and cultural tradition and
established big name brands right so jen
jen is also the home to something called
Shan Zhai so it's not only the place of
these large-scale manufacturers but an
ecosystem of small-scale production
houses which is a has come to they have
come to be known under this terms and I
so jean-guy traditionally stands for
copycat so think of the copy Gucci bag
or the copycat iphone that you find in
one of the electronic markets in
Shanghai or in England
and for example but it has transformed
from this copycat production into
triggering new forms of innovation so
the most well-known examples for this
are for example dual SIM card phones
that were produced by the small scale
manufacturers or the early SmartWatch as
it actually came out before the Pebble
watch was put up on Kickstarter or the
phone with a built-in compass so a lot
of these devices that are produced in
small batches three to five thousand
pieces put on a market the manufacturers
in that sense test if there's interest
in it and then they start innovating why
quickly and produce the next version and
this is really designed for specific
market segments so for example migrant
workers who couldn't afford a smartphone
still get a cool phone that looks like
one of these for example so somebody who
has written quite extensively about this
is bunnie huang and he has given us its
own name he named this is not just John
Johnny mortises con Chi which speaks to
a Chinese version of open source now
what does bunny mean with this so these
Shan Zhai manufacturers that have just
been talking about were able to innovate
so quickly because they openly share
things like the Bill of Materials so the
thing the demand of just told you about
this wall it's a list of materials with
all the sources and materials that go
into producing a particular artifact and
so these small-scale vendors have been
able to develop very quickly and rapidly
by sharing their sources so under
Chinese side coming back to the question
of what are the Chinese startups in this
so does this eric pond from seed studio
who opened up in 2008 two years before
china's first hacker space opened a
design and manufacturing house in jen
jen his market is actually makers so
Eric designs and manufactures open
hardware products is not being shipped
into the world his vision though is not
just to design another manufacturing
unit in Jen Jen his real vision behind
this is to actually change something for
the people on the factory floor so what
eric has been doing is that he actually
puts people together in teams where they
can learn from one another so workers
would for example transition from repair
/ engineering into design and this is
also visible on the labels of Eric's
products that are not labeled
made in China but in a weight with China
and again this is coming back to what I
started with this vision of like that
makers in China pushing forward that
there is a move from Made in China to
making with China and I want to end with
this quote from an interview i did with
Terri Chung recently this is the former
CEO a foxconn just to give you sort of a
glimpse into how the big players are
also beginning to notice some of this so
he explained her to me how after his
retirement from Foxconn he became really
interested in the maker movement and he
says here I'm now standing on the other
side I worked for a large company for 35
years I think that's enough I want to
help the younger generation I want to
help make hers be successful and with
this I would like to thank you very much
and next up is your in Hartman of
Berkeley to talk about Hardware
incubation at the academic level great
so Brady and I will split the session
and I want to talk about how we go from
you know interested students and get
them to a point where they may actually
be ready to enter into an hardware
accelerator or incubator program so this
is just a shot of an afternoon in the
invention lab a space that I co-direct
with Eric Paolo's at UC Berkeley now
this classic piece of Steve Jobs arguing
about how you know you need to marry
technology with the liberal arts it's
hard to believe this was only three
years ago so this was the ipad 2
announcement and one of the points the
other than it being a fabulous ad for
working studying and researching in
human-computer interaction and user
interface design is that he makes this
argument that we're in this post-pc era
where hardware and software have to
become really integrated and so well
what does he and was Apple mean by
post-pc well it's devices that connect
to the apple app store now you can
probably frame this a little larger and
if you followed the CES coverage from
last week here's what CES means by
post-pc and what's interesting is that
there's a whole lot of activity in a
very very small number of segments right
so there were dozens of smartwatches and
even more many more dozens of activity
trackers and then smart home appliances
and apparently it's pretty profitable to
be in one of those small niches these
days um but what we believe is that
there's actually a much larger space of
other appliances smart products to be
explored and that's what we want
students to do in the invention lab so
what is one of these labs look like well
this feels a bit redundant showing you
these pictures while being in ITP
because by now by now you you know what
the general ingredients of one of these
fabrication labs look like right so lots
of digital fabrication equipment from
low-end 3d printing to high-end
multi-material 3d printing laser cutting
circuit board milling parts stores
basically what you see when when you
look around here what's also really
important though is a staff so this is
Mark Wahlberg he's one of our lab
managers and from the very beginning
before we had equipment we knew we had
to have lab staff who's knowledgeable
and can be around every day to teach
people so nowadays what we feel actually
students come in with kick ass analysis
and math skills and mostly computer
signs and programming skills at as well
but even the electrical engineers may
not ever have held a soldering iron so a
lot of the things we need to do in the
first month is just a rapid-fire
exposure to physical skills and building
there are two classes that I just want
to give you a quick overview of the
first is critical making this is a class
that Eric palos teaches where he
explicitly pairs students with some
technical background with students who
have don't who don't have any technical
background at all and they come up with
some really inventive solutions like
this spice printer that takes you know
additive manufacturing concepts and
applies them to the kitchen or these
kind of whimsical tactile games that are
that you play blindfolded and you have
to feel your way around the game board
or more artistic concept like moss based
QR codes that you spray on buildings but
that only remain legible for a limited
amount of time before they decay now in
my own class I co teach a class with
Paul right and were more explicitly
oriented towards making products that
could then go in in an incubator so a
little more market
orienta just want to give you a couple
of examples of what students can come up
with in about 10 weeks so this is car
PhD this is a device you plug into your
diagnostic port every car in the US has
one of these ports since the mid-90s and
then it uploads the data through
bluetooth through your phone to the
cloud to give you suggestions for how to
save gas mileage this was simultaneously
developed by students as this other
device also out of Berkeley called
automatic that you can now buy in in the
apple store here's a smart a drip
irrigation system that has a 3d printed
valve and a soil humidity sensor at the
end it's just a spike you put it in the
ground and it doesn't automate your
gardening because the students found out
in a contextual inquiry that's that's
not what gardeners want they want to be
involved in the growing of vegetables
and so therefore that has a solar cell a
wireless radio that sends all that data
to to your tablet here's a shower device
that has an internal hydro generator to
generate enough energy to power a small
bluetooth radio that for example in
california we have lots of uninsulated
water line so it can take a couple of
minutes so you ought to get to gets warm
so you turn the shower on you can then
make coffee and it tells you when the
water is warm enough here's a here's it
a spelling teddy bear so you learn how
to spell with with this pair that has
kind of a voice interface but it also
keeps all these detailed detailed
records of what you could spell
successfully and what not and so it can
give you as a parent kind of guidance
for maybe what what to review some other
examples here's a smart barrel gauge the
students did work with micro
distilleries and figured out that they
have to report for tax reasons their
alcohol liquid level in every barrel so
someone walks around with the dipstick
every quarter with hundreds and hundreds
of barrels so this is just a small
ultrasound sensor that you put in the
bunghole of your barrel more devices yet
more we also start to do we started to
do quite a number of medical devices so
this is a
a smart patellar reflex measurement
device that you strap on your shin and
it measures amplitude and latency of
your patellar reflex if you have a
neurological disease that can keep track
whether that's getting worse or better
tracking your daily liquid intake this
may be really appealing to the
quantified self crowd but there's also a
big opportunity here for dialysis
patients and people with congestive
heart failure who have to make sure they
don't drink too much on a given day and
we're actually doing this together with
ucsf which is our medical school there
so there are many other opportunities
like like the smart retainer so just to
finish up where does the social come in
while all of this only works with the
network so we've been building a network
of super users and we we give them this
bargain which means you can have 24-hour
access to our shop if you make your
expertise available for n hours per
month to the other users and this has
worked like gangbusters so we have a CAD
expert we have a PCB expert etc and they
post their hours we're also doing some
research for how you can scale this
beyond being in the lab so here's small
wearable device we're working on that
supposed to kind of capture and transmit
some manual skills where it's not just
pushing go on a 3d printer but manual
sanding using a manual power tools and
the reason we want to scale this up is
that as I mentioned yesterday we're
actually building a new design institute
across the street where we want to
hopefully at some point in the future
get a thousand students per year through
hands-on making classes and that will
hopefully generate many startups that
then apply to brady's incubator
thank you born so we're running a little
low or a little low on time so I'm just
going to talk very very briefly and then
hand it over to breeze so that we can
move on so I run highway 1 which is a
hardware incubator about nine months ago
I decided to hop over and create this
thing I work for PCH international which
is a large supply chain management
company they make a lot of the stuff
that you have with you today they handle
a lot of apples supply chain and beets
and things like that now we've been
running the program for four months and
we take in teams that have a prototype
and want to try and get something made
because it's very easy to make something
but it's not easy to make something that
can be made and I think you saw that
with Amanda stalk and so some of the
things that I've learned along the way
is that entrepreneurs coming in think
that the prototype is the documentation
they kind of show up with their Arduino
board with the blinking LED and they
think they can just go to the factory
and they can have that made 10,000 times
and it's just not that simple and so the
skills that you need for prototyping do
not translate directly to making
something 10,000 times and getting
something manufactured so whereas like
the early team at the early stage two to
three people with kind of business
skills development skills design skills
and making skills are great for that
initial idea but the further down you go
the closer you get to actually shipping
and making it real you actually break
out into a lot of different skills
different from software companies you
need an experienced double e who is
going to be able to make your board
small enough and work on the antenna and
work on power consumption you're going
to need a mechanical engineer who
understands how to make a hinge work
right that will be able to twist 10,000
times you need someone who knows
firmware and can work with the latest
Bluetooth stack and you kind of probably
need a good connection in Apple to get
your mfi chips because those are hard to
come by but that's another story
altogether
now the other challenge that we find
with companies coming into highway one
is that they're so focused on the
hardware because for a lot of them that
is like the first thing that they've
ever made that they've ever made it
scale and they forget about the software
because when you first get a hardware
device that first week do you have it
you play with the buttons you feel it
you feel it in your hand and the build
quality really matters but in the end
the interface that you have is through
the software and through the design and
so that's something that we're trying to
figure out how we can help companies in
the program when I deal with my sonos at
home it's through the iphone controller
it's through my laptop controller it's
not through the white box that sonos
actually made when i play with my iphone
and adduced is usually playing with my
iphone it's what Donny I've software
team is made not the hardware team and
so that's the other thing that we really
try and drill into the company's is it
that's the interface I'll be doing one
of the breakout sessions I've talked
about this at length online so if you
serious about it I'll be around if you
are interested in doing something like
this there's a great book by Phil Baker
who worked at Kodak and apple and is
consultant to hundreds of hardware
startups it's called from concept to
consumer so on the first books I read
when I first started a down this path
and bunnies blog and as I mentioned
bunny will be speaking in about half an
hour to us via Singapore all right thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
