you
thank you very much for coming over
today I know many people are here also
many people are watching online so thank
you very much thank you very much as
well to participate in this event and
I'll go over the event that we had over
this weekend but it went really well
we started Friday evening with the
introduction to touchdevelop
it was a workshop hands on everybody
developed their first touch develop apps
and then on Saturday morning till
afternoon we were here it was more like
an officer and people were coming in we
were trying to answer as much questions
as many questions as possible and a lot
got done Saturday Sunday I believe was
either resting or working on the apps
many were working on the apps so that
really went well and today by noon we
had 17 submissions so 17 apps were
submitted for the competition and it was
hard going through all of them because
we wanted to bring out the finalists so
the eight finalists who would be
presenting here we went through that and
I believe all the finalists are here and
before we go and start looking at each
of those finalists I like to introduce
our panel of judges we have three
distinguished judges amongst ourselves
yes of course better so we have Judith
Judith Bishop is the director of
computer science here at mites of
research connections she's been a
professor for quite a long time all of a
life before she came here she's her
research interests are in languages
compilers
and she's written number of books on
this topics and a lot of present a lot
of papers and a lot of research is done
in that area she will be one of our
judge judges then we have Ben Ben is a
research area manager here he's managing
the research in software engineering a
group here at MSR and
he'll be one of our judges then we have
Tao Tao brings to the judging panel
another flavor which is he is an active
professor in one of the universities he
comes to MSR from North Carolina State
University his research work is all
about software engineering social
computing and the like and he's right
now a visiting researcher here at MSR
for the summer
I like to thank the three of you for
being here
how will frame this competition is will
give three minutes to each of the
contestants each of the finalists to
come up here present their demo talk a
little bit about it we do not have
individual slide presentations for each
demo though we'll have one slide going
up with the name of the of the project
and some screenshots but they'll be
presenting it orally as well as using
whole vision to actually demonstrate the
judges would be judging based on the
criteria which we set forth earlier
which is the polish and the novelty
aspect of the apps and then we will let
them after all eight contestants have
have presented we let the judges you
know talk to each other
confer with each other and then come
back and announce three winners but it
doesn't end there then we have one prize
where I should talk about the prizes we
have the Xbox bundle as the first prize
we have the Nokia Lumia 900 as the
second prize and we have the Kinect for
Windows as a second as a third prize and
then we have a Lumia 800 as the Choice
Award the People's Choice Award so we'll
be using another project from Mike's of
research which allows you to vote for a
certain topic during the presentation so
if you have a phone a laptop or any
means to go off to the Internet any any
device doesn't matter which there is a
URL up there you'll just go on to that
URL gives your webpage which you can use
to what so the rest of the 5 the 3 which
would be winning the three prizes the
first second and third
and then the rest of the fight will vote
for them based on the the choice of what
the viewers Choice Award so that's kind
of how we'll go so let's go right into
it the first finalist for today if I can
move this is 3d traveller the Gustav
Glenn draughts please come over and we
have a timer here I'll start that and
then I call it 3d traveler it's
essentially a 3d collect the objects
dodged the obstacles game so we've seen
these before on the Internet the
interesting thing with touchdevelop is
from what I can tell this is the first
3d game on the platform touchdevelop
isn't natively have 3d support so I had
to put that in the back end so what we
have here is the intro entry menu screen
nothing too special what's really hard
to see especially with this presenting
is they're stars moving in the
background so if people want to see
later or actually want to try the app
there is a star field sort of like the
star screen so everyone knows what's
running unfortunately because it'd be
white balance here you can't see it but
on the phone it shows up very nicely so
few special options you can calibrate
your accelerometer they said think is
important feature for a game especially
for phones I've seen that don't have it
because if you're holding your phone
sort of vertical like this and you're on
a bus you want something that you can
tilt a lot because the bus might jerk
around a bit but if you're sitting at
home you might want precision and you
just might want to tilt it a little bit
to move all the way left to right same
with up or down so that's the
interesting feature the other thing you
can also do is email your high score
when you're done these those are both
using the touch platform so if we run a
new game you get some information
and now here's stuff showing up really
badly can we turn off the light on the
camera
blippi focus if you do I guess you can
see right there in the center some
information about the project at the
start up with a game I show thank you at
the start up at the game you basically
see information about what this game is
your ship your enemy but this is yellow
so this will show up that's what you're
supposed to collect so after those three
you basically start the game so here we
um you can see unfortunately this game
is optimized for you actually holding it
so I can't put it on a table but you can
sort of see this the field at the moment
barely visible zooming up towards you in
3d can we project what you're seeing
there no okay there we go
there you go so there's our field and
you would see the ship but I can't
actually put the ship on the screen
because I'm holding it the wrong way to
finish game ends you get a notification
goes back to the main screen and you can
play again don't have to restart the
game okay thank you thank you very much
so the next one is baby nose numbers
Natalia with Sarah did I pronounce it
right Sarah yes oh this is this OP I'm
supposed to entertain the child at the
time where parents forgot the toy with
them basically it's just by tapping you
have to move them so that on the top
there was a smallest number and it
should be vibrating after the end and
then when you face it down we will have
them different and actually I have I
have two different boards one can be
stuck like this that's it and what gets
at random first and second selected at
random so the child just can put it
facedown and half all over again that's
it thank you thank you very much
our next contestant is Morgan Morgan
hokey gas savings traveler so I'm
actually gonna start with the app
already running because this is a GPS
app and I
better way to show the GPS app than to
have a GPS trace already on it the basic
idea for this app is that if you're
going to walk or bike somewhere and this
is to encourage you to do that as an
alternative to driving so it traces the
route that you take and then tells you
about how much gas you saved by doing
that so let's start the app over and
kind of get an idea for what really how
this really works all right so when you
start up the app you agree with these
two buttons start and stop and so let's
start a new run so I've just started the
app I'm leaving my house getting on my
bike I'm gonna bike down to the store
you can see that's where I'm starting
and if you remember from when I started
that it traces out where you go with the
Green Line so you can kind of see the
route that you've taken and have an idea
for what you've done when you've reached
your destination all you do is hit the
back button to stop and then it tells
you how much you've saved it tells you
what your lifetime savings is and then
it automatically lets you post that to
your social networks and I'm a social
guy so I want to tell my friends all how
much better at saving the environment I
am than them
and so it was just that and that just
calls straight into the touchdevelop
api's one additional feature that this
app has is a global leader board so you
can know how your life savings of gas
stacks up against everybody else in the
world right now I'm the only one on the
leader board and I'm in lead great
that's pretty much all there is to my
app we have live tile support so that if
someone picks up your phone they can see
just how much you've saved without even
entering the app let's see if we can get
that to fire yeah that's that's pretty
much all we have to this app thank you
thank you very much okay so the next
contestant is Erik villain with image
filters yep so well
when I heard about the hackathon my
first idea was trying to do something
interesting and I always wanted to like
make like a camera filter that when you
were recording camera and
were looking at everything like in a
8-bit video game but then I strive to do
it and it was released low so I settled
with the second best thing which is
doing it for static images so here's the
application it's a very straightforward
application let me just run it here so
first it just says please take a picture
or load one of your pictures and just to
make it interesting I'm going to take a
picture here hopefully it will work it's
a little bit dark but we will have to do
with this and then the next thing is
that we have a bunch of different image
filters I have like three categories of
image filter first we have the popular
Instagram like vintage filter which
pretty much that's like a sepia tone or
a CN tone or a and grey stone with a
well all the corners like blurred out
which is kind of cool and we have oh I
stopped them yep click on our button but
well so now I'm going to load that
picture because maybe make a blur color
than what we have now and we'll all of
parties with a touch ap ice so let's go
with this one I've never tried this one
so maybe interesting oh okay there is so
other set of filters I have is just kind
of a 8-bit video game style filters
there's like a small counter on top of
these because that's because it's really
low and this will just make it like that
8-bit can pretty much I have another
setting here it just does interent
number of colors so it's like 16-bit or
a bit and the other filter I added was
just edge detection I saw that there was
an edge detection filter that makes
everything like look like but relief but
I wanted to add a bit more so I just
added like a full edge detection thing
here and I tried to overlaid on the
image but I'm not sure if it is
completely different from your image but
yep and so basically that's all I did
and well just a
happily oh one second okay so just one
minute so to make all the Instagram
filters I just made like a kind of very
image on the corners and more cookies on
the right and that's well calculated by
the application here so that's the image
am i playing together with like a tone
like a sepia tone and the actual picture
so that's how we get the Instagram like
filter and well that's pretty much it
thank you thank you very much oh and you
can say the pictures and share it with
other people
good thank you thank you okay so then we
have lifeline by Emanuel so we've all
been in a situation where we want to get
out of there but we don't want to be
rude whether whether that be like a
conversation or just some awkward spot
and you're like no so I decided to write
out a script that's basically a lifeline
with it I mean I'll do a description the
script and I'm gonna run it so the what
this script does is you hit it you just
you know pretend you're checking your
time you hit it it sets off about a two
minute delay and then it simulates like
you're getting a call and then now we
could be like oh excuse me you know I
gotta get up I gotta take this call come
back you know something happen I have to
leave and the best thing about it is
that it has an offline in an online mode
now online is the prettiest obviously
but the offline mode also works as long
as you're fast enough to catch it before
they see what's actually there so I will
run it and you'll see it it's this is
actually set for ten seconds because you
know I have three minutes I don't want
to put two minutes waiting all right so
runs right and it has three first it
starts off with three things there's a
blank screen as you can see so people
don't even know it's running then
afterwards there's a vibration along
vibration right now if we can hear it it
vibrates four times I said somebody's
vibrating and it actually it brings up
the screen and show you like somebody's
calling and then all but you have to
hope it does one more time
it actually brings a ringtone and then
that's that stopped now if I were to
take if I were to go over here into
settings and let's say we take off it
take off the you're in a place I'd you
have absolutely no servers so like you
know secret nuclear facility or
something yeah let's go ahead and put
airplane mode on come back here turn it
on again got another ten seconds to wait
it would do something similar the only
problem is that it doesn't bring off the
it doesn't bring up the original image I
showed because I take those straight off
the internet which include the the image
I showed but it does bring a point image
so it makes it look like it's somebody
any contacts it vibrates still and then
the next part right after this it plays
a sound to actually makes it sound like
it's one of your ringtones our default
that people don't change so that's
pretty much what the app does and after
ten seconds I'll stop so you can it
gives you enough time to walk away and
that's pretty much it
thank you thank you very much okay so
then we have a mini Wars Emmett first
before I start let me thank the touch
development team for holding this this
event and also for making this great
development environment so my the game I
created is called many wars and it's
make of traditional game which we have
two artilleries and each one tries to
heat the other one with the bomb I chose
this game because I can do it in a very
short time because this is my first
application ever tried times phone so
first you can select number of players
and you can choose to three or four i
limited number four because as screen
size is very limited so we have here two
you have two tanks here the red one and
the green one the green one is
over here but leave it's not very clear
here on the screen you can adjust you
can aim to your enemy by dragging this
in this area and then I found that maybe
maybe the ragging is not you cannot aim
very accurately so at this earth so you
can fine-tune your angle and your power
and then once you are satisfied you can
shoot the bomb past your enemy and then
if it hits him he loses some power but
now he didn't lose anything
another thing edit is that you can make
it harder to enemy to reach you by
jumping so we can your 10 can be by
doing this jump to change your location
so maybe it becomes harder to be enemy
to to reach you also edit the different
weapons so sometimes you have this
missile send a city of the normal bomb
so you have different weapons and then
of course I have time to finish it
because you have to hit your enemy 10
times because he has alive so over top
over here you have life for the gain 1
which is 90th other one is 100 and then
that's all I thought I had more weapons
but I didn't have time for all these
because I disappear over the dike and ok
thank you thank you thank you very much
really cool game
so when I run it for the first time it
actually downloads a lot of little
images and artwork and then it just
talked to me it said shake to play run
this again so that you can hear - yeah
and now it's a classic snakes and
ladders game so there are two players
here red and green and they move around
the board every time I shake the
alternate and depending on what fields I
hit it either
might climb up or go down so if I shake
them the dice should whole you shake
more okay so the dice was holding or is
holding and now the ball moves and
there's also a sound like the ball is
actually moving every time I shake the
other player takes a turn yeah that is a
game he I think he anticipated just went
on I think he anticipated that this
would be a big big hit you already
integrated okay thank you okay so now we
have point hop who's going to present it
give it a meeting solution for basically
anyone who's working in Microsoft to
open up this app and you see your
meetings for the next couple days
you pick a meeting you figure out how
you're gonna get there if it's a meeting
that's close by you and a walk there
gives you the Bing Maps instructions to
get there if you need to call a shuttle
it has all the shuttle stuff built in so
just click one button and you open up
the shuttle you call them using the
phone API and you can call a shuttle
from the point you're at to the point
where you need to be if it's an online
meeting it extracts the conference ID
for that online meeting from the subject
from the body of the email and it'll
have
information right there along with the
phone number to call in to a landline
meeting directly from the phone so I'll
demo those three features for you I'm
actually borrowing a phone over there
because I don't have mine right now so
I'll have to go through this sample data
quick
so we'll try out a meeting that we just
created all other meaning and previously
that was the slide the page with all the
meetings so we clicked an individual
meeting we read directly to this map
we're going from Lincoln Square to City
Center Plaza there's a content filtering
for abbreviations and building numbers
so you can actually work with API and
provide palatable information that there
works with it with a Bing API so like a
press back this isn't what I want to do
I can find the shuttle information I'll
press the call shuttle there it'll ask
me if I want to call don't call and I
can just go right through there call the
shuttle from point A I am where I am the
port where I need to be now if I click
on line meeting
ms our talk series I can click back to
the it wasn't an online meeting so I can
find one quick
there there you go
pics out online meeting picked up the
conference ID from the details extracts
that and as the conference number and
the conference ID right there so you can
call from your phone and join any of
these three types of meetings in a
really simple efficient way and a lot of
this is automated so it's all at all
just goes into your appointments your
meeting calendar and figures out what
you have and and really sets it up for
you in a user-friendly way to kind of
access and plan out your day even
looking ahead that's point hot thank you
thank you very much so that would be our
eight contestants we have heard from if
the three judges would like to confer at
the back you can do that in the meantime
we can actually have some snacks and
then after they're back they'll announce
the winners what you accomplished over
course of a few days it's just
remarkable I think it's a remarkable
testament to your ingenuity and your
efforts but also to the platform you
know I like you know let's give Nicola
and Pele a hand from touch about is
really I know it's it's you know it's
startling to see the kind of things that
can be done and it was really hard and I
was saying that it's really hard as
judges to go through and look at these
and say wow you know we have to pick
only three out of all these great
projects so having said that I'll start
I'll start with our third place of
winner and this is 3d traveler so the
pretty please whoever did 3d turbine
with my mana just said so I just want to
say about 3d traveler I think we really
felt strongly that bringing 3d
technology to the touchdevelop platform
and showing people you know that it
could be done and it can be done in an
effective way is really moving the
platform for us so we really thank you
so much for that thanks a lot
okay so the second-place winner we're
giving two point hop so uh please come
forward so we felt point hop was a great
a great illustration of the capability
of the phone in terms of not saying oh
you know here's a silo that's going to
be your math and here's the silo that's
going to be your you know your outlook
information it's basically saying how we
how we can with touch to bail very
quickly bring these sources together and
give people the opportunity to get the
information they need right now right in
front of them so that's a great a great
direction to take this technology
forward and for the final four the final
first-place winner we want to give that
to snakes and ladders by Andrew coats
Andrew is Andrew here
unfortunately Anderson here ok let me
just say a couple words about snakes and
ladders we felt that it really
illustrates and again in a remarkable
way how you can take an idea in this
case it's sort of an experience that
people have had since kids with a board
game you know and sort of work with a
board game and transfer that experience
in a matter of days to a working
application that you know that has a
look and feel and the sort of the polish
of you know what you'd buy in the
marketplace what people would typically
buy in the marketplace and I guess with
the integrated ads it's one of these
things where you know you can see he's
he's going beyond just you know built
your building as a demo but actually he
wants to monetize it so we really we
really felt like again it's gonna be a
great milestone for people looking at
touchdevelop to say wow you know what
can you one of the things we can build
so so thanks a lot to Andrew for that
alright and now Alex next I out a new
thing this is new this product was
released today actually the meeting of
it the technology will use to what so so
bear with me now if you have a device
any device
Windows Phone iPhone Android laptop
anything that you have all you do is you
go to this URL and this would give you a
nice UI with a ray of either green like
or a dislike so we'll only be using the
likes and when you have it out I can
then ask for votes for each of the
projects so how this will happen is
we'll ask for votes for the five
remaining runner-ups
so other than these three the five
remaining runner-ups will board and we
have a Nokia Lumia 800 for the one
getting the most words okay so that's
what are we done voting I see one two
greens there's move on to the next one
gas saving traveler oh I have three and
we close it there
I will reset this let's vote for gas
savings traveler okay so we have eleven
here let's now move on to image filters
but let's let me reset there you go
image filters
nor dislikes if you don't like it do
nothing okay so we have four then we
have lifeline and let me reset give me a
minute yeah
lifeline
okay we have seven then we have I know I
know but remember to figure this
technology out so they just released
this okay so then we have many wars and
let me reset many wars
but we closed it there okay we have six
and our clear winner is gasps I'd like
to thank all of you for being here for
participating in the event and for
knowing more about touchdevelop our we
hope that you'll continue using it in
whatever you do and we'll continue
hearing from you thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
