and I host and produce a narrative
documentary style podcast called the
intern and I work out of beta works and
a Brady tag made to talk and so just
wanted to share a little bit about about
what I do so I do not have a tech
background at all I used to be a teacher
work in the nonprofit space so when I
was hired to make a podcast about what
it's like to work in tech and live in
New York City it was kind of my first
introduction to everything so I kind of
out operations like an insider outsider
to this world and and so kind of to like
really quick stories about that when I
first sat down in the morning and
everyone was introducing themselves as
kind of taking notes on who I wanted to
talk to and just like kind of like what
they looked like or what they were
wearing and I looked at my list and
realized it was like you know this
person their name why I wanted to talk
to them like blue plaid shirt and it was
like pink plaid shirt like light blue
plaid shirt and then the other thing is
that so i watch Silicon Valley for the
first time like years ago and I just
didn't I didn't get it at all like i
didn't understand why it was funny and
then it came on after Game of Thrones
the other week and I started watching it
again like for the second time and I was
like this is hilarious I totally get
that so at that moment I was kind of
like all right I think I'm kind of
stepping in a little bit more to the
inside our side of things so like in in
each episode I kind of asked a bigger
question about the tech world and then
kind of try to see it through the lens
of my own experience so like one of the
first episodes I asked the question
where does all this money come from like
why is it that i'm eating kind bars and
like stashing five in my backpack every
day and we're all drinking free beer and
none of these companies are making any
money and like I get it but like really
like where does that money come from and
like okay it comes from the VCS but
where does that money come from and in
so I kind of bring like a healthy dose
of skepticism I think the things and
also just make it relatable as someone
coming from the outside looking in I
think one of the best episodes I
documented my experience asking for a
raise so
that's episode 5 you want to check it
out and so with that in mind like the
outsider perspective I thought I'd just
share some questions that I have coming
into this the botanist space and okay so
one thing I've noticed is that companies
in beta works and in the space suddenly
started incorporating bot strategies
into their companies and my question is
like this was touched on earlier but in
some ways it is fueled by venture
capital money but like to what extent
and how does that work why is the bot
bot topic so polarizing why are some
people so staunchly opposed to this new
thing and some people are so behind it
how is this different than smarter child
which I talked to in Middle School on
aim like what what is new what is new
here and how our BOTS going to monetize
and why do people scoff when I ask this
question and also like what's with all
the jargon I'm really interested in like
how ideas come today and how trends
become something that we're all going to
jump on this train and get behind how
did the word bot come about and we had a
really interesting conversation about
that so that's pretty much it it's
really interesting being here with you
guys and yeah if you want to download
the podcast you can get itunes overcast
soundcloud it's called it the intern
