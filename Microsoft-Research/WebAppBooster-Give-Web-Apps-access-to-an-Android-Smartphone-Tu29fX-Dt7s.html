you
hello I'm Nicola German in rice group at
max of research is my pleasure today to
announce our new puter from San
Francisco State University so we've been
working with Arnel into the past months
on a project called hatch develop a
mobile development environment that
comes in many platforms and I know is an
expert in cost compilation and dealing
with many different war platform so I'm
excited to hear more about today what
anna has been doing now yeah thanks
Nicholai for the introduction and thank
you very much for inviting me to give a
talk here so the title of the talk is
web a booster giving web apps access to
your smartphone and this project was a
result of a collaboration with microsoft
research as nicole i mentioned and i
want to give you a bit about the
motivation on why we did it and also
some technical details on what a booster
is all about so I will in terms of
agenda I will talk a little bit about
using html5 for mobile apps so it's a
pretty exciting time if you look in the
space I will talk about phonegap kind of
the pioneer of using html5 for mobile
app development and then I go into some
more details on web boosts and also I'm
going to be focusing on security because
that obviously is a very important topic
last month there was a study that was
released talking about html5 and and
mobile development and if you kind of
look back on the history of using html5
for any kind of development we had one
point oh that which is basically using
static HTML pages I think most of us
have used an editor to write your own
little home page then we add web two
point oh I think Google really opened
people's eyes by doing something like
Google Maps that really showed people
the potential of what it can do inside
browser not just merely rendering static
content content like in web one point oh
but actually have a very highly
interactive application and then now
lately there
something that I call at least web
three-point oh so html5 going mobile so
you see actually more and more platforms
that use html5 as a first class citizen
for writing mobile applications so there
was kind of like an early example that
unfortunate didn't quite take off webos
from from poem and now HP there's Chrome
OS from from google Mozilla is right now
extremely active in this space you may
have heard of Firefox OS so basically
bringing the Gecko rendering engine of
Firefox to a mobile device so the entire
experience of Firefox OS is in effect
based on html5 so starting from the home
screen and they even go down to two low
level system applications that are
partially written in html5 Tizen another
example collaboration between Samsung
and Intel bringing html5 to mobile
platforms and last but not least Windows
Phone 8 is also in windows 8 also have
elected javascript and HTML as a as a
first class citizen so if you look at
the the space with regards to who is
developing in what language what
platform on for mobile devices there was
an interesting market study that was
released in january of this year and the
link you can see down here develop
economics so they're like a market
research company and i would highly
recommend you take a look at this study
because it has some very interesting
points and pulling out two slides from
this study and the first light here
talks about the distribution of
developers and for which platform they
develop and a change within half a year
well first of all you can see that the
majority of developers do target Android
and it has grown from 68 to 72 percent
of developers that were being questioned
as part of the study that that that go
for Android the next not much big
surprise is iOS
although they have seen a little bit of
a decline the study sites some changes
some shifts in Asia Asia is heavily
biased towards Android so that accounts
for the slight drop on developers for
iOS now some of last year made of middle
of last year developers were not yet
asked about html5 so there is no
comparison how this looked like back in
the middle of 2012 but still I find it
very interesting that fifty percent of
developer said yesterday also targets
they also use html5 for developing
mobile apps and it will be interesting
to see how then in subsequent month this
changes well the other platforms you can
see is also less popular the next one is
Windows Phone and then followed by some
other platforms but I just wanted to
highlight that apart from the big
elephants in the room the iOS and
Android html5 has also become a premier
technology for developing mobile
applications now the second slide I
wanted to to cite from this market study
deals with some some thoughts about
using html5 for mobile applications and
first of all the developers were asked
the reasons for selecting html5 and the
number one reason Ford for using html5
is cross-platform portability mean it's
pretty well known that mobile platforms
become these walled gardens we're also
the owner of that wall garden have a
strong choice on what technology should
be used for this mobile platform and
it's difficult to use anything but a
different this first technology so Java
is for Android you have objective-c for
iOS Windows Phone 8 C sharp and also
html5 but if you have a nice idea for an
application you as a developer you want
that to be present in as many platforms
as possible in as many marketplaces as
possible to maximize your revenue so if
you have to rewrite your application
from
meds that's a that's a big amount of
work so html5 is kind of like this
unifying factor so developers see html5
as a technology that enables them to
more quickly port the application to
different platforms now at the same time
developers were also asked what are the
biggest downsides or omissions of html5
and the the number one point that was
mentioned is access to the latest native
API so you have html5 as an execution
platform but one thing that is really
missing is accessing some device
specific things so smart phones are
known for special hardware devices like
accelerometer magneto meters on the one
side but they also have some interesting
data so think about music library or
your photo gallery that you might want
to access from a form from your
application so if you run inside a web
browser your sandbox and you do not have
access to this API so that's kind of
like the landscape as it is as it is of
today now I want to give you some
examples of some of the advanced web api
that is currently developing also under
the umbrella of w3c so it's kind of
amazing to see how how the web is
developing to kind of cater to these to
these needs so they are a slew of new
API that are currently being sanitized
by w3c and and I'm sure you have seen or
least heard of many of those api's so
like for multi-touch gfap I by now web
sockets along be directional
communication you have web workers
allowing some parallelism in web
applications web RTC real-time
communication and there is even a new
standard for accessing near-field
communication from web applications now
I wanted to give you two examples
because these are like cutting edge ap
is that are still in the process of
being standardized and the first one is
called weapon tents or web activities so
the intent
activity paradigm has been introduced by
Android and it's basically a late
binding mechanism where one application
can make use of another applications
functionality so nice example is if you
want to pick a contact from your contact
list in Android you send an intent that
will be answered by an activity inside
the Android platform so it enables more
code reuse and and make this late
binding mechanism easier so now there's
something called web activities and
Mozilla right now is pushing this very
heavily for their Firefox OS platform
and I have a little code snippet on the
bottom here you can see how this looks
like so there is a new browser object
called mots activity you can instantiate
it you can give it a name and and and
some additional data like mime types so
essentially the code snippet I have here
on the slide what you want to do is you
want to pick images and you specify
while you interested in PNG and JPG
images and then you can fire this most
activity now let's just assume that at
least on Firefox f Firefox as if you
have different application application
installed that managed images for
example the wallpaper application or the
gallery application what happens then is
the same thing that happens in Android
you are being shown what is called an
activity chooser so that's the
screenshot f here on the right so
essentially these are all the
applications that are able to service or
that a bulimic so then the user says
well I want to pick for example image
from the gallery and then you click on
ok and then then basically that
application will be launched you can
pick an image that will be returned back
as a result back to the application so
same idea late binding mechanism but now
as part of html5 platform second example
I wanted to give them our web sockets so
for the longest time web developers were
limited to http as a communication
protocol and if you want to do something
like like push notifications from server
down to
web application you had to resort to all
kinds of tricks for example deferred
replies who deliberately did not send an
HTTP response and and only one when you
had an event on the server side you
would pick it back it on this deferred
reply to the browser so eventually they
gotten around to do something like web
sockets and web sockets is a is a new
standard that allows be directional
communication between server and the
browser the interesting thing is they
managed to do so in a compatible way
with the current web standards so a web
socket in terms of a protocol starts out
as an HTTP protocol that gets upgraded
and once you have upgraded the
communication link then you can actually
then also send data down to to to to the
browser and the way this looks like
again give them some some little quotes
niblet here so there's another browser
object called web socket and there's a
new uri scheme called WS you can give it
a domain name and port number here and
then you can bind different callback
messages callback functions to this
object so for example the on message
callback will then be invoked inside
your browser whenever the servo is
pushing some data down to your to your
to your browser likewise you can send
mÃ¡s de de from the browser to the
server by just using the ascent API here
so it's a very nice way of pushing data
back and forth between server and and
and browser so so next I wanted to talk
about the kind of like the grandfather
of web development for mobile devices a
project called phonegap it's an open
source project they were acquired by
Adobe and actually they turned it over
to the Apache foundation and phonegap is
now I believe still have incubator
status with the Apache foundation and
they also renamed it they gave it a
different name it's called Cordova but I
hardly see that name mentioned and
everyone still refers to it as phonegap
so I'm going to do the same here but
what phonegap essentially did is very
clever idea so
phonegap creates a native app for the
respective platform but what they do is
they instantiate a webview widget in
full screen mode and the html5
application that was developed by by a
mobile app developer is piggybacked or
is is bundled as data into this native
app and at runtime what phonegap would
do it would inject the html5 and
JavaScript into this web view that is
part of the phonegap application so what
you had in effect is a native app that
can be hosted in an app store like on
the iOS App Store or Google Play Store
and you downloaded like a native app but
the moment you run the application what
it does it in sin she ate this full
screen when browser window and then
injects need HTML and JavaScript and
they also give you a lot of CSS styles
to to really mimic the the native look
and feel so they actually went down to
mimic for example the iOS fancy widgets
that you at that iOS is known for but
it's all html5 and HTML and CSS so some
more details on on at least for how
phonegap works on Android so I mean
there are two ways of communication how
we can break out of the sandbox because
you're still running inside a browser
widget so if you if you are javascript
running inside this browser widget and
you want to make a call to the native
layer so let's just say you wanted to
access the camera API then what n-word
allows you to do is in anandhi on the
Java site there is something called a
webview client and you can override a
method that's that's called should
override your L loading and basically
the the html5 application has a certain
URL scheme that it then uses to make a
request for example what to take a
picture and you can intercept that on D
on the Java layer inside this
boilerplate code that comes with
phonegap and this boilerplate code is
simply forwards that unmarked the
parameters and then forwards that to the
native API
so that's how we can make it down call
so from JavaScript down to the native
layer now a nap call is even simpler the
webview has something called a method
called load URL and essentially you can
just in line your your JavaScript code
that is being executed in the context of
your application and if you have for
example events like accelerometer or GPS
you can then upload this to or you can
return that back to to the application
running in your web view and for
different platforms like iOS I do this
foam get does the same thing same trick
so they always instantiate in a widget
that implements a native browser and
then they inject the the JavaScript and
the phonegap does support many different
platforms and it's a widely used project
now Nicolai mentioned that we have been
doing this project in the context of
touch develop so touch develop there is
an html5 version of touch develop and
and and the first thing that we try to
do is we try to use phonegap by taking
all the JavaScript and html5 of touch
develop and bundling it with phonegap
again as a way of turning it into a
native app that can be uploaded for
example to the google play store however
we ran into a whole bunch of problems
when we tried that route and well first
of all surprisingly there are quite a
few widgets that were missing so many
things that the touch will have wanted
to do we're not able at least a phonegap
did not immediately provide any any
solutions now phonegap does have a nice
plug-in architecture so just a matter of
implementing additional plugins but the
bigger problem that we be encountered is
that phonegap uses the the browser
widget that comes with android which is
all good and fine however this this
browser widget is not chrome is not the
chrome browser it's based on different
technology and you can tell that it's
not maintained as
Lea's as the Chrome browser in
particular we found that touch develop
applications run extremely laggy using
the phonegap approach so at the same
time we noticed that Chrome as a as an
external browser actually had much
better performance in terms of executing
phonegap so the idea was well why don't
we just simply use chrome as as the
rendering engine for for touch develop
well that's that's all good and fine
except that chrome is not a widget
chrome is an external application so the
next question is okay then how can we
then still run touch develop in a way
that gives access to to native API and
well that was basically then the the
birth place or the time of this project
that we have called web app booster so
it's a bit of a geeky name but I guess
it kind of captures the essence of what
it tries to do so what a booster
essentially is a free Android app it's
already available in the Google Play
Store and what it does it acts as a
gateway for web applications that run
inside of chrome to capabilities and
functionality that you have on your
device so for example if you want to
access contacts or if you want to access
the gallery or or your song library so
phonegap gives you access to to those
things in inside your inside your
smartphone so it makes use of web
sockets for be directional communication
and it also has a plug-in architecture
that makes it easy to add additional
components so on the next slide I have
an architectural overview on what how
what a booster looks like so so
basically so what a booster again we're
talking about Android here so what a
booster is a native app that runs on
Android and here you see another native
app that is chrome also running on
Android so these two applications run on
the same device and what happens now is
web a booster when you run it it's
actually a
ground servers so once you activate it
it runs in the background and there are
two different servers that run there
then one is the the WebSocket server
that is used for bi-directional
communication so that is how for example
we push sensor data so if you have a
continuous stream of sensor data like
accelerometer or magnetometer that's how
we push that to to the web application
we also have an embedded HTTP server and
the reason for that is we used HTTP
server for returning more volume data so
for example if you want to return an
image over to to your application we
could have done this also using the
WebSocket server here by doing data URL
encoding but we found that was too
inefficient so it's it's much more
efficient if you actually return this
data of ear and embedded HTTP server but
the idea is then you have chrome you
visit an external web page for example
like ketchup comp which has like a web
app so you first in step number one you
download all these HTML and JavaScript
belongs to the touch available
application and then there's some
JavaScript code that's similar to the
code symbol head earlier that opens a
WebSocket to the WebSocket server that
is owned by by touch develop and then
there's a protocol that the web app can
can talk to what a booster in order to
accomplish certain things now obviously
security is a big concern here because
you know if anyone could just simply
connect to this WebSocket server and
then start pulling down your contact
information that would not be a good
idea and and we have taken a lot of
steps to to ensure this doesn't happen
and we'll talk through that in a second
a question yes
other platforms I know that for example
Windows Phone not be able to explore so
the question is if we have explored the
same approach for different platforms
and and questions are often for iOS or
Windows Phone 8 and well yes we have
explored it however it is not possible
and and in for legal reasons not for
technological reasons so iOS for example
does allow background processes so again
what a boost is a background service and
runs in the background and iOS does
allow background services however only
for very limited kinds of applications
so for example for voice over IP
applications or for media applications
that play music in the background so
something like what a booster would not
pass apples review process and Windows
Phone 8 i believe it's similar but you
guys probably know better so I don't
have a live demo but I do have a series
of screenshots that give you kind of a
flavor on on what it looks like using
what booster on Android and well if you
download what a booster from google play
store then you have to explicitly enable
it so it's an opt-in things also to be
very clear that you know what what you
what you're getting there and initially
so does that's the the overview screen
of a booster so initially there is no
application that uses it so there's no
no connection so next what so and from
this point on what a booster runs in the
background so then you can switch to to
chrome and you can visit a web
application that makes use of web
booster so I wrote a little demo so
there's also domain web a booster org
slash demo so that gives you a kind of a
nice way of testing web by boosted also
to see how it works so there's like a
little web interface where you can just
simply select what kind of action you
want to perform like accelerometer or
pick a contact so the very first thing
that that web that the web application
has to do that once to use web a booster
is too
request permissions again you don't want
to have uncontrolled access to to all
kinds of sensitive data but you want the
user to be aware of what is happening
also the user has to give explicit
permission so so this little demo
application you can you can have a
button here that says request
permissions and then what happens here
and the next step if you click on this
button so there is little dialog that
pops open where the user is being
prompted okay so there's a website that
is called web boosted's org and it
requests these kind of permissions here
so access to all different kinds of data
do you allow this once do you always
allow it or you're rejected so the user
has to make has to make a choice now i
do want to point out one technical
detail at this at this stage here and
and this dialog a modal dialog that you
see here this is not part of the Chrome
application what happens here is the web
application sends a request for these
permissions to the background service
that is implemented by web booster and
then web a booster opens this modal
dialog but it's able to do so overlaying
this modal dialogue over the Chrome
browser if you look carefully you can
still see this darkened background so
actually we're this modal dialog here is
overlaid over the Chrome browser but it
was not opened by chrome it was opened
by this background service you may say
well this is also a kind of a
interesting feature of android that our
duck out in terms of api feature that
the background service is able to
overlay something over the the current
application but it is possible using
official android api so it's not a hack
someone is interested i can explain how
this works but just to be clear there is
no way to tamper with this so it's not
like part of some JavaScript where you
might you know do things differently but
security is guaranteed by this
background service so there's no way how
the web app can can can manipulate this
dialogue here at least if you trust
weboost as an application so let's
assume that the user gave permission so
you say okay
allow this application that runs on this
domain to use these permissions and then
we can start using the API before I do
that if you switch if at this point you
switch back to web at boost you can see
there's one active connection so you can
also see the list of domains that have
currently open connections to web
booster you can then tap on on on one of
those domains and you can see what kind
of permissions have been requested by
the user but by this web app and then
you can also revoke those permissions if
you choose to do so but I guess the more
interesting thing is let's go back to to
Chrome because now you have permission
to use different different API and so
what I'm doing now is the web app now
requests or says okay let me pick a
contact from the users contact list and
same things the request is being routed
via the web socket to the background
service and similarly what I mentioned
before with this dialog that pops over
the chrome the same way now I create an
intent for picking a contact but I do it
in such a way that it overlays the
chrome browser so what you see again
here you can see just barely in the
background you can still the the chrome
browser but then the white window that
you see over here that is the activity
in android the standard dialogue in
android that lets you pick a contact so
my demo device i have two contacts here
and then if i if i pick one of those
contacts then the background service
sends a little bit of jason back to to
the web application and what the demo
app just simply does it just simply
prints locks out this this this Jason
code here so it's kind of like gives you
an idea on how web booster works and we
always do support a bunch of API so
contact is one we do support several
sensor so accelerometer gyroscope are
supported we support media so we can you
can browse all the mp3s that are stored
on your voice you can play a media and
we also it was one more yeah gallery so
we also allow you to browse the gallery
of and also taking a picture is also
supported by web a booster in the
current version okay let me switch back
and show you some more internal details
on on what I booster so here's
essentially you know if you wanted to
make use of web booster here's how you
would do it so you would just simply
create a web socket and you connect to a
web socket that runs on localhost on
port 80 42 and if you don't get a
connection to this port that basically
means that web booster either is not
installed or has been deactivated in
that case if you wanted to you could pop
open little dialogue and you say well
you know to enhance your experience you
might want to download web a booster on
and enable it but but if this connect
succeeds that new that means that you
are running web booster on the device
and you can make use of enhanced
capabilities now you have to do through
an authentication authorization process
I'm not showing on this particular slide
here but once once you have
authenticated and authorized the
connection and you can start making use
of additional features and what I do
here is I show how you would start the
gyroscope for example and so there's a
bit of Jason and you just have an action
that's called start guy role you have to
give every request in unique ID and then
you just simply use the web sockets to
send this jason / 22 web booster and
from then on you will get a continuous
stream of guy raw data as the building
sensor has has updates and as i
mentioned before there is this on
message callback that you can hook into
and if you see the same message ID for
the response so 42 here that i use also
for the request then you know that
you've received back some some gyroscope
data so some more details so here if you
wanted to extend a new plugin so so i
mentioned before that what a booster
have a plug-in architecture so there is
a base class called plucking on indie
Android source code and each plug-in has
a life cycle so when the first web
application connects and it uses this
plug-in there is a non create so you can
see for each origin that is being used
so a plug-in instantiated is intended
for each origin and also then once you
disconnect once once you close the tap
in chrome then also you go through a
life cycle on destroy if you wanted to
make some data persistent for example
but it's but the main function here the
main callback is execute and and that
basically whenever you send some Jason
like the star gyro that I had earlier
then you then then what a booster would
be calling this execute here and you get
the request ID you get the action and
you get the original JSON object so if
there's additional parameter Genie to
access you can register new plugins
there's a there is a kind of like a
manifest a web app booster manifest it's
called plucking XML that it's a bit of
XML that just lists all the different
plugins that are available and I use
Java reflection to and actually at
runtime to instantiate the plugins and
and and register them and you can see
the kind of actions that each plug-in
responds to but also for certain for
certain plugins you can see there are
some permissions here so the the plug-in
gyroscope plucking requests permission
called guy row so before a web app can
actually use that it first has to
request this particular permission so I
mentioned that we did this project as
part of the touch develop project so if
you are touch available user and if you
wanted to actually give it a try on
Android so what you can do is you can on
your android device first from google
play store you have to download and
install web at booster it's a free app
again and once you have downloaded it
you can then switch back to to touch
develop and here's like a very small
script that gives you an idea on how
this works so essentially you
but what you see in this little box down
here you see a touch develop script that
if you run it you can see it its uses
the social API choose contact and
actually this little touch developed
script would then pop open the same
contact choose our dialogue that I had
earlier in my screenshot so I wanted to
spend some time to talk about security
because that is not now the big thing
that I mentioned is important but I
really haven't talked about at this
point and I wanted to explain what we
have done in kind of in terms of
security so first of all there's
authorization there's authentication and
authorization we have seen the
permissions dialogue so so it before a
web app can use certain API it has to
request permission to do so so that's
the same model that Android does so that
at install time there's a dialog that
pops open and the user has to say yes or
no if you want if you want to give that
web app these kind of permissions so so
that's all good and fine the more
difficult part is the authentication
like how do we actually trust if there's
a dialog box box that pops open and says
well there is a web page xyz.com and it
requests these permissions how can you
trust the origin how can you trust it
actually the domain that is mentioned so
basically the screen show that had here
so what a booster will take the the
origin of the URL of that's also given
to you as part of the WebSocket protocol
and it says okay so there's a web page
or web application called what my busa
dot-com dark and you'd give this
application the permission now if you
know a little bit about web protocols
you know that you can easily faked these
these bits of information right i mean
you have a WebSocket server that runs on
your device and and there are many bad
things that can happen here first of all
you know since you're running a website
good server what could happen is that
someone like drive by malware you know
that someone from the outside of that's
not even running on your device can
access your connect to your web socket
server the next thing is that if you
have something that is not even the
Chrome browser let's say malware is on
your device but it's just using plain
socket API you can actually spoof the
course head us the cross-origin resource
headers and you can just pretend that
you are a trusted domain so if you trust
touch develop we just simply affect this
information so so that is what we have
to to guard against and make sure that
you know justice going back one slide
here so that people can actually at
least trust this information about the
origin of the domain so so one thing
that that we have done is at least to
limit the scope of securities we only
allow connections the WebSocket server
only allows connections from localhost
so that already takes care of drive-by
malware so that no one from outside of
your device in the same network and can
access to your socket server and also
one limitation we have right now is we
only allow one connection / origin so if
someone already like if touch develop
already has done a connection then you
cannot piggyback by saying okay I'm also
claiming to be touch develop but none
sort of problem again is the faking of
course headers and I want to go through
the protocol that we've implemented to
explain how we take care of this
particular problem so so this whole
protocol essentially kicks off by a
connection that we receive inside of web
booster and then there's a connection
and someone claims to be touched
overcame and again this could be a
legitimate request coming originating
from from chrome and we can trust chrome
not to do something bad with the course
headers but this could potentially also
be some malware that just takes
advantage of a trusted domain so at this
point we have incoming requests
Stan we see while someone who claims to
be titular calm but we cannot trust this
piece of information at this point in
time so what what what a booster does it
it tears down the connection so it
closes the connection it creates a
unique token for this new origin and
it's and it then gives like the the main
activity of touch develop and now what
happens of what I booster now what
happens is then in the next step the
background service use it the same
intense system that i showed earlier for
picking a contact it uses the same
intense system for opening a web page
and the rationale here is that we can we
trust this intense system it's built
into android that it will actually be
answered by by the chrome browser and
what you can see in the in this intent
for opening a web page what we do here
is we have the original you are L so we
say okay someone who claimed to be
touched available kale and let's go to
this web page and we also append the
token that we created in the previous
step now if you know a little bit more
about android development what you can
do is if you have multiple applications
on your on your android device that are
able to open web application say you you
download opera or firefox for android
and you have potentially multiple
browsers that can respond to this intent
what happens here is the same thing i
mentioned earlier for the motts activity
so you have something called an activity
chooser where the user has to then say i
want to use this application to open
this URL so if you wanted to intercept
this like if you were malware what you
can do is you can you can say okay my
where and and I'm also able to open a
web page and then but the user will have
to click on a button here so and for the
built-in applications like chrome and
then also additional third party
application like Firefox people trust
that so so again like like this step
here web a boost our opening this web
page
age relies on on on the trust that you
have in certain applications and if
there is a suspicious application that
all of a sudden also claims to be able
to open this web page at least the
thinking is that people will not click
on that but it will rather click on the
Chrome browser but then the next step
what happens is so Chrome then goes to
tattle calm and it downloads for a
second time this web app but now because
there is no this token in the uri o now
a second time touch develop runs inside
chrome it can extract the token it can
open up the WebSocket connection a
second time but the second time it will
present this token that was created in
step number one so which means that at
this point in time we actually know that
that this connection has to come from a
web app that originated from a
legitimate source named Tasha locom so
at this stage DD connection is
authenticated and from then on we allow
more communication like starting
gyroscope and picking contacts so any
questions to regarding a security been
good mix
can we talked about the supplier night
so there isn't a paper of you I spoofing
on the Android I wonder if they have a
more principled solution of people
confuse
because this is
well what does Elizabeth yeah yeah no no
I I do agree i think what a boozer does
not add more problems here than what we
already have on Ananda spoofing sites I
think that the fact that open platform
right now which is to say that they
suffer from the evil good absolutely
suffer the committee to support this
worse it was flat for would just ignore
incision yeah well I guess the fact that
you can overlay a dialogue from a
background service I wonder that
surprised that no one picked up on that
yet in the security community knows what
level is
okay then let me come to my to my
conclusions here so in terms of status
quo so we do have a stable version of
what a booster that is currently hosted
in the in the android market we already
have several plugins that we support and
we plan to do some more there's a home
page so you can go to web boots a dork
and also gives you some more detail on
how it works and also if you want to use
web app boosters if you wanted to
integrate it and it also has some code
snippets that explains you how to do
that yeah I is the next step we want to
think a bit more in depth on the
security model and and there's actually
an interesting feature of or not so much
a feature but requirement of touch
develop in particular because touch
develop is a container for running small
apps but different apps potentially so
the question is here okay how we do we
request security or permissions is it
kind of like like we request all
possible permissions or only on on
whatever the current app you're running
and what is the the scope of a
permission like when do we revoke
permissions so if especially for touch
develop we need to think a little bit
more in depth on requesting permission
so right now I only do it on a per
domain basis but I think we may need to
make a little bit more fine-grain to
better support the needs of touch
develop well as kind of an Outlook and
this might be a bit way off I guess we
have to also think a little bit more in
depth about it but I mentioned earlier
that the WebSocket server right now only
allows connections from originating from
the device itself for security reasons
but what if in some constraints we were
to allow connections from different
devices so you could actually build up
some kind of sensor network imagine that
you could use your phone or let's say
your platform to access someone else's
sensor reason might be maybe your own
phone doesn't have the sensor let's say
if you have a special-purpose sensor
that you only have on a different device
you might want to access that or you
might want to actually correlate
data coming from different sensors like
a mini sensor network this might be a
could be used for some distributive
gaming here for example so so this
little thing what I have down here so
basically have 11 phone here that has
multiple connections to phones nearby or
maybe in different locations but do
something like like remote sensing or
distributed gaming so just some some
ideas on how to push maybe what a
booster beyond what we use it for right
now well with that I come to my last
slide here so that's a screenshot of the
home page again I have put up some some
more information on what it is and how
to use it so you welcome to to
contribute in different ways just maybe
to use it in your own web application or
maybe contribute some more plugins if
you're so inclined but with that I would
like to conclude and thank you for your
attention oh no any questions anything
else yes yeah you have any thoughts on
the impact on battery or
impact on battery well android is known
to to pull down the battery because of
all the background services that's I
mean it's a nice feature you know it's a
nice flexible system actually they have
you know I talked much about activities
but Android also likewise has this
notion of a service so it's delivered
something running in the background and
there is no constraints and many
applications make use of that what that
booster it will drain battery only if
you use it so if it's just passive in
the background you will not use any
battery so only when someone opens up a
WebSocket connection but then of course
it will add additional a drain on the
battery but I think it's fairly limited
let's say if you want to pick a context
you know then then that's a one-time
dialogue if you were to let's say
connect to a sensor and you had a
continuous stream of sensor data that
probably would have a higher hit done on
the battery yes yes yeah so an Android
when you register for sensor you can say
what sampling rate you want so if you're
only interested in orientation changes
you know you don't need a hundred Hertz
you just need for 10 Hertz me for
suggesting for windows 8 or no I think
windows is I html5
where you can get census in a really
public
yeah unless you rises in from Aurora you
sure can get this mess up in the storage
I didn't raise no html5 can get married
I don't know then I appendage came apart
a data is there something similar to
that in android no not everyone would
write against me RT is enough cross my
heart it's not possible sure which it is
it it is
basically you're getting around the
limitations of android phone hmmm your
career or native app so the session is
recorded so there was a question about
the same thing for windows phone 8 and
there was a discussion amongst the
Microsoft people here which you guys I'm
the more better experts on on that topic
yes so you're talking about the packing
model but the size not stand the idea
said I have to compile these plugins
into my def abou started months on the
device episode involves integrity i
guess i could send java coats over the
buyer you have a managed back in
subjective impossible anyway give a
security because the question is I
talked about the the plucking model and
right now you have to create a new
version of web booster so if someone
were to contribute a new plugin then I
have to actually recompile web a booster
and resubmitted to the google play store
and the question was is there also some
way of maybe doing a different way and
yes there is android has a virtual
machine called dalvik which has the same
capabilities as the Sun hot spot virtual
machine namely mainly they have a class
loader which means if you compile a
plugin or any java code to dalvik Dex
code you can over the arm you can
download it from somewhere and then just
use the regular class loader on android
to then then execute this code there was
a time I believe where the facebook
application did that people at some
point noticed that Facebook updated
itself without you actually I didn't go
through the google play store i am not
quite sure but I someone told me that
that maybe a couple of years ago that
was the case and they use this little
technique well I here in that sense so
you could continue only the track in
store
if you assimilates you certify
submissions and so instead of the
webpage so between and Java code it can
come from the same adjusters I could I
could open my little pluck in store but
you know the thing is this is has a
different quality I mean we're talking
about like some some system plugins you
know like very low level stuff it's not
like an end user plugin so I think it
does make sense to republish the
application in the google play store is
has a different quality there's no icon
for plucking right not like it is a very
different thing than a regular app store
to start covering that about research
okay other questions Starla's visiting
us today and tomorrow so if you want to
talk to him you can schedule in the
button for them all thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
