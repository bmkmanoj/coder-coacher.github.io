it's very difficult to just take a
camera and take a picture of a scene and
then look at it and really capture what
you had seen so instead with the
ubiquity of video cameras and cameras
everywhere we realized they taking lots
of pictures maybe a video sequence maybe
a lot of pictures taken with a still
camera through the magic of computation
either on a machine or up in the cloud
we can enhance the experience
all right so I want to show you in
particular how we created this image if
you've lived in Seattle for any part of
your life you've certainly seen Mount
Rainier
and the first thing you might be asking
yourself is where did this picture of
Mount Rainier where was this picture of
Mount Rainier taken from and I'll try to
explain that so if you look over here
what I'm going to show you is not just
one input image but many input images I
set up a camera in downtown Seattle
and this is what I saw through that
camera you'll notice because the lens
was so long that the mountain appears to
be shaking around and that's because
when you have a very long lens it's
almost impossible for the camera to
stand still in addition the atmosphere
of course makes things shake and here we
took all those images and use the
computer to align them so that it
doesn't shake so much but you can still
if you look carefully you'll see the
atmosphere is shifting around and all
the pixels are changing finally we can
go in and we can move every individual
pixel by itself to get them all nice and
aligned and now we finally have a nice
stable image of Mount Rainier but it
doesn't look as clear as we'd like so we
can do some magic which we call d hazing
and we get a result that looks like this
unfortunately in order to get this d
hazing you'll see a lot of different
artifacts in here you can see dust spots
from dust on the lens and if you look at
the mountain it doesn't look very sharp
in all the places because of what we
need to do to expand the contrast we can
take all those images and align them as
we saw before
once they're aligned somewhere hidden in
there is a much sharper image and a much
richer engine and now if we D haze that
result we get this for example if you
see the sky most of the dust has been
removed and if you look at the mountain
it's much sharper and that's the reason
is because if we look at every single
pixel here what we did is we relied on
something we called lucky imaging it's
something we borrowed from the Astronomy
field where when they look at stars even
though you know you see stars twinkling
at night that's because the atmosphere
is moving things around but every now
and then they get a very lucky shot of
that star unfortunately for us we have a
whole mountain we want to make a picture
of so we need to get lucky on every
place on that
mountain and through computation were
able to examine the pixels for every
location on that mountain and pick out
the one or two or three or four where we
get lucky so to speak and get a nice
sharp picture of that image finally you
put it all together and we get this
result</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
