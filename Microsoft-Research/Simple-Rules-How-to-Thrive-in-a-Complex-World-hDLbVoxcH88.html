hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
thank you so much for coming my name is
Amy Draves and I'm pleased to welcome
Kathleen Eisenhart to the Microsoft
Research visiting speaker series she'll
be discussing her book simple rules
she and her co-author danse olaf's but
the last decade developing a set of
rules to help tackle complex problems
and have got created this guide for
achieving your most pressing objectives
she is the SW a Sherman MD professor at
Stanford and co-director of the Stanford
Technology Ventures program she is also
the co-author of the award-winning book
competing on the edge and has won
numerous awards and fellowships as well
as giving the Oxford's Clarendon
lectures she was recently named the most
cited research off author over the past
25 years on the topics of strategy and
organizational studies and recently
Bloomberg TV called this book the nerd
book of the summer please join me in
giving her a very warm welcome couple my
former students are out there and
monitor lands so I hope so hello to them
all so just there's a little sidelight I
wrote part of the book actually up at
the Whitely Center at u-dub which is
that Inn at the Friday Harbor labs so
actually part of this came from the San
Juan Islands and then finally I do want
to show you that I have an Apple
Computer
but I am running Microsoft Windows on it
so I just want you to know anyway anyway
thanks for having me ton of the talk
simple rules I'm going to start out with
a with a story and it's a story about an
army sergeant in Iraq during the Iraq
war about ten years ago he's in Mosul at
the base the threat near the year near
the airfield there and it's just before
Christmas time and he's he's in the in
the mess line and he's grabbed a piece
of cheesecake and as he's about to dig
into the cheesecake there's suddenly
this massive explosion and a terrorist
has blown himself up and blown up a
bunch of other people here at the army
mess
and Sergeant Montoya is a medic and he
ducks he's fortunately he ducks under
the table and after kind of the
explosion he then looks out and he's
okay but the mess there's a mess around
him of carnage of all sorts of kinds of
things and he's faced with a problem of
this tremendous complexity time is of
the essence and how does he decide who
to help and who not to help and what he
ends up relying on as you might expect
are the medical rules of triage or the
simple rules of triage and the idea of
today is that that simple rules are our
way to cope with the complexity that I
think we all face whether it's all the
devices we have to do all the things we
have to do managing our jobs and our
kids whatever so how do janet yellen
who's obviously managing our economy or
at least tries to crickets you might not
think they have a complex life but you
know they have a small brain so it's
pretty complex or Mark Zuckerberg
running Facebook they're all coping with
complexity and they're all doing it
listen to some extent through simple
rules just to give you a definition
what's a simple rule a simple rule is a
shortcut strategy cognitive strategy
that saves time and effort by
economizing on our simplifying how we
think and focusing our attention so
essentially it's around a rule of thumb
rule of thumb heuristics or other words
for it essentially thinking about those
couple features of simple rules just to
give us some some baseline simple rules
are simple meaning there's maybe two
three four five involved simple rules
depend on the person in the situation
that means your rules are not
necessarily my rules and the third idea
is that simple rules relate to some
defined activity so they're not just
platitudes like you know be nice to your
customer but actually they're more
focused on something specific to make
that more particular me let me bring in
a couple of examples one of them is the
idea of is the simple rules of Michael
Pollan I don't know what's on your
refrigerator but I have actually several
friends who have Michael Pollan simple
rules on their refrigerator and those
are number one eat real food that means
food your grandmother would recognize
eat small portions
eat mostly plants within those rules you
can have blueberries kale the occasional
fish and so on but essentially you're
following the simple rules second point
is the simple rules are unique to you so
and I'm I hope you're not too much you
dub fans but but this is Stanford
football the simple folks turns out the
Stanford football team also has rules
for eating and those rules are eat
breakfast because they're students and
they tend to get up late and and they
stay up late get up late and rush to
class and skip breakfast stay hydrated
is their number two rule and that's
because they tend to be very active
people and they tend to need hydration
to stay fit and healthy and their third
rule is to they can eat anything and how
much ever they want as long as you can
pick it pluck it or kill it so if you
compare that to Michael Pollan there's
no concept of portion control for the
Stanford football team
whereas Michael Pollan is obviously it's
a portion control and there's no you
know the Stanford football team as I'm
sure the u-dub football team are eating
plenty of meat and not really worrying
about too much about Mouse mostly plants
and while they may have an overlap
around not non-processed food they are
is there none like Sims distinct
features so the point is that the rules
the rules are personal the rules are
unique they're not just the rules for
everybody another example to bring it
into into into business is is IndieGoGo
versus Kickstarter the two major
crowdfunding sites that you probably all
know IndieGoGo was was founded by
actually Cal Berkeley alumni and their
idea of the Internet is that the
internet is for everybody and and they
also have this other I'd this concept of
the Internet everybody deserve a rich
uncle and crowdfunding on the internet
makes that possible for all of us so
what are their rules for what can be on
their crowdfunding site what are their
simple rules for picking projects
anything goes as long as it's legal it
can be on the IndieGoGo site so you can
fund your root canal your trip to Europe
your in vitro fertilisation your a new
startup the Jamaican bobsled team you
can fund whatever you want
least give it a shot on IndieGoGo second
rule on IndieGoGo is around how do you
have which peak which projects are the
featured projects you know the ones that
the site visitors are gonna see and
that's an algorithm so it's an objective
if you will algorithm that's revolves
around the popularity the project
combined with how much effort you're
putting into the project at least in
terms of promoting the project so the
idea is algorithm that somehow combines
effort and popularity
contrast that with Kickstarter
Kickstarter I don't know if you've ever
posted in Kickstarter Kickstarter has 13
project categories so you have to fit in
to a Kickstarter category and they
reject about 25% of the projects that
actually try to go up on their site so a
curation model as far as what's it
what's a featured project on on
Kickstarter
that's curated by Kickstarter employees
so the Kickstarter staff decides that
I'm gonna take your project and feature
it and I'm not gonna and I'm not gonna
feature yours so it's very much a
subjective curated process what's their
underlying value system well an
IndieGoGo it was internet for everybody
a kickstart it was much more around a
value around the importance of public
funding of the Arts so again a curation
model public funding of the Arts and a
more particular more what kind of a
narrow narrower vision of what's
actually should be on the site so the
point is to similar businesses to
somewhat different rule sets and then
finally simple rules relate to a
specific activity they're not about how
you're going to change healthcare in the
u.s. they're not about being nice to
your customer they're on specific
specific processes so for example in the
case of Michael Pollan it's your rules
for eating what's for lunch and in the
case of IndieGoGo and Kickstarter it's
what projects are on the site and what
do we feature so very specific decisions
okay that's kind of 1.0 on on simple
rules second idea to dig a little deeper
is is there actually several kinds of
rules I'm going to talk I'm going to
talk about all of them and I'm gonna
talk about some of them and it turns out
it's important to
talk about kinds of rules because some
are easier to learn than others number
one and number two it's better to
actually use more more types of rules
than one type and so the fact that it's
harder to learn I mean you should use
your more type has you then starting to
think you may have to actually look for
certain kinds of rules so anyway then
the types of rules matter let me start
with the first type one of the easy
types boundary rules boundary rules are
rules for picking deciding yes or no
like can you be on the Kickstarter
website or not or if you have a lot of
alternatives which alternatives are you
going to choose good example good
example comes from The Weinstein Company
Weinstein Company is a movie producing
company they did the imitation game
which is what's in the background there
they also do silver linings playbook the
artist back in the day Chocolat Pulp
Fiction so a lot of write variety of
movies now if you're sitting there at
the Weinstein offices what you're seeing
is a massive number of scripts keep
coming to you because you're one of the
top Hollywood producers how do you pick
which movies to do why imitation game
and silver linings playbook for example
well there are a couple simple rules one
of them is that is that a Weinstein
movie as always has a flawed but
sympathetic main character so for
example if you think about the imitation
game Alan Turing is a really irritating
jerk but there is a part of you that
likes the guy you know he's really there
are ways in which he's empathetic silver
linings playbook is also about a person
struggling with with mental illness i I
I forget about the schizophrenia or
being bipolar but it's so fairly see has
a fairly serious mental illness but yet
you like him he said he's a good guy
second thing is a Weinstein movie not
only has a flaw but sympathetic main
character it is also about a basic human
condition so in the case of the
imitation game and Alan Turing it's
about not only being somewhat far along
on the autistic spectrum but also being
gay at a time when it's illegal to be
gay silver linings playbook is dealing
with mental illness the artist was
dealing
with I don't know if you would call that
movie that's the movie that won the
Oscar and it was it was a silent movie
and it was dealing with a person who was
a star in the silent movies but he
couldn't make the switch to two talkies
and and so it was about the basic human
need ition was about how you deal with
fundamental change King's Speech is
another one of the Weinstein movies so
the point is they're twos there too and
there to serve all the rules but the two
primary rules for picking movies and yet
you get a rich variety of movies coming
out of that well does that mean that
every movie then is really a Weinstein
movie as long as it's not a Disney movie
no for example Weinstein would not do
gone girl I don't know if you all saw a
gone girl but there's not one character
you like in that movie it's just really
just no one is likable in that movie or
the Birdman again another movie did
anybody like anybody in Birdman you know
no they're not like you know you just
wouldn't like those people then the idea
of a basic human addition think of a
movie like Mission Impossible kind of
what's the basic human condition there
other than fanatic action so so it's not
every movie there these are these these
rules are screening out some but keeping
others give you another example frontier
dental this is a small company and their
problem was they were that what their
business is they do cosmetic dentistry
they've got an alignment a fairly high
tech alignment system and they were
having a lot of heartbreak in doing
their sales calls but they were getting
about a three percent hit rate in their
sales calls they sat down so ok we're
obviously calling on the wrong dentist
to how are we gonna figure out who to
call on so I started thinking okay some
heuristics one of them I thought well
you know I bet it's dentist between 35
and 55
you know old enough to have money but
not so old they're not innovative
showing an age bias I have to say about
who's innovative and not but but it
turns out those rules didn't work
because it's very hard to tell how old
the dentist is and so you couldn't
actually use the rules so they went to
another rule and that was how good's the
website a dentist with a good website is
probably an innovative dentist whose
might be interested in our product then
they went to a second rule
was checking credit reports and if a
dentist had three credit reports within
a year that were negative they didn't
call that person either so essentially
we went to a rule of good website good
credit is the dentist worth are calling
on and they ended up with something like
a 60% hit rate
so overall the point is that simple
rules can help you choose what to do
final just the reason a quick quick talk
because I'm in Microsoft Research I
thought I'd win a dart by slide but
DARPA is is I think we all know that
coming out of DoD and doesn't just pick
any project to work on DARPA picks
projects that are on the so called
Pasteur's quadrant at the frontier of
science and also commercially or at
least militarily relevant second set of
rules it's also kind of kind of easy to
learn and these are how-to rules people
tend to learn these sort of rules these
are rules for how do you execute a task
start out with Airbnb probably all know
we are B &amp;amp; B you probably even know the
story of Airbnb they start in San
Francisco two guys were renting out an
air mattress and serving somebody a
bagel during during conferences trying
to make some extra money it turns out to
be a good concept or at least they think
it's going to be and then they wander
for about a year and a half trying to
actually make the concept work so they
try they first of all they think oh yeah
it's really about conferences so they
got to the South by Southwest and they
get about three people signing up they
go to the Democrat and Republican
convention they get a few more people
but it only lasts a week then they go to
Y Combinator finally and then they start
getting getting some advice about how to
actually find rules one of them one of
the key pieces of advice was get out of
Mountain View go to New York that's
really where them the market is and in
the course of doing a lot of
experimentation a lot of talking to
people they came up with a couple of
simple rules about how to be an Airbnb
host in fact in New York where they
particularly found out was there's about
the hosts it's not about the guests so
actually the key is the hosts and they
got some rules for how do you how do you
have simple rules for hosts that could
be a campsite a treehouse a castle an
apartment and there are
to have a few simple rules for being an
Airbnb host leastly says they started
out one was take professional photos of
your of your property secondly was give
people local tips to give it that Airbnb
flavor and number three always have
fresh soap fresh soap being the signal
of cleanliness when you go into a
bathroom and it's not fresh soap it's a
little bit on the Exide maybe if you
don't really know the people and so and
they have a couple other rules too but
those are essentially some rules that
were largely around how do we tell our
hosts how to be good hosts when it's all
kinds of people in all kinds of places
with all kinds of properties and the
local tips one well first of all the
photography one gave them an edge over
some other sites like home away that was
actually kind of an initial actually
minor edge that created a major edge and
then secondly the idea of local tips
really fit with the kind of branding
that Airbnb wanted to have a little bit
of a funky style probably something near
and dear to all of your hearts maybe not
Twitter per se but meetings you're
probably one of them one of the things I
least the most high tech people I know
run into is they spend more time than
they like in a meeting that's happening
to people with Twitter and there's some
ex executives at Twitter that have new
rules about meeting first of all
meetings have no powerpoints and the
second thing is you can't cancel out of
a meeting once it's said no powerpoints
because everybody wastes too much time
making a PowerPoint when you could be
doing something actually useful why no
canceling because if we're gonna have a
four or five person meeting and one of
us cancelled out it sort of messes up
everybody's schedule so it's a no
canceling within that you can do what
you want to do at your meeting but you
have this couple simple rules final
example on how to rules to take it maybe
more into the into the rock scene the
white stripes the white stripes are a
rock band they are there their hit album
their initial hit album was called the
white blood cells it was thought by many
to be one of the albums of the decade in
the 2000s the White Stripes did white
blood cells in 10 days 18 songs in 10
days
and I put this example in because I
think it's it's about innovation how do
you be innovative in writing music in
ten days when you're are probably a
group of people who are not too into
rules but as it turns out the White
Stripes did have a couple rules one of
them was no covers meaning you can't do
somebody else's songs it had to be
original
the second was no guitar solos no blues
no bass no slide guitar after that song
could be whatever you wanted it to be
but within those rules you had to stick
within those rules so in other words
they weren't so he growing as the out of
the so called sandbox they were creating
their own sandbox and then and then
playing within that sandbox okay so
that's how to rules those are the two
easy kinds of rules to use and probably
if you think about your life you
probably are using some of those rules
in your own life some rules go over get
a little bit harder
these are timing rules they're useful
when you have deadlines rhythms and when
you're trying to maintain rhythm and
when you're trying to maintain momentum
keep things going or when you're trying
to actually synchronize a lot of people
also work for that good example as Pixar
when Pixar started out their first lease
their first hit movie was Toy Story Toy
Story took four years to develop perhaps
some of your big some big software
prizes Jack's probably take something
like that took took Toy Story it took
Pixar about four years to do Toy Story
and the problem with that was it's
really hard to run a business at least a
movie business if you're only doing a
movie every four years and it's really
hard to get talented creative people to
work for you if you're only doing a
movie every four years and so what the
Pixar executives did was started going
into a timing rule which was to develop
one movie a year it took a while to get
there but what essentially they did was
develop a pipeline of rules where they
broke the moviemaking process into four
parts so there'd be sort of a year one
year two year three year four role and
so what that that did was was create a
pipeline of movies so that so that
Pixar could could bring out a movie
every year and then they started then
they planned that time that rule so that
they would also come out at Thanksgiving
so it was a movie every year or at least
at Thanksgiving because that's the big
movie going season or one of the one of
the two big movie going seasons of the
year for families so the idea was what
they did was was develop this rule took
a while liked you to do that it wasn't
actually it is actually non-trivial to
to do that with something as complicated
as a Pixar movie but essentially they
created what is what you might think of
as a moviemaking Factory it didn't
always work in fact this past year they
weren't happy with the quality of the
movie it was going to come out so they
actually they actually skipped a year
but they do try and hit this one movie a
year not another example this is um how
many you may not know but it's in it's
in the concrete business you're probably
thinking concrete's not real interesting
but it's also turns out it's actually
kind of an important industry because in
this may it may be something you don't
know it's the third largest source of
man-made co2 in the atmosphere is from
the concrete industry so it's actually a
relatively polluting industry it also
has one of the highest per capita
consumptions around the world so there's
a lot of it being being polluted around
the world what are the simple rules that
at this company well first let me step
back what this company did was they
decided to do make a more innovative
concrete and so what some of the
engineers and scientists did it previous
is they went back actually to the
ancient Egyptians who are the who are
the folks who discovered or created
concrete and they looked at what the
recipe was that the ancient Egyptians
were using and they were using they were
making concrete but they were adding
blood to it and also horsehair which I'm
not I can kind of get with the horsehair
was I don't know what the blood did but
in any event there were some properties
of blood and horsehair well they sort of
went to the 21st century version of that
and created a new concrete of
proprietary concrete where you could it
had in the production of it it was it
was half the emissions you could use
less of it and it was less likely to
crack so less usage as well as cleaner
when you were
you were producing it so they have this
great innovation and what do they do
with it well they go to Las Vegas and
there's a big trade show and they're you
know showing off the properties of their
concrete and they get you know people
are interested and they're looking for
distributors they decide they really
they think this is a worldwide product
they don't have this the capacity to
distribute it so they're looking for
partners and they get I know something
like a hundred or something partners why
don't want to work with them this is a
small company so how do they how do they
choose well what they did was they they
came up with a few simple rules the
first one was does the partner have a
laser screen machine now for you and me
we don't know I I don't I'm guessing you
know in order laser screed machine is
either but apparently people in concrete
do and it's a signal what it is it's a
quality signals a signal of a partner
who is likely innovative and likely
high-quality and luckily relatively big
so that's what that's that is then the
second that rule they had was actually a
timing rule and that was we're going to
do three partnerships a one one
partnership every three months so every
three partner every three months a new
partnership and your partnership and you
partnership finally the hardest type of
learning rule to learn is a stopping
rule just like it's I think it all is
easy for all of us to get into the stock
market it's always kind of hard to get
out
that's sort of what a stopping rule so
when do you stop doing something
probably the hardest kind of rule to
learn we've got a couple of comments a
couple of examples of that I started the
I started the talk with crickets it
turns out crickets have a stopping rule
for mating if you're a cricket it turns
out mating is really important because
you have a very short life span you've
got a got to get on it
female crickets have a rule that says
when it's time you look for you look for
male crickets that chirp at over three
trips a second so the more chirping the
better the male below three chirps
you're not interested in this guy so how
do you find mr. right you look for the
big drippers but suppose you've been
there for 24 hours
time's running out you haven't found mr.
right then you take the first available
cricket so perhaps similar to I don't
know bar rules whatever in any offense
in any event a cricket ms/ms cricket has
rules for finding mr. cricket if that
includes stopping another example is our
friends at the concrete company after
they go back to them they had their rule
about the laser screed machine they had
their rule about every three months we
get a new partner they also had her
stopping rule if that partner has not
used our concrete in in one of their
projects within three months we drop
them as a partner we move on to somebody
else so they were very quick on dropping
people from the partner set another
example I probably don't know who that
is
that's that Steve Blank of the lean
launchpad but what you may have heard
Steve Blank is one of the sort of lean
startup people and and I used that
because I think it's it's it's he's got
some interesting ideas probably what's
best known is his idea of get out of the
building talk to a hundred customers
always face to face that's one of his
sort of a constellation of his rules but
he also has some interesting rules about
when to stop a project and I think
that's particularly important whether
it's product development or whether it's
sales whatever it is steve has some
rules around when do you decide that a
business is not making it you need to go
in a new direction the so called pivot
rule do it with asking yourself four
questions after you've talked to you a
bunch of customers your hundred
customers you ask yourself four
questions do customers see the problem
that I see second if the customer sees
the problem will they buy a solution
from me will they buy a solution the
third rule is will they buy the solution
removing me and the fourth rule is and
can I make the solution if you get the
right answer on all those you continue
if you answer no you pivot on any one of
those questions you pivot so this
customers see a solution will they buy a
solution will they buy from me can I do
the solution go ahead if not there's a
no in there you move on and then finally
going to be a final stopping rule just
point out the Mount Everest stopping
rule I'll probably a lot of you have
read the book into thin air that not
96 of Nan Everest disaster that actually
in probably was caused by failure to
follow the stopping rule Scott Fischer
who is the expedition leader had us had
a clear stopping rule if you're not at
the top of the mountain at 2 p.m. you
turn back the day 8 people died is the
day he violated that and let people stay
up there to almost 4 o'clock in the
afternoon and they were wiped out coming
down so the point is simple rule of
turning back at 2 o'clock no matter what
was working until the day he didn't do
it and it didn't work ok that's that's
the kinds of rules let me let me just
wrap up with maybe the deeper sort of
the 3.0 how do you actually figure out
the rules and then we'll open up the
question so I'll just do this how to
create rules they can be both personal
or by the way personal or business so we
can talk about you know we can talk
about rules for weight loss rules for
getting your kids to study rules for
finding a date or we can talk about
business rules but I'll talk a little
bit about business rules first there's
really three steps the first step is
what is it what is your objective not in
some sort of vague sense but what is it
really you know do you want to be the
number one mobile phone software maker
in the world very specific about what
you're trying to be second is what's the
bottleneck what's really keeping you
from doing that and the third is then
what are the simple rules so let me give
you some a couple of examples house of
cards probably many of you have watched
house of cards that is a Netflix series
and what was Netflix trying to achieve
with that Netflix was not trying to be
profitable they weren't trying to have
this the greatest show ever what they
were trying to do was make this the most
noticed show ever notice then hopefully
people liked it too but they wanted to
stand out because there are plenty of
good shows I mean there was there's
Sopranos there was Mad Men there was the
wire there was all there were a lot of
shows how were they gonna stand out most
shows try to stand out with great
writing house of cards does that too
they try to have great writing they do
have great writers but that wasn't going
to make them stand out
so their objective was fundamentally a
standout the second issue then in rank
creating the rule says what's the bottom
line what's gonna actually help them to
stand out and they're the bottom left
for them was not writing as it usually
is it was actually around directing what
they did was realize that if they had mu
and well and what they created in house
of cards is a movie quality experience
on television that's I think one of the
standout things and so they they hired a
list directors Nathan gave those a-list
directors a number of simple rules but
pretty simple because a list directors
don't like a lot of rules it was
essentially around 20 days shoots you
got to do two consecutive Equis episodes
and we like it if you hold a particular
kind of camera they liked but within
that you could do what you wanted and
then of course the other breakout was
seeing the bottleneck of programming so
they saw directing and they start
programming and that's when they figured
out the binge-watching ideas it did
binge watching and they also they also
bought house of cards 24 episodes of
house of cards something that media
companies would never do and broke out
so they had a key objective they had a
bottleneck to mention Google just
backing a Google of Google bottom like
is do you wanna the bottleneck is not
always obvious it's why aren't we
achieving what we want to achieve in the
early days of Google they were trying to
do a number of things around search as
well as some other software products
until they started realize they were
sort of think of our bottlenecks
software but in fact they started to
realize the real bottleneck was computer
scientists and so in fact that became a
focus of simple rules of Google to hire
hire computer scientists and then
finally its objective bottlenecks were
it's actually usually you're not obvious
then finally how do you figure out the
rules this is actually a Czech
restaurant chain totin it's in Prague
and they do service they do food service
for big corporate clients actually like
like like Microsoft and other IT
companies they wanted to go into that
business because they were traditionally
a restaurant business and they developed
some simple rules and those rules and
the way in which they did is really what
I want to emphasize what they did was
they got some expert
they asked some other people in the
business of what to do and then the
third thing they did is they tracked
their own experience because what
happened was they they hired really
great chefs their clients were very
happy with the service and they couldn't
make money and so what they did is they
started tracking their own their own
food processes figuring out why why
their costs were so high and came up
with some simple rules like set the
menus on Wednesdays only five different
only five different meals across our
various restaurants three of those have
to be best sellers two of them have to
be a same across all two all the
restaurants and you can only use local
or seasonal ingredients within that the
chef's could create whatever they want
to eat so overall what's the point the
point is that in creating rules you
think first of all what's my objective
for house of cards it's to break out
what's my bottleneck it's not products
it's computer scientists if it's Google
how do I create the rules ask experts
ask my friends track my behavior I want
to close with this picture
mostly because I like it I love that
picture this guy Leonardo da Vinci but
simplicity is the ultimate
sophistication which i think is what the
message of this talk is when the world
is feeling complicated to keep it simple
and I think that's the end of the story
so when you're feeling bummed out
there's too much to do try try some
simplicity okay thanks a lot
okay any questions yeah so using is a
they need to yes you have this rule to
how do you try to enforce or explain
those you you can you can well first of
all you can enforce them because they're
they're fairly enforceable because
they're easy to communicate easy to
remember so they're actually pretty
simple that way as far as the enforce
that I think what what we see is most
successful for people is if if it's a
say in a business context you actually
work with the people you're working with
so people you you kind of collectively
come to the rules so for example one ztz
did their rules about about restaurants
they worked with the chef's because the
chef's obviously figured out they needed
to be profitable and so they worked with
the chefs so usually it works out best
to have people who are actually going to
have to abide by the rules
think about the rules too because they
they also come up with good ideas yes
yeah the people yeah you can tell when
the rules aren't we aren't working is
because you aren't getting the kind of
success that you wanted to have all the
way and a good example if you think of
it let me save a good example
um yeah one well I gave you this is this
is this a little bit of a personal
example but it's it's it was a graduate
student of mine who became a
professional poker player and he started
out playing poker by reading books on
poker like fast Eddy's Texas Hold'em
poker rules and stuff like that and he
learned the probabilities for poker and
he started winning at the one in two
dollar tables in San Jose but after a
while he was he sort of says he said to
me you know I didn't like taking money
for people who couldn't afford to lose
it so he decided to go to the five and
$10 tables and the strategies turns out
changes because at the five and $10
tables everybody knows the rules
everybody knows probability and then it
becomes the rules become a motion and so
he started to realize you know that he
had to both control his own emotions and
take advantage when people were losing
it
other people were losing it for himself
he had
rule around he would only take a certain
amount of money and if he lost that he
was done the other rule that he made for
himself was to always regard a win as
being when he played a hand well even if
he did even if he didn't make money so
then he went on and he he decided to try
his hand at Vegas so he went to Las
Vegas and it turns out that there's a
lot of good players in Las Vegas but
there's also a lot of bad players in Las
Vegas and the trick is how do you figure
out which is which and so he said well
you know in Las Vegas there are fish and
there are sharks and you want to play
the fish and when you sit down at a
table and you look around the table and
you see only sharks you know who the
fish is and you know it's time to go and
so the point of that is that that he
started with the rules then switched to
being about picking the right table and
he had some strategies around about
essentially going to playing for about
45 minutes really conservatively sussing
out the people figuring it off there
were fish and then sitting to the left
of them because that's the optimal place
to sit so the point is that as as the
rules aren't aren't working you start
saying well what's how's the bottleneck
changed how the peoples change how do I
update the rules there's essentially
what the story is oh not so if the rules
are working that's great they'll be
maximizing your you might not be
maximizing that's right well it turns
out first of all that you that some
rules are typically better than no rules
at all we do have done some we do some
lab studies and we showed we showed that
that a more strategic rule is a better
rule but just having a rule sometimes if
it's encourages at least some of the
same right behavior works so so some
rules are better than normals it's the
message here how do you know if you have
the optimal rules you know I don't think
you do know you know for example I gave
you the prim Chris you know we get a
partner every three months you know
would it have better been to would have
three point nine weeks been better for
point seven you know whatever but if
you're about right that's probably what
you want to you want to you want to be
okay
yes to happiness or joy meaning any kind
of Universal role in setting up rules I
know you can make it individual universe
you don't do those in your rules you're
gonna you're gonna fail you know there
isn't no there I mean that's sort of
what we've come up with is we don't
think there's I mean maybe there's some
universal moral rules so that maybe you
know we all want to live by the system I
said I was just in them at Wall Street
last week where we were talking about
ethics and and my interviewer said you
know ethics don't matter in finance
which sort of thought was maybe the
wrong thing to say but I think I mean so
there may be some moral rules that we
would all have but as far as rules for
life like this I'm not sure there there
isn't what there are kinds of rules so
for example I says stopping rules timing
rules are hard to learn and often really
useful there are certain rules that are
that you have to often think about
before you actually come up with but I
wouldn't say there any that just create
happiness or not happiness I think
that's that might be an objective of the
rules of you know I wanted me I want to
be happier in my life therefore I'm
gonna do whatever okay yes oh good okay
so it turns out wasn't an irritating
jerk at all oh this was a fabrication we
had Turing's biographer Andrew Hodges at
that very few months ago okay okay based
on his book he was unhappy about the
movie precisely because they made him
but this makes me realize at least that
it wasn't just Weinstein thinking that
the movie would be a little bit better
if they did this but it was essential
for them to do the movie yes to make him
the portrayal right to give him yes yeah
that's a dog I'll keep that in mind
thanks a lot for the tip yeah anything
else yes so how do you start yourself
from improving things by adding more
rule
you disagree yeah because it turns out
there actually isn't optimal and then
you've started going down that's part of
the self-discipline what we've seen
actually this is now getting more into
him into the psychology of it but people
engage in what's known as simplification
cycling and so people who are reasonably
a student what they do it they'll they
what will you see what you see people do
is they will they will learn too many
rules and then they'll actually realize
they have too many and they'll back off
or they'll raise the level of
distraction if you start having too many
you start losing the flexibility and
then it gets to be more like you can't
remember them you don't want to do them
and it feels like like reform school
anything else on people's minds
yes what is the most recent time that
you've developed some rules for myself
I've been doing a lot of media I I'm
starting because of the book I've been
violating my rules guy used to have
pretty strict email rules like I don't
only look at email twice a day and I
knew wouldn't look at it on the right at
least I would I'd look on the weekend
but I wouldn't I wouldn't respond on the
weekend because I didn't want them
responding back to me and that's kind of
gone I kind of you know with the book
I've kind of been 24/7 but I have new
rules about radio interviews and so in
radio interviews we've learned some
rules around at least I have that in
radio interviews you first of all ask
who the audience is going to be so you
have a sense of what kind of examples
what kind of stuff is going to resonate
with them and then secondly what you try
to do is you only talk for like a minute
or two before you kick into a story so
that's what so those are my new rules on
on radio interviews which probably has
nothing to do with anything any of you
were doing anything else on anybody's
mind yeah did I do that yeah yeah yeah
that was actually the original ideas
came from well from software and
computer companies yeah we originally
did some studies where we were looking
at you know which companies had product
development flows that you know we're
systematically successful and we found
we found two pathologies if you told us
about a company that was way too
bureaucratic we know it was on the East
Coast if you told us about a company
that was way too crazy it was probably
on the west coast and so is that in the
middle and I know making Chicago perfect
I suppose but anyway some of the rules
that worked I think one of the rules
this works is variations of the the
Intuit to Pisa rule which means a
software team shouldn't be bigger than
what two pizzas could feed and that I
think recognizes the fact that that
talent in software is not uniformly
distributed that in fact both working in
small teams and you probably noticed
this where you are here today the best
best software people are quantumly
better than the average software person
and so a smaller teams were more
effective so that's one of the rules the
other rule that was actually the other
rule that was the real surprise to us
was acted at the pay seat the timing
rules the fact that the best companies
that we were looking at had some kind of
timing rule and it depended on a bit
what the exactly the product was but a
timing rule where you would you know put
out either you know a product every nine
months or 12 months or 24 months
depending on how complex the product was
and why that worked was you first of all
it gets people into a rhythm and so you
can actually start getting you know you
know when you're actually in a rhythm
you're you're skiing you're golfing
you're dancing and you start getting
your rhythm and you get more focused
more confident more motivated we can get
that on the team the other thing it does
is it synchronizes people so if you know
that the product rolls in nine months or
twelve months of you know you ride this
kind of roll then you can synchronize
marketing engineering if it's
manufacturing if it's relevant whatever
else is relevant you can centrally you
can synchronize everybody because we all
know that's when it rolls in fact one of
the the tina fey rules for for popular
television shows is if the shows at
11:30 it's ready you know no no messing
around and so that that's sort of that
was a second rule that we really saw
that worked both the size of the team
rules and the rules around the pacing
we're particularly important in least in
the kinds of companies we were talking
about at that time there's a couple of
major rules yeah we felt we found the
more structured you were the more
efficient you are getting it getting out
the wrong product so more and more rules
make you what rules do is tend to make
you pretty efficient but they because
they restrict your flexibility you may
have the product that's actually not
fitting the market and not really not
really what people want yes one of the
rules of you follow is we look at
projects that are in the pipeline
minitor that are moving along you talked
about when do we kill a project we kill
it off can you go over expand a little
bit about that you said when it's not
profitable or not yeah the the ideas of
one to kill a project I see the DARPA
examples fairly interesting because
DARPA has has rules essentially if you
haven't you haven't have a certain level
of breakthrough by the time of the
project which is somewhere between three
and five years which is you know a big
window but it's it's difficult science
they they kill the project so I mean you
could you I mean it would depend on it
it's this goes back to the idea that the
rules are unique to you so the Stanford
football team is not Michael Pollan so
Microsoft is not somebody else or even
parts of Microsoft I'm sorry what I
would say is you need you need some sort
of a stopping rule but what that
stopping rule is is probably Microsoft
specific it could be about not meeting
some kind of payback it could be not
meeting some functionality but something
there was one company I was working with
that had a rule around new businesses a
new business had two years and if it
didn't make certain financial goals you
either stop the business or you at least
rotate it out the top management team
and rotated in a new one so so those are
that's parts what's what's the lesson is
having a stopping rule what exactly that
lesson is is a little more idiosyncratic
to what you're trying to achieve okay
thanks a lot everybody thanks for coming
