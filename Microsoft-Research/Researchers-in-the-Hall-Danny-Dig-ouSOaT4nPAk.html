is standing by Josephine yeah you know
the hallways are getting kind of packed
so I convinced Danny Diggs join me here
in the hood room Danny dig of Oregon
State University welcome nice name I
read that your specialty is in enabling
programmers what has changed in the
world of computing that they need
enabling yeah so my research is enabling
programmers to confidently and to safely
change very large computer programs out
there so I'm turning regular average
programmers into Oberer programmers who
can change very large software systems
and the only software systems were
successful out there in the real world
those who keeps keep changing you know
if I thought the season doesn't change
then it becomes obsolete and no users
want to use obsolete systems uber
programmers I like that a lot and and
the whole world is getting bigger you
know bigger data sets are are everywhere
so can you give an example of how
automated changes in these large data
sets you know are used in the real world
yeah so my research group has been
automating a few kinds of these software
changes so I can give you a few examples
we've been working in the last few years
to semi automate the help of the program
this is an interactive automation
process to semi automate programs to
make them more efficient to make them
use a parallelism that is in every
computing device in laptops in desktops
in mobiles so all of these devices have
now multiple brains we call the
multi-core processing the software
doesn't know how to use multiple brains
so then the software doesn't get any
faster so that's what I've been
researching on the last few years you
know how can we adapt our software to
actually effectively make use of
parallelism in hardware and to it should
improve the performance of software well
speaking of mobile phones for example
people are using these phones to do more
more they surf the web they call up
video etc and sometimes it's pretty slow
and you're saying that these automatic
changes can actually make things faster
yeah so recently we started looking at
the specific domain of mobiles
so Mobile's smartphones and all these
mobile devices are
they have much limited computing
resources than the bigger cousins the
desktops and the laptops that's why they
crash sometimes yet yet what you see the
the usage of the the model of the usage
is like you know people are switching to
them and moving away from desktop and
laptops and most of the usage out of
these devices is going to the network
fetching content from the web loading a
page or loading dynamic content it can
take a long time so if you are a
programmer you are not careful on how
you program this you can execute a lot
of these network or services you can
execute them on the main we call the
main user interface event thread which
will block the user interface and your
app will become unresponsive and you get
very frustrated and this is what causes
people to write bad reviews about
absence to uninstall the app and we've
been helping programmers in helping
programmers to improve the
responsiveness of their we've all had
that happen so thank goodness that you
are improving that and the thing is your
work if successful is actually invisible
to the end-user
that's the point isn't it that well
that's the that's the sign of a success
when when you know computer science it's
truly successful when it's not on the
first page of New York Times but but
when you know everybody is using you
this life becomes the water and the air
that we breathe you know it's it's
unnoticeable everything goes so smooth
everything is so responsive it's oh
that's good news for you yeah thank you
so much Danny that was great work by the
way back to you Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
