hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
the next speaker is dr. P Anand then he
is the managing director of Microsoft
Research India he joined Microsoft
Research in 1997 prior to that he was it
so enough and also he was a professor at
Yale before that and in fact ananthan
founded Microsoft Research India in 2005
and we have nine areas of research and
if any of you have interested in
internships as well you can go to the
website and look at those details I
request and then to come on the stage
and deliver that you know the last two
talks you heard Peter told you about how
researchers are what motivates them what
kind of problems they work on and the
kind of impact that you can have hans
showed you wonderful examples of you
know active research and the
state-of-the-art problems that you're
solving our idea as he said in the
morning in this whole event is to really
expose you to what is you know
high-quality research and why it's an
exciting thing to do and I hope already
you're beginning to feel inspired by the
type of things that people have told you
and the demos they showed you I'm
actually going to focus on the human
angle it's about you meaning it's about
the researcher why do people want to get
into research and how do they go about
doing it and and what do they get out of
it at a very personal level so I hope by
the end of my talk you will get a little
bit of sense of you know what people are
about but let me start first a little
bit about the lab itself this is a
chance for me to introduce the lab and
tell you about some other people there
we started in 2005 it was inaugurated by
you know a couple civil who was then the
Minister for Science and Technology of
course he's changed his portfolios many
times and you know he came in in 2005
helped let's start the lab we've been
going on for last nine years and growing
continually we started with five people
at that time no we started with these
mission goals which is derived from the
Microsoft Research worldwide mission
goals which is really to do basic
research you know and to advance the
state of sort and of course to impact my
crop products working in a company like
Microsoft gives us the opportunity not
only to do good research
but to really see its impact on the
daily lives of people and what could be
more gratifying you know someone some
you know those of us who were in the
process of inventing solutions and
solving problems but we also had a third
mission goal which is really to work
with the Indian science ecosystem the
academic community to help India advance
in research and technology and
engineering education as well when we
came to India PhD research PhD education
was very new was not a lot going on in
computer science there were about thirty
five PhDs graduating every year from all
over India the numbers have increased
about you know eight fold now I'm sorry
six or seven fold a still long way to go
but I think we're beginning to see
progress and it's up to you all of you
here and to see that growth now why did
we set up a lab in India it's because of
you it's because we realized back in
those days there was an aspirational
growing talent pool people like you
exactly young people who wanted to see
great careers and we had an opportunity
to get them to think about research and
of course Indian economy was growing
many years ago when I left India it was
stagnant but now it's been growing and
Indian climate you know Indian economy
that the economic climate having a large
number of people who are poor and
illiterate and those kind of things give
us an opportunity to think about
research problems which we may not think
elsewhere well that was the motivational
goal these are from nine years ago and
today we have grown to a lab of about 60
plus people working in many different
research areas I won't tell you in
detail but this is a rough summary of
what we have 50 or so PhD researchers
from all over the world many from you
know US universities and many from
Indian universities we also have B techs
and M Tech's like you who spend two
years working on a research
assistantship program they learn how to
do research most of them typically go
abroad to do PhD after that and that's
something that we would like to see more
of and we've had many many interns it's
one of our strongest programs and this
is a division of roughly the kinds of
things we do we do research but we also
work a lot with our product teams as it
says in the bottom left we have a bunch
of Engineers helping take our ideas
you know transfer them into Microsoft
products and that activity is very much
part of what we do every day we have a
team which is a team responsible for
organizing this event which is to work
with the external community with the
universities government industry and
others and then we have a small group of
people who do active research in
collaboration directly with product
groups now we work in 8 different
research areas I am NOT going to bother
to read out those to you you can read
them but more importantly if you go to
our website researched at microsoft.com
slash India you will see this kind of
information so I'll let you do that at
leisure not not now while you're here
but perhaps later now let me go back a
little bit about what kind of people
become researchers and this you know I
want to tell a little bit of a personal
story to begin with and then move on to
talking about some people so let me talk
about myself
right and many times you might see you
know you saw fit dr. Peter Lee come and
talk about horn you know ultimately we
are now we've all kids like you at one
time and we all went to some kind of
high school and it's not as if when we
were doing that we thought we would
become a researcher I certainly did not
when I did my high school I studied in
Tamil medium so even my English was not
very fluent when I went to IIT this in
1970s and on many of you you know were
born after that the country's economy
was not in a state for great ideas of
growth and innovation it was much more
at a sustenance level 1975 we had seen
some of our worst political crisis in
the form of the emergency that was
declared and a lot of political freedoms
were curtailed
and we were just coming out of it when I
graduated you know we were really hungry
for jobs and I like many others at that
time went abroad to the u.s. to study
masters simply in search of and a higher
education so that we can get good jobs
and you know have a good you know good
economic opportunity at a personal level
research was not the first thing you
know at that time and my mind so many of
you were at a similar age then when you
know like I was at that age may not be
thinking about research and hopefully
today with the climate that is in the
country perhaps that's not true perhaps
you are actually looking at
opportunities to you know explore your
ideas and innovate but in 1977 we were
not a very highly developed
Nouriel forward-looking kind of country
now I went to after my masters I went to
work at Intel as an engineer again
research was not the first thing on my
mind but that's what you know it dawned
on me and I look back a few years from
then you know when I was in college in
IIT I'd actually read a book called the
design for a brain by Ross Ashby which
you know kind of speculated how would we
go about building something that was as
powerful in terms of its capability as a
human brain from simple ideas very
inspiring book I didn't think much about
it at that time was fun book to read but
back when I you know later on when I was
working at Intel I would do my job you
know 9:00 to 5:00 wonderful job very you
know I I did my job well there was no
problem but then I found it that I was
something was lacking I mean I've come
home every day you know I would have
friends I was learning to play music and
all had parties but something was
missing so I started reading a little
bit more on the same subject about the
brain and the mind and became very
curious about the question of how does
the mind work hardest the thinking part
of our you know being work and I started
reading reading articles and books on
artificial intelligence and they had
some ideas they sounded very interesting
not very clear I was still you know must
have stood in a lot of technical jargon
terms that I may not understand so I
kept reading and then one day I decided
that well I really need to learn more
about this so I decided to apply for PhD
and that's basically what took me to go
do my doctoral program I went to
University of Massachusetts to work on
problems related to artificial
intelligence I worked on computer vision
which is of course one part of the mine
the seeing part how we see the things in
the world did my PhD and when I finished
it I got an offer from Yale University
to be a professor of artificial
intelligence and I did that for a few
years and I got a bit Restless because I
wanted to see my research have much more
real-world impact so I went to industry
research lab called Sarnoff corporation
in Princeton working on large projects
you know which was related to
state-of-the-art applications mostly in
the government area or not private you
know not in consumer area because
computer vision at that time was not
very related to consumer applications it
was still an emerging field you know
when you are working on large problems
that gamma
and the military needed you could apply
that research so that's what we did by
mind in 797 things had changed so I
moved to Microsoft Research I was
responsible for running the computer
vision group for many years and and you
know this was very satisfying I was able
to publish I had done some interesting
work a lot of people had recognized the
work for what it was and but there was a
pang you know I think many years ago I
had left India at a state where the
country had not really grown but by the
90s as most of you know because many of
you were you know kids at that time
everything was available jobs were
available people who were you know
driving nice cars living in nice houses
actually having interesting jobs
actually doing interesting things that
worked but then when I look back there
was something missing which is India was
still not thinking about research as an
important thing to do many college
students that we spoke to they were very
happy to do that you know education go
work in a company but when you ask
something about research nobody
understood what it was so I
but as this talent pool was rich so at
that time I talked to my management at
Microsoft Research
they were very forceful enough to agree
to set up a research lab in India and
that's how I got back you know it's been
a great nine years you know I continue
to do this I've stopped doing research
once I started running the research lab
directly I missed that but I must say
that the you know seeing people like you
seeing having researchers work in our
lab and actually advance the state of
the artist really immensely rewarding
and I hope we will see that that's just
my personal story let me switch to some
other some other people I want to start
with you know one of my colleagues dr.
Ravi Kernan he's a researcher in our lab
a brilliant theoretical addition he did
his high school in Madurai
and you know did his in Central School
mother I think he did a speed I can
iit-bombay
was a silver medalist when to do his PhD
at Cornell University so I asked him a
few days ago Ravi what is it that made
you want to get into research as opposed
to you know go become an engineer in
Orbea we do something else when his
answer was that when he was doing an
undergraduate education in IIT Bombay
there was a senior student who was you
know in the same hostel of
rooms away who was a PhD student and
that student really sounded like he was
doing very interesting interesting
things so in fact to the point that now
we actually worked with him on a small
problem and solved the solve problem and
then he realized that he had always had
this great interest in solving problems
and many in fear like this I mean you
wouldn't have gotten into the colleges
that you did if you weren't like that I
know many of you for instance in high
school probably took your mathematics
book and solved all the you know
problems the proofs of geometry proofs
that were at the back of the book and so
on and even he was like that he was one
son that like to challenge himself to
solve problems and he realized that
research was a way where he could have
an endless supply of interesting
problems to work on that he keep on
solving then he joined you know as I
said Cornell University had a PhD was a
professor at MIT Carnegie Mellon and
later on at Yale and he joined us in
2007 to come back to help us establish
our lab in the area of theoretical
computer science he works in the area of
theory of computer science algorithms he
is one of the best-known researchers in
the world in the field of algorithms his
you know fame claim to fame is that he
introduced the idea of principle
sampling in linear algebra so that when
you deal with large matrices you don't
have to always work with the entire
matrix but you can do with some subset
of it that's more manageable in size
he's won many prizes the connotes price
is the highest price that a theoretical
Computer Sciences is awarded so he's
someone who really approach research you
know was motivated by something slightly
different not the question about the
mind but rather the interesting
opportunity to solve problems so I asked
him what is it that's exciting to you so
he says mainly it's the opportunity to
solve interesting problems so it's the
same motivation that you know hard work
improves when I was in high school still
continues and this was something else
which is as a researcher you have
immense amount of freedom so he enjoys
the freedom to do what he wants you know
he doesn't have to do a nine-to-five job
going back to what Peter said he's not
always looking for the red dots he flies
finds immense number of blue dots as he
goes along without even you know
thinking about what he's looking for and
the other thing that he really liked and
this is something that's important you
know we are standing here Peter was and
Horne was we are standing here and
talking
you about what we did and this there's a
great pleasure in actually being able to
explain interesting ideas to bright set
of students the idea of teaching the
idea of disseminating ideas is something
that he finds rewarding but of course
more than anything else recognition I
mean when you do this you become famous
I mean he's got all these prizes
students come to him they follow his
ideas and that's a very high degree of
satisfaction and you know he was very
clever in a cute when I said you know
what is it really that's one important
thing you want to say to these students
and he said well research is one carrier
in which you don't have to current your
failures you know you can work for 10
years and you might have got 100
failures and might have three successes
in the long run the world remembers the
three successes so it's a very high
tolerance tolerance rate
in fact in research if you choose
problems such that you never fail that's
probably not good because as a
researcher you want always to work on
problems that are so hard that you are
bound to fail often often often but when
you succeed you've done something very
profound and important and what other
carrier where you are rewarded for
failure think about that and next time
when to my dear friend and colleague
professor Ashok Gingin wallah many of
you might have heard his name he's a
very well-known figure in Indian
electronics and computer science he did
his high school in Calcutta studied in
Bengali medium came from a modest family
and then I asked him why did it why did
you go into IIT why did you study
engineering he asked you know he told me
something very interesting from the
childhood he always had a strong
interest in political activism he cared
a lot about society social differences
poverty issues of inequality and so he
wanted to fight that but he had to go
study engineering because his family you
know needed him to be educated and be
able to you know provide for the family
and that's one of the reasons but of
cause he was a brilliant student so he
did very well and then you went to a
u.s. did his PhD and but he wasn't you
know he didn't want to spend a lot of
time there because he was always looking
to come back home and make a difference
you know whereas I stayed for 25 plus
years he didn't stay for more than about
four years or five years to the u.s. in
1981 he came back to India joined IIT
Madras and he was continuously active
throughout this time on various
political you know activist movements in
order to improve society or address very
kind of social challenges lot of
anti-jewish social injustice and he
cared a lot about it he wanted to erase
poverty and he thought the way to do it
was to fight for the rights of the
people who were deprived but as he was
you know spent his time in IIT he
discovered something else he realized
that the more important way perhaps the
most successful way of transforming
society is not to be you know doing
political activism at one end of the
spectrum but to come in the middle and
promote entrepreneurship and innovation
so he started doing that he is a pioneer
in the telecom revolution in India and
during the time you know you might have
all you know known in olden days before
you were probably born perhaps we had
these telephone kiosks where you could
go and make STD calls he was you know a
part of that transformation and movement
and he's been about given many awards
but mystery of course you know but the
butt noggin award is one of the best
prices awarded to top scientists in
India and it's given to a few scientists
every year and he's a recipient of that
he's also been very influential not only
because of his research or his influence
in academia but also his passion for
societal transformation he's a member of
the Prime Minister's Scientific Advisory
Committee he's a member of the court
care committee which is you know come up
with a document for IIT reforms and now
most recently thanks to his efforts he
is a chairman of a new committees head
up by the MHRD called the quality
enhancement for engineering education so
he's someone who's passionate about what
he does he's deeply committed to
improving society long history of
activism but ultimately he decided
entrepreneurship with the way to succeed
and this is something that I you know
want all of you to take away is that the
reason we do these things is not simply
because we want jobs not simply because
we want to have fun but ultimately it's
a way of advancing you know the society
in a very interesting and fun way not in
a way where you have to sit in a corner
and cry all the time but in an active
way where you invent things where you
bring it to the society and get rewarded
you know you get rich you get famous for
that and that's a good thing and he's
engaged hundreds of students in his
enterprises and you asked him what's the
one message you want to tell to the
students he says never say it cannot be
done
now I want to move to Bill T's who will
be here later today as one of the
speakers and he is actually very unusual
he's actually from the u.s. he's
American he was born and raised in
Pennsylvania he did his high school
there and then his bachelors and masters
or bachelors and PhD both at MIT very
smart student from the childhood onwards
I asked him why did he get into computer
science he said it was mostly an
interest in the subject he was starting
to program computers when he was like in
the fourth grade or something like that
so he got always interested in that
subject
he saw computers as a way of making
things and doing experiments rapidly you
know you don't have to go around
building a lot of hardware and test it
but you can simulate it in software any
kind of thing that you want to do in
software you can do it a lot faster and
see if that model your idea and our
approach is right and thereby I've
improved both your theory practice he
had one very key influence again
legislate Ravi in this case it was his
advisor both for his undergraduate and
PhD professor soumarin saman amarasinghe
is from Sri Lanka but a professor at MIT
and apparently a bill guard involved is
the project that he was doing and so
professor Suman has again a history of
trying to solve social problems through
technology and that's something that
bill has been very passionate about I
don't know how much of that he'll talk
about it in his talk today but in the
lab in the last six years his primary
focus has been working on how to bring
technology to help in in the areas of
education health in particularly health
also people-to-people interaction in the
context of poor people rural people
people who don't have access to
technology access to computers maybe
maximum a cell phone not a smartphone
but the featured phone and he's done
some tremendous work in that area and
has received you know already about 10
or 12 Awards worldwide for the kind of
work that he's been doing I asked well
what's your message to the student stood
students and he said something different
it's not about why technology should
change Society or it's not about solving
problems but simply listen to your
internal compass and do what excites you
personally and I think that's a great
message my hope is that we will shift
your internal compass just a little bit
towards excitement in doing science and
research
the last one is against someone who's
working in our lab young researcher
who's about 28 did his PhD and finished
his PhD about three years ago he is
Indian but he grew up abroad his father
is a diplomat he ended high school in
Saudi Arabia studies in the u.s. at
various universities did his PhD at Yale
and during his undergraduate education
when he was doing math he met a
professor professor Alan Taylor who
worked with him very closely and solving
problems and introduced in the
excitement of actually working on math
problems the great thing about Nikhil is
that recently he solved the problem
which happened to be a computer science
problem but as a result of it he ended
up answering a question that was open in
the field of quantum mechanics for the
last 50 years it's a tremendous
breakthrough something at the age of 28
I'm sure all of you would love to have
you know done something like that when
you get to that age and that's because
he let himself go and I'd worked on the
problems I asked him what is it that
motivates you to do research and he said
something that Peter said in the
beginning it's the beauty of math in
mathematics and science so he comes
you know purely from the notion of
understanding the beauty now he's been
very successful in fact later on this
afternoon profs dr. jeannette wing will
talk about the work that he did but i'm
not going to cover that just to give you
an idea of the person that he is so why
did i go through all these people each
one of them including me has a slightly
different motivation to come into
research we are not doing the same yet
here for the same reason but we may be
doing the same thing at the end of the
day so it takes all kinds of motivations
and reasons to do research all that
matters is that you care to be free to
think freely to work in an open space
now that's all fine as far as you know
doing these problem solving these
problems now and coming from microsoft
you know it's a company which makes
products you want to not just do your
research on paper and publish papers and
look at beautiful things many of you I'm
sure want that research to go away and
have real impact you want every person
in the world to use the technology or
the product that you invented right
isn't that the reason to do all these
things well let me tell you one small
story you all have the Kinect right how
many of you have used the Kinect
okay more if you have to get it up there
anyway so if you're played with it you
know it's an amazing machine in terms of
you know making your body the controller
but Kinect started as a Microsoft
research project in in collaboration at
the product group called natal I'm going
to play a video that kind of tracks the
history of the research behind Kinect
because just you get the flavor this was
done the video was taken you know with
people in our Cambridge lab and others
not here but so but it'll give you an
idea of what they did I hope the video
and play
until now if you wanted to measure the
movements of parts of somebody's body
you need some kind of a device like a
remote or a marker but now in the towel
the body itself is the input device
project natal allows you to control your
character your games your entertainment
experiences through movements of your
body this is the dream of every
researcher taking that blue skies'
research and seeing it being shipped to
millions of people folks in my group
come from all walks of life from
musicians to artists to algorithmic
developers to researchers to product
people the way that we incubate is
essentially to actually embrace all of
these different work styles the first
time that you discover something new
that you love that's what the first
moment was like when I walked up to the
sensor gestured and saw that come to
life on the screen we knew we had
something when we took the first demos
that were using the skeletal tracking
technology and we actually had people
using every part of their body not only
were they smiling but they said hey I
was actually there one of the brilliant
things is that a 3d camera for the first
time it's going to be available that
gives you the three-dimensional
information about the distance to every
point on the body but it doesn't
actually give you an interpretation of
where the limbs are what the angles of
the joints are so for that we need to
build software what the tunnel does is
it evaluates effectively trillions of
body configurations every frame we've
made it do that 30 times a second the
person playing with project natal
doesn't need to change their actions or
change their behaviors to fit the
technology note all technology actually
changed itself to fit the way that the
player plays I think this is one of the
most successful applications of machine
learning and computer vision that's ever
been deployed we should absolutely
expect the unexpected it's 50% Hardware
50% of software the beauty is that
have the ability to tie those together
in a magical experience from a
technology site our goal is just to make
that absolutely seamless you act it
understands the idea of using your body
as a controller the idea of controlling
things with your voice the idea of
connecting with players like we've never
connected before suddenly that white
sheet of paper in front of me was filled
with ideas the opportunities to delight
consumers to make our art form more
accessible to a broader audience we've
given you a ticket to the coolest party
and given you a megaphone to shout out
and to interact with the people around
you
last thing said coming 2010 so this is
you know several years ago of course now
we see the success of it in the field so
here was a dream some people who were
actually in the product group had about
a product that they could make to change
the way people play games and here are
some researchers who had some ideas they
met and that's what you saw so it's very
very rewarding you know when you are
able to think about these things and be
able to approach the problem in an open
way and solve it I'm gonna pause a
little bit to a different type of things
so let me ask you you know Peter
mentioned this some of these things and
it's interesting that I have the same
code what is research right I mean there
are many ways of talking about but
ultimately new knowledge is created
through the process of research you
knowledge doesn't come accidently it
doesn't sort of dawn on you one day you
know many times people do have these
brain waves and ideas but those are
often a result of many many many many
days of thinking about something that
you don't know how to do and then one
day you see the answer but it isn't as
if you're sitting one day and having
lunch and then you never thought about
you know something and you invent
something so it really takes that kind
of hard work and it takes a lot of
research it takes learning about what
everybody else has done learning about
what the problem really means and
understanding it and then keep working
at it until you solve like Robby said
solving hard problems that's at the
heart of research but you know if you're
thinking about product development again
like Peter pointed out you would be
working on a focused problem but in
research you kind of have to put that
aside you cannot assume anything you go
down to the basics go down to the basics
and question everything and learn the
fundamentals and and you want to take
the problem in the most general way yes
you may solve a small problem but that
behind that solution may be something
that's much more elegant much more
general that's what you're looking for
and one of the things about research
again as I said earlier you know you may
spend 10 years working on problems you
might have solved five problems and
failed in hundred problems but you keep
on working at it patient like again I
think Peter mentioned it is a talk those
10 years of gap in the speech
recognition if people had given up and
walked away we wouldn't
where we are today so you keep on
persisting at it and most of the things
in research don't pan out in few days
all the things that even the connect
work that I said the product may have
been developed over a period of one or
two years but the research behind it
without knowing the end goals were
actually being pursued for a decade or
two before that so you keep on working
at it one of our colleagues well-known
person called professor bill Buxton
calls it the long-nosed of research it
really takes 20 years for any ideas to
crystallize and become a successful
product and the other point is that you
know your world is your critic when
you're a researcher you don't have a
manager that tells you if your work is
good or bad more often than not your
manager is not an expert in your field
so he cannot or she cannot give you that
criticism you go to the world you
publish it and everybody tells you you
know whether your work is good or not
and that's him men's feedback to correct
your course and one thing you have to
remember that every new technology and
every new idea was a lab experience at
some point long before it turned out to
be product so you don't get to innovate
you don't get it to put new products out
unless you're actually doing some
research on it now next question of
course is why should you PhD why can't
you just leave this room start doing
research tomorrow well the problem is
it's not that easy all through your
college until now I assume you've all
had to study a subject go to an exam
right how many of you have had a course
in which there was no a no exam maybe a
rare one there and I want to meet that
teacher of that brilliant person but in
you know you are trained up to now to
learn subjects and be tested against it
guided learning when you go to research
you've got to put that away you've got
to learn on your own you got to think on
your own you've got to go into the depth
there's no teacher who'll tell you go
read this and go read this you have to
discover what to read you have to you
know there is a certain process of
becoming independent that you cannot do
without this training and research and
that's why we have PhD programs you
spend those four five six years you know
sort of learning to be a different type
of person not learning new subjects
alone but that you do but your real
learning to think on your own
and there's more you know immediate
point if you want to become a professor
or a researcher in a place like
Microsoft Research you
a PhD degree but there are reasons not
to go to graduate school and this is
applicable to some of you hopefully not
many of you first of course you enjoy
taking courses rather than learning on
your own if that's what you like don't
go to research and you're so much in a
hurry to get a real job and you want to
make that first you know 10 lakhs are 20
lakhs and buy your whatever Maruti Swift
or whatever you want to buy that's what
you want to do and more likely than not
from my experience you probably don't
want to do that your parents probably
want to do that I bet many of you your
parents are saying okay when are you
going to finish and when I gonna go get
married and my neck so don't listen to
them okay here's you know strong appeal
here is a case where you should tell the
parents I really want to spend more time
doing something else it's no hurry
you'll always get a job you'll always
quote those things and the last is of
course if you want to improve your
salary it is in fact not the case that
by doing PhD you will get the best
salaries you will get good salaries but
those five or six years you could have
probably done other things so if that's
what your intention is money is alone
that's probably not the thing for you to
do but phd's do command very good
salaries so it's not as if you fail in
any way now when you are a graduate
student you have the most amount of fun
because when you're a graduate student
your hours are flexible you work when
you want I mean unless your advisor is
so you know terrible that they torture
you and you go at your own pace you
don't have to finish it at a certain
time you take your time to learn your
thing and do it right you work at home
you work in the office
many times people work in coffee shops
is the most favorite place for
researchers you have a lot of breaks you
can take two months off doesn't matter
it's only your progress you know there's
nobody sending that you have to do this
not necessarily coursework and your work
is flexible you can actually work on a
topic for one year and say I am not
making progress
switch it you know go to something else
where you can be better so this amount
of freedom you will not get in most
types of things that you do and there
are lots of researchers in the world
they are very supportive and your
adviser you know most of the time if
they are well informed they will really
support your mental journey as much as
your research progress and something
very important most researchers present
their words in conferences held
worldwide and you know people who
organize conferences are clever in order
to attract good people they have you
know hold them at the best places
southern Italy Hawaii Goa I mean you get
to travel to nice places at somebody
else's expense after I graduate you know
graduation you go join a research lab or
university and you're in generally you
have more influence and control in your
job than the people who are not
researcher who didn't do the PhD because
you have more authority we have more
deeper knowledge and pretty much any job
that you could have gotten a few years
ago you can get now probably you'll be
stronger in doing that job and move
faster of course you're starting a
little bit late but for that you will be
wiser now last part I want to just
finish a little bit about what we are
doing
apart from this event in order to get
people like you excited about research
and transforming India to a higher level
of research and engineering education we
have a strong program this is a program
led by the team that I said was working
on external engagements the MC for this
event Miss Vidya Adam poly is in fact
the head of that group and one of the
speakers later you'll hear siddharth
actually and many of you probably know
siddharth is actually in the part of the
group we've been working on many aspects
not only on improving the researcher
ecosystem but also working with our
partners on helping technology address
societal challenges and last but not
least you know working with industry and
government and academia to provide
thought leadership by being in these
committees I'm a member of that Q Triple
E committee with the entire team
actually do a lot of the support work
for that committee in terms of
technology and so on and we've you know
we connect with many people trade bodies
government academia industry and other
you know Microsoft units as well to do
our work these are some of the programs
don't bother leading them again if you
go to our website you'll learn more
about these programs some of them will
be relevant to you when you become a
graduate student for example travel
grants to go to international
conferences PhD advising joint with
Microsoft researcher PhD fellowships and
there is something called research
connector I don't know if you'll hear
about it today but you'll find it in the
website and we organized many events
take Vista is one of them but we
organize summer schools winter schools
you know and we have a lot of
collaborative opportunity for professors
and researchers as well a couple of new
initiatives
I'm not sure we are going to talk about
research connector but we will be
talking about the
Sibley empowered classrooms which is
bringing a new way of using technology
to enhance quality of teaching and
training for engineering education I
won't say much about it because it's
going to be one other talk
so in summary why is research the best
carrier we're almost I'll tell you why
it's almost freedom but more do you want
flexible work creative you do some of
the most creative work I mean you
literally create new ideas new gadgets
new technology of course you get flame
and glory I mean you saw these people
winning awards and you give talks and
lots of people stand up and applaud and
you travel around the world and so I
think the only job which I can think
which is better than being a researcher
is a rock star now if you are going to
be a rock star you wouldn't be here you
would have already been out there so I'm
sure you're not unless one of you is a
rock star in this case I want to meet
you but you know therefore you're here
do the next best thing be a researcher
