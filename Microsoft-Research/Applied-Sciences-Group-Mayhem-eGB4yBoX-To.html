director of the Applied Sciences group
here at Microsoft and I'm da white I'm a
developer on the Applied Sciences group
and we're here today to tell you about a
free open-source application that we've
been working on that we call mayhem and
mayhem is this really cool system that
lets you connect devices and services
together so the windows ecosystem has
all these different things that plug
into it well up till now it's been very
hard to connect those things together
mayhem lets anybody do that so let me
show you what I mean by that so I'm
going to use this xbox controller to
control my power point presentation and
now as a programmer I could go off and i
could write some code to do that would
that be a lot of work and probably
beyond what most people would be willing
to do but with mayhem it's really simple
so you come in here let me choose the
event xbox controller and now you push
the button on the xbox controller that
you want to trigger on these clicked a
so now we hit save and we choose the
reaction that we want to happen when we
click the a button on the xbox
controller and we choose PowerPoint next
slide we turn it on and so now with that
mayhem connection running I can just
press the button and control the
powerpoint presentation so this is the
basic operation may have you have events
and reactions and that's all there is to
it you choose a trigger event and then
you choose the reaction that you want to
happen when it triggers so let me give
you another example I'm going to use a
Windows Phone here to control the media
player on my pc so we choose the event
phone remote and a new button is created
on the screen and we're going to set the
text of that to be play pause and you
now download the mayhem remote
application from the windows marketplace
and when you open the settings for that
it'll say pair with your computer and on
here Yusei parathe phone and it launches
the barcode you scan the barcode with
your phone that's got it so we can close
the code save it and we choose the
reaction
media play pause turn it on and you
notice the button has appeared on my
phone and now I can just control my
media player so I hit play pause and now
my media starts playing and I can stop
it again just by hitting it again
alright let me show you one other thing
this is a device that's an insta on
device and this just you plug into the
wall you plug your lamp into it and you
can control it with your computer and
we've built modules so you can control
this from mayhem so we're going to go
ahead and control the light of that we
have over here with my voice so let's go
ahead and set that up so we choose the
event speech recognition we're gonna say
turn on the light how we save that and
choose the reaction insteon reaction and
this is populated with some defaults
turning the light on so we save that
turn it on turn on the light Hal and the
light comes on it's that easy now in
fact you may have noticed that when we
had the phone before we had a couple of
buttons already set up and I can also
control the light from my phone so
hopefully that shows you some of the
things that you can do with mayhem it's
this really cool Universal application
that we've done the hard work for you so
you can just specify what you want your
computer to do really quickly and it
does it so mayhem is an open source
application it's available from the
outer curve foundation and you can
download it for free @ mcmayhem com
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
