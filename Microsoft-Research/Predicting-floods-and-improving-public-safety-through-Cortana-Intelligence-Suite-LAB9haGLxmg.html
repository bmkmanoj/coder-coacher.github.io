Several miles to the south and to the west of the Onion Creek area, in
the Onion Creek watershed there was about 12- to 14-inch rainfall.
And that rainfall, that water began to move through the watershed and into Austin.
And it really did catch us by surprise.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; :: Flooding is the largest natural disaster that people face.
It costs more money and it takes more lives than any other form of
natural disaster that's faced in the United States or elsewhere.
The National Flood Interoperability Experiment is designed to develop the next
generation of flood forecasting system for the United States that's connecting
the nation's flood forecasting system with local emergency response.
What we're trying to do is build up the actionable intelligence that can be created
at that time and perhaps even forecast floods before the rain starts to fall.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; :: We learned from the NFIE team that when a stream gauge is not working
that the emergency response team loses ability to monitor flood.
They wanted a model that can predict water flow into the river, even if a stream gauge is not working.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; :: The goal of the National Interoperability Experiment was to use advanced analytics to save lives.
The biggest challenge of the experiment was to bring together large datasets from disparate data sources
in order to calculate flood predictions for nearly three million river reaches across the United States.
And enabling geographically distributed researchers to collaborate in the cloud.
We leveraged several of the higher level services in Cortana's
intelligence suite to accomplish this such as stream analytics,
Azure Data Factory and Azure machine learning.
One of the great things about Azure ML is its ease of use. It
enabled us to ingest, clean and transform these data.
It also enabled us to create models, score them and evaluate the predictive
capabilities by simply connecting them together in a drag-and-drop UI.
In the end we were able to generate graphs and show a high level of correlation using
the machine learning modules that were available in Cortana's Intelligence Suite.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; :: What we need to be able to do is provide them accurate information that gives
them the ability of making a decision on what to be done, whether to close systems
or close roads or close bridges, that type of information is critical to have.
Microsoft presented a concept of how to start putting not only immediate data but long-term historical data
together that could really build out an idea of how to actually manage a flood event in a unique way.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; :: Using the knowledge and the science, along with the boots-on-the-ground
first responder capabilities has a synergistic effect.
So if we can work on this experiment and develop a template that any agency
across the nation could use to lay that over their threat and risk analysis
for their community and better prepare themselves, we're all much better off.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
