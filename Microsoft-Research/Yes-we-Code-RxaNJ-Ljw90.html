are buried hello so this is the second
time I've used I've built slides this
way and so if it if it if it up
and doesn't work let me know you'll
notice but it's it's written in markdown
and then I use a script to generate
JavaScript presentation it's really fun
it's called big DJ s is the technology
and then big dot py generate it's from
generated from markdown so let's hope it
works so hi everyone my name is Harper
and I was a CTO for Obama for America
which is President Obama's re-election
campaign it was a really interesting
choice to choose me as CTO they really
wanted a change a departure from the
past in 2008 this was the CTO um and
he's a really great guy he's the one
that hired me he's who found me and
really people always ask how did you get
the job and it's really disappointing to
just say networking a friend of a friend
who happened to be a Republican was just
like hey this guy's looking for a CTO
and I was like okay that was it this is
me obviously and this is 2012 I don't
know if you guys notice the difference
here but slightly always said it was his
he was trying to build this kind of like
Jacques versus nerd dynamic in the
office because we shared an office
together I didn't really appreciate that
so anyway they basically just um wanted
to do things differently and what they
wanted to do is they wanted to win that
was the first thing the second thing I
wanted to do is they wanted to use real
technology so my wife she's Japanese and
she was telling her this and she told me
this saying which basically says if you
want rice cakes
go to the rice cake factory or the other
rice cake guy the idea is they needed
engineers to do engineering before they
just hired whoever is around and if
you've ever been involved in a campaign
how many people here have been involved
in a campaign this is a big group you
know that it's really just like a
hundred twenty four year olds and they
just do whatever they solve whatever
problem you have them solve apparently
it doesn't really work for engineering
as much it worked fine in 2008 but we
knew that we had a different game this
cycle where we needed to do things a
little bit differently and more
importantly we need to execute the hell
out of it so we the first thing we did
is we this was actually uh I don't get
hub which obviously you guys know of
creates these little guys and one of our
one of our people photoshopped it and
made him a little progressive how cute
so we we hired 40 engineers throughout
the campaign we hired them from all of
these places I want to really call
attention to the last one which is a
real company i'm very excited about
these days is it god damn its marked
down tell ya it's the script just
kidding so overall the campaign had
about 120 tech staff now let's go back
to this 40 number because I forget to
say something in 2008 we had four so
this is back-end engineers these are
people who build the foundational
technology in 2008 they had for
engineers for all of it we had about 120
tech staff including analytics and IT
and all that fun stuff now if you think
about that many of you work for giant
companies and 120 engineers is an
incredible amount of engineers for any
organization except for all startups in
the bay apparently we had 18 months to
do the job that we had to do it was very
daunting but we we relied on these
things and I don't know if you guys are
familiar with the simpsons a really cool
show and Homer once spelled that out
loud smrt and I say that all the time
anyway so execution but the thing was we
couldn't it up we had no chance we
had no intent rye and try again
you iterate you your launches fail how
many have launched something it didn't
quite work out how you expected it now
if anyone doesn't raise your hand you're
lying because launching never works we
had a unique property though we started
from zero and we had to build an
enterprise but we had a very limited
time and we couldn't it up so the
first thing we set out to do is we built
a platform how many of you guys have
heard of narwhal no that's more maybe
then should but anyway Narwhal is this
really cool i don't know you guys
recognize that guy so jim messina the
campaign manager we had a weekly
presentation we photoshopped his head on
animals for every presentation just just
as a way to kind of break it up and make
it a little more humor anyway Narwhal
was a concept it was something we came
in there and we said we need this
platform to run the campaign and how do
what do what is this platform you to do
well it needs to be an API because what
an API will allow us to do is it allows
us to share information all around and
it allows us the freedom to build all of
these really important things very
quickly and so being able to this is my
favorite slide by the way this is this
would be like a good anyway so then we
built the products on top of that API
and so this allowed us to really build
all of these very distinct products on
one platform that then could share the
data so here is the innovation are you
ready when you logged into the call tool
you use the same username and password
that you logged in with on
barackobama.com and then on van for vote
builder and then on all the bsd tools
that alone was the innovation that
changed everything a shared username and
password it was crazy and so you know
that was really exciting and that was
only because we were able to share the
data back and forth with this API so
here's the products we built call tool
dashboard the mobile apps contribute
there's a lot of others but I actually
don't think the innovation was the
products we built if there is an
innovation it was that the API was big
was wide and covered all aspects of our
technology this is a little bit of a
stat that kind of blows my mind still is
we had 290 roughly a little under 300
repositories on github that we regularly
deployed
so that means that our staff of four th
engineers had to maintain that much code
to be able to be successful in the end
we had thousands and thousands of
servers this was a pretty crazy thing as
well but luckily we used amazon web
services so we probably only hit a
thousand server for like like one second
one day one time but we're able to scale
infinitely so if you guys are doing
those things use Amazon like I said
before failure was just not something
that we could focus on we just could not
fail and when you're kind of powered by
ideology it's pretty easy to kind of to
to adopt that that attitude but it's
hard to adopt it in technology so we had
to do a lot of things the first thing we
did is we engaged heavily in user
experience so we knew that we would be
very deliberate about the things we were
building and now how the users were
interacting with them I hired the first
I think user experience professional in
the history of campaigns Jason kunis he
was our director of user experience he
was great the second thing we did is we
did this thing called game day which
it's funny I say day because it actually
we did dry runs to look at that we did a
game day which was this idea of
practicing failure so going through and
killing all of your products killing the
technology that powers your products and
we did this for a month so October all
we did was ourselves it was
terrible it was one of the most painful
things that I've ever gone through which
was every single day you'd come to work
and you would purposefully fail things
and then you'd react to that failure
because we knew that we had no time to
learn how to react to failure on e day
we knew that we had no time for the gotv
period for us to even think about what
happens if a database disappears what
happens if this user clicks this button
strangely what happens if we had no
whips we had to know exactly so we did
this until we had enough of a handle on
execution that we did not have any
worries and there were no surprises the
first time we did this or not the first
time but one of the big times we did
this was a Sunday and the next day
amazon went down very very very hard and
took most of the internet with it and
that day i think it was october 21st
anyone remember there was the day of the
last debate which was not a great day to
have a lot of downtime but we didn't
have any downtime because we had just
for 12 hours that the previous day on
what to do in exactly that scenario so
we just reacted it was no big deal and
our users didn't notice which is the
most important thing on e de e de was
hilarious this was an actual post-it
note that was on someone's desk and so
I'm like walking around and I'm and I
see this and I'm just like yeah we
should call him the down so on eday
because we're done you can't you wait
like you cannot it's not like we're
gonna build so we just sat in my office
and listen to R&amp;amp;B and waited for fires
and there were no fires because
everything that we had practiced worked
so every reaction was the actual perfect
reaction there wasn't actually something
that were surprising the only problem we
had hilariously was with our favorite
app Oh shaheedi which we had a huge
implementation of and we used for voter
protection and made the difference in
places like Virginia and some other
places where voter protection was very
important and it almost crashed but it
didn't so we won that was very exciting
this would be a really different
presentation if it would have gone the
other way it might be an interesting
execution to try it so takeaways I
wanted to open it up to some questions
and some discussion but I wanted to give
you guys some of the things that I that
really made me think about or that I
thought about during the election the
first thing that I think the innovation
that we had was the team it was hiring
it was getting real engineers inside of
a campaign to do engineering and that
goes for not just engineers but it goes
for the analytics folk and it goes for
the IT folk and it goes for the media
analyst people all of these people came
and were interrupted their careers to
join the technology and the solutions
and the code rewrote was innovative but
that wasn't the innovation this is
something that's really frustrating we
the campaign needed to represent America
and we weren't able to do that inside of
the engineering team I was able to talk
to you huge organizations that are
trying to hire non-asian minorities and
the technology organizations and women
in the technology or organizations and
they were not able to help us and when
you have the president's name you can
pretty much get whatever you
and they were not able to help us so
that kind of demonstrated to me which
was before that I was like it I'm
making t-shirts I don't really care now
I'm like okay we have to do this and it
was impossible we did not do a good job
well we did a great job I mean we won we
can go back to that slide and we can be
like well okay well what does it matter
but going forward you know I I really
truly believe that innovation comes from
diversity and you know we need diversity
on our teams to survive so I need you
guys to help about with this and I think
one of the first things we can do is
just continue talking about it and not
just yelling change the ratio but
actually doing things politics doesn't
they don't know is that he makes sense
politics does not like change at all me
hired as a change agent as someone who I
think looks different and I think that's
part of one of the reasons i was hired
because i could be a change agent
visually as much as I would like
execution-wise they it was hard so this
is something we can all kind of think
about and I'm sure you deal with this
especially the people that deal with
giant organizations that are old
anything that's been around for a while
they don't like change and politics is
one of them and it was a pain in the ass
I mean you don't have to wear a suit
that was something I did not believe but
apparently you don't so yeah this was a
this is a gift that was made one of the
times the president came and visited so
i thought i'd share this and that's it
so i'd love to hear some questions and
really i'll answer anything to the best
of my ability so if there's any just
questions about generally the campaign
or technology or why I'm so good looking
yeah yeah so if it's something that I
can't answer i'll probably just say I
can't answer that or probably try and be
funny in the back
so the question is talking more about
practicing failure and iterative startup
culture um campaigns do not like
iteration they don't they are very used
to technology being launched or shipped
one time and so they would say ok when
is it going to be done and you would say
it's going to be done on the first and
they would say ok and then on the first
if it didn't fulfill what it needed to
do they just kind of throw it away and
be like once again technology has
us which is the thread of a lot of
technology and campaigns it's a very
difficult thing and I think it's just
because all of us who do technology
we're used to saying oh well it did
launch on the first but it also launched
on the second and the third and the
fourth and the fifth and the sixth all
through however many days you have and
so we launched very early with some of
our products specifically to get them
out because we knew that almost as a
little bit of a culture virus about
iteration that we knew that once it was
out there they had to react to it and I
don't know if you guys are familiar with
users but they're all and
they react much differently to software
when they actually see it then when they
when they were telling you what they
wanted and so we would often get these
specs that were basically this is what
we want we would build it and then they
would just say that isn't actually what
we wanted we want this other thing which
I'm sure happens every single day to all
of us all the time and so we just
released early we released often we did
a lot of conversations about what we
were trying to build the only thing that
we could do to solve any of these
problems was just ship the ship ship any
political problem we had we could ship
it away if we shipped good software
would disappear so now on the practice
failing part all we did was made sure
that every like I'll just tell you how
we did it so we just would create a menu
of all the things that we were going to
test we're going to test this without a
database we're going to test this
without DNS we're going to test this
without our cues our servers are all
going to disappear and then we just go
through each of them but Dylan Richard
who is my partner in crime in many of my
projects was it was a total Punk and he
would he rearranged it so
he gave out the menu and everyone was
like okay this is scheduled for today
and then he just changed it so they're
really two schedules they went through
the one that they had but then he was
 with stuff on the backend that
then they'd have to figure out what it
was and it was it was much like as much
like Dungeons and Dragons so we'd sit in
campfire and our DBA would be like or
one of us devops guys would be like a
DBA just dropped all the databases what
are you guys going to do and then they
would just be like oh and so they'd
go and have to do it and then he'd be
like amazon just went down and it was I
mean it was really funny so these two
guys basically played DM for our entire
engineering team practicing all these
doesn't scenarios and there's this idea
of tabletop exercises which apparently
is really popular to say in government I
think they do it too they don't just say
it and so when we said we're doing a
game day jim messina was like call it a
tabletop exercise so I was like we're
gonna do some tabletop exercises and
everyone's like oh that's very good yeah
it's a good idea and so that was a you
know and that was kind of that was that
yeah how would you guys do compares
dress
yeah so a funny story about Orca is in
2008 we had an app called Houdini away
so the question was how did what we did
compare and contrast to what the other
side did and then Orca do you guys know
what Orca is Orca is not a narwhal it is
apparently the main predator of narwhals
it's the only natural predator of
narwhals which the Republicans talked
about a lot in the before they lost
anyway so in 2008 there was an app that
we built called Houdini and Houdini went
down and crashed and never came back up
at 9am on Election Day it was the app
that was going to show us what was
happening in our in our polling places
and whether we were going to win or not
you know how we did win so it was fine
but um if we would have lost i think the
dialogue would have much been like orca
and so this is a hard app it's not total
it's not the most difficult app in the
world but it's not an easy out it's not
something you can just kind of make
quickly and so in 2012 we had a the same
app because you have to have this app
for pull counting and tracking of people
who are voting and we call it Gordon
because Gordon was the guy who killed
Houdini and we were like that dude
and so um we had Gordon Gordon worked
and then Orca was basically the
Republicans version of that and so it's
this really interesting that it went
down is the app that is goes down
apparently and it just sucks so compare
Orca which is a very small app that
everyone uses the count voters to
narwhal which is this giant concept idea
of having an API for every piece of data
and every interaction that you have and
a lot of business process management
stuff in there and we're just talking
apples to oranges but the press doesn't
really care and so they're just like
Narwhal killed Orca and we're like okay
well it didn't help us yes
I think there are some really can do as
an educator this is one of my big issues
so do people realize that computer
son Todd and
and also that girls need permission New
York unlike boys so a girl who's
interested in robotics will not a
robotics club but we'll take a robotics
class and everyone who knows me as an
educator knows I I really am against a
course in education but there are times
when having things and the formal
curriculum really really makes it
different
introducing kids who wouldn't
huge problem there's this talk in the
industry about the talent gap there's
this wreck
I think you illustrate it really vividly
they really concrete we can do the
school don't have a teacher computer
science in school because engineers make
way too much money in the industry but
there's something to really ask
ourselves with industry professionals
that we're also responsible for the
training of the new
thank you going back here your politics
doesn't like change slide one of the
biggest night sometime over the last two
days I've heard you remark that was
really important outside the washer I
wonder if you could sort of reflect a
little bit now my question is it's
important to move these things outside
of Washington and that's actually not my
thought at all I mean it isn't I believe
it but that's from I mean that's from
that's Barack Obama so he both his
campaigns were in Chicago and it was
specifically to be outside of the echo
chamber and be outside of where I don't
know this because I've never really I've
only been a legend in DC like 48 hours
in my life and but apparently it's a
terrible place and also they only care
it's a company town right so they're
what they're worried about what they're
interested in and it becomes this echo
chamber of oh my god this is the most
important thing and it's actually not
and so we see this all over we see this
in Silicon Valley that's about it i
guess a hollywood i'm suppose although i
haven't thought of it much but i think
it's important when you're especially
when you're trying to be innovative to
not go to the place where everyone else
is doing the exact same thing and so we
did not want to we were trying to not be
washington we were trying to you know
reelect a president that we thought was
going to be a great president not do
what the wonks wanted us to do and so if
playbook said something we didn't really
care now that's not true we obviously
cared but it wasn't that we were trying
to just follow and so Mussina has said
this a bunch and he had he said he's
much smarter than me on this topic and I
would let me listen to him and what the
president and Axelrod have said on this
but I think it's pretty telling that
both Mitt Romney's campaign and our
campaign we're not in Washington one
more
I was ready is there is your code base
open source could you talk a little bit
about the decision about how much
transparency to put into code developed
for a public campaign yeah and that
allure of this quasi public private
space so it's not quasi-public it's
private so that's I think something that
is a misnomer there is nothing public
about a campaign it's a private company
I mean I understand what you're saying
but legally the lawyers are like
whatever culturally so I personally
think that everything should be open
source and the reason I think that is
because everyone else will it up
somehow and it doesn't matter what
organization are talking about we have
purpose built software for a
presidential campaign like the next time
that will be used is in four years so
even if we have some organization that
holds it technology it rod of four years
is a lot and so we're not going to
there's not going to be an interesting
it's not going to be interesting in four
years and so I think if we open source
it now then all the people like us can
take it and apply the little bits of
technology to our organizations and say
oh well we don't necessarily need
Narwhal which has thousands of lines of
code and hundreds and hundreds and
endpoints we just need the thing that
does voter registration or whatever and
then using that and pushing that to the
the organizations that we think are
important now I don't know what's going
to happen with the code I'm waiting to
find out and I'll probably find out
through c-span more so then I'll find
out through my organization because
that's how it works apparently not that
I'm bitter and what I am excited about
and this is the question everyone asks
is won't the Republicans have it as well
and I think that's a really interesting
question because I'm not sure if you
remember but the Republicans hate women
and so since they hate women they're
still going to up technology until
they get a reasonable candidate and that
reasonable candidate is able to be
reasonable it doesn't matter what they
what technology they use they outspent
the out of us and they put crazy
ads up all over and the people were like
let's landslide him and so I think it's
it's very telling that the resources
don't matter is
much as the actual candidate and that
gave me a lot of hope now with that said
I still think open source I think that's
the only option I'm gonna be that's not
going to worry they're not going to do
that though I can go do this all day so
if anyone wants to just like we can go
talk somewhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
