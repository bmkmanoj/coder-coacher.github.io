hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
first I will thank you very much for
coming over tonight and we'd love to
have you here this is the first lecture
of the series of state of state of art
of technology and so we are going to
have in every month second month second
weekend second Tuesday evening around
six to seven pm over here and the 2g
this will be sponsored by different
society today we're going to have
internet things is like confused
consumer electronics and computers and
then we're going to have computer
society signal processing society and
each different aspect what's going on in
the world are most exciting things and
we have Pisa here and if you like at
some PSI and go to back and pick up the
pisa and then come back to to enjoy to
enjoy our lectures by that by jody not a
doctor no Joe Joe is being with the with
us for many many years and very active
was chairs was Airy chairs was various
different positions and pretty much is a
guru of Seattle section and he what he
become our new fellow 2015 and then so
congratulations to Joe
and he give distinct electro around the
world and the 20 kind wonderful things
on the governor the Board of Governors
for consumer electronics society it's
wonderful person but the thing that
we're most excited about is that we are
going to be chairing the global
humanitarian technology conference here
in Seattle this October yeah and it yet
Joe is our chair and Vice Chair this
year should share the following year and
so we were going to have a very big
event and all your of you will come to
join us in the conference and help out
volunteers get things good human hearing
technology area things started get very
active in Seattle and connect with the
world so please go to get your pizza and
come back here and then we were we were
here what Joe tell us today now is this
my clit yeah good yeah i might as well
introduce myself and keep going because
we have what 41 minutes all right you
heard the introduction the one thing i
would add to that is that i worked here
lucky me starting in the fall of two
thousand note 1992 and i retired after
eight years time off for good behavior
in two thousand so i want to talk about
some problems related to building the
Internet of Things and in particular i'm
going to describe a particular solution
that uses Bluetooth Low Energy I want to
talk about the problem to solve I want
to talk about the ways we are
considering connecting the low energy
world to the Internet and then various
ways to map that all through and then to
talk about what to do with this and how
it would work given the time I'm going
to be a little crisp
but I hope there's time for questions at
the end because if one of you is brave
enough to ask a question it's likely
that several of the others would like to
know the answer and that means you're
paying attention okay the first problem
to solve I'm a connectivity guy
currently and I'm interested in
connecting the low-energy world to the
Internet so today this is industry hype
you can hardly open up another magazine
article online hyping the Internet of
Things there are going to be probably
trillions of device of amounts of money
invested in this and uh my wife keeps
asking me who cares why would I care
about these things that I want to
pervade my house with how many of you
have seen recent and I mean the last two
days articles on the web about people
hacking into peoples cars anybody yes
several of you as an aside I work a lot
on security and I believe that security
for these things is a forethought not an
afterthought I believe that the security
the customers will shun any devices that
appeared to be leaking and if anyone
wants to kill this market quickly
they'll produce a lot of stuff that gets
act so to answer my wife's question I'd
say in this whole space somebody has to
come up with an application that would
get me to want to buy the device so for
example two years ago two and a half
years ago i bought a fitbit well that's
nice if i knew in advance that buying a
fitbit would allow me to lose 20 pounds
that's a sale but that's just an
attraction that doesn't mean it's what
it's actually going to do and you know
as you can imagine willpower matters
more than what this thing tells you but
that's just an example of the attraction
then i might use it if it actually
connects to the world my fitbit will
talk through low energy to my phone or
my iPad until fitbit com how i'm doing
or not doing and so it's starting to
accumulate in for me
to tell me gives me little electronic
rewards if I walk so many steps per day
etc etc a question to always ask is
where is the intelligence is it in the
device is it in something that you
control is it up in the cloud somewhere
and to pick an example you all know
because you know what the Kinect is that
the Kinect is something where there's
intelligence and the device staring at
you but there can also be intelligence
in the complete xbox and it can go up to
the cloud and back you know about
Cortana and you know about Siri which
record your voice and they can do voice
recognition and speech recognition based
on what you tell your cell phone and
that's where the intelligence is in the
cloud not in your hand right so always
ask yourself where is the intelligence
really and if the intelligence is not
where I can see it someone can get to it
and like I say you got to be able to
trust it otherwise people are going to
run away we may in fact some time have
people looking back and now as the good
old days before someone could hack my
car so the bluetooth sig where I work
for a living has identified three
different ways to connect low energy
devices to the internet depending on the
use case the first one is let's take an
existing device which doesn't know where
the rest of the intelligence is it's
just a what they call a generic
attribute protocol server and the
RESTful API allows the device going
through a gateway from anywhere to
attach to and control this device we
don't need to do anything different
outside of the gateway the second way is
if you have a really smart little client
app and you teach it about HTTP so you
can tell it to go through a gateway
through a proxy server to talk to the
Internet makes sense you all know what
proxy servers are right now maybe and
the third is to put ipv6 intelligence
directly in
vice and that's the subject of today's
conversation so I just walked through
these and this is sort of a picture this
is probably does not light up existing
stuff you can go through a gateway
that's restful does anyone here know
what i mean by talking about restful
some all of you who've been on the web
for the last almost a generation now
know what HTTP that appears in the URL
for a place you want to go right HTTP
stands for hypertext Transfer Protocol
and it is a restful design we're going
to do more of this going forward
stepping back i was describing if you
teach this thing to go back out through
a proxy to the web so for example a pair
of these things together they're
speaking native bluetooth low energy and
they can go out to the server first
punch a hole in the firewall which needs
to be there and explain to something out
here where they are third point is if i
put ipv6 or something other native IP
directly in the device in which case it
needs to talk through a border router
from clients and servers out on the web
here is what it might look like in your
house there are two common ways to find
internet access one of them is 3g and 4g
through your phone in your pocket or if
you've got some kind of broadband modem
cable dsl whatnot from an isp and you
again you need that firewall so you
don't get hacked and then you can talk
to a gateway in your house which is
doing the six cell border router to talk
to all these smart nodes in between this
is a good time to check for questions is
this a mysterious or does this make
sense
I've got 35 minutes okay so let's
suppose I want to connect these things
who here does not know what the Internet
Protocol is by now um it was such a
wonderful thing that we built it and
reconnected the world unfortunately the
people who designed the net Internet
Protocol were not aware of how popular
this was going to become so when they
designed it they had 32-bit addresses
which is four billion unique addresses
and that's no longer enough unique
addresses to address every living human
on the planet so if you're going to have
more than one gadget per person for sure
a ipv4 is not sufficient and we're in
imagining maybe in a nightmare tens of
devices per person and that means we
need a lot more bids so today to
function we have network address
translation we were working on network
address translation Microsoft 20 years
ago that's when a set of local devices
are mapped into an ass engl external
device and port addresses are used to
map particular functions inside the
protected Network to the outside and
yeah so ipv6 now has a huge address
space so to put in perspective 32 bits
is not enough to address every living
human on the planet 64 bits is enough to
address every living insect on the
planet if you can imagine how large that
is and 128 bits is that much larger so
if we've now defined a system that can
basically address anything then we've
got a foundation to start connecting to
all those devices we might conceivably
want to have
so ipv6 has a larger header and if you
want to adapt this to things that are
light you have to do some adjustments
otherwise you spend so much time on the
air just shipping me those 128-bit
addresses back and forth that you don't
have time to do anything useful so the
IETF internet Engineering Task Force has
been building a way of mapping ipv6 to
smaller devices their first target was
the 802 dot 15 dot for radio now to
translate that into English how many of
you ever heard of zigbee right that's
the radio it uses z-wave also uses that
radio there's a cable modem keyboard
control function that also uses 802 dot
15 dot 4 and originally their original
plan was to start porting this to a new
and interesting radio Bluetooth smart
low energy but the people from the
zigbee space said well we own why why
pan so they've just decided to name it
six lobe etle instead and this is a
decision that happened like three weeks
ago when the document it was in voting
so this is sort of hot off the press so
stepping back there's a technique for
adapting ipv6 to small devices it's been
done to the first radio it's now been
done in ballot for the second radio and
it's going to be applying also to
attitude about 15 radios and so on yes
ma'am I'm sort of in principle like
natty right so what's the big advantage
to having native ipv6 addresses you know
if you're doing some kind of a sub set
right and mapping it well what they do
basically in the border router you have
to compress the addresses to the nodes
and I didn't want to get deep into
exactly how 6lowpan works if that's
what's going on it's not the same as
natick it's
or a compression and then it's
technically different but your ego all
this trouble you know to get native ipv6
what's wrong with math you know why
would they it is ipv6 didn't exactly
it's an IP over full definition just
like IP over Ethernet ideally Wi-Fi all
right might be over 15 up for it's just
like that so that's a hotdog urban
there's no Maddie you know where to find
me so keep if i don't answer you enough
today we'll talk okay i'll give you a
card later um so as he was saying ipv6
over foo alright problems to solve first
of all connecting it to ipv6 and all
those giant addresses and all the other
functionality the topology the limited
package size because if you want these
radios to be small and cheap you don't
want to put you know has anyone looked
at the specifications for the newest
raspberry pi you know nice machine you
could run Windows 8 or Windows 10
Windows 10 is going to run on it right
that's way too much functionality to put
in a small cheap thing right we're
talking about things that probably have
16 or 32-bit processors they don't have
memory management they will have much
less than a quarter megabit of memory
and because if they get larger their
first of all going to consume a lot of
power because they're going to leak and
and then you'd start putting them into
lights because you have to put it in
something that's powered all the time
you have to do service discovery and you
have to do security that's just at the
top level list ok so the characteristics
are you want it to have a small packet
size if their large it's not low power
anymore you want to have shorten the mac
address you want to have low bandwidth
and low duty cycle you can support star
and you can support mesh does anybody
know what I mean when I talk about a
mesh good alright you're trying to keep
it low power meaning you want it to run
on a battery if not a coin cell
rather than being lines powered
obviously you want to cheap you want to
be able to support a lot of devices and
have a technique that supports a lot of
different things that are
distinguishable and groupable in some
way you want it to be ad hoc deployment
because our customers are not going to
be your corporate IT department your
corporate you're the people who deploy
this are going to be basically anyone
and we have to design systems that can
stand it to be installed by anyone you
want the devices sleep a lot to save
power and assuming that you have at best
a 32-bit processor but probably a 16 so
you want to compute what the border
router does is it looks at the first
packets that are hit that are sent in
and it recognizes things and it will
compress them so that on subsequent uses
their much shorter it's actually pretty
simple and then you compress the
subsequent packet headers as well
because you already can assume things
about what was done before but you still
have to do address resolution and you
still have to handle different kinds of
radios and the some applications will
have different applic ammeter to
optimize without a lot of time I'm not
going to get deep into that all right so
we SAT there in the bluetooth sig and
two and a half years ago the IETF came
to us and said hey can you give us the
foundation so we can put ipv6 in these
things and we said okay and being the
bluetooth sig we take twice as long as
we ought to be but we eventually finish
this was adopted in December so we want
to build new use cases there the market
for six Lawai panas expanding who is
heard of thread yeah okay there are more
than 100 companies and consortia who
think they're going to tell all of us
how the Internet of Things is going to
be wired up thread is one of them you'll
hear about more of them later people
have been putting 6lowpan into systems
for managing power today if I where's a
step back in a moment and say so what's
a smart house any ideas oh come on smart
house yeah yeah and have you mentioned
you I cuba's smart house some people
think a smart house saves them money on
power close enough and a lot of the
original applications of 6lowpan are in
that space some people like to have
their entertainment to follow them
around the house I'm not one of them
that's what DLNA is for some people want
better control of their security and
who's in the house and can I turn lights
on and off etc etc etc a lot of work is
being done in that space now and of
course some people like my dear wife
think that they want a house that takes
care of itself that not only will the
vacuum itself maybe I'll clean the
toilets I had to explain to her that
that's probably a ways off and it's more
of a physics problem than a
communications problem there is an
organization called internet protocol
for Smart Objects IPS oh it is closely
related to but not the same people as
the IETF internet engineering task force
and this presentation is about how to
hook together a system with a Bluetooth
radio using a particular profile talking
to six lobe etle talking to this that's
the stack so let's start with this smart
radio and in this design the ordinary
Bluetooth tools are used for finding and
connecting to a device from something in
the center but they're not used
thereafter there's a feature that's in
the second version of Bluetooth smart
called connection-oriented channels and
this design takes a connection oriental
sets it up with a minimum MTU of 112
hundred and eighty octets which is big
enough for your average IP
packet and lets it run and underneath
the upper stack allocated a fixed
channel and this is what it looks like
conceptually here's the the node it's
got the regular radio it's got the link
layer how many here have not heard of
the open systems interconnect model by
now good this is the multiplexer layer
these pieces you use to make a
connection but afterwards it runs that
stack in fact I need to fit I need to
change that because they just renamed it
I didn't catch it in all the places yeah
so here is a border router which
connects to ipv6 sources out here and
then connects them to all the child
devices so in regular bluetooth low
energy or smart today it's low energy
because it's designed to be very low
duty cycle it you know you can do a
transaction of advertising for attention
forming a connection getting a receiving
come in and turning off again in three
milliseconds how often do I need to turn
off the lights in this room maybe maybe
twice a day on and then off so if I'm
doing that the amount of actual
communications time is tiny and for a
lot of other things that you can imagine
in your house the actual time they're
going to be on very much beyond is over
the time when any changes occur those
are tiny compared to how long they're on
and that's how you can build things that
run on coin cells so ordinary package
sizes are 23 octets even a long
attribute is 512 octet so transferring a
long message it costs a lot of battery
time compared to three milliseconds
common internet protocol packets or
twelve eighty or they can be that large
so here's what the stack would look like
into inside a single Bluetooth device it
has access profile for finding things
profile and attribute protocol for
controlling things once you've found
them and the multiplexer the link layer
and the physical layer applications
profiles and services are what does this
thing do once I've decided what causes
me to want to buy this thing right I
didn't buy this thing because it has le
in it I bought it because it measures
something that I consider important so
the connection oriented channels is
we're now bypassing the simple
mechanisms for controlling things in a
device and going to something that's
less constrained in terms of how much
data can deliver to deliver it to
something that's beyond the scope of the
bluetooth sig yeah so instead of let's
suppose for example I have something I
can turn on and I can have a
characteristic that's that's simple
automation I oh and I write a one to it
or I write a zero to it in ordinary cat
and get that thing will take the single
transaction will probably take well
under a millisecond if I have to deliver
longer pieces of things that boil down
to turn the light on and off I'm
choosing to spend energy and other ways
just to have it a more general tech
method does that make sense at all okay
so we added long packets we made room
for this stuff and we let devices that
live up above the BTL the BTL a layer
decide whether to switch or do complex
any other action that we want so so why
would I want one
these things like I say there are
probably a hundred and fifty companies
or consortium to want to tell us how the
IOT is going to work and they're not all
correct because most of them will have
few followers you can classify them by
category IETF internet Engineering Task
Force we've already talked about all
seen is an organization that Microsoft
is a member of developing plumbing for
connecting devices MQTT and don't ask
where you cite all the names there are
automotive specific things as you've
seen there are people are wiring up cars
and then connecting to the internet god
help us there's healthcare has anyone
ever heard of ie i triple e 11 0 73 i
expect most of you have not but 11 0 73
is a set of I Triple E standards for
talking to health and sports and fitness
devices it defines what the data looks
like it was designed originally for the
convenience of organizations that right
the applications that use these
semantics and in the Bluetooth world
what we've done is wrapped all that
stuff up so that lots of these things
now speak that language or speak to a
translator that speaks that language
home automation big complicated space
today but we're trying to drive some
convergence industrial utilities and
smart grid so home automation the
organization i PSO has been building a
set of specifications of semantics for
how you talk to all these different
parts of a house and so the point of
course is that if i want to write a
bunch of applications how many of you
remember the history of computer
operating systems some of you should
write the applications writers are the
actual proxy for the end users the end
users are the ones who actually spend
the money on the product and the
applications writers want to have as
much common allegan as
possible of the things that they're
going to write too so they don't have to
write many different versions way back
in the mid to late 70s we started
building personal computers and the
people writing word processors had to
write a different printer driver for
every print different printer now see
for Microsoft came and other operating
system companies came along and
abstracted printing and abstracted
communications and all those other
things so the applications writers would
like to be less confused about what's
underneath the convergence I'm
interested in driving is convergence on
the models from my PSO because if I can
build systems that then translate to
that using things like all join then I
can attract those people and build
markets so I wanted to couple the
devices from the dedicated application
services right I talked about right into
a printer I don't want to have to deal
with a lot of different abstractions
that turn a light on and off it's always
an advantage in software development to
not have to reinvent wheels do it once
and test it I want operability across a
lot of machine-to-machine protocols
there are several examples that I will
quote later and before that can be
translated into the all join
connectivity system and I want the
developers of the applications end of
the end gadgets to concentrate on what
they're really good at and not having to
reinvent all the connectivity stuff in
between so these people have been
writing applications that run on top of
six low why pan in homes and with the
development of six lobe etle we can take
the same applications and run them on a
different radio basically and they use
something called co-op which is
constrained applications I think I've
got a slide on co-op know where is I had
a slot here I'll jump back and forth I
want to explain what co-op is you've all
heard of HD
TP co-op is designed for lightweight
stacks and uses UDP rather than TCP so
it doesn't count on the system
underneath it to keep track of reliable
delivery it just sends a message in what
then moves the timer's up to a different
level it's very similar to http in fact
it's kind of a subset of it and there
are no web browsers extensions that you
can get that speak to co-op so imagine
it may be the next version of internet
explorer might have an extension that
knows how to talk to these lightweight
home control things let me go back up so
these people decided to take the most
commonly accessed items 18 of them and
build what they call a starter kit and
so here's an example of a smart object
they've built models for how to talk to
a fridge how to talk to hvac and that
means heating vacuuming and air
conditioning controlling your house how
to talk to random digital inputs to
random actuators I'm not going to
explain the French stuff so specifically
it talks about general i/o generic
sensors how bright is it is somebody
nearby how warm is it how humid measure
power in some device what you want to
sometimes you want to measure what's the
load behind the power source you want to
control lights of course you want to
turn power on and off you want to
measure acceleration some things you
want to measure magnetic field sometimes
measure barometric pressure these are
things that are in the starter kit the
people developing them have actually
been working on probably a hundred
different devices and again if they're
doing such a good job of doing a hundred
devices I don't want to have to do it a
second time so to take just one example
drill into digital input
it wants to know the current state it
could have a counter so we can say how
long it's been in the current state you
can say what polarity it is I might want
to specify debounce period how many of
you have designed embedded systems where
you have to deal with what is called
debounce I see a few hands good I used
to work on video games 35 years ago
that's where I learned about debounce
that's why I'm a fellow and yes you have
to be very careful about how long people
are pushing the buttons and whether you
believe it or not you want to have edged
you can provide for edge detection you
can reset the counter that's keeping how
long it's been toggled and there can be
application types like people are
putting air pressure sensors in cars in
my car in fact I was driving around and
the sensor went on turns out it was a
sensor failure but it started telling me
that i had and air pressure problem in
my car we should get used to that
alright any questions about that before
I proceed because I don't want to run I
think I have enough time here is some
more detail on the things i showed you
before here's the radio part underneath
this is connection-oriented channels
then we start adapting that to the ipv6
then above it we put co-op which
generates UDP traffic and above there I
put something an application it's trying
to drive a smart object of any kind yeah
where would the lightweight and grim
transport oh well as a matter of
fact lightweight m2m maps directly into
IP smart objects I've got a copy of the
document and it's it's full of this
implements this thing in lightweight em
to him so it's an attempt to bring
everybody together good question I think
I went back to this already I should
move it to a different place in the next
slide deck so like I say there's a lot
of them trying to tell us how it's all
going to work
at CES show month and a half ago the
chief executive of Samsung which I serve
I'm sure all of you have heard of by now
he says that in two or three years
eighty percent of all Samsung's products
will be Internet enabled for internet of
things he says all the work on standards
has not succeeded so far we need help
please come we can't do this alone by
knew who he was I would write him a fan
letter because that's exactly the right
attitude right now and so he needs the
help of all the rest of us um there will
be Darwinian evolution thereof when you
have a lot of choices customers will be
attracted to something that might be
useful to them they'll keep it if it
connects to things that they care about
and then they will not throw it away if
they don't discover that it can't be
trusted um will support all these use
cases that I talked about above because
you know Microsoft may decide to take a
technique and bring it to one group and
CSR may take a technique to another
group nokia for example has been one of
the the people trying to drive IPS be
they'll take that into IETF they'll
spread it however they're going to
spread it the bluetooth sig itself is
not going to be telling us how this
works I think I looked at my favorite I
left out my best cartoons what I did
instead give you three slides worth of
references so I'm providing this so you
can go find all this stuff um so how IP
v4 and v6 work network address
translation where you can find the
engineering task force different kinds
of radios and that takes too much time
to explain it all I was talking about
health standards this is the I 11 0 73
um all seen Alliance is the group that
microsoft is a member of
machine-to-machine connectivity Open
Mobile Alliance yeah you or someone was
talking about lightweight m2m smart grid
is an i triple e standard for how to
control power usage in homes and there's
that starter pack so I invite any of you
if you want our curious about this stuff
to download that and see what it has to
say here's how to find me this is my own
computer I'd show you a couple of
cartoons one of them few years back
Dilbert had a cartoon where Dilbert boss
gives him something that's basically
Fitbit Dilbert is so excited that his
boss cares about his health but in the
last frame Dilbert and the cat arla
saying this guy is not breathing hard
enough we should give him some more work
get used to the fact that all kinds of
people can get access to your
information than they may not be
friendly at all the other cartoon that I
like it's about 15 years old now about
networking houses and refrigerators in
all this so the man comes into his
kitchen and his refrigerator has an eye
on it sort of like Hal 9000 and he says
Dave give me a beer and the refrigerator
says the scale in the bathroom is
reporting disturbing flab abnormalities
I can't do that and the guy saying I
don't want my equipment to be smarter
than I am but imagine someday our houses
will care about our health so much that
they'll be intervening constructively
all right you know where to find me yes
sir just described with the current
version is of Bluetooth and also we're
vegans for them making version features
okay apple head and some other companies
are making use of beacons beacons are
about where is something a Bluetooth
smart
server will generate advertisements
there are three channels that are chosen
to avoid all the Wi-Fi channels in the
2.4 gigahertz band and so a device will
be saying hey I'm here hey I'm here an
older version of that technology um
who's heard of docomo docomo is to Japan
what eighteen t is the United States so
docomo makes a whole lot of money off of
beacons and commercializing where things
are so they had this problem of years
back because they wanted to do indoor
location but GPS doesn't penetrate the
ground right shinjuku station in tokyo
is the largest train station and the
largest shopping center in the world and
docomo wanted to put beacons that would
radiate the message here's where you are
here's where you are here's where you
are and here's how low you are you are
so they could tell which stories you
were near and they would have a separate
record of what the specials were at this
store at this time so Apple has been
popularizing ibeacon but they didn't
invent it it was invented in Japan and
all they do is they take these things
stick them on the wall there powered by
light because the power is low enough
that they'll run basically forever on
the ambient light in this in that place
and they're programmed with their
location and all they do afterwards is
say I'm here I'm here I'm here I'm here
and they run forever they don't have to
be maintained just don't cover one with
paint let's stop working so the notion
of doing you know different device types
over IP over Bluetooth hmm seems to be
in some sense competing with the notion
of Bluetooth specific profiles they
don't have IP in the middle of it
exactly so how do you see the bluetooth
sig going forward you see that as being
a though continue doing that competing
you see that as it did and or how what
you see hooking in the future I don't
know how it's going to resolve but I
believe that there will be more than one
choice I in fact I am preparing to
make a proposal within the bluetooth sig
that what the bluetooth sig should do is
take the IP vso starter pack and create
exact cat equivalents for each of those
18 items because that means that if I'm
an applications writer and I want to
write to I PSO and it translates to a
gateway which is near a bunch of low
energy devices if they don't have I pnm
directly they can convert directly into
native at and get and drive the devices
and the devices will be lower power
because they'll be lighter but the
applications vendor still sees the same
thing I think that might be a winning
strategy actually but I have to convince
some other people to agree with me your
point is that they have to use the same
schema and Anna transport the same
semantics schema is a right word for it
oh there was hand hand i go i think it
was somebody before me but yeah oh um so
go ahead it's on been finding is a lot
of people expect hardware to be
commoditized and you don't make a lot of
money on it so they tie it into their
service and they figure the money give
me the service means the service so
you're working for open standards where
anybody service and anybody's device and
anybody's apfel work together I want
that the problem is is I'm finding like
wink for example which is available Home
Depot you were kind of open in a way you
can you know talk to us and our way but
everyone wants to own that cloud service
because they think that's where they
going to monetize that's right that's
right um because they want to hold on to
something that they control something
that's unique and you know I used to
work at Microsoft we wanted open
standards to apply to everyone except us
Pullman tation of the open standards
right well I 22 years ago I got away
with telling a joke to Bill Gates so
bill how many Microsoft engineers does
it take to screw in a light bulb he says
I don't know you tell me I said none
bill cuz you will declare darkness as
standard
he gave me good good stock options later
so it didn't piss him off too much well
all I see is a all these vertical stack
which frustrate me because I'm trying to
you know build out a smart house you
know myself you know to do these things
and you know my video system is
different but it's got its own stack my
alarm systems that don't stack my winx
got its own stack stuff i'm building is
i'll talk to anybody that gets use noche
ass but you know this is going to be
complicated for a while but to step back
so samsung is one of the has joined the
thread group and the thread group today
uses six low why pan and things that
look a lot like I PSO over them so i was
talking to samsung at CES a week and a
half month and a half ago and they said
oh yeah this one the only tested parts
are six slow wipe and today but we've
already got Bluetooth Low Energy get
into it and we're going to try to sort
it all out and make it open six low BTW
le also so that's the direction they're
headed in and they samsung will still
add some kind of proprietary value on
top of what they do and that's okay
because people want to have a profit
motive I mean that's what pays for this
building amongst other things but they
will that the boundaries of what's
proprietary and what's public will get
pushed back I would suggest that in this
space some of the winners will be the
ones that are more open than the ones
that are less open because the ones that
are more open can attract more support
microsoft learned that big time decades
ago okay bill joy who was a college
buddy of mine said you should design
your company on the assumption that not
all the smart people in the world work
for you and so they built and not an
open source but they built an open API
windows system and working with intel
they built the pc industry which still
has life in it and when I look around
the war
old the people who have at least open
api's if not open source attract more
support and um you all know the success
of Linux and you might know that all
joint is built on remote procedure calls
in Linux so it's going to attract people
to add value on top of it okay and you
kind of mentioned it in one of your
former slides that Wi-Fi has to the 11 p
I remember oh um true there is in
development okay go to being sick slow
system over 82 to 11 as well okay so how
do you see the future of coexistence
between well if the applications are
disconnected from what the radio is it's
better for the applications and so there
are some applications for which I'd say
Wi-Fi is a better use than a 215 dot for
or BTW le anything that needs a lot of
data or that needs the 100-plus meter
range then yes you want to use that and
if the same 6 low ipv6 system lives over
all these radios that's attractive to me
as an implementer and it's attractive to
me as someone's trying to build a system
that meets actual market needs does that
make sense speaking of which um another
friend of mine who is also a
distinguished lecture in the consumer
electronics society wants to come out
here and talk about his ideas about home
networking and whatnot and I would like
to know who I should connect Bob
frankston to hear any volunteers anybody
who's works on this stuff here at
Microsoft I'll send him to you you know
the financial industry went through a
very similar thing trying to West
standardize the communication between
banks and so on mm-hmm they finally went
to edit fact yeah
yeah that's pretty much the
international standard now yeah there
was a lot of basic principles that are
completely missing from what I see here
the whole concept that has the protocol
advances you send that a code which
tells you which version you're using and
you backward compatible so it's possible
to upgrade the parties in the system not
a pretty good system does that affect do
this also yes that standard consumer I
mean standard um computer design if ipv6
he'll have compressed addresses much of
the complexity this tougher disappeared
with them well it's the complexity
appears briefly when things are found
and connected the six low border router
recognizes what happens when things are
first discovered and hooked up and
thereafter things are compressed does
that make sense so it occurs
infrequently if it had to happen in
every single transaction would be a much
bigger cost and it wouldn't save you
anything at all so that makes sense the
deal with the whole IP address for your
configure again after that right that's
correct so it's still it's it's a
lossless compression if you understand
the difference between bed and lossy
compression oh you president heard the I
teach computers 1620s and 1401 since
Allah it had a variable-length number
and there was never had to hold this
lattice it could be because there's no
limit and if they went to a coding
system like that uh you wouldn't have
these issues except that if you send too
big of an address you run out of memory
or something a lot of the routing it's
done in the internet is done by really
optimized fast hardware and that
optimize fast hardware knows about 32
bit and 128 bit addresses and not a lot
of variability in between um yeah I can
see building all that out of plane
transistors yes you still got the paper
or 64 all right yeah
another question I have two questions if
I may jo one will thread support IP
smart objects and two is the OMA device
management a smart object yes okay um in
reverse order um there are explicit
references in IPS 040 mi lightweight m2m
and that's why all those are listed in
the references and the fourth is I have
found the people that are working on the
thread stuff for samsung and I'm trying
to find out from them whether they're
planning to use I PSO or not and the
answer is I have no idea I'm trying to
wait for them to get caught up in their
email um you probably see uh I'm Sunday
night there was 60 minutes and then
lastly store was in the car and they act
so she's a choice he couldn't stop her
brakes it can be a big liability is
there some way we can build in to have a
securities nobody can happy to put these
are your houses that will get opened up
doors are being opened before lots of
this deal gets extracted I mean take a
car and connect it to the Internet
that's a door with the question then is
where the locks one of the comments that
there was made because I saw the same 60
minutes is that the manufacturers differ
in how they handle that and i would say
at this point if i was going to go buy a
new car i would ask them how they
control this now and i wouldn't buy the
car if they didn't have controls built
in inherently insecure duh yes no i I've
been talking about nobody wants their
body hacked and nobody wants their house
hacked and this is an example of nobody
wants the car hacked either I mean we've
been connected for well right many of
you are familiar with
onstar by now so you've had at least a 2
G level connection to General Motors for
a long time if you've had one of those
cars and in advantages you get locked
out you leave your keys in there you
call OnStar and they unlock them for you
they can tell when your car is being
stolen and they can cause it to slow
down and come to a stop remotely if it's
been stolen that's a nice feature that's
something that attracts people but the
door is open as soon as they Internet
connected it to anything now i'm
guessing that the OnStar system is GM
proprietary and not an open system so
that there's no way directly for hackers
to get into your car but people are now
starting to connect you know 4G to your
car and then Wi-Fi within your car which
means it's now got the door open right
and I I don't know exactly how they're
going to solve it but like I say I'd be
asked them this question in the showroom
floor oh crap yeah sometimes is strike
with that co episode pulling backwards
in a way I mean I PV the women of the
reason why I 15 a foreigner other radio
technologies have adopted at paysage
presumably is because thought people
know it is it's the common language
upstairs a common language is HTTP
there's a new version of it have you
heard as you probably talked to a lot of
people who are very interested at that
layer have you heard of people saying
well rather than co-op we'd rather use
HTTP to which well or five um the when I
was mentioning the ways that the
bluetooth sig has the first way is HTTP
and a restful api that takes um if you
build a browser with particular
capabilities and explain it to it
basically how to drive a bluetooth low
energy device directly it converts those
things into HTTP gets and puts sends
them to the gateway which then converts
them into native stuff when i was
talking earlier about how I would deal
with the conflict between IPS over
native GAD what we would wind up doing
is building basically the get restful
api version of those native things so
from the far end point they look the
same but they're lower power lighter at
the far end I think I got distracted but
yeah we're working around HTTP now as
well as co-op now but I did put up there
is I've written several articles on the
subject and there's another one that's
going to be published in april and it's
basically this presentation and it's got
a lot more references is that good
enough answer alright thank you for
hosting me here cards if anybody wants
to find me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
