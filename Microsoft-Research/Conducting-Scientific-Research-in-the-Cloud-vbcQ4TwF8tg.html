you
everyone my pressure to be here to share
some my research experience of
ammunition actually I'm not an actor
come on computing and just beautiful
compact my research in vision
accountable unfortunately my name is
Lynn Leah Tom and come from Sonia
university 02 and the top of the days
our distributable is to be leader v2
model anything for large scale on the
recognition of QE first of we are
talking about big data everything now
email we should probably not more syrupy
exam 0066 billions photos uploaded every
day of to the freakers and perhaps 50 72
hours per minute in youtube and today we
are one morning 1 billion smartphone
users we capture bottom enemies sao
paulo right now all process of a MV data
one of repeat technica tease through
object recognition although involved
involves among business opportunities
such as our intelligence surveillance
robotics and mobile applications and so
it's on our today's not a special book
shop on the provision of mr. learning so
plainly are free we go through a
background motivation of them on my
research
and then I we are both on how to act
back to them a committee no ultra model
for an Asian enough to go to the system
oh i got an--oh people here 39 different
research paper on selecting those 2 step
I'd time but let me introduce our mom
probably the fader fader own visual
recognition now for the other motive of
Famer they are based in research first
days the count at 11 and now is the time
image from mi chiamo are 18 8 million
images they love Oscar will be quite a
change for of the recognition and
another wise up we love is well known
now image next to have a command
thousand thousand images so we'll see
how to conduct research always kind of
very much then a prickly there are four
times more at each other to conductor of
the recognition in Division the first
place image processing just like I
imagined annoying enhancement fact is
then the second temple very important
sorry that is we need to extract a lot
our pictures through present for images
then person one we need to perform
pulling up going to get a compact image
orientation along with into a contractor
or tomorrow
Christopher education as an example you
so give the image here we can fly the
 window over the image and judgment
to make decision violin shop window
included offshore we are interested then
please our model where host them
monitors championship first we are also
go to the other two stands in the time
erection about the mobile imitation on
if you're doing some research image
analysis ovation I guess material
knowledge Colonel features of excessive
hecho de Campo images like this let this
bitch i use to extract demerits for
involving information for images to
represent a pattern ok Arthur Stan
Korean employees are well known both
famous object are even reputation is
better world model I always be Q coming
originally proposed by providing a my
cheek and then extended by the way from
assemble the key is to hold this to the
bone pastoring on the image passion and
the Jared a set of fictional so visual
words we call they were going to
represent each images yourself she's
already my name is eating cookies with
the road to the world then without
limitation of the diabolic took a
special information wait wait not so
special criminal colonel what about to
extract feature from a different scale
the image coming so again the
protonation may be more present
that one report our favorite techniques
for sorry I'm pulling is a fuckery is it
feel very hard face further originally
transcoding proposed to replace the
original vision was conference fight by
owning a DVD package wiggler and so we
wait for your image conscious then
they'll matter has been extended by are
hiding 2002 it readily to after Inland
Fisheries and are they holding divisions
and I just go through some you know some
details it will be interesting photo
paper ok the last art snap oh we need to
counter this particle very powerful
model two suitors presentations around
sweet i was thinkin model in first
internship whole take linear model and
the kernel oil under the minimum the
linear model very traditional Island we
use and many years ago the bacardi
discriminant function and with the u.s.
to be wise man when you to attract the
teachers and a total sample which are no
they are labeled politic own actions
they wait Leonard is from any function
to predict in a chain they are the basic
assumption for linear model is assume
plan attend a nonlinear secreto actually
not all 65 in rehabilitation so we will
know
function friendly have no family
functions the living promise of a
procedure to minimize the risk of facing
arrow sailor traditional linear Morris
up the SVM I think I guess most people
either they experience to be not
function in the dark experiments in this
room I just ain't anger changelog is not
killable rival no hierarchical structure
simple watch on a lot of Icarus II i
received another popular mar is tomorrow
the for example women in her eyes it's
been lost function here by introduce
some i'm talking like accounting
punching they had way I expand a power I
didn't pour alcohol tomorrow too hahaha
very high and each one teach a safe and
sound hope you will kind of function a
starting modulator perfection techniques
are we are vice the problem is the main
are they may not be very suitable for
big data obviously white what were the
reason nail the son type of people are
committing the model also waking Conan
having model they are abandoned oriental
is to divide by vitac horrible model for
recognition I will take a example for
your strange why we live in Panama I
referred to find a word for
technical details here example he will
have a twinge lucky I see for a whole
the category of hope will a portion come
back panel and object rattles baby there
are local ease that are very appearance
belies for them all different types of
legs different type of hat so maybe one
people can fire you know we will handle
the purest wearing so we need to go I
Sparkle eyes cannot be paralyzed it's
really insistent so we need to compose a
model in your box and to represent late
p for more spatial information in this
model we need we have sweet Slayer
structures processes and not who knows
close to agent Monica application the
second layer is our include a note to
catify option as at home then the third
letter oh no structure enables to switch
with infra local gunfire to file of your
parts and also with the dig know itself
look is a local detective to clockwise
of Japan st. although we need to
incorporate a space you're constantly
relationships between party so as a
tickle for a combo for all over it
compact model then cheering and is just
how to the time and it distributed list
of the deploy moment or destroy
resistance we we take it is we simplify
on the model for example typically are
three components in model part HRG
feature and later I am
and freaking some engler time accounting
of the applications of reaction term
different research traditional SVM the
Fourth Estate happens to represent 11
appearance burns for object then the
second 10 is a key our borrowed it to
import a cobra and the spatial
information structure information here
and so well one this is the additional
tool of structure actually original SPM
so we call them smaller is late and
saturation so for example that they are
the poster is to represent appearance
information I love slip your hand if you
move on e to the land grant is Ellen
second stage return is talking operator
they are structured their deformation
they all lay off spatial layout
faculties then we can connect other and
then so we can assume i find provide the
smaller in this book Anthony's the beta
because you know the model parameter
franchini analyst I sink rate it up I
will present a lot features another
structure information is easily know
grammar actually so the progress are
become another or compatible when he
talked we put in 20 miles the study
found until there are two parts further
the better our model parameters is
worried to find a traditional I swear
the other ones that they know where I
was lead to denoting a structure
computerization of options for Newton's
so let me tell your properties for it
come to know expected because we need to
ice may receive for each example for
example once we have the Sultan's
absolving trainees and hope for large
scale of traffic issues may we need to
add tomatoes evil Pichon sample so and
why we need a
for this problem Phillip naturally notes
from function be coming in this book is
restarting well one with estimated us
account computing las prediction
function we need two of two big wire
activated a late arrival so the
procedure of Medici they seem campaign
to that the iteration first take better
there for each Chinese I'm hope riggan
on my better we operate an ism for our
traditional organization method Egyptian
they feel we were not where is
comfortable for a general solution Olin
is very different it can be used either
Windows Azure or other computing
architecture what we will prevent a toy
example here to demonstrate our system
when we take the example of a
possibility 12,000 their arms they are
wrong 10,000 training samples and 20 of
the copies here we use our 100 computers
to share two new models I know that here
computers can be agreeable should own a
virtual machine on patient interaction
data are really in this computer and
each of them store one training images
example we regular computers from 120
here we call ready 1 2 20 yrs our
managers are we use them to update
models forecast one two fifties and
representative
and handle all of template's our
preparation they were predatory 1 to 100
computer-based workers so at least a
wooden handle I used to handle
corporations are fine by managers for
english english extrusions bring one to
20 and the rest of machines and 20 up
tomorrow so in all computers no
commitments as need for college and the
tool introduced of the messaging tax our
first pic bet that the late arrival to
determine the structure configuration
for each training samples subscribe to
to optimize data will some gradient
descent factors other of messaging I
reason further we know the for long but
then one was worried especially
computing because for you to the
activator for each training some of your
way paralyzed paralyzed step one for
each motion we perform a detection on
them only 100 samples stoking it with
the model then we collect the detection
result and it listening that all feature
extraction and a confrontation function
the picture detective where model I seem
all computers actions for to the rain
biking children which ones for the
potential regard for the outlet machine
tool of managers so it's full of magic
among the transformation of our managers
in fact to type of ominous practical
where decent languages
ren 12 20 computers for rent I am buta
the model parameters for car finally
something model is sent back to another
99 computers like this as you are we are
paid model together compare okay um
football the time of all churning a
borrowing a single machine is a run for
me to 30 hours it basically depends on
the positive example numbers or hardwell
attention for our timing for the chain
any model industry with these things
around 10 hours interesting with all the
increase the improvement is not very
functional averaging through such
precision are almost the same with
anything we don't we don't know any
accuracy in a model for 20 categories a
parameter single forever almost the same
precision the point so what's the
bottleneck in a system obviously it's
not a very awesome fun ago we bothered
or mega other so catchy the created this
and that means the SEC step 2 we don't
we don't terrorize the SEC too
impractical as that'll be called so
because of the attribute of the
algorithm you cannot be paralyzed amore
so many of these solutions we use the
finale or my attention algorithm that is
Hanover Newton organization so in that
to replace love the
you know Sgt we wait with doing our poet
example year we found the time cost in
each iteration for the Newton air feat
fgs is large name as GD as he needs to
computer the creator for all samples ah
this area is a used an iteration to get
a better solution estd accumulation for
credit can be terrorists she goes away
computer operator for all animals so how
good was then we were in turn back the
final are distributed citizens into four
texts first we are for each computer
with camera the gradient of resemble
pictures then we could practice gradient
the gradient Iranian way our model I in
all computers actions for equilibrium I
computer any step say this the step 3
for a bite of your data model parameters
for class I are updated each more update
the model name came back to the other 99
to attrition actually unfortunately I
cannot recall the final result in
services young ending because of a
divine person in two ways so when it's
very unprofessional improve efficiencies
Liza approximately 100 times faster over
this fury system of 104 stations as go
insane okay I don't know that's all any
question
time to question our party questions yes
I'm curious about the rhythm we're going
to talk about I'm just wondering what
kind of amusing to paralyzer Camilla
looming well we ended this one I think
in each iteration you think I know
complicated but no next one next month
yeah I'm sorry Ichigo issue you have
this communication strategies master
Alton's not so worried what kind of our
computing promotes a porn are we also
now reduced to the sea view is memory
using which we see each iteration you
will reschedule the job at hand right
now okay I think member so called for
any calls you saw in a new memory yeah
yeah we are trying or undercook it yeah
other questions so everybody I really
want to thank our speakers they've all
these all been very very interesting as
I said before these are people that we
gave the resources eight nine months ago
and so these projects aren't just
getting started tomorrow us over to the
microsoft research building will see
signals there and so
that's interesting and so I really want
to thank everybody gets really please
help me thank our three speakers again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
