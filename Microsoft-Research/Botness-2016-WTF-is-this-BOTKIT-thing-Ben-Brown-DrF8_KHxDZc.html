Dan just said like none of no one of the
tools that you will probably see today
or any of the things that we've built is
like the comprehensive solution this is
going to be something that you have to
compose your own solution for so
definitely like try all these different
things different approaches so I'm going
to just talk really quick about bot kit
the thing that by built and is powering
some of the more successful bots out
there right now i'm ben Brown I run how
da I it's a slack bot and bot building
tool this is a quote that I made up you
know BOTS should be making but should be
fun and easy and not not too technical I
think that that's you know important
thing like the people who build bots are
not all going to be hard core software
engineers or AI people they're coming
from web development or mobile app
development and things like that so you
know I you know and I think we have an
opportunity for to sort of improve the
way these things are made so that's why
we built bought kid you know I just want
lots of bots out there I want bots to be
ubiquitous sohbat kit you know really
what we look we focus on with pocket is
like can you get your bot up online on
slack or on facebook or on you know
twilio or kick and things like that very
very quickly so you're talking to your
like magical you know robot friend like
that's the the coolest thing that you
can do and I think we're fairly
successful we get tweets like this all
the time like you know you know this guy
they had it just just started coding and
he's like two months in using bot kit
you know building building bots you know
people are like saying like oh I have so
much fun doing this stuff like it's a
JavaScript framework you know these
people are at that they're talking about
their having have fun and then there's
like tons and tons of stuff out on
medium and all over the place that are
like example apps in bot kit and like
how to do bot kit stuff so there's a lot
a lot of resources out there already for
pocket so you can build box right now
with for slack facebook and twitter IP
messaging and here's hear the details so
you can just npm install bot kit you can
get you can clone it from github there's
a ton of example code in the repo that
will like literally
you just get a token from slack run this
app it's online same thing for facebook
and twitter so this is how we how we
basically boil it down right BOTS do
basically three things they hear
triggers that could be like a pattern or
it could be an event or can be you know
a file being uploaded they reply to
messages so simple replies like I say hi
the bot says hi and then they conduct
conversations you know multiple messages
questions and questions and answers
going back and forth so you know to do
that you know it seems fairly simple but
like to do that you have to do all of
these things before your bot comes
online right and each platform is very
slightly different and kind of a pain in
many ways to get these things started
for example twilio has like five
different API tokens that you need to
get before you can you know get your
thing online you have to configure all
the stuff blah blah blah so vodka takes
care of all that stuff you know it
provides the web server it provides the
web hook end point it does the OAuth it
does the dealings with the api's it
provides tools for pattern matching it
has plugins to tie into you know wit da
I and Lewis and API de AI for natural
language it does all that stuff and sort
of moves it into the background so the
developer can focus on you know building
a user experience and building you know
application that they want to build so
this is like a hello world bot kit app
and this is like the most verbose
setting because this is twilio with his
five keys so like that's all of the code
you run this app it's online it's
talking to twilio and sending receiving
messages just a hello world thing here
but you know you can see that it's it's
fairly straightforward and and like so
I'm just going to dive into a couple of
these little things so BOTS but like I
said BOTS hear things so in in bot kid
we have a here's function and you pass
in the thing that it hears and that can
be a set of patterns it can be intense
that you want to match it can be any any
matter of things and then there's the
second parameter there is like what type
of message
is so message received is basically any
message you can also have like in slack
you could have a direct message you
could have a mention like at BOTS so and
so you can have things like ambient
messages which are messages that are not
directly to the bot and that's it so you
build your here's pattern and now the
bot is going to respond to those things
you see none of the other messages that
don't match these patterns you don't
have to deal with them which is
particularly important in slackware you
receive a fire hose of messages so oh
and then so there you can see reply so
the bot replies to that message right so
I somebody said something and the bot
says got it in this example very very
simple here's an example of this
conversation so a message comes in same
thing right somebody said something and
we're going to start a conversation say
oh hello what is your name and there's a
asked function so what does that do it
like sends the message and then waits
for the person to respond and instead of
having to deal with that response and
connect it yourself to the question that
you asked for of many of the same people
who organized this are involved in our
event call talk about it's a two-day a
series of talks from bot makers and
people who are enthusiastic about bots
and a day of workshops where we're going
to get really really technical about
this stuff we have some super awesome
speakers including the founders of
active buddy which are which was about
from the early aughts one of whom is
going to be here today people from
purple people from pull-string Darius
Kazemi who's a Twitter bot maker and you
know about 15 other people and we'd love
to if you guys want to talk talk to me
we have a submission form on our website
talk about AI that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
