make science fiction into science fact
the journey we started with Kinect could
not have been possible without the
amazing partnership with Microsoft
Research you cannot create a great
product a breakthrough product by
accident kinect was a consequence of
years of investment by microsoft in a
way kinect had an infinite amount of
miracles that needed to happen for us to
bring this product to market there's
three technical pillars that have made
the the same point intuitive experiences
of Kinect possible and it really is
about voice recognition it's about
identity recognitions about human
trafficking within each one of those
categories there is a myriad of
improbable things that we had to make
possible we knew that the challenge is
in Norma's pretty much there was no way
to over-design the digital signal
processing chain the microphones the
electronics everything had to be
squeezed to the max who will be made to
perform the best we had the technologies
at the beginning but making them work
together as a pipeline and to have
influenced performance was the biggest
challenge in research sometimes you work
on offense that you actually don't know
where are the applications core
technology that we are focusing on is
tracking also your identity we want a
computer to be able to recognize you and
continue tracking you we developed a
software system technology that combines
three factors your face and the clothes
you're wearing and your height to
determine whether this is it the same
player enable immersive gaming you have
to be able to track the body in
real-time and moreover we needed to
leave some of the computing resources
available to game designers to write
their games I've been working on this
problem of extracting 3d body position
from video why
and the Xbox team contacted us saying
they wanted to solve the problem of
human body tracking we didn't then know
what techniques we were going to use to
solve it but one thing I knew from my
previous experience was that we were
going to need lots and lots of training
data lots and lots of example images
that could train the system or even
ultimately test the system I was
involved in the human body tracking part
of the system so that it can turn you
into an avatar or interpret your body
motions as gestures to control the game
this is a highly resource constrained
machine learning problem we need to make
this work for children for adults for
Jamie people to know gaming people to
one person to two people two males two
females to people with beers two people
have had some people with dreadlocks
this is performing a state-of-the-art
signal processing operation on what
comparatively is very limited computer
hardware beyond broadening the audience
for gaming Connect is already starting
to open up exciting new avenues in
telepresence in robotics in healthcare
Microsoft is really looking at the
future of computer human interaction
away from just the mouse and keyboard
into a domain where anyone can interact
computers at any time computers
obviously thanks the Moore's law of
fabulously powerful now we're seeing the
things that we're just unthinkable even
five years ago are now feasible we just
scratching the surface Microsoft
researchers approach to innovation of
doing blue skies research just because
it's difficult will always lead to great
advances in the way the ordinary people
interact with computers in the world the
incredible partnership between the
connect team and microsoft research has
allowed us to make tomorrow happen today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
