big challenges among them is the desire
to really launch a career research and
yet they have to spend so much time
seeking outside funding that they spend
more time looking for funding than they
spend looking for actual research topics
the faculty fellowship program allows
them to really focus on their research
rather than on seeking funds in those
critical early years after Princeton I
went to Caltech for my PhD I was in the
electrical engineering department my
research focus was in computer vision
artificial intelligence and
computational neuroscience I received
the Microsoft research faculty
fellowship award in 2006 the Microsoft
faculty fellowship was very helpful in
funding me to explore risky and early
projects that would not have been
supported otherwise in my case it was
the image net project along with others
the image net project is a massive
dataset collection and research project
in computer vision and AI our research
in computer vision will have huge impact
down the road in visual image search in
digital data indexing and management in
robotic navigation and interaction with
humans
Juan Carlos Nieves was my very first PhD
student he joined my lab when I was a
very young faculty and we worked
together for more than five years after
Juan Carlos very successful PhD he went
back to his home country Columbia to
become an assistant professor I was
selected a microsecond faculty fellow
back in 2012 the fellowship is very
interesting because it highlights new
researchers in the field that have
potential to develop new ideas that can
lead the community to move forward in
the science I believe student Juan
Carlos surprised us by being selected in
twelve he came through our
latin-american part of the program and
he was nominated by universities in
Latin America and at the time we didn't
even recognize that he would stay faily
student the fellowship definitely helps
in multiple dimensions one of them is it
allows my work to be exposed to a wider
community wider computer science
community also as a mentor it helps my
students to get inspired as well to
pursue their own ideas and research
agenda and also from research
perspective it helped me to pursue new
ideas new risky ideas that we wouldn't
always be able to pursue I'm very proud
of whom Carlos he's one of the
trailblazers in Colombia who are doing
modern computer vision and artificial
intelligence research and mentoring the
future generations of students in that
field of study in Colombia having a
significant amount of funding with no
strings attached allows an early career
researcher to really follow courageously
the path that their research leads them
the Microsoft faculty fellowship has
played a very positive role in our
research community it recognizes the
young rising stars of computer science
research it provides early and critical
funding to this young faculty especially
for their exploratory research projects
and it opens up collaboration
opportunities with Microsoft researchers
I personally feel very honored that I
was selected as a fellow and it's great
to be among this Mis group
each year Microsoft Research helps
hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
