and for 15 years thereafter we
successfully grew larvae billions of
larvae every year without having to
monitor the sea water the first time I
heard ocean acidification discussed was
probably around 2007 as we were trying
to understand what was causing these
mortalities in the hatchery and it was
around 2008 or so that the failures
happened more regularly than the
successes and this whole issue came into
focus for us addressing carbon pollution
is not a small thing in our industry
isn't going to do it by ourselves
live ocean is one of the things that the
Washington State Legislature funded in
order to try to help voice to growers in
the state deal with ocean acidification
it's just like the weather forecast that
you got on your phone has a big
sophisticated numerical model behind it
predicting things out a few days into
the future and live ocean does exactly
that same thing for the ocean the main
guts of it are built with Python that's
and that's sort of a glue language for
the architecture main model runs on a
Linux cluster and then those systems can
speak freely and push files up to Azure
working with Azure has enabled me to do
more and faster specifically with the
the outreach part of this project that
is it's separated and made available all
the output in ways that would have been
hard for me to do on my own
just to describe ocean acidification
fairly complicated and a lot of people
don't really have an intuitive sense for
it I think data portals and models like
live ocean can really make that bridge
because even if people don't understand
the chemistry they look at the color
coding and they'll see how that changes
with location season and they'll they'll
get a sense that it's real and that
they're connected to that
I would like for people to be able to
access the live ocean output for many
different portals and develop if they
want to their own websites that use it
for in different ways that's something
that's going to be enabled by asher is
sort of spreading out the information in
ways that I didn't foresee you know that
the information we're getting from live
ocean and the prediction of these
different ocean acidification events is
important for policy makers and for
scientists so we get a better picture of
just exactly how the seawater chemistry
is changing over time you know again
from a management standpoint how to
manage our different operations around
these corrosive water events
what's so exciting about live ocean is
it is uniquely addressing the ocean
acidification variables that's a
breakthrough that's something that's new
that's something that we don't have
another model currently that's really
addressing that
