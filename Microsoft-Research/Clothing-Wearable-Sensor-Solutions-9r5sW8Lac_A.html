lectures freely available
you
hi everyone thank you for coming today
for our presentation on wearable
technologies and soft sensors I am
thrilled to be presenting to you excel
ear a hoe he is the CEO of clothing plus
a finished company his company has been
researching and developing soft sound
soft sensor technologies for the last 15
years so today he's going to present to
you some of the work that they've been
doing so I'll give you Excel II thank
you yeah
my name is axel eraill and I'm very
happy to see that so many of you are
here so listen this story what I have in
my mind so first a big picture how we
how we see the market it was about ten
years ago when we last time saw
increasing activity around the wearables
there was a company's called Philips
Levi's France Telecom and many others
kind of excited about this opportunity
but on that time 10 years ago actually
the bubble exploded and the business
almost vanished now we are seeing the
same thing increasing activity lots of
news loss lots of press releases even
product launches are happening and we
are happy to see that the majority of
the concepts that are behind the
launches and and presentations are more
user orientated are more based on the
real needs and the real behavior and
even on top of that I'm happy to see
that the technology that is behind that
that the launches are far more mature
than it was 10 years ago I would say
that 10 years ago every everything that
was launched was completely unable to
fit on the whip washing
for example at the moment when we when
we see the lawns when we see that see
the activities everything is washable
and many other logistical things
price-sensitive eating's has been has
been built from the different approaches
so we believe that we are we're
absolutely happy that the activity in
this space is increasing but we are
somehow very confident that this time
this will fly briefly how we see the
market first of all we see the e textile
applications there is a thermal things
there can be a therapy or treatment
there can be actually the heating and
cooling functions there can be a
feedback functions a lightening
illumination is another application area
it can be an indicator it can be a
visual feedback it can be there it can
be the communication what do you want to
say by your clothing it can be made with
that with the illumination effects then
there's a haptic world where where the
different kind of user interfaces are
built on top of the a textile and
wearable thinking there can be switches
there can be game controllers there can
be a massage therapy things and then the
fourth main application area it's the
sensors so there is a lots of
application areas where where the
sensors can be used but the bottom line
is that you do the sensing through the
wearable and textile like materials how
is the how is the market so where these
applications are used there's clearly a
safety and professional market out there
which is using these applications
there's a fitness and wellness there is
this infotainment market and health and
medical market
and actually wear a clothing plus sees
the most of the fruitful and meaningful
applications or launches happening at
the moment they have something to do
with the sensors and they fit on these
two markets of course we are looking
looking the other opportunities as well
but we as a clothing plus small still
small company we have to be very careful
to follow the real market behavior and
commercial activities so these green
boxes highlights the area where clothing
Plus is very active so our vision is to
make comfortable wearable electronics
and we feel that by approaching this
vision through the textiles we have an
extremely nice material enhance
because textile is very comfortable
material so if we are able to integrate
the sensors for example into the textile
material we are almost in field of
comfortability comfortability
immediately so we see that by
approaching this with textiles we are
there and when we are focusing on on
sensing we feel that all the wearables
all clothing related all accessories
related things kind of offers very
natural platform for doing sensing and
especially when we think about for
example the clothes the textile textile
material based clothes we immediately
understand that we get a bit pretty
fruitful information base to integrate
the sensor since we are in touch with
the textiles no matter are we sleeping
running working we are in touch with the
textiles or with a very large area and
there is even textiles there is even
pieces of clothing and pieces of
accessories that
or in very tight tight connection with
the user for example the bra or the or
the underpants they already have an
interface to talk touch the body very
naturally and we have accepted those
those pieces to be worn over the days so
we feel that textile and clothing
approach gives us a very good tool to
realize that vision and keep that focus
viable this is something that I say that
presents our academic slides so I'm not
going to give you any any more detailed
education but these are the main
findings why what we have found out the
basic strength of of textile integrated
wearable sensors so first of all as I
said last time the under last slide it's
very natural to put on and comfortable
to wear I would even say that it's the
most natural thing to put on is the
clothes in some cases also the correct
sensor placement is viable so to get the
sensors on the right positions without
anybody helping you it's some come how
comes into the picture through clothing
for example we did a vest a sensor vest
I come back to this later but we did a
sensor vest with with Philips
and their requirement was that they need
to get sensors placed in tolerance of 1
centimeter every time that they put the
sensors on typically that needs almost a
medical kind of some kind of the medical
professional to help you to glue or
place the sensors with that tolerance
but we were able to design a garment a
vest that repeatability places the
sensors on the tolerance of 1 centimeter
so it get it's the repeatability but it
also gets the one-time a reliable sensor
connection and sensor placement we also
see that the requirement required cables
between the sensors and between the
sensors and electronics those can be
hidden into the textile form factor
since textiles for example the best
underwears whatever they already have
the large area going around the body why
not to integrate the wires into the same
platform and again get them vanish
because if there would be any kind of
wire hassle hanging wires whatever that
will both destroy the the this the
measurements because it can it can make
make the movement or behavior different
but it also can destroy the signals
since when you are when you're feeling
that somebody's seeing that you are
doing a measurements and you can get
mentally loaded from that position that
that the sensing is somehow visible by
hiding the sensors into the textiles you
can get the sensors back and you can
live as you want so we believe that by
integrating the sensors into the
textiles we can do very long-term
sensing without loading anybody into
this environment at all mentally then
some kind of concrete things what what
have we done in this business are we
only talking or have we already done
something luckily we have done something
as I said that the the business kind of
potential or or or or the the the the
big vision of wearables it collapsed
about 10 years ago luckily we survived
we walked to to polar who was the the
giant on that time in the in the
heartrate sensing and we were we told
them that we could transfer we could
further develop the plastic cold heart
rate sensor strap to become comfortable
textile like easy to put on and they
understood it immediately
they said that actually one of the
biggest obstacle on selling the heart
rate systems was the hard plastic cold
piece of electrics that you had to wear
and this was actually the the product
that made helped us to survive to stay
in business but also start learning and
start understanding what is really the
business behind the wearable sensors but
this this was that this was an example
which we launched with polar more than
ten years ago and of course we were we
were thrilled to be able to work with
the company like polar but also we were
thrilled to be able to be on the market
with the real product and we were
following very closely that will this be
a sustainable long-term meaningful trend
in the product evolution or will this be
only a short-term a fashion thing
something for the marketing guys to get
benefit out of and then they would kind
of back to the plastic straps but no
they didn't back up the consumer
feedback was so overwhelming that they
consumers insisted to have more textile
straps so that turned out that textiles
can be used as a signal or sensors
signal connectors signal signal wiring
methods in a demanding sensor
environment so there's lots of
distortions lots of movement artifacts
lots of moisture
lots of problems in this area so if we
are able to do a textile sensors that
meet high quality requirements that
comes from the polar we felt that this
is really a doable thing and actually
the competitors felt the same way the
other companies they naturally they gave
us a ring
after a couple of years that can they
have the same thing and now we are
supplying millions of straps so at the
moment we are on top of the others we
are supplying too soon to Garmin adidas
Timex all these companies are buying the
straps from clothing plus of course we
have further developed pushed designed
the straps it's not anymore the same
that you saw 10 years ago but but the
idea is the same but the design and
performance is even better so this is
something that has happened this is
something that that it's really
commercially existing it's machine
washable it's durable it's everything
that is requested from the from the
demanding electronics industry very
logical thing to ask after having the
textile strap especially from the
females is why don't you integrate the
strap and the bra together because
majority of the users the female users
they have the problem on wearing the bra
and the strap at the same time because
they are overlapping the same part of
the body and since the bra is already
needed there from the physical reasons
it's difficult to say that try to use
the strap on the same place because it's
almost impossible so that so the people
they kept asking that why don't you
integrate these two worlds together and
this obvious question has kind of gave
us a guts and failing to start
integrating these two two things this is
actually the vision that we had already
more than 10 years ago but but we were
not able to do that vision or implement
that vision commercially because there
were no removable transmitters so we had
to do that straps first with with the
detachable transmitter to be able to
jump into
business and at the moment we are we we
we feel that we are in in in front of
the
huge opportunities and at the moment we
are we are supplying the the sensors to
two Danish company pure I'm we are
shipping to Lululemon we're shipping to
Adidas and we're shipping to Under
Armour that forgot something does
another but still there is a big
underwear company sports underwear
companies who has understood that this
integration is meaningful
this integration makes the usability
that makes makes the the the heart rate
changing even more comfortable for the
users you don't need to wear anything
extra just put the sport clothes on and
you will be monitored and from the
business wise this is these naturally
much bigger opportunity than the strap
business because we feel we believe that
especially on especially on the women's
clothing business we believe that after
five years almost every high-end sports
underwear should include the sensors
already today the difference for example
the price difference if you buy the pure
lime or Lululemon bra with sensors or
without sensors the price difference in
in in shop is only five euros so the
price difference is all almost
meaningless ting and even if we get
further down to this business it will be
smaller I have some samples with me
probably way we make it so that I show
you something here but if after the
presentation you feel that you want to
get get your hands on to these
please come and look so this is this is
the bra
with the with the place for the
transmitter and the integrated sensors
you must wet the sensors the it's not
for it's not required for everybody but
majority of the people needs to get a
good sensor skin contact through the
water this is a church that that we have
a created and what we are manufacturing
to adidas this is a shirt for the photos
especially for the soccer players and
the unique in this shirt is that
typically that transmitter is located in
between the sensors but because the
soccer the the chest is the control area
for the ball you can't have the
transmitter here and that's the reason
why we have wired or placed still placed
the sensors here on the fruitful areas
where you have the strong signal but
instead of having transmitter here we
have built the wiring system to put the
transmitter on the back so actually I
can turn this around
to show you how the wiring is built up
so there are sensors and then there's
wiring system and there is a pocket for
the transmitter yeah
yeah is there a reason we must giving
sensors at the back of the body
yeah in some applications it would be
possible but especially in in that in
within top athletes with the lots of
movement movement artifacts a lot lots
of other distortions we must sense from
the area where the signal is strongest
and that since we are we have we have a
Maps a kind of academic maps where the
signal is strongest and it's around the
chest of course there is a place to do
it from the back as well but we would
lose a bit of of the reliable signal but
that's a good question if we go more low
intensive training sessions it the heart
rate can be read from very many
different places from from the from the
shoulders or as well from the hip yeah
especially yeah actually that's not the
loose shirt that's quite fail that's
quite tight well fitting shirt but of
course you still lose the signal
sometimes when there comes a real real
collision or somebody is pushing you you
will lose the signal and yeah this is
widely used in the MSL and in the
European top leagues those are mostly
the production effectiveness questions
and as well the insulation questions so
there's lots of different kind of
requirements for the signal wiring and
we got the the best combination between
the costs and the manufacturability and
the signal quality by doing it like that
there's a lot of there so there has
happened lots of cost optimization in
that yeah
yeah that's a good question there there
is there is a there's completely
possibility to do it fully integrated it
needs a bit more expensive battery
because the typical coin cell battery it
will explode in the washing machine that
the temperature load is too high so but
it's it's easy to select a bit higher
temperature range battery and in the
crate Italian so we have a we have a we
have a good understanding how to
integrate it permanently and I
personally I believe on that it's there
is not going to be any more removable
things after come after couple of years
at the moment there are still removable
thing and what the other question that
do the we sell also the the module we
have we have couple of partners with
whom we have kind of developed and
validated that the combination works
perfectly and at the moment actually I'm
happy that you asked is that we we are
selling that the absolutely the smallest
transmitter on the market and in the
same package there is also the the most
minimalistic connector interface or
connector this is not so valid on the
straps but we are very happy that we
were able to remove the snaps from the
front from the bra because it didn't
look so good but I'll come back to this
later but I believe on integration after
a couple of years you can't remove the
transmitter
so this is this is one one trend one one
business that souls shows the value of
integrating clothing and sensors
together yeah actually one of the most
fun power consuming thing is is
transmitting so if you would be just
recording it the power consumption level
goes dramatically down so so I don't I
don't see any major problem on that it
can be thousands of hours that you can
record the rate huh with that yeah sorry
no everyday no no no one battery better
per year like
how would I say if I recall it right
this this transmission technology it's
it's it covers like thousand hours I
don't I'm not exactly was it 100 1000
hours roughly yeah but if you would
remove the transmission from here it's
completely off-the-shelf stuff kind of
switch off the transmitter bye-bye
ice software and because somehow we are
proud that we are we are able to do this
business on quite demanding environment
both from the cost twice
design-wise and the signal quality wise
so all this wet all this movement all
these designers requirement and the cost
requirements we have we have solved the
problems so actually we believe that
it's quite easy to move away and move
further in this business and integrate
the sensors in other applications as
well I have another example the best
that I already referred we made a vest
with Philips so Philips is one of the
companies who believes on home
healthcare they believe that the
chronical diseases chronical problems
that people have they should be treated
at the home the hospitalization the
hospital environment it's good for the
acute problems but not good for the
chronical things and actually the
Philips identified an an problem that is
the heart compensation so the huge
amount of people have the weak heart
that's that's very well known and when
the when the heart gets too weak it
happens I couldn't say that my heart is
getting weaker it happens kind of
without an alarm and when the word heart
gets too weak it starts to
emulate the water in the lungs and the
Philip set that if you are able to
measure amount of the water in the lungs
and especially if you are able to do the
drain trend analysis draw the trend line
how the water accumulation is going or
or accumulating there it could be the
way to give an estimation or indication
for the both user itself or the patient
itself or the doctors to start
dehydration medication and some other
treatments to avoid the hospitalization
and a critical care and that that was a
challenge that was a great challenge
what could you please design a West or
the piece of clothing that is easy to
put on easy to do sensing and is to kind
of maintain and we developed a vest with
Philips that measures through by your
impedance the water accumulated into the
lungs and the idea is that the patient
he or her they put the vest on every
morning for five minutes they can drink
coffee read paper watch TV something not
very active but still live normally and
the and the best measures during these
five minutes the bore water level level
in the lungs and it's not only one kind
of one time measurement the idea is to
do it every morning
so you were able to do the trend line
analysis and actually we are very happy
that this is vest it just passed the
clinical studies in Europe so there was
a was a thousand people's thousand
people from from the males females fat
thin but what they were different things
were there and thousand people they were
all using the vest for one year and it
was easily shown that the rest really
detected
when the water starts to accumulate into
the lungs even 10 days before the
hospitalization started so 10 days is a
good time frame to start reacting and
start giving the right medication and
other treatments so we are very happy to
see that we are able to bring this
technology this wearable easily accepted
effective sensing approach also to the
space of home healthcare and we are we
are very proud to work with the
companies like Philip since they are
they are good in their their business
and they are very demanding against us
it has been also yes please require
water yeah they still require the water
just to be sure you yeah you can take
the rest now yeah that's that's an and
and we believe further into the home
health care we believe that the sensors
in the home will help users to to get
many benefits out of the continuous
long-term sensing actually village takes
care of that we just designed the best
and sell the best to Philips they they
have the deals with the insurance
companies and their so so we are not
working directly with that with the with
the hospitals study we're working as
three hyper-dense
they have any sort of my condition or
was just randomly picked people are
those were the team or the group that
was chosen to be that the validation
group they all had one heart attack in
their history so they were clearly a
target group so there was a big
prediction that something bad will
happen so one one interesting learning
was of course from this project since
Phillips they have to be very honest
what they do they have to choose the
right way of working it was also
interesting to work with them and
understand that why did they chose a
wearable textile like approach since
they had an palette of glued electrodes
plastic things even implant to do that
but it was so nice to learn and work
with them and get an confirmation that
there are things that are are very kind
of valid to do through the wearable
textile sense so in the in the in the
very big picture we believe that
actually textiles and sensors gives an
extremely nice platform for for
motivation show the effectiveness of the
medication give a give a give a people a
reason to to to to believe on on or get
some get some evidences on if they
change their lifestyle it's a it's a
quite rewarding to learn something that
when you switch something it really
effects on on some some parameters in
your body for example what one example
one example that I just learned that I'm
not sure do another English words but
but the one of the most dangerous fad
types is actually the
that around some inner parts of your
your body and it's it's a interesting to
learn that when you start to do any kind
of sport any kind of activity
that will be the first fat to be burned
and it would be so important to tell
people that the two or three things two
or three times when you did a sports
really had an critical effect on the
body that without any sensors it's quite
problematic to see the real change for
example by just measuring the weight
it's it's it's it comes too slow with
this kind of clever sensing methods it
could be possible to give the feedback
even faster so we believe that different
kind of wearable sensors will be there
and we hope to be in a major role while
this trend happens what we promise in
clothing plus is that we can integrate
almost whatever sensor into the textiles
so we are not stocked with heart rate or
bioimpedance not at all we would like to
see from our customers our business to
business customers but they have a need
they have a need to sense reliably from
the body something and then we walk in
and we do it we design the clothes we we
integrate the sensors we do the needed
wirings within different needed
connections and we make it happen
and here is a list of some some sensors
that we have been integrating and that
should be a reference or a proof of
concept that we can integrate almost
anything into the textiles yeah is there
any way since
yeah I'm not sure that but you can see
pain easily from the heart rate
variability when you get there is a
there's great academic study that when
people are in dentist what happens for
their their heart rate when when they
get hurt it's not getting up
it's it starts to click
tick like a clock so there is no
variability but how to localize it I'm
not sure about that yet but we could for
example do we could integrate the
microphones in the clothes we can
integrate the temperature microphone I
love the idea to listen the the sounds
from the joints to be able to do some
kind of conclusions that how are you
doing we can sense the temperature's
bending stretching we have been
integrating optical sensors into the
clothes accelerometers yeah it's hard to
define clearly because you you can you
can do the predictions how straight you
are standing or how the how the arms are
moving or almost flexibility could be
one one thing to be measured and
probably the combination bending and
stretching and accelerometers to get the
posters on the on the on the ground and
stuff like that but actually typically
the best best best possible case is that
consumer of the the business-to-business
customer walks into clothing plus saying
that our customer base needs to know
this and to be able to tell them this we
need to sense these things from the body
and then we are the partners who solves
that yeah
I would say that all these sensors we
can integrate into the textile materials
so it's only matter of piece of garment
are you wearing a hat all day if if so
then we can do it the EEG if you are
wearing the pants all day we can do the
heartrate we can do some optical sensing
here
well how would we do it we would build a
some amount of prototypes we have how
would I take the clothing bus we have
the building blocks we have the methods
to do connectors we have the methods to
do wiring we have the methods to do the
sensor integration so it takes a couple
of months for us to build the 10 clothes
with with the specified or selected
sensors and then we test it yeah
typically we need somebody from Pease
business of electrics or consumer
understanding yeah substrate and then
integrating that Kaplan substrate into
the fabric itself yeah good question we
we are not business of developing the
sensors so we just want to integrate
existing commercial approved
miniaturized cost-effective sensors into
the textiles so we we are not we are
printing or developing the sensors on
our own
only some very rare where rare wants but
typically we choose with our customer
the sensors that they want to have in
the clothes and then we do it our
platform our building works enables kind
of it opens the fruitful fruitful
platform to integrate almost whatever
kind of the sensors substrate by captain
or are you using a more rigid substrate
using an fr4
no we seems our vision is to do ask
comfortable we are only working with
yeah yeah
the washability is one of the main
challenges because it's something new
that electronics industry hasn't faced
so far so we actually have to push our
material suppliers and push ourselves to
do that the methods to integrate the
system so that it can be washable and we
yeah I wouldn't expect it to function
after between 25 to 50 watching stay up
to curved obsolescence we we test always
all the way to 100 cycles
what's your usage
your value on Cobra using percent usage
at up to hundred cycles I have one occur
for you maybe maybe that's so detailed
question that we have to dig into this
more careful because it depends on what
signal you are sending their our our
story is that for example when we work
work with Adidas we want to promise from
our components more and they are
promising to their customers so what
they typically they promise is from 40
to 50 working cycles that's what they
promise to their customers 40 to 50
washing cycles what what what the the
the big brands promises to their
customers so this was just for the
inspiration that we are not stocked with
the heart rate we would like to see
whatever ideas to be sensed from the
body and we try to be the experts to do
that few slides about our company so on
top of which resources we really do this
we have 25 persons in in R&amp;amp;D to do the
development itself there is mechanical
engineers there's naturally text textile
engineers there's a material sourcing
prototyping we have our own factory in
China or this unique in this story is
that whatever we design we promise that
we can mass-produce it so exactly the
same technologies that we have in
Finland where we do the R&amp;amp;D we have the
exactly the same technologies in China
where we do a millions of these products
per year
here is something about the technologies
that we use we used to use to think that
a suing would be that they're not good
enough for this but no it wasn't we had
to kind of reinvent that the set of the
technologies to be able to do the
integration we have different kind of
methods for the connector assembly we
use widely the laser cutting we have
three different lamination technologies
to put the components and text house
together
we have ultrasonic welding where we sue
the the textiles in in the different
methods we have the dispensing we have
the the methods to do the printed
electronics we have a lot of electrical
functionality in line in the production
side and as well the machine vision all
this is needed to meet the requirements
of the sensors sensor industry they are
not happy happy with the tolerances of
some centimeters they need to get the
exact installations water proof layers
ceiling structures and everything should
be in tolerance of some tenths of
millimeters so we had to jump away from
the multiplied handwork to mechanized
and new new production methods these are
not completely new in the world but we
are trying to push them independent in
the in the form factor of textiles but I
said this this is really mass production
already this is not only some prototypes
we are doing millions of these products
textile integrated sensors this is
something that I always want to want to
tell that we don't have anything of the
self so there is no warehouse where you
can buy the clothing plus products we
always do it based on customers needs so
we have development service after we
have understood what the customer needs
we do it exactly like they want and then
we have the production service so the
link between these two stories is that
whatever is developed there is
seamlessly transferred to real mass
production environment in China
and there we have so much focus on the
quality some facts about the company
itself so the story has started in 1998
at the moment last year we our sales was
in dollars it was about 10 million
dollars and 27 persons in R&amp;amp;D plus some
marketing and sales guys then at the end
I throw you three technology news I tell
about the building blocks that we have
developed to be able to implement the
vision these three things has has been
developed within last year the first is
actually the the invention our marketing
guy came up with an idea of center wire
so the idea is that that here we have
the pant the running pant or cycling
pants to measure the EMG EMG activity
from the from the front leg and the back
leg to be able to guide the user to use
the body symmetrically but as well for
example for the biking you are able to
adjust the height of the saddle to be
able to use symmetrically or optimally
the front and the back leg muscles so
these
or is it still like I could put a lot of
sensors on my pedals yeah the biking is
biking is this is something it's not an
easy problem and this this comes to the
same problem from the different angle
and especially when you are doing
running or or skiing when you don't have
the mechanical bike where to integrate
the sensors the pants is the quite
fruitful place to locate the sensors but
here we that's actually pretty much the
same technology that you saw in the
auditor shirt it's even further
optimized that than what it's here but
the idea is to use the same material as
a sensor and as a wire so we actually we
eliminated one connection interface here
there is still one connection interface
where the wire is turned out to be a
plastic connector where the module
itself is clipped in and the information
is sent to the phone but this is this is
this is a mass-producible way on doing a
wiring and sensor structures on the
pants I can put this also to go through
the other technology is actually again a
fancy name trace base this is something
that we have invested quite a lot during
last year and we have done a technology
study and a development to able to do an
PCB printed PCB that has a good
water-resistant or watching resistant so
actually the the purity and the the good
part of this story is that in this
platform we can integrate almost
whatever existing sensors or the LEDs or
components so there is a patch where we
can put the components on and the wire
structure itself
is also washable so here I show you some
graphs of these these studies so here
for example 80 white 5 washing cycles
and the resistance over the 40
centimeters has increased but it fits on
the majority of the concept where we are
aiming so this is over 85 washing cycles
the the resistance change the other
graph that helps to understand this
technology a bit better is this is a
typical flexible copper copper PCB this
is a bending stretch a bending test the
typical copper wire in some point it
just gets broken but what happens to our
trace based technology the the variance
gets bigger but it doesn't get broken
and it's still only some ohms where you
are living so it it's a it's not it's
not a clear line but so far what we have
managed to develop it's good enough for
the majority of the concepts and the
technologies where this is a me but the
idea is that we are able to do layers
with the printed printed technology and
meet the watching requirements and
especially what's creating that that we
are also able to make it very
comfortable by quickly you could think
that this is a bit ugly to put on this
can be comfortable but actually this is
an example how it almost vanishes in
into the clothing so here we have this
technology integrated in
and here actually the exactly the same
technology but it's also made to be
stretchy so by building the the fabric
layers and place this in between you can
make these electronics both washable but
also stretchable the tracing tank yeah
they don't it's not a sensor you are I
guess the tracer yeah you are right and
we have the technology to integrate the
sensors on the tracer and also the
connectors on the treasure yeah and then
you have a we have a we have a specific
technologies to integrate those
treasures in the textile material to
make it comfortable and easy to put on
and actually the third technology news
is it has something to do with all lots
of to do with the connectors some of the
underwear companies they are very
allergic on the snaps they don't see the
reason why you have to big bulky metal
pieces in the in the sophisticated
nicely designed bra and we agree them
completely and that was the reason why
we why we developed a connector cord
called flat snap so we we removed a
majority of unnecessary metal from the
snap and made it as flat as possible to
make it possible to almost disappear
into the textile structure and the shirt
what you have in your hand there is also
the flat snap connector present on the
on the back so it's all almost
disappeared that's a good question
because we have other options but the
snaps they have an extremely good
mechanical spring structure in it to be
able to avoid the the the movement
artifacts so
well what was the technique that you
people preparing the same yeah yeah
magnets is a option yeah but there is
also the limitations on the magnets they
are there they are not so stable over
the time you can lose them the the
effect they are somehow they are if you
get them kind of you can break the
magnets and if you are sensitive with
the magnets some some of the people they
don't want to wear the magnets and they
are not so cost-effective
that's quite quite cost-effective thing
though those i-i've completely follow
you we can do the magnet that's a great
technology but so far none of our
customers we have tried that quite Oh
many times
but none of the concepts commercial
things has never ended up to you be to
be using magnets but magnet is a great
thing magnets are absolutely crazy
yeah so the springs the spring structure
on the snap has been copied into this
flat snap idea and somehow that the
story behind the heart rate sensor
business shows that the snap is very
reliable and there and functional
connector type yeah several garments and
why not yeah so you need you just need
to have on the other piece of the
apparel you need to have the the female
side and on the on the other side you
should have the male side and then just
clip those in yeah that's possible
absolutely yeah that's one option
absolutely yeah
so that was just just to give you an
idea that the connector technology is
the third main part where we are working
so I would say that it's the connectors
it's the tracers and it's the platform
for as many sensors as possible where we
are focusing and we feel that if we are
able to offer these building blocks our
customers are are are quite capable on
defining their dreams on top of these
technologies and we really really would
love to throw you a question that this
is what we have done with the others it
would be very exciting to do something
with the Microsoft actually the question
is that what could we do with you
actually this transmitter this is btle
yeah yeah this is to be very precise
this is not made by clothing but I said
this is made by one of our partners but
they are very open-minded and they they
just want to make this this fly high and
see this used as as widely as possible
but btle
is actually one of the main main radio
technologies where where the weather
sports industry is lying yeah the most
common software
how would I say that can you hate help
me with this
actually clothing bus we are so good in
software that's why we are here so so
where we are good we want to integrate
the sensors then we need somebody to do
the electronics who transfers the
signals in the into the some kind of
electrical signal that can be sent to
the software that can actually build the
value for the customer typically for
example here software is built by Garmin
and software is built by Suunto software
is built by Philips
it's very typically our customer who
takes care of that yeah as clothing plus
we we haven't done that on our own we
try to try to keep our eyes open and and
and understand where where the
development is going and absolutely I
see that when these components are ready
enough we choose we just need to adapt
those and for some of the players we are
we are discussing and trying to push
them to meet the washing requirements
those are very typically the things that
they don't immediately understand or
they are not even willing to go in this
business because they see already the
value in the stretchability sobic but
whenever it comes to washable stretcher
stretchable thing we are very curious to
add up those pieces in our our portfolio
since we are the integrator
great well thank you everyone for coming
and if Ellie will be here for the left
you guys want to just chat with him for
a few more minutes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
