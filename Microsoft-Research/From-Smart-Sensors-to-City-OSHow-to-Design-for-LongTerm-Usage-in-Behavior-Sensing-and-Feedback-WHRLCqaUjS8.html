you
good morning so many thanks to fan out
for the Chi introductions okay so I'll
talk about how to design long term usage
in behavior sensing and feedback apps
okay so why long term usage is important
for behavior sensing and feedback ok
because human behavior in nature is long
term for example eating exercising
shopping these are the activities that
we may do every day over you know years
after years and also like alcohol and
substance abuse for you know drug
addicts or alcoholic addicts so this
will be one applications that you know I
like to emphasize on later okay so we
really want to do long-term behavior
sensing right because with the long-term
observation data we can extract
meaningful behavior trend and patterns
and also for our feedback based on the
data will collect from the users we want
to provide feedback that can motivate
kind of the steady and gradual behavior
improvements that can sustain you know
over a long period of time and not
something that you know comes fast but
also goes away fast so how do we
motivate people to continuously use
these type of behavior sensing and
feedback apps over a long period times
and you know designing this kind of
application stickiness is very
challenging okay so I'd like to give a
disclaimer I don't have any good results
I'm not offering any design guidelines
at this point but you know just tell you
what we have done and what we're testing
so first of all I will give you two
examples of my prove you're researching
our
very long period of time okay so the
first one we have done is something
called the place for toothbrush so the
goal is to encourage kids to do proper
and thorough brushing okay so on the
sensing side we have this vision system
so you can see we use a camera here okay
and then we also have a marker that's
attached to the end of the child
toothbrush and we can detect which part
of the teeth the child is brushing and
we also have a feedback game I'm going
to play this video so you can see
exactly what it is okay so this is my
daughter when she was five years old and
all the dollars you know all the kids a
lot they love for you Candis right and
her mom forced her to brush at nine but
you know kids against sleepy and I so
they only brush three or five times and
then they call it done and obviously
then she will end up in the densest
clinic and it's a hard way or the kids
to hear all the drilling sounds okay so
we designed this game you can see that
inside the Rose is a camera okay you can
see that at the end of the child's
toothbrush it's a LED pattern markers so
basically the camera is looking at the
LED power markers as four phases each
face as a different patterns and so we
designed a game so at the start of the
game you know the child pieces
with cavities so while the child is
brushing her part of the teeth that part
of the cavities will fall and we also
use sound right so the dentists say that
you're supposed to brush is seven times
in each area so we used to read me pasa
la ceiba you can see that there are
numberings the numbers are actually
important right you want the child to
brush a particular older ok so the child
will remember that order so even you
move back remove this game which I will
hopefully we'll have some muscle
memories
okay so I'll talk about the second
applications that does not work over a
long time okay so this application is
called the mug force so the go is
actually encourage people to drink
healthy amount of waters you know many
of us we work in the office and
sometimes we forget to drink okay so
they say that by the time your tongue
feel dry your body is already dehydrated
so what we do is we use a mobile phone
that you can attach to your drinking
bottles okay and we use two sensors the
first ones accelerometers so we're
detecting this drinking motions right so
after the user put the the cup back on
the tables we trigger the camera located
on the back of the phones will take a
shot into the mug and then we can detect
the water level so when the water level
drops we can infer the amount of water
the user has consumes okay and then we
have prototype this game which I will
also show you in the video so this is
this game has a tree okay so you can see
the tree here so if you don't drink
enough water we use a metaphor design
then the tree will lose its leave right
and you can also see other players
players how well other players are
drinking their waters and you can send a
loving heart reminders remind them to
drink water okay so let me get this
video playing
okay so this is one of my grad students
who's working very hard and people
forgot to drink water so you can see
that the tree wells you know slowly lose
its leaf ok and this is a bit remember
this is something called ambient display
right it reminds the user all it's time
to replenish the tree will replenish my
own body
so now the leaves will grow back okay so
we're showing here is the single user
game so okay so now is showing you the
sensing part you can see that at the
back side of the bottle we put a pattern
markers this is to make it easier to
detect the water level so what we found
it is like entire one many people like
to drink warm water and one water will
create vapors so makes it so camera
cannot take a very clear shot so we need
to have the black markers to help us
okay okay and this is a multi-user games
so to play this game the user first has
to drink enough water to earn a credit
ok and then this card is a loving heart
credit and he can send it to you know a
friend right so you can see that you
know two guys they're really enjoy pick
playing this hard giving games you know
so you know he's really happy you know
somebody really cares about him
okay so just continue
okay so so let's go back to this
question so why you know these two game
kind of persuasive abs do not work over
them here at time okay so the reason is
novelty facts right so what okay so what
is novelty facts you we can illustrate
using this curve so on the x-axis is
over time and on the y-axis is the users
interests and motivations okay so for
the first couple times with the user
thing so this game is novel is really
interesting right but how about the but
after the second weeks or after a month
this game them become repetitive it
becomes boring so the user is interests
and motivations would then just wears
off right okay so so now we want to oh
the questions that we're trying to
address in this talk is long term usage
okay so we're trying something different
and this application is called the sober
sober theory so we're targeting we're
trying to assist alcoholic recoveries
using mobile phones so this is on the
sensing part this is what we did is we
create a bluetooth this is a breath
analyzer ok so this orange device so
this is a straw so basically the user
would just blow into it right and
there's an alcohol air sensor that was
held since the alcohol levels okay in
the users breath okay and then it will
then send it to your mobile phone and
this is a spring shot of the mobile
phones so make sure that the user
doesn't cheat right so we will you know
turn the cameras observing the user
taking this this test and we also have
market you can see ah this is the eyes
the nose who make sure make sure we
capture the users face ok and the end
the device so he also has a rechargeable
batteries in this vise ball basically
loss of week ok so i will show this is a
promotion
videos we made to recruit users okay
it's law in its all in Mandarin ok so i
will try to verbally annotate
hey
angel hold on okay priyanka intention
john ha okay busy is saying that if you
drink if you drink too much you will
suffer memory probably and you also have
bad temperaments okay okay and this will
cause disasters in your workplace as was
to your families so potential for
serious alcohol addicts they need to go
see physicians right so don't see tub ok
so our target subjects are patients who
leave the rehab centers to help them you
know maintain sober ok I'm going away
shuffle don't know goodness how ever you
know so when they meet friends when they
have pressures they may go back to
drinking again ok so don't eventually
they'll give up the treatments and
that's that's bad and we're trying to
help my master Xiang yang yin et typing
shitty the including yet hey pal you got
your wasting show teach you in see
colors specialty and jumped it yourself
I'm soldier home Thank You Team B so
this is the UH the breath analyzer
device Julianne Howe passion war gow GI
joe movie so you can bc use it your
whole team so tell me any time to take
bleeping test okay so after each
breathing tests we have a small
questionnaires so we're also trying to
understand the users mood his alcohol
craving levels and whether he wants to
share his locations okay so okay the UI
i will go through very quickly in the
videos but i will give a little bit more
explanations later
commotio shopping so that your charger
needs a lot okay so this is a weekly
summary of the test results and this is
a monthly social teaching City shuffle
yo Kai dojo okay and we also do some
social ranking so you can rank your own
behaviors against you know a group of
other addicts who are trying to quit how
about your attendance it so you think we
also built in a storytelling tools yeah
and i will describe that tool
commentator wait so what he gon change
sure pouco Tail County the shin saw my
potential outsourcer with up cheering
chewie function that make a teacher the
teeth that how you talk about the
function chance in making jokes about
 ching ching EG clean can t go t
equal township hate so the user can also
record you know his his feelings and
some encouragement for himself say
beautifully you know to play later Hey
Joe what I enjoyed and 18 part time in
your to show shop let's go back
so so just a very brief explanation on
the interface right so this is a main
page and this is that the users most
recent input the mood levels his craving
levels here and this is the his erac
values okay and that he can just scroll
around to see the weekly chart the
monthly chart so the orange dot is when
the user failed the test and the blue
one is passed the test and this gray one
is missed a test ok mr. tez is also also
bad okay so the next interphase and so
this is a small question years we also
user to filled out and these are the
visualizations okay so the user can kind
of see his mood swing over a week or a
month his alcohol craving levels and the
test results so the important part is
you know once you overlay these three
charts then you know this is kind of
like a self understanding tours right
under what condition will lead me to
start drinking again you know maybe when
I'm depressed no I would be more likely
to drink or you know what I feel sad or
when I have a large mood swings okay so
this is another tools that we're
building in is called the storytelling
tools so basically we took the so in the
u.s. there is a alcohol anonymous
program is called the double a okay and
it has the top step programs to quit
drinking okay so basically we draw each
steps into a story page illustrations
okay and so we're trying to visualize
the patient struggle with alcohols we're
trying to visualize that progress okay
so for example this page may say that
you know some encouragement I'm eager to
take
this has to stop drinking I'm going to
treasure every day believe that I will
feel more positive every day's ok so
whenever the user passes an alcoholic
test we still have a small games that it
will color this this page ok so this is
the page completion ratios ok so my time
is going out ok so I guess my point is
you know is to bring value out of the
data to the users ok so the more the
longer the data you have collected the
more the higher values you have ok and
you know we really want to turn the
other into useful you know stop drinking
tools such as the storytelling and this
self-understanding tools ok so i can
come out so you can if the design
feedback that's not where there's always
a hardware alternative to this so one
example is like the smart tooth right
you can do we're about sentencing we can
do implantable sensing where Bo since
it's like you once you wear the sensor
you forget it the user will forget it so
you can do long-term collections
implantable this is another thing once
you implanted it's a permanent or
long-term sensor installations so I
won't my time is up so I won't so this
is a smart to that we build you can kind
of detect different kind of oral
activity you can detect eating actively
talking activities
ok so just I'll leave the Q&amp;amp;A to the end
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
