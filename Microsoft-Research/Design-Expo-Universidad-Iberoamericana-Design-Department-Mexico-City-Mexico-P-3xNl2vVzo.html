hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading

academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
next up is I've americano from Mexico
City okay so a little start I'm Ellie
I'm Alejandra hi I am alone so I am
David we're from Mexico City universidad
iberoamericana and we are going to
present your greenery so we want to know
who has played or know someone who has
played a let's say farm bill all right
now who has actually grown an urban
gardening cool not many of us but many
of us want to do so and but what is
stopping a big cities like Mexico to
adopt this Disick tivity according to
our investigation some of the problems
could be ignorance on the subject lack
of useful information and a complicated
learning process so basically what we
want is to promote the reconnection with
nature and with that a more conscious
use of resources by experimenting that
nature has its own time a process so
wonder what if technology could help us
to achieve this and if so how can that
shape the interpretation of our
environment and that is why we created
greenery a platform or you can learn how
to grow your own food isn't an
innovative learning processes and of
course promoting positive emotions it is
not just about growing vegetable to us
about the whole experience so greenery
is basted in two main main things the
first one is the application and the
other one is the greenery box and the
application is based in four views the
first one is a general information the
second one is a training the third one
is a real gardening and the fourth one
is a social view so here we'll have the
first view it works by a general data
information where you can check it
everyone do what every time you want and
for example men
is this part of the project and it will
help you to give your plan to life so
the second view consists on training
move so the user is going to be able to
grow a virtual plant and it will display
the days that have gone by the
temperature the type of plant the bests
it may have and also the levels of
maintenance so for example if he has run
out of water you can just simply click
on the buttons on the left and water it
and this way the user is going to be
able to learn to a more interactive way
and it's kind of a gaming part oh so
here we have the greenery box we have an
example right here we're making this box
that has these sensors that will tell
you the levels of temperature humidity
in the nutrients balance and all this
will be transferred to the application
and so the user can learn through a more
educated process and once he's an expert
on the matter and he has learned all
this stuff he will be able to grow his
own garden at his home in whichever size
he wants so the application greenery is
gonna tell him the information he needs
and all all these information I mean
he's going to be guided through it you
are also going to be able to share it in
social networks this is the fourth the
fourth view and friends are going to be
able to comment and like on your garden
also you may go to other friends gardens
and like and comment on them and well
here we have a little scenario of you
sir that is an expert and it has
using weinery for quite some time and
what we have here his garden and he's
checking it in the morning and even if
he's been even though they could be
using the application for a while kisses
to learning and for example he now
sharing with a friend I know something
about how some insects are good for your
plants and because it's also about
sharing I mean now he just got his brain
engage and it's gonna download the
application
yeah so we can see that he has now a
huge garden at his house and he started
with a little box the greener rugs and
now he has grown lettuce and onions and
tomatoes and while he's scanning it and
greenery through virtualization is going
to show you all the information you need
and he's really proud of all this
progress and the tomato that true or
trying to show is the transformation of
information to emotion that if we give
way your plan if you take care of it you
will receive some benefits from it and
it doesn't matter if you're a beginner
or an expert user you will always be
able to learn from this application so
let's say you invite your friends over
and you've been cooking the whole day
you made a pasta you made a salad made
with the tomatoes that you grew on your
own house and you're am experiencing
that a flavor you are sharing with your
friends you are sharing the benefits of
urban agriculture it's not that he
became an expert gardener he is creating
a cultural trend he's spreading his
knowledge with his friends and with his
know people
well about our design process we define
some key elements that guided us through
it the first one it was to create
empathy between the user and the system
given by an easy n dynamic graphic
interface also with trusted information
so the user can know what are the
realness of the practice the second one
was giving a dynamic experience
theoretical and practical mmm using new
technologies as a learning vehicle and
the third one was a use of a smart
gamification to develop positive
emotions and to maintain the users
engagement so it is about transforming
that fine to emotions some of the
benefits that greenery offers would be
changing users perception and creating
new experiences all through a fun
learning process so our inserts felt
really enthusiastic by launching into
the market so our next steps will be
gathering the experts in the matter to
complete database launching the beta
version that will have a free version
and a subscription version and of course
finding companies to make it profitable
profitable and finding advertising so
we're we're seeking is for a one you to
do is to expand this and gather more
people to enjoy greenery and to see the
benefits that you can bring so that they
can grow their own urban garden whenever
you grow your own food in a fun way
thank you thank you
so so thank you um what's really
interesting just there's some history
that lends support to what you're trying
to do in the First World War there was a
movement called liberty gardens and it
was this movement to collectively build
urban small urban vegetable gardens
throughout cities for obvious reasons so
the point is is that there was an
external social force that caused that
to happen and I what's interesting is
how do we use social media and the
technology to actually perhaps maybe
have a kinder gentler catalyst to bring
it about the same end but and so there's
it's not a crazy idea that's what I'm
saying and the end the challenge is
really this notion about as you say the
education of how do you get people
started and then how do they have the
skills so they have the success we are
in a world of instant gratification and
that's the one question I had is that in
a world of instant gratification how do
you reinstall the sense of patience and
nurturing that a garden requires and it
probably has restores a part of our
humanity that technology is he wrote it
to someone well basically we're seeking
with greeneries that I mean we talked to
a lot of people and they told us that
they want to you know have a own urban
garden but didn't didn't they didn't
really know how to do it so they needed
information I mean they go on to blogs
and they see this information about
people that have been doing it but it's
not like the same thing so we wanted to
do like a whole package and give the
information also you can share with
other people this and you can practice
through gaming so that's you know it
will be building the more patients to
that and you know I think when you see
like you actually grew your tomato and
you were really excited about it and I
think that's like part of the process
you know and it can be you could be more
patient if you can see the progress that
you have made and you have if you had
actually tasted it so that's where we
are offering with all these like it's
the whole experience not just becoming
like a garner of course Katie you have a
question um exciting project is he I
have a question about the game you've
kind of alluded to it but it'd be good
to hear more and i also got confused is
and in the the tablet experience are you
automated lee controlling like watering
and stuff like that or is that just a
simulation to show you kind of what
could be happening or what is happening
yeah i mean right now is just a
simulation but about the gaming part
what we want I mean as we said and it's
to develop positive emotions besides
phone you know like I think gamification
gives you the opportunity to inhale some
other motions maybe like enthusiasm and
motivation maybe passion you know so
through this process to build in every
of the stations of the application these
motivation and the maintenance of the
engagement since the training part then
the bill have it one and then when
you're a mastery and you're gonna want
to go through all the stages so I know
for that answer your question all right
you guys thank you so much thank you
thank thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
