several miles to the south and to the
west of the onion Creek area in the
onion Creek Watershed there was about 12
to 14 inch rainfall there and that will
that rainfall that water began to move
through the watershed and into Austin so
we didn't anticipate it we didn't know
that was coming and it really did catch
us by surprise
what we found in in the 2013 Halloween
flood in Onion Creek was that there's
still areas where we can improve and
that that has to do with the predictive
analysis in other words being able to
accurately predict what the threat is
before it gets on top of our residents
and our citizens and in some cases our
first responders flooding is the largest
natural disaster that people face it
costs more money and it takes more lives
than any other form of natural disaster
that's faced in the United States or
elsewhere
the National Flood interoperability
experiment is designed to develop the
next generation of forecasting system
for the United States that's connecting
the National flood forecasting system
with local emergency response what we're
trying to do is to build up the
actionable intelligence that can be
created at that time and perhaps even
forecasts floods before the rain starts
to fall we want to first of all simulate
the flow on all the streams and rivers
of the nation simultaneously and that
means a continuously functioning
hydrology model over the whole
continental United States
that'll be continuously running and
continuously being updated initially we
get the flow levels that are coming out
at the model and then we visualize them
through the web browser so that people
can see what the flows are and what
their predicted to be the technology
enables us to have something very
complex running on Azure in the cloud in
the background while the person in front
is sitting there using whatever it is
that they're comfortable working with we
have programmers on the team who have
been doing the work with Microsoft Azure
they took two day training program and
they were pretty pleased that they were
able to get repeat going which is the
stream flow model that we're working
with and they'll be able to scale that
up as we need different virtual machines
in the future that's what we really love
about the cloud is that we can bring
them in and send them away as we need
them and when we're going to be having a
flood situation developing you've got to
be able to have that superfast
capability bring in lots of virtual
machines and then let them go when we're
done what's really unique about this is
we're bringing together the big data
sets of the geospatial information but
also the weather information and then
computing on that to give the answers
out really quickly and this hasn't been
done before in a real real time scenario
there's a lot of work that's been done
after the fact looking at how the
modeling could happen but applying it so
that users end-users can be prepared
ahead
is a really unique situation and that's
what the power of not only technology
and the cloud actually enables and it's
being seen in this situation here in
academia we teach we do our clever
things for research and so on but we're
not often called upon to do things for
the nation but this is a chance for the
academic community to show not simply
what we think but what we can do and we
have tremendous resources in the
academic community and with their
partners such as Microsoft Research to
be able to create a new future for the
country
dr. Mamie calls it an experiment I call
it a proof of concept putting them
together using the knowledge in the
science along with the boots on the
ground first responder capability says a
synergistic effect though that one will
be a force multiplier for the other and
so if we can work on on this experiment
this proof of concept and develop a
template that that any agency across the
nation could use to to lay that over
their threat and risk analysis for their
community and better prepare themselves
we're all much better off
