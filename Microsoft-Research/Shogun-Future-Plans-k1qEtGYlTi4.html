hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
okay so I'll make this quick it's
already late so we're community project
I already said this so we want to build
our community one way to do this I start
with the last point is we started
organizing workshops and events and this
is a lot of fun I really recommend this
to people in general I think here some
other products also do this Stan
recently at the first meet up in London
yeah we we're planning we're currently
applying for a grand num focus to to
organize a code sprint next year where
we get together all the developers from
all over the world I mean maybe most
projects here have all their developers
in one group but we don't so it's super
nice to get together another thing we
would actually would love to this is
kind of a dream we would love to we just
founded a non-profit Association to be
able to take donations I may be higher
developer in some some sense this would
be great because we have lots of
problems that need kind of long-term
love yeah we also i mentioned this
earlier we are trying to change our
license this is hard and another thing
since we be kind of we having all these
leaf pile of all these algorithms we
it's sugarless kind of can be very
useful I think for education and machine
learning at universities because we can
easily compare different methods and
visualize things so we want to push this
so currently i'm talking to kind of the
people that teach in london to use sugar
info for the machine learning courses we
hope to get this going and together with
these ipython notebooks and yeah that's
thing going to do then so the code
sprint will mainly be a dimension will
mainly be on technical gold so people
have been talking a lot of technical
goals here well we share most of them
the first problem with sugar knows we
need we have this super complicated book
process because we support all these
languages in these interfaces so it's
hard to compile it how to install it
this really needs to be resolved for
this yeah so we this one thing really
want to focus on having like easy
installation and procedures that all
these Python projects have we just have
in pip install soo geun this would be
amazing
and yeah then we have we have a bunch of
like internal because the framework is
really old and you know as cold gets
worse and worse when it's older we need
to clean up things reduce memory
footprint and stuff and then this year's
maybe the the biggest thing we have in
mind is we kind of want to want to want
to generalize over the internal ways to
compute things so the first baby step
towards this is to to have an internal
representation of linear algebra
operations but we don't want to be that
another library to do linear alg
operations we just want to be
independent of the back end so since I
mincha gone already we switched from
lapack to eigen and now you know there's
GPUs so we don't want to change like all
the algorithms again we just want to
interface against some internal
representation that is independent of
the back end so that we can easily
change the back end to be sustainable in
a way when the same one we want to do
the same thing for parallel and
distributed computing so we are we've
already started kind of coming up with
internal representations of how how can
we how can we represent computation jobs
tasks that that are done without dealing
with a concrete interface so that we can
easily select between well we want to do
things some kind of shared memory are we
going to do it on a computer network on
things like batch classed as a spark
yeah I think this is a very useful thing
and also I think this is a great
opportunity for collaboration because
most open source projects have this kind
of you know that the same problem they
wanna they have some computing tasks and
they're somehow without changing the
algorithms too much want to be flexible
in where the stuff is executed so I
think this is a maybe there could be
some some kind of meat a project that
provides a basis for computation and all
this project yeah and this slide I just
wrote it so I'm super excited i would
love to interface to lots of lots of
products here so kind of you know less
the stand project and would be cool if
we could use the fixed probabilistic
models from stand with insulin could
expose them would be good for them we
have already bindings to VW and lip
linea would like to update for example
the VW 1 so this would be nervous to
talk to about the sleep lip GPU array
looks is yeah looks super cool so we'll
have
look we kind of with this matrix view
problem we haven't really solved it in a
in a satisfying way and also we can
through all these interfaces we can
embed high-level languages into our
project we can call the stuff from C so
if you're interested in exposing your
your models for sugar and talk to us we
might do it and this is the thing I I
mentioned in the discussion so last year
I was at last October was a google for
the google Summer of Code mentor summit
and I met this other guy also from a
machine learning tool box called ml pack
and he just released a paper on how how
much faster his toolbox is compared to
other tool boxes and what he did he
built this super cool framework where
where he were he compared his toolbox to
other two boxes on standard problems all
in an automated way and one vision I
kind of have is imagine you had a
website and you can every two works for
a certain problem can upload their
script and then everything is executed
and compared and so this way you you
create reproducible benchmarks this is
good and also it has a really nice
motivation part because so me as a
library i'm interested in you know being
being fast so i attuned my scripts so
usually when you know in papers you
compare you compare methods to each
other you tune your own methods and
about the other mess is you don't give a
 you tune yours until you're faster
so then you would have some kind of
framework where you you know where
everyone is interested in making a good
impression and then you can you can look
at it you can see lo que have this much
time this library is this accurate this
library crash this library uses too much
memory and so on and so forth I think
this would be amazing so we we are
trying to push this it's a bit hard to
do this alone but if anybody's
interested in this so we were offering
one of these some of code projects next
year we tried it this year but we kind
of ran out of time we already
collaborating with this with this other
guy I mentioned to us started on this so
maybe this would be a really nice thing
to do yeah that's it thanks
yes in the past before the current one
it's one lab techs software make it work
take the other one you want to compare
right to learn then implement the same
intimidation to the confirmation we know
that with other institution problem
linking with blood cells we disagree
it's very hard to do on many different
systems in the current benchmark under
convention that we talk in a few time
what is happening smoothly the author or
user of each system is providing some
support for to the people that do the
benchmark they do their own for Taj
because the XML sisters they prefer that
started that have the androids ten do
people that do it for some of the other
system the abstracted it are they have
done it or not and they have kept from
them at the same so if everybody do the
work for their own first you have that
collaboration make it
because I don't know how to reproduce
that that's collaboration in other case
and the two white work at this time
ended in the first in the past we never
tried Inquisitor get up so it was more
difficult but well technically you could
set up a fixed environment and tell
people okay you have to write a script
that runs your your algorithm and you
you deal with the problems you just get
the data and we just get the results and
then we compare and kind of people are
responsible for this and you kind of
take some standard you know a boon to
long-term support system and if you
can't make your toolbox work on this
thing well it's it's your problem
exactly yeah I know there's also there's
also the EM Los project that sorry
there's m loss and ml data so ml data is
this open-source machine learning data
sets thing that's kind of they're meant
to be benchmark datasets was kind of
debt by now we just really sad and M
loss is this open-source track of GML
are where you can submit your project so
within these things you could think
about this but nobody's really doing
this even you know these websites like
em los it you know once the guys stop
doing it because they had a child it
just died yeah I agree I mean this goes
further than just ml2 works as this is
also super important for reproducible
research in my eyes you know when you
have all these papers about don't know
classification algorithms and everyone
always claims out we beat everyone but
there's actually you know the benchmarks
always bias because yeah oh you knew
sampling algorithm and so it's
ridiculous so there should be some
framework to compare things in a neutral
way it's really important here
a lot of these learning methods have
hyper parameters to them like a learning
rage or an annealing schedule in
something and I find it's very hard to
compare these algorithms when somebody's
taking the time ahead of time to find
the optimal versions of those and the
next you're comparing because that
doesn't really represent the practical
situation where you're facing new data
and you have to spend a lot of time like
this for the sgt versions we wrote it
would often take as much time yeah find
the right hyper friend what you found
them everything really quickly yeah
that's actually I mean that's true so
yeah it's the initial work that was done
here was actually separate
implementations of the same model or
algorithm for the same model so same
parameters so we fixed the parameters
for your don't know but once you start
comparing like families of models then
that's a problem obviously yeah I agree
it's a problem even if you're trying to
test your own project s because
overfitting your own
the hyper automatic I put on a better
solution is a way to bring that be us
again someone that manually tune in
during six six month to get the best I
per kilometer but until we have
automatic I program adverse selection I
think it would be pretty hard so if you
don't work I think it will change yeah
maybe you know first step is there are
multiple frameworks for deep learning so
you take a model you fix the parameters
and you run different implementations
and then already in there you will see
divergence in the results both runtime
end results so this would already be an
interesting one if you fix these things
I think at least
coming up with that kind of design of
what that the Dave cash should be there
it seems like something that you show
gun guys I don't make things yeah yeah I
agree I agree um it's this is a problem
of manpower and this can't be done by 11
one project I feel multiple people would
have to sit together and contribute time
run something if the result is destroy
the whole yeah that's true we use docker
24 notebook server okay thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
