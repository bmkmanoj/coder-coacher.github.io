hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading

lectures freely available
thanks all of you to come back in spite
of the popcorn but I think that's a good
transition to the social media session
which is headed by Kate Crawford who is
one of our social media researchers
Thank You Christian I think I think the
implication is that we're incredibly
entertaining people so I'll do my best
um I think one of the really significant
and powerful things about this lab is
the recognition that technology is not
just computer science and engineering
and math it is also social and cultural
and there's something really exciting
happening right now at the intersection
in particular of computer science and
social scientific and humanistic methods
and I count it as a pleasure and a
privilege to be working at that
intersection with my colleagues in the
social media collective founded by the
wonderful please stand Dana void lovely
to have you here and joined by Nancy
boom Mary gray Megan Finn Jessel engel &amp;amp;
Kate miltner with this amazing group we
think about the ways in which social
practices and network spaces are
interrelating and what we're going to
give you today is a little bit of a
tasting plate three of our favorite
collaborators and thinkers who make us
better researchers and what they're
going to give you in quite short talks
is a sense of the landscape a little
glimpse of a set of relationships
between big data algorithms and social
media with health politics and public
space first up we have gnf who is a
professor at the University of
Washington in the communications
department and also the author of the
very recently published excellent book
with MIT press venture labor Gina
today the question that I'm asking is
why big data won't hear us backed by
Intel we've spent the last three years
studying data practices and contexts at
the intersection of formal medicine and
consumer wellness what we found we think
is important for understanding
healthcare IT and we think it has huge
implications for understanding the
social nature of data let me start with
a quote from our research I want to work
with a doctor who believes me this is
from Katie mccurdy she's an activist in
the quantified self movement she's a
woman with a rare autoimmune disorder
that causes weakness involuntary muscles
it's a condition that leaves her in pain
and often without the ability to stand
in front of an audience and smile she's
also a user experience designer and she
made this this is a visualization of her
life literally it's 35 years of charting
her condition and her memories and her
feelings about her disease I want to
work with a doctor who believes me now
this is literally from a woman who has
evidence on her face she made this chart
in an attempt to communicate with her
doctor she graphically quantified the
qualitative and she hoped that her data
would do something for her that it would
help her get hurt she doc is she also
documents her illness over time with
photographs of her smile the artist and
activist Regina holiday turned these
photographs into this mural quantified
smile it's also telling quantified self
is going on right now as we speak
the other coast um quantified smile um
Regina does these jackets she paints
these murals on jackets as part of a
walking gallery literally a reminder so
people walking around medical
conferences are reminded that we're all
patients and in that sense we all have
stories we want heard we all want our
data to be used to help us get better
and we also want our data to to be heard
before we can talk about the technical
problems of health data innovation and
there are many we need to solve some
basic communication problems first
before we can talk about the integration
and analysis of multiple data sources
into electronic health records or the
health and telligence possible from
wearable pervasive devices or how search
analytics can be tools for health
prediction we need to figure out how
these data can be used for the joint
decision-making of patients with their
doctors these are the biggest problems
for health data innovation and they are
social problems not technical ones to
solve them I argue we need to rethink
data as social Oh Malik the technology
journalist recently called for data with
empathy now he was writing about
foursquare and coffee shops but I think
digital health innovation is an ideal
place to look for what we might start to
call something like data and empathy
this talk is based on research that I'm
doing with Britney fury so fast she's
currently an intern here at MSR New
England and she will be looking for
gainful employment as soon as she
finishes her nsf-funded dissertation
hire her she's very smart
there are three misconceptions that we
have about data that stand in the way of
empathy first data are not resources as
i turn my page people are looking to
data to solve enormous problems in US
healthcare we interviewed frontline
providers in impoverished and rural
areas in the United States and India
technology enthusiasts in mobile health
and IT startups doctors and scientists
in major research hospitals quantified
self members who are tracking enormous
amounts of personal data and people it's
health technology conferences on both
the east and the west coast to
understand the startup world i joined
the brain trust of a business
accelerator in this vertical i don't
even know what that means we did all
this to find out what people are doing
with their data what practices they have
around health data and how they talked
about their data now one of our key
findings from this research is so
obvious at first blush that it seems
strange it has not been integrated into
the design and implementation of health
data innovation namely people expect
really different things from their data
they expect data work in different ways
doctors patients and entrepreneurs all
value data for four different goals in
different ways in a new paper Brittany
and I term these data valence ha's the
social expectations of how data will
perform or what people think what people
think data do in social settings now
consider this from a gerontologist I
don't need more data I need more
resources saying that in Silicon Valley
or
Seattle is heresy likewise too many of
us who spend our careers cleaning
massaging collecting wrangling analyzing
data we always want more of it but to
the doctor data represent time and money
a biostatistician highlighted this
difference between the culture of
clinical care and medical research
physicians are typing away madly all
that information is actually very rich
from the doctors perspective though any
data that doesn't contribute to a
clinical decision or action is a waste
of their resources and a lawsuit waiting
to happen no wonder so many doctors view
data innovation as diverting resources
away from patient care now contrast that
to the overhyped by this point solution
slogan data is the new oil with informal
medicine data are useful resources right
dinner useful resources only when
connected to clinical decisions and
actions now these are two very different
expectations of data and yet as we all
know and believe data have and present
enormous potential in the healthcare
setting data need both interpretation
and connection to be useful or as Jen
vandemere has recently put it in an
article data is not a business model
it's only the commodity action based on
wisdom is the valuable resource now this
brings me to my second point about data
disconnected from these social contexts
and Arrangements data are not
communication we saw this in a pilot
project we studied that used a
relatively simple device the Bosch
health
for chronic disease management this was
a program for elderly rural patients who
lived in the sometimes two hours away
from their doctor participants in the
program would answer a simple set of
questions every day and this data was
managed by an algorithm that presented
it to a nurse who and it was coded red
yellow or blue I'm sorry red yellow or
green who needed a follow-up call from
the nurse now using this technology
nurses were able to see 150 patients a
day right they were able to check in on
150 different people a day they saw them
here on this desktop and they connected
to them on that phone this is actually a
picture of their windows-based operating
environment we watched how these nurses
would really do data interpretation on
the fly pretty complex analysis where
they were always adjudicating between an
across variation in their cases based on
their interactions their history the
context of the patient consider then
this quote from one of the patients
about the device the the simple machine
itself it's a machine but it's almost
like it talks to me every day like
someone cares you see their data didn't
have to be validated with a phone call
every day to make them feel like someone
cared just knowing that the data could
lead to a conversation was huge like
someone cares now data are not
inherently communication but given the
right setting they can be this fantastic
opportunity for those conversations and
connections which brings me to my last
point data are not private this process
of making data is always social data are
meaningful only because of how someone
collects manages and make
arguments with that data data is not the
new oil it's hydropower always made not
found the exact wrong question to be
asking today is what are we going to do
with all of this data well except for
that all of us researchers right we're
going to still be asking what do we do
with all of our data um the better
questions though really are data for
whom data when and data why take this
image from the collaborative chronic
care network or c3n their project of the
Cincinnati Children's Hospital now at
the core of their philosophy is using
data building a data ecosystem that is
meaningful valuable and useful for their
different communities of pediatric
patients their doctors and researchers
here's a quote that they list on the
website for inspiration once you open
the possibility that people are not only
using the web as a platform to produce
their own individual content but you
also to pool their efforts knowledge and
resources the possibilities for what
they can create are astounding that's
from Harvard social media theorists
yokai benkler data for whom data when
and data why now in addition to the
social side of data there of course is
another way data are not private to turn
a technology axiom on its head
healthcare data never want to be free k
Crawford here at MSR has argued that
it's really dangerous to think that
large-scale data can be made anonymous
inherently objective or come with a
tacit or explicit approval consent she
and her collaborator Jason Schultz are
tackling the problem of predictive
privacy not
directs breaches in personally
identifiable information but rather
those that predictively approximate our
private information with a high degree
of accuracy security research continues
to show how anonymous data can be re
identified and in fact Latonya Sweeney
has worked with a team that exploited
well-known weaknesses in large-scale
databases to link names and contact
information to publicly available
profiles in the Personal Genome Project
the risks for health data are simply too
high to assume that data without
personal identifiers can remain private
data is not a generic off-the-shelf
product it doesn't come prepackaged
clean reten ready to use right out of
the box our health data should not be
laundry soap it should be artisanal
currently we don't actually have very
good bridges for dated across the social
worlds in health care among patients
clinicians and researchers now to do
that we're going to need real design for
social settings and real practices and I
have a few ideas for how to get there
first we need to have transparent
conversations on what data actually do
as well as what people think their data
are doing people will tell us what they
think is valuable about data if we
listen to the valence a--'s that
resonate in their communities and when
we do that we can start to use data for
their potential to build and foster
those communities data then start to
look a lot less like they belong in a
generic box and much more that they
emerge from a set of relationships this
is what data with empathy looks like it
was in the c3 case c3 NK
and it's here in the rural telemedicine
program that we studied this is a
picture that the nursing team used in
all of their presentations to show why
their work with the Boche health buddy
was so important it also shows one of
the first patients in their study who
died data are not communication
ultimately data alone won't cure us but
these cases from health technology
innovators can show how data can be used
to help us see each other as individuals
respect our multiple communities and to
help people tell their unique stories
let us build the structures platforms
applications and communities that
empower people to link data to empathy
understanding and action thank you
thanks so much Gina next up we have one
of our own hundra's Monroy Hernandez
honors is a researcher at MSR in redmond
but we like to claim him first because
he was a postdoc here in the social
media collective and undresses work is
really extraordinary for the way in
which he looks at how social tools can
be used to foster civic engagement and
also particular kinds of creative
practice over the youngest or topics of
my research is on collective action and
I've been looking at collective action
from many different perspectives one of
the things I've been looking at recently
its collective action through these
technological form which is hashtags and
in some ways you can think of hashtags
as ad hoc collective action in case you
know what hashtags are you know hashtags
are things that people add often two
words on things like Twitter
we'll get cetera to identify categories
and what is really interesting all the
hashtags is that these kind of emerged
organically from people's practices and
this platform to start to kind of
implement mechanisms to you know when
you click on one of these hash that you
see all the messages that have been
tagged that way but you know has that
have become really visible in moments of
crisis and this is the kind of
collective action that I've been really
interested in looking at you know when
this collective action has to happen
quickly and very at work and very
organically so this is a tweet for
example from the tsunami in Japan
obviously with some hashtags and this is
a particular message asking for help we
also seen hashtags in the you know in
crisis related to political events in
you know the Arab Spring and all sorts
of different political movements some of
which we've studied but today I want to
focus on one particular kind of crisis
which is very close to to me I'm
originally from Mexico and as you
progress in the news there is a war
going on in Mexico there's a lot of
people more than 60,000 people have been
killed since the were started in 2006
but one of the interesting things about
the the Mexican drug war is as opposed
to the other crisis like the one I
mentioned in Japan and others people who
live in these cities that are embodying
the drug war are dealing with crisis as
part of their everyday life so you know
an earthquake is the kind of thing that
you might experience one in a lifetime
or maybe twice if you're unlucky enough
but in Mexico people are you know
dealing with you know car bombs grenade
attacks all sorts of crisis in ongoing
basis the same way we deal with traffic
here and one of the differences between
what's happening in Mexico and what we
see in other places that are you know in
crisis is there in you know
traditionally the typical way in which
institutions react to crisis is you know
how you have the government officials
reporting on what's going on and then
you have the media that is kind of
helping broadcast those messages and
bringing information to to citizens so
but what is interesting in Mexico is
that these two institutions are not
doing the roll so on the one hand useful
you have for example in this Washington
Post article how you know journalists
are adhering to a near-complete news
blackout under strict orders of drug
smuggling organizations and their
enforcers who dictate via Daily
telephone call
emails and news releases what can and
cannot be printed or air and again this
is my dinner our journalists in this
place very few general is there you know
to publish things on the mainstream
media because they're afraid of their
lives similarly the new scout the
government officials are also adhering
to a news blackout in these sites the
case of the city of Nauvoo Laredo in the
border with Texas where the mayor
mysteriously disappears for days and
refuses to discuss drug violence and
even the military general who presides
over the soldiers patrolling the city
does not hold news conferences or issue
any statements so again you might enjoy
a person living in this place you have
no information of what's going on at the
same time in Mexico has many other
places in the world we seen an increase
in the adoption of social media and
these couple with weakening institutions
like the ones I mentioned journalism and
and and the government and an increased
violence has led to a kind of really
interesting ways in which people use
social media to communicate what's going
on and again this is work that I've been
doing as part of my postdoc here as well
as some colleagues in ms are in redmond
as well so the kind of thing that i
started to notice kind of anecdotally as
somebody who lives who lived in Mexico
is tweets like this and I'm going to
translate this to English and this is
you know caution and Gonzalez Avenue by
the big supermarket people report the
recent risky situation which is a
euphemism for a lot of these kind of car
bombs and grenade attacks etc and then
the hashtag empty why follow to refer to
you know you can click there and you can
see what's going on in the city circle
if you go to Twitter right now and you
look at the hashtag empty why follow you
will see very accurately what's going on
in the city of Monterey empty why is the
abbreviation for Monterey and follow
just an invitation to follow this
hashtag so we decided to look you know
first you know the basic word frequency
in one of these cities to see what is it
that people are talking about and one of
the things that comes really clearly as
you know people are talking about the
world balacera for example in Spanish is
shooting precaution this also if you
know the city you know that you know
Apodaca is a location whether loop place
another location so people are referring
to things that are going on as well as
the locations were these things are
happening furthermore there is also the
emergence of these kind of set of words
that people often refer to narco
language which we seen also from the
data and so one of the words for example
is an cova hollow which is one day but
they found a body wrap
in a blanket so these are specific words
that have been kind of developed to
refer to all sorts of practices that
these criminal organizations use and
it's a bunch of other words and we've
been looking at the presence of those
words across multiple cities in Mexico
looking at the data from different
cities as well and one of the
interesting things is that these words
are positively correlated to the
homicide data that we see every month in
these cities so again it's kind of a
proxy to see what's going on in these
cities furthermore we decided to look at
again those four cities regno samantaray
Sal tu and Vera Cruz and look at the
frequency of these tweets and the first
thing that we notice is that those
spikes that you see there actually
correspond to big events so for example
in Monterey the city in second here this
big spike or responded to 52 people
killed in a casino that you know happen
at that particular day and the same for
the other cities so again in kind of a
correspondence between what you see
online and what you see on on the
streets the other thing is the spread of
these violence also has gone from north
to south which is the way in which the
cities are order again kind of relating
to how we can perceive some of the
things that are going on the streets
through social media even though we
might not see that necessarily from news
media the other thing that we've been
looking at is that you know personally
when I've been looking at the news
coming from Mexico is that people still
tweet about what's going on but because
this is going on for more than six years
now people are losing kind of the
surprise to this event so a lot of times
people are reporting these kinds of
thing is like Oh yet another you know
person hanging from a bridge kind of
thing so we wanted to see if this is
represented in the data as well and we
shouldn't have found that you know we
there is increase violence increased
numbers of homicides but there is lower
negative effect in the tweets and the
same well the opposite for for dominance
and activation which eric referred to
from the word that they've been doing
with a postpartum depression we use the
same techniques in fact moonmoon the
child is one of the my collaborators in
these and basically these speaks to some
of the literature on effectively since
the sensitization how these three
phenomena occur when when this happens
and the other thing that we were
interested in looking at is like who is
reporting this these things and
we decided to plot the people reporting
these posting these messages across two
axis number of tweets they posted and
number of followers that they have and
what we found is you know you have like
three different categories of
individuals you have people over there
with lots of followers more than a
million followers but very few tweets
and then people in the center and people
over there and hear the people over
there are people like CNN for example so
you have a lot of others and they report
on all sorts of things not only about
Mexico but when they do report about
Mexico they often use these hashtags
that have organically been created by
the community and then you have people
like average citizens who happened to be
you know passing by or seeing some kind
of violent event and they use the
hashtags to report and then you have
these other individuals who don't have
as many followers to CNN but they do
have a lot of followers and they also
produce a lot of content and when you
look at what they do what they do is
they often receive messages from other
people and they canna curate them and
then when they receive multiple messages
out about the same event they cannot
broadcast that back to their followers
so if you want to know what's going on
in the cities you can either go to the
hashtag or follow these individuals and
they are acting really as journalists
and the same if you look at the rigid
neural network in this series you notice
the same pattern where these individuals
are the same ones that I show over there
the previous slide so we decided to
actually talk to these people I
obviously as you can email her to talk
to them so these are fake names but you
know I talked to a couple of them and
these are just two two women that I've
talked to who performed this role of
curator and one of them angela has about
25,000 follower when we talked to her
and claudia has about 30,000 followers
and when I asked them for example how
many hours a day did you spend doing
this work Angela said that she spends
over 15 hours a day you know reporting
these events so you can see that they
really are doing this pretty much all
day and the other thing that I asked her
you know how do you see your role so for
Angela's she said you know I am a
journalist it is as if I was work
correspondent on social networks of the
world we are living in Mexico Leiter was
really interesting this is the way she
referred to herself as a war
correspondent for Claudia you know she
says I'm yet another citizen but people
do think of me as an angel as she said
so often times people will you know
whether the road to go from home to work
or vice versa is safe to navigate the
other thing that is really interesting
about these phenomena is that these
individuals and people reporting things
online are being targets of intimidation
both by governments and cartels and I'm
just going to mention two cases this one
happened in 2011 I believe in September
2011 of these two individuals who were
involved in retweeting some messages in
the state of Veracruz and turns out that
some of the messages that they were
retreating were false or at least as by
the government claimed so they were sent
to jail on charges of terrorism for
spreading misinformation on social
networks but again it's really hard to
know in this place is what's
misinformation and what's not given that
there is not like a you know the
journalism journalists are not really
reporting what's going on so the
government or of Veracruz which is the
stage where this happened change the law
to make it illegal to report you know
information than my terrorized others on
social networks and that's still active
the other kind of intimidation is from
cartels themselves as you can mi ahn dae
my not be really happy with this
although i have to distinguish it in two
types of things that people do online
there are some people who report things
that are public like these shootings
which typically cartel don't cartels
don't really mind that much in fact
sometimes they like it is kind of like
publicity for what they do but in other
cases they report on private information
this is what leads to things like these
so these are two people hanging from a
bridge after reporting things on social
media or at least that's what the
banners that they were left next to
their body said so again the cartels you
know going after people who might be
reporting private information and so
kind of going back and trying to analyze
a lot of these these data what are the
things that I was trying to see is
whether this happens in other places as
well and I don't know if you remember
for those of you who live here in
Cambridge about a year ago there was a
shooting here in Kendall Square so I
went online to Twitter again and see
whether people were reporting things and
sure enough I found a lot of people
reporting things even before the
Cambridge Police Department or the news
media was reporting anything one of the
instances things that I found is that
there is this account alert New England
that actually performs this role of
curation of information and this person
I talked to this person on Twitter
Steve and I asked me you know whether
you get the information and he basically
spends a lot of time listening to the
police scanner in here in Boston and
reporting things on Twitter right away
but what is interesting is that you can
see this individual reported back to
this account with an image of what this
person has just seen and I think maybe
from this building actually looking at
that view so basically like not only
this this person is reporting was going
on but they also gained so much
visibility that they have you know all
the individuals sharing data and and you
know images and media etc and but one of
the indices things about these and this
I just put it in storage file another
familiar with this tool it's a tool that
allows you to curate manually curate and
put together a story in the form of a
feed of what's going on so you can do
this and this is a tool that was
developed for for journalists but it has
to be done manually and it's only one
person in this case it was me who put
together this kind of feed so we were
interested in seeing whether they're
more kind of automatic ways of doing
this so we recently released this tool
for scale we have an extended to other
cities that makes it automatic to kind
of to make latent content that is hyper
local container a different
neighborhoods of Seattle and more
visible and doing these cara matically
so if you go to who lead net it's an app
as a web app for mobile phones you can
select your city in only cities around
Sierra and you can select your
neighborhood and you can see what's
going on kind of in a form that is
aggregated to see you know what's on in
your neighborhood and so on and one of
the interesting things about this is
that you know a lot of these information
is typically in the form of feeds like I
show before which i think is fine for
reading quick information especially
about things that you already know about
but if you really know if you if we
really want to know things about you
know perhaps some phenomena that we
don't know as a lot about like you know
some earthquake somewhere else you know
typically wikipedias a really good place
to get a more contextual kind of view of
what's going on so you get like the who
where what and you get a lot richer kind
of information unfortunately for for us
you know Wikipedia only reports on
things that are notable so it's really
important for Wikipedians to report
things that already you know proven to
be right by the media they cannot really
create an
article about something that is just
happening without any report from CNN on
New York Times cetera so I think the
model of Wikipedia was really well
unfortunately doesn't really work for
hyper local information or things that
is they're changing all the time like
the case of Mexico so this summer we
start to look at this at this issue and
we looked at like the kind of importance
or the number of people who might be
interested in a particular set of new so
you have things that are kind of notable
at least from some media and then things
like you know just my tweet of what I
was doing you know a few days ago and
it's a lot in between so you have things
like you know like the seattle times for
example reporting on fireworks in
seattle you know it's relevant to maybe
only people who live in seattle but it's
you know on mainstream media but there
is a lot in between and a lot of this is
often or could be kind of curated and
put together in some form using a lot of
different tools that are available so
what we were interested in doing and
actually we did this with nate matias
this summer one of our interns we looked
at you know is there a way to kind of
aggregate a lot of this information in a
manual way but not only with information
that is already on the media but in fact
information that might be in social
media and kind of put it together in the
style of wikipedia but using sources
like the style of storify from social
media so we've been playing with this
and it's a tool that is available for
better testing and again these tools
basically allows communities to you know
collaboratively create stories in a very
structured way and put together kind of
a wikipedia style of story not as a fee
but an article where not only you can
start writing this together but also you
know ask other people to help so here is
you know me a night and you contribute
an image and then it says sure and then
he uploaded image perhaps nate is at the
place where this is happening so we've
been playing with this for the past few
few months and more recently one of the
things that we're exploring is to you
know there are a lot of scenarios where
there is no one around that event or at
least no one that you know you might
want to write an article but you don't
know anyone who is you know attending
this bike parade or whatever so what
we've been exploring is the possibility
of outsourcing this to kind of crowd
workers so we've been replacing some of
these individuals with TaskRabbit i
don't know if you're familiar with
TaskRabbit that's rabbit is a tool
similar to mechanical turk
son but instead of doing virtual test
you can do physical task in the physical
world so you can pay somebody to you
know go right now to the Boston Common
and take a photo of something or
interview someone so that's what we've
been doing with test drive it so we know
there's going to be an event somewhere
in Seattle for example it could be
anywhere with the task rabbit is
available and we ask them please go
there and take a photo and then put it
on a new spell or go there and interview
someone and so on so hope is that not to
replace these kind of community driven
news but to kind of bootstrap it in the
cases where we don't really have anyone
there or make perhaps you know there
might not be enough interest but the
hope is that through you know
crowdsourcing this kind of news we might
show the possibilities of these kinds of
tools and perhaps engage others in a
more volunteering fashion so with that I
want to close it and thanks Kate yeah
thanks Honduras and last up we have
chalten Gillespie Talton is a professor
at Cornell he is the author of wild shot
and certainly from our perspective is a
group of researchers we find his work
incredibly informative when we're
thinking about the politics of platforms
thanks Tom thanks so I can't help but
comment a bit on I want to echo
something that Kate's at the beginning
about how important it is I think at
least for the social scientists in the
room that this part of the project that
MSR New England represents is
incorporated into the space it's
actually part of this project it's not
something happens after the fact it's
not something that researchers are
encouraged to include it's actually a
part of it I think this panel is really
nice glimpse of the kinds of things that
we can do so we have gina's work saying
you know let's see how these things land
let's see how they fit into people's
lives we can take ondrea's work and say
what can we know about this process by
examining how people take up technology
and then how can we intervene really
powerful and then there's a third one
that I think I'll be trying to do which
is kind of like how do these systems
come to be part of being a sociologist
of technology the the premise is that
technologies are not just water it built
what are engineered right there's a lot
of work that goes on beyond the material
design of the technology how is it
framed how is it governed how is it sold
how is it taken up and the argument of a
sociologist of technology is that all of
that is the technol
g2 because when i go to bing.com to
search i'm not just using an algorithm
I'm using an offer i'm using a resource
i'm using something that's culturally
meaningful i'm using something that I've
encountered before I'm using something
that someone told me was great or awful
or whatever and all that stuff is part
of the phenomenon right so part of
studying IT is studying all of these
processes that make the technology what
it is and that's part of what I want to
do today there was a great I wanted to
comment the other way is to think about
is that Hannah had that great quote
about engineers computer scientists want
to go for the needle in the haystack but
social scientists want to want to
observe the haystack right I want to add
a feature to that because I don't
recognize myself in that some social
scientists want to say a haystack really
where did a haystack come from why a
haystack exactly who put a haystack here
what about hay bales why is it in the
barn why is it in my way what is it
doing right and that's one of the ways
that we get to not just observe but we
get to perturb a little bit so i'll put
that in there okay so here's one of the
things that i've been thinking about a
lot is how online social media platforms
and i mean that in the broadest sense
thinking about Twitter and Facebook and
YouTube thinking about Flickr thinking
about search engines all the sort of
sites that offer up all of the things
that we're saying that they are becoming
are perhaps always have been the keepers
of online public discourse and that role
just like being a publisher of a
newspaper just like being a head of a
broadcast network is increasingly a
position where while you are a private
organization you were also making the
space and making the terms for what
public conversation looks like one of
the interesting things that happens in
that job is the decision on what to
remove so I find it very interesting to
think about how these sites set policies
how they envision themselves as arbiters
of what is appropriate and inappropriate
and especially how they develop
mechanisms and how they decide on those
mechanisms and and enforce those
mechanisms for how they patrol these
sites now it may look like
looking at a very small needle in a very
small haystack but i think if we open up
this feature it will help us see all the
kind of governance that goes on in these
sites the feature is the ability to flag
to report inappropriate content this is
becoming a ubiquitous and a common
mundane element of many platforms most
social media platforms now offer some
way to flag or report that mechanism is
usually at the point of content the
video you're watching the tweet you're
reading the blog posts the comment what
have you and it's increasingly emerging
as one of the main solutions to the
problem of how do we manage the amount
of stuff that's going on in these social
media platforms and the ability to
patrol for things like pornography hate
speech excessive violence harassment
spam self-harm comments about suicide
drug use underage activity copyright
infringement right an immense list of
things that these sites have decided
that they're supposed to sort of guard
against the question we can ask is
despite this thing becoming mundane and
tiny and small what if we unpack this
thing what if we looked at the work it
really does not just technical work but
social and political work I want to
highlight the fact that much of what I'm
offering up here is coming out of a
paper that that I wrote with Kate
Crawford so we are both implicated in
this discussion and so so flag s if we
do I don't know I can't make a flag joke
okay
so flagging I almost I've decided which
one to check and I was like no I'm not
going to do that so flagging I want to
argue serves two purposes the first
purpose is this is a relatively logical
solution to the problem of scale so if
you are a broadcast network operator
you're going to look at 30 pilots and
run for you can look at all of them
before they go up right but if you're
running YouTube that's an immensely
difficult thing to do right so instead
of saying we're going to preview all of
this stuff you instead say we're going
to use our community we're going to
outsource this effort this first line of
defense right we're going to crowdsource
it basically and say let the community
tell us what we need to look at and we
need to review so it's a practical
solution at the same time it's a
powerful form of legitimation so it's a
very powerful thing to say we listen to
our community our community guides us as
to what's appropriate and inappropriate
right and we're responsive to them first
and foremost that's not just a nice
promotional thing to say it becomes very
important when say a government starts
to say we should legislate your content
we say no no we have that handled right
and community and community standard in
public interest these are very familiar
terms that work very well inside of a
policy environment okay so as we started
to unpack this flag of sort of draw
attention to it there are first a couple
things that we want to look at right the
first is that the flags for the most
part work on a very limited vocabulary
they have a very narrow bandwidth so
let's think about the implications that
first so in many sites the flag is
literally a binary right you can click
the binary and you can say I have
flagged this content some of these sites
have very little follow-up I'm gonna
stop there for a second you can click
report abuse you can say you've done
this you can submit very simple process
increasingly we see more and more of
these sites adding these kind of sub
menus you click the flag and once you
click it what you get is a list of
what's wrong with it right inappropriate
content violence spam harassment each
one of these sites has kind of a
slightly different way of articulating
this but a similar idea all right give
us a bit of information you take off the
one that it represents you click Submit
sometimes they say thank you and
that's the end of the experience right
YouTube has probably gone farthest
probably not surprising they've got a
set of sub menus right so once you click
this you get a second sub menu you
choose which thing they just recently
added a text box where you can explain
record of to explain your other answer
and you can even indicate a time stamp
so if somewhere in the video is the
particular offense you can indicate
where that is right 500 characters so
make sure you compress your comment so
one thing is that even though we've seen
an expansion of the vocabulary of what
you can say I want to argue in a minute
that it's still a very limited
vocabulary here's a second point which
is you know very little about the
process once you click Submit right so
you flag the content or flag the picture
flag whatever you've told it what
category you think it falls into you
said submit it says thank you and then
your experience in most cases is done
with this you don't know what happens
next you don't know what that process is
you don't know how fast it is you
usually don't know the result unless you
happen to obsessively check that piece
of content and maybe see it went down or
maybe see it didn't write Facebook has
just recently added a feature where not
only can you flag on all sorts of things
on people and images and groups but they
have a support dashboard so all your
flags are registered and you'll get a
report if you check that dashboard or
through your facebook email that says
this has been addressed we have decided
not to take it down and we decided to
take it down but this is an exception so
in mo Kait most cases there's zero
follow-up so despite the expansion right
the recent expansion of the vocabulary
and despite the recent addition and
Facebook about a kind of follow-up
monitoring this is a very narrow
vocabulary for managing the myriad of
concerns that might exist on the side of
users and the information that gets back
to the platform and the operators of it
so for instance there is very little way
to express degree or character of your
concern there is very little room if any
to express to take issue with the rules
there is a very little room in most
cases no room to have a social
engagement around this
shoe right a debate about what's wrong
with it and if you think about this way
there's no alternative flag right so
imagine you see something that you find
offensive but you also think this should
probably stay because it belongs here
because I believe in robust and
sometimes troubling public discourse
there's no button with that right
there's no yes flag so it speaks almost
entirely in a vocabulary of complaint
right when you click that flag it
basically is an utterance that something
like this doesn't belong here and
sometimes it's uh this doesn't belong
here and I think it's porn right that's
about what you can articulate so and and
if this seems nitpicky remember that
this flag is basically just the button
ification of what could be an email link
right they could do all the other things
the flag does I could know which video
it was referring to a good time stamp it
could do all those things you might have
a link that says complaint ? and it's a
link that opens up an email box that
goes to youtube or goes to Facebook
right that already has it built in this
was on this day it was video x right you
you coming from user why but instead
we've reduced that ability to a very
narrow and I would argue data fide right
mechanism offering up those that
sequence of categories is not just
helping you specify what you find
troubling it's not just giving them a
tip on how to move through this
complaint quicker it also gives them
data right in their categories usually
those categories match the sort of
guidelines that's the site has set and
it gives them a data that they can
assess right where these complaints
coming from where are most problematic
categories so it urges our communication
to them our expression of concern into a
very constrained form very low bandwidth
form okay
now all of this presumes that a
complaint that one gets when they get a
flag is an individual and genuine
expression of concern right now that
would be a relatively naive assumption
and of course the sites that deal with
this don't assume that either but the
mechanism would like to think that I was
offended I was genuinely offended I
clicked the flag to indicate such the
reality is there are all sorts of
reasons why people flag they might be
flagging because they are trying to
annoy the person who made the content
they might be flagging as a kind of
release valve they might be offended by
it but they don't actually think it's
against the rules they don't know the
rules right so all of these individual
reasons why you might flag publicity
there been some accusations about music
videos of a racy being flagged by their
publicist so that they would maybe get
banned right so that then they could
talk about how hot they were that all of
these mechanisms nevertheless become a
flag this person flagged at this time
for this video right and reduces all of
that complexity the second as we seen I
don't know why Britney's getting a lot
of name checks in this panel so Britney
feel herself as wrote an excellent
article about a project called Operation
YouTube Smackdown this is a group that
was active from 2007 to as late as 2011
and they were finding and highlighting
Muslim fundamentalist videos urging
their followers to systematically flag
them under the promotes terrorism
submenu of extreme violence under
YouTube they had a video add a twitter
feed so that everyone be sort of
flagging the same video on the same day
they had to sort of bring a websites
that sent this information around and
this is not to the only example right
this is just one sort of prominent
example this group thought of themselves
as engaging in cyber war right a kind of
civilian defense initiative right what
was the phrase Britney had this thing it
was countering the cyber jihad one video
at a time right so a very sort of
militaristic very organized effort and
announcing their triumphs right when
when Al Qaeda groups acknowledge that
their videos we're not getting through
they
purport they served up that news that
they had had effect on here now you
might think about this as a kind of flaw
in the system right boy what a limited
flag that says you can't get any of that
across that must be bad you might think
of it as the cost of doing business if
you're going to monitor this many videos
or this many tweets you have to take a
very sort of desiccated narrow form we
argue that this ambiguity is actually
quite important for platforms right so
having a limited information on what a
flag represents having limited
information about how people's offense
was registered why they were doing
things allows two things one it allows
platforms to engage in ad hoc decisions
they can decide when to listen to those
flags they can decide when to ignore
those flags and they can use different
justifications if they're removing
something based on a flag they can say
our community spoke right and we
listened to them they found something
horrific we a jet we adjudicated it and
they were right when they decide not to
remove something they can say look we
understand that people found this
offensive but this video was publicly
relevant this was important journalism
this was troubling but necessary right
and when they each of these become a
kind of legitimation point where they
can say the flag speaks for us or we
speak despite the flag this kind of
ambiguity not having to respond to or
deal with the kind of information that a
more a richer form would offer is
actually strategically valuable for them
okay let me just skip this little slide
ok our paper ends with an idea Kate had
where we explore what it would look like
to have something like a sort of
Wikipedia discussion page behind each
piece of content what if that were the
kind of mechanism where you reported
where the person who produced the video
could speak to it where you can
adjudicate it it's not a perfect system
but at least raises some of the issues
about what that narrow form means and
what we've what it means that we've come
to rely on it I want to go in a
different direction just for today which
is to say that in some ways the
vocabulary that this flag represents has
itself become
a contested space all right so ask this
question can the flag as a forum bear
the weight that we need it to bear all
right can this little thing can this
tiny little mechanism that adding to a
platform is tiny right it's a modular
little piece of software it exists it's
easy it's it's accepted can it bear the
weight of needing to patrol the site
placate users demonstrate good
governance and in the face of the
bitterest tensions going on today
terrorism rape and misogyny suicide
bullying right is this the mechanism
that we need Twitter recently was
dealing with the fact that a woman who
had been speaking up in the UK they were
thinking about who to add to the
currency and she had said there need to
be more women there was a discussion
about putting jane austen on the
currency that was decided to be that was
decided and then she began to get rape
and death threats all through Twitter
and it wasn't just one person so it was
very hard to deal with this harassment
was she was a public figure it was
hundreds of people and Twitter struggle
with this and talk about what they would
do in the end they said we'll add a flag
we didn't have a flag tweet by tweet now
we do right is that enough can it carry
the weight right we're in Cleese
increasingly we're using these spaces
that can test these heated issues in a
very sort of interesting moment in 2000
when we get the date in 2008 senator
Lieberman sent a very public letter to
youtube and google saying i've
identified these 80 videos they believed
they were muslim fundamentalist training
videos and he said you've got to remove
this this is horrific and youtube had a
very interesting reaction they took some
of them down they didn't take all them
down the issued a statement about how
they defend free speech while they took
half the videos down and then that's
when they added promote terrorism as one
of the submenu spaces right so that
became part about vocabulary right that
was the response now we can think about
the vocabulary is this a place where the
names of what we find most offensive the
categories for understanding what we're
struggling with are being articulated
here's the last thought is it that when
I flag a video because i think it's
violent
and when operation YouTube smackdown
sends that video around on their tweet
and flags it and when Senator Lieberman
sends a letter are we all in some ways
flagging although certainly Minh has
quite different resources to do so are
we all in acting that same dynamic that
has been built in right the vocabulary
of complaint both YouTube's ability to
distance itself and its obligation to
respond as a sort of community mechanism
is that the structure of oversight that
we've engineered okay stop there thanks
if I could just invite all of the
speakers up for just a short session of
questions before you wrap up got
everybody getting reem aight questions
yeah we have one of the back Jessup
please
yeah thanks so I think that yeah so the
question was is Paris is there is there
a way to think of a parallel between
flagging inappropriate discourse and
sort of historic tactics about flagging
people for being inappropriate for
violating social norms or crimes
whatever I think the key difference is
that part of what is interesting and
problematic here is how invisible the
flagging is right so part of that you
know branding someone literally branding
someone is a kind of like we're going to
make this violation visible on you to
your community right I think one of the
things that people struggle with here is
that not only is the complaint sort of
drop into a hole right it now belongs to
flickr belongs to Twitter or whatever
but also even the process by which it's
resolved is often invisible Twitter's
are making some different policies about
that when they're asked to take
something down from a legal perspective
trying to emphasize a kind of
transparency this has been removed and
the letter goes up but I think that's
still unusual across its colleagues so I
mean it's an interesting comparison but
I think the key is almost the commitment
to invisibility as opposed to the clear
commitment to visibility in the examples
that you're talking and we just have a
question here the fun we could have a
more complete picture
subculture you mentioned this offensive
but maybe there's place here looking at
4chan i know that i'm lagging because
someone is about that what about if you
have you know what mention it at the end
having disposed around appropriate mess
like that disgusting pages and so ready
to get a get a broader signal yeah i
think it was i think it started with a
kind of needing to recognize at this
forum which has become quite common and
not just on social media platforms but
on you know journalism you know comment
sequences and you know smaller social
media sites i can be built into a Ning
it can be built into all sorts of
mechanisms so the widespread pneus of
this very desiccated one I think we try
to point out that wikipedia has a kind
of discussion environment that's quite
different read it handles these things
quite differently in the sense that like
there's a lot more discussion about
right that 4chan does a lot through Dan
never to start with it through sort of
social shaming and social norms so it's
not as if this is a sort of one size
fits all but at the same time I think it
I think a clear case you made that this
format and how it's generally managed as
a relatively small feature to solve this
problem is widespread and is getting
held up as the solution that proves that
we're doing something right and the
solution is going to manage an archive
of the scale next question here just
best thanks
we see the same thing we've seen the
basement
resulting in an old
so we're taking these beats in the
individual it seems
fragile so how much what kind of
reinforcement is necessary for these
things
it's not about the technology
it's a great question so briefly to
state the question back how is it what's
the balance between people feeling
connected through their data and people
having a really shallow experience and I
actually think that that's something
that needs to be built and the core of
the design so a recent study that I saw
presented looked at male young male
smokers in Quebec in a smoking secession
cessation program and they was by text
right so simple communication they would
a simple algorithms that would give the
participants back a text in response to
something they text and the participants
were told well you know this is a
basically a robot that's going to text
you and seventy-five percent of the
participants to texted back thanks for
the advice that was exactly what I
needed to hear so you know that the the
people in the program we studied felt
connected because they were actually
made to feel connected in the program
right they they knew the nurses they
talked to the nurses the nurses worked
very hard to integrate that data into
plans of care for the doctors the
patients doctors so you know I think you
know part of the story would be yes
there are ways to automate aggregate
information but we need to remember that
if we create designs to help people be a
part of a community and and act with
that data responsibly then we end up
with something that's much more powerful
we create an opportunity not a
replacement for communication I mean
what just to add a feature that wouldn't
it be it's easy but I worry too easy to
sort of say the move to data equals the
move to dehumanization right and in sub
audiences we need to say that because
there's kind of like an enamored so the
data is the solution everything but you
know what if we thought it a lot of it
as we've always had a tension between
procedural ization and sort of ad hoc
human interaction
so that moment when we walk through the
DMV and we feel like we were just a
number and we feel like we got the
canned response that's a dehumanizing
moment to that didn't require any data
necessarily it required algorithms but
they were algorithms about like what do
i do first what do I do if you asked for
this what do i do whatever I send you to
form 17 I send you to line 12 and and we
have that tension we're like if we want
to do the human interaction it takes
longer it's harder to sort of train and
so you know and so all the benefit we
get about procedural ization gets a
scale and scope and you know insights
across many situations and that's a
human procedural ization and a
computational procedure ization now with
powerful computational tools we're
moving into a realm where you can't do
the other one right so if you're talking
data on the on the tens of millions
there's no much there's not much of an
alternative in this sort of humanized
version so that's why it feels like it's
one of the same but I almost think that
kind of procedural ization is key to
what the data commitment is and that's
the thing that we've struggled with
already about human connection birth and
sometimes we get value out of an inhuman
connection I mean that's what's weird to
write that makes us qualitative neyo
institutional lists really and on that
fantastic note thank you so much for
being part of this session if you could
please thank our speakers I'll move to
afternoon tea
