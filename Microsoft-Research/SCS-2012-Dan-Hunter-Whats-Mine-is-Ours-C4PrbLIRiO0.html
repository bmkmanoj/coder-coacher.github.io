school our mystery opportunity for me to
talk about something which I've been
playing around with for a long time I'm
a trademark lawyer as well as a guy that
doesn't bother cyberspace kind of stuff
internet things a lot of time looking at
virtual communities and playing warcraft
I'm really interested in the sense that
we have about ownership what we actually
think of as ours or dimensions because
mine so this is this particular
presentation is going to focus on the
idea of on the shipment and belonging
and it's a way of actually connecting I
think some of the stuff we talked about
earlier today in the fashion arena to
some other things are going to be
talking about in the next one I don't
think this is moving we're on ok so the
conference theme is the changing nature
of the public and so here I want to try
to connect the ideas idea of ownership
to the idea of what we think I was
publicly home at the moment think office
of power try the topic that that we
talked about is this idea of what's mine
is ours so when we think of things that
are our it's right that is that a shared
ownership you are really going too fast
that's top 15 seconds even when we think
of the ownership of that we think of
things which are in the public domain
that are the politic right so here of
course you looking at me some examples
of your fisheries or forest but also
open source communities writing some
people think like within this particular
kind of agree
internet and social computing arena of
the idea of those things which are open
source which we all you know actually
share our people with giving it away so
why do people give this stuff away and
there's a perception I think that this
is in part altruistic and part a kind of
like a religious or ideological kind of
conception but I want to present a
different kind of conception these are
illusions on cases which were watching
recently there are Elizabeth Taylor's
it's pretty clear who's they were right
they were hers and what I wanted to
suggest that in fact I'm gonna share of
things which are ours there's also in
partnership about those things which are
just mine so the normal kind of
conception of what we think of is why we
have a private property is this the most
efficient way of allocating resources
right it's just economics but what I
want to suggest is that there's a really
deep seeded need for individuals to own
things in order to be able to express
their selves with in the world right
that in fact ownership of things but is
deeply a part of our sense of identity
I'm the easiest way of giving this
example rights to think about the things
that actually you really care about but
that are not particularly valuable I'm
particularly focused on this one at the
moment because I lost a ring that my
brother bought for his wife and boy am I
in trouble if you look at other kind of
areas like the gerontology literature
what happens when people move from their
houses into assisted living is they pick
very specific material objects they
don't pick the things that are really
economically valuable the big the things
that
they're like photographs or rings and
the like and when you think about the
fashion material that we talked about
earlier today right there was there's a
really big focus when when people are
presenting themselves within the world
right about what sort of status
indicators they actually have so I spent
that's been quite a bit of time
interviewing with women about their
handbags and the nature of the grounds
cuz I'm a trademark attorney so became
single and then and so what it meant was
that it actually start to talk to them
about why they care about fendi bags or
wire sell bags or why they were never
owner vuitton bag and this was
interesting to me in the way in which
they actually presented is that it was
part of their self-expression because
when my previous life actually spent a
lot of time talking to players have
bought of warcraft about why they up to
a particular interest and love of these
particular mouths or this particular
scored and it wasn't about the
statistics the attributes of these
things generated it was about forms of
self-expression and meaning within those
particular arenas we see this in lots of
areas that's not just online or brands
and so on you know the northwestern
american indian tradition of potlatch
where we're at right actually destroy
items in order to be able to demonstrate
how powerful they were is really a
significant part of personal position
within that particular arena so coming
back to the initial idea of this
conception of the public i want to
suggest that that our conception of
public ownership is tied into our
individual conception of personal
ownership that even though i don't own
central part i have no exclusive right
to it then in fact I have a really
really strong sense of personal
ownership of certain spaces within there
in the same way as I have a really
strong sense of personal ownership of
bars that I don't also on right these
are places that are mind these are
things which are just like online so the
idea going to suggest
here is that the conception of the
public and what amounts to commons and
open source of all the sorts of things
that we really care about with it some
right now is really about about a shared
sense of this thing is mine collectively
right and so in effect we're not talking
about a religious or an altruistic since
that this is the reason why people
actually contribute to these kind of
arenas that in fact they actually open
it individually but we share the
concessionary collectively thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
