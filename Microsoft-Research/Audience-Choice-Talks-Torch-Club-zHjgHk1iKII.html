you
so we had nine people but one of them
has gone m.i.a so now we have eight
people and we are going to start all of
this off with Hilary Mason and hi
everyone so I'm Hillary I'm a computer
scientist which is important to
understand the context of this talk
which is intelligence amplification
artificial intelligence and why we don't
have more of these things today and if
you feel like tweeting at me at see
Jason um I will apologize in advance
because this was totally not prepared so
I basically just pulled some quotes and
pictures off the internet and one of
them's a really cute monkey um so this
is a mural I grew up loving this used to
be in the the exit to the ride called
horizons at Epcot Center at disney world
and it's called the prologue and the
promise and it's by Robert recall who is
actually an artist who was hired to draw
a what spacecraft would look like oh I'm
actually taller than somebody that's
that doesn't happen very often um to
draw it spacecraft would look like in
space and and Disney commissioned him to
make this one of a kind girl for for
this ride to sort of talk about the
enhanced promise of humanity and if you
look at goes time happens as we go to
the right you see sort of like our
historical great monuments and then our
families of all different racially
stereotyped people and then we see the
future where we're all living in space
and yet this hasn't happened instead it
is 2014 and if you go on a site like
reddit you'll find questions like this
this is one of the the nicer things you
find on reddit for those of you who
haven't been there yourselves it's a
pretty awful place sometimes also pretty
creative but somebody asked if someone
from the 1950s appeared today what would
be the most difficult thing to explain
to them and here's the answer all right
I have a device in my pocket that is
capable of accessing the entirety of
information known to man and I use it to
look at pictures of cats and get in
arguments with strangers right so
congratulations computer science this is
where we are um let's go back in time so
if you want to learn nothing else of
value for me
tonight I can tell you how to make
animated gifs work in keynote so in 1956
this book was published and entered
introduction to cybernetics this was a
tome that was written to help scientists
who thought that the new science of
cybernetics in computing was too
technical for them to use in their
practice so it was really a you know
everyone should get behind using
computing in science because it's the
future and it was also the first use of
the phrase intelligence amplification
the idea was scientists would have their
intelligence amplified through the
beautiful mechanism of computing and in
1962 Doug Engelbart who m who wrote some
beautiful things and of course is pretty
famous in those communities I don't need
to tell you about it but increasing the
capability of man and in 1969 Fred
Brooks who had been at IBM working on
the the 360 system went over to UNC
Chapel Hill it was the second computer
science academic department in the
country at that time so they could
choose what to focus on and they chose
computer graphics and he in fact said we
have the new set the necessaries to
build an intelligence amplifying system
in which the minded machine will
cooperate and he asked you know who
deserves to have their intelligence
enhance vesely um and he actually got
back a list of people who were so
deserving from his Provost um and he
looked through the list and from this he
came to the conclusion that not only was
it important that they enhance people's
cognitive capacity but that they solve
problems that affect people's lives and
he chose based on this to work on some
chemistry problems which actually have
not yet been solved today um so let's go
back to 2014 and what our internet looks
like and it's you know full of monkeys
doing monkey things we're starting to
see this actually get applied in science
and it's awesome this quote is from
communications of the ACM last month
it's from this article where they're
talking about a really cool project
where computer scientists work with
linguists to help read arrive the
primitive or language from which our
current spoken languages have descended
by understanding things like mutation
rates and language and it's a great
example because it's something that
linguists could not do on their own
the cognitive requirements of this
problem are outside the scope of the
human mind and yet computer scientists
would never have solved it without
linguists because what do we know about
language and so it's beautiful but it's
only one example so computer computation
should give us super powers and I'd like
to encourage people to think more about
that and to make awesome things on the
internet and thank you very much drink
more this is my turn um hello this isn't
flat is another Oh fine detective him no
talk for this hello um yes what was my
topic um playing improvised music the
rednecks which is a sticky catch-all
term for talking about house concerts in
between 1999 and 2006 a lot of my gigs
as a solo bass player were two other
bass players because outside of that
world being a solo bass player sounded
more like a dare than a job and so it
was kind of like the forfeit that
someone had to pay when they got
something wrong but by 2006 I'd realized
that the expectations of other bass
players was ruining the way that I
played I didn't want that I didn't want
to sit full of a bunch of people who
were listening to me with their eyes I'm
going all that looks clever so I ditched
my most of my audience handful of them
came with me by 2007 um I'd met my now
wife and we'd started to look at
interesting ways of touring because
she's a musician as well and we both
just got on Twitter and I sent out a
tweet ash I think it was beginning two
thousand eight that we did this I sent
out a tweet saying it was to book us for
a house concert and 30 people responded
25 of which turned into gigs and so we
went this is really easy this is great
and but what was most interesting was
that a lot of those people who booked us
had never heard us very few of them had
any idea what they were getting into
with the solo bass part of it
and so we ended up touring everywhere
from Milwaukee and then was I think as
far north as we went wizna Nebraska it
was as far west lake charles louisiana
was as far south and somewhere upstate
New York I think was as far so we kind
of did a bit of a loop in a rental car
but there were a couple of glorious
moments when we realized that the person
who booked us was obviously trusted
within their community and so everybody
showed up so we playing to 30 people
most of whom thought that the idea of
listen to coldplay was a bit radical and
so I got up with a base and a bunch of
looping toys and things and played what
was sort of cinematic ambient
electronica with electric bass while
they look like they were witnessing a
human sacrifice and this goes big hair
and painted nails in the fur coat so
we're watching a transvestite play weird
 what's going on but but the context
was kind of what made it work and I was
able to meet them halfway and I bought
them quite a long way on their cultural
journey and I learned a lot about just
how wrong my stereotypes were about
people in the Midwest and something
magical happened that the music became
rather than the music being the kind of
key to a transaction about my
specialness on stage it became a meeting
point it became sacrament around which a
bunch of people came and met each other
and we had we did a gig in in dallas on
the same tour where the halftime
conversation between the members of the
audience was what their favorite gun and
knife show they'd ever been to was okay
we're on Mars what the this is as
mad as people and yet they were lovely
and so that their put their
understanding of what what music relied
music was about was messed up my
understanding of what crazy rednecks
were about was nicely messed up and and
everybody went home having had a
fantastic evening and we put the plane
two numbers of people that in any other
kind of venue would have been disastrous
but the economics of it worked out as
well because of this gratitude thing I
was talking about le monde we did a gig
in Chicago to six people and may 250
bucks and normally plenty six people
would be the point in which you give up
and go home and for us it was like
brilliant we did it was played 26 people
tomorrow night as well and so we
discovered an entire
new way of taking music without
preconception music that didn't have to
fit a box music didn't have to fit
someone else's genre classification as
though it was being put in a section in
Virgin Megastore and play it to
like-minded lunatics all over the world
thank you
okay so thanks everyone for asking me to
make this presentation first of all I
just want to say that genetically
modified foods in China is a category
that is newly emerging but it's existed
for quite some time and I want to give
you the take-home message at the very
beginning which is that GM foods like
anything else is actually part of state
making in 21st century China this is an
image from the Beijing Olympics from
2008 this is a stunning moment we're all
50 nashua 52 ethnic minorities of China
were there to carry the PRC flag another
very huge say project as you might well
know of is actually the Three Gorges Dam
what I like about this image is
precisely you see this mythical three
gorges which no longer exists see more
it's been a lot of villages have been
submerged in people displaced and then
of course the Chinese Aeronautics Space
Program which there's an image not only
the first three taiko nuts but also the
first woman Tycho night and then we come
to rice which is actually a part of the
state craft of ancient China that all
the waterways all of the crops that were
available in agriculture was very much a
part of the creation of ancient China
whole dynasties have completely fallen
away by not being able to provide enough
rice so the importance of rice is
something quite significant back in two
thousand as we know there was the human
genome sequence that was you know
pronounced it was delivered to then
President Clinton and very shortly after
that in 2002 there was the rice genome
project initially was the international
project where there were over 12 nations
but what happened in 2002 was that the
Chinese scientists were able to publish
in nature the rice genome and this was a
huge leap largely because the
seeing that was available at the time oh
and that's we know now bgi Beijing
genomics Institute has largely dropped
the price with you know these huge
sequence machines now why rice what's so
significant about rice the reason is
because simply food insecurity rather
than food security is a very part very
huge part of social memory here's an
image of you know a huge constant
drought that is part of daily life for
many World workers and peasants across
China and this is actually part of a
bigger project I've been writing about
regarding biotechnology in China most
people really think about biotech and
China's first generation where it's
really about trying to have
drought-resistant plants or pest
resistant plants but very quickly as we
all know it's gone very quickly now to
second generation biotech and that's
about bio amplification or
biofortification so for instance the
recent scandal about golden rice which I
won't have time to talk about tonight
but just will gesture to and mention
that's a huge issue having said that
however the notion of of GM foods in
China is an evil category is simply not
something that really exists partly
because that if you remember that
earlier slide of food insecurity food
security is far more important being
able to have enough food for a
population that's projected to grow from
1.4 billion to 1.6 billion by 2020 is
something that it's still on the minds
of everyone so what we have in China is
this growing interest by the elite not
dissimilar to what happens here in this
country or elsewhere in the world Europe
especially where you have the elites
that are concerned more and more about
organic food so there's actually there
is a green label this is the organic
label in China but in the meanwhile even
though food security it continues to be
the gravest concern for not just Chinese
officials but also ordinary people what
is increasingly becoming more and more
grave concern is the food safety crisis
i'll be talking a little bit more about
this with regards to the regulatory
mechanisms tomorrow i just want to
gesture to that this is an issue that
everyone has been deeply concerned about
island on the everyday and so i'm just
going to end with this image this is a
wonderful image it's a website that was
produced by a chinese graduate student I
and it's I forgot it's a Giroud tawan
which means throw out your food out the
window and so it's basically a website
documenting from 2004 to 2011 all the
different scandals and different
examples which there have been
contaminated tainted foods that have
been reported in China so it's a
fascinating website I highly recommend
you look to that to look at the ways in
which citizens sciences starting to
transform the ways which we think about
biotech in China so by way of ending I
just wanted to say that genetically
modified foods is increasingly becoming
more and more of a category and it's
going to resemble perhaps euro-american
discourses precisely because of food
safety crisis so thanks very much
hi
so so in 1993 I wrote an article for the
new magazine why it's not forwarding
here exciting slideshow so in 1993 I got
an article a brand new magazine called
wired I actually didn't think that this
magazine was going to survive too long I
was thinking to ask my expenses up front
but it was about this group called
cypherpunks and that got me into writing
about cryptography and all during the
1990s I wrote about the Clipper Chip
wars and the crypto Wars of the 90s and
wound up writing a book about it which
came out in the year 2000 and I dealt
with all the issues of about it then but
one regret that I had during the course
of research in the book was I never got
to go inside the NSA across what the
triple fence and it's highly protected
and you know and see what that was like
I actually did talk to someone who is in
the NSA but they maybe meet him outside
the grounds and the National Cryptologic
Museum that was there so that was back
then and that's Paul of course with all
the Snowden leaks and you know the
controversy about what we learned about
the NSA is doing wired where I now work
wanted to follow up on it and they
assigned me to write a story which is
actually appearing just now on the issue
coming out it's already online about the
NSA and the angle we decided to take and
right up our alley it's about the tech
companies you know what was the effect
of all this stuff on them yak on their
reputation this is actually an
illustration it appears within the
article there so I got all the tech
companies to agree with me Microsoft and
Google and Apple and Facebook but I
thought I should also go to the NSA and
see what they would do my expectations
were pretty low and when I first
contacted them you know that sort of
backed up my expectations they said well
maybe we could have you submit questions
by email and then you know we would
reply anonymously by email which was
pretty much
which is pretty much what I faced with
you know the first time around but then
all of a sudden things change pretty
drastically they said well maybe we
could get someone to talk to you then
finally he said well maybe you can come
to visit like this week and I said Wow
and yeah and I didn't know who I was
going to talk to her whether I would get
in the on the grounds then they asked me
some questions thing it before to make
sure I can get in like my social
security number and when I was a citizen
and they wanted to know the make model
and serial number of my tape recorder
this is my tape recorder I open it up to
get the serial number and I gave that
information and they said okay look
here's the information you know how to
go so I went down Baltimore wasn't
expressway and took the exit and I went
through all these complicated
GateHouse's and proved who I was and had
to park in a sign parking space they
gave me and then I walked in there and
and to my relief i was in the actual
building the iconic building you see
every time you see a snowden leaked they
show a picture of that building so so i
got in and I immediately realized you
know something that I knew but it really
brought home to see everyone walking
around and a lot of people were in
military uniforms and the NSA is part of
the Department of Defense this is sort
of a window in their thinking and
because the kissa demselves warriors to
protect this as soldiers and yeah
they're disappointed that people don't
thank them for their service like the
way we do the rest of the soldiers they
are because in their mind set they are
protecting us as much as the soldiers
overseas are and as a matter of fact
they made a point to show me on the wall
there the names or sometimes just the
markets of when they can't use the names
of people who had fallen who had died
working for the NSA to protect us there
so they ushered me to this conference
room and to my relief I was going to
talk to these top people the general
counsel Raj day was there the woman who
was in charge of all the partnerships
private partnerships the NSA had and
this fellow named Rick ledgett it was a
very high official who was in charge of
something called the media leaks
division there which basically was
created for the Snowden damage control
you saw him in 60 minutes also and then
in walks general Alexander the director
of the
say and he kicked off the session it was
like two and a half hours of me at gang
to ask NSA anything I wanted so what did
I ask so I talk hasn't about prison
which I still been trying to figure out
the company's really didn't know
everything about it and it really is
that the program by which the companies
are compelled to provide information and
there was some things that came from
from the slides that were released you
know leaked by Snowden and written about
and The Washington Post in The Guardian
they just didn't seem to square the
companies were saying and they said that
was because the the slides were done for
an audience that's already knew all the
code words and things like that so not
misunderstanding just arose as it turns
out the misunderstanding is a big deal
for them they really fail that you know
the reason why they're under such heat
is that people don't understand it they
in their view they collect these
haystacks and and that's what the big
information they collect and we get get
nervous about that they said well they
get all the metadata about all our phone
calls but to them that those haystacks
really don't really exist they act like
they're not there and they're only a
privacy threat until they actually
access them and when they access them
yeah and I believe there's a lot of
rules and regulations and minimization
that takes place whenever they see you
know in you know the prism hey stock
evidence that someone's a US citizen or
even though it has a green card they
have to back off and get other you know
permissions and things like that so in
their view the collection is not a
danger to us and a constitutional
violation it's the access something Isis
accessing of it and there's rules for
that I said well that's finding good
right now because you know you know
you're wonderful people and the
president's a wonderful guy but what if
Nixon was the president what if a J
Edgar Hoover type was the head of the
NSA and they were using it against us
and they said don't worry about that
because in that case or people they are
you know are very conscious of things
and they would all go in the inspector
general's office and they would like
complain and the line would be longer
than Disneyland in you know to drop a
dime on the people who are abusing your
you know your your rights there and you
know I actually put in the story
outline the story and then I said well
considering what's happened the
whistleblowers in the past they would be
in for a ride wilder than anything
Anaheim had to offer so so finally I
asked him about we talked about Snowden
there and they really hate at snowden
and even though they acknowledged there
was a value to the debate we were now
having they just wouldn't give him the
credit for doing it there they just felt
that he was a person who betrayed his
country who betrayed them who put us in
danger there and they really don't don't
like the guy but I have to say that I
owe him something because ed Snowden
because the NSA has the response the
public got me in there thanks head
alright alright so when we pass the key
words around when we went around for
talk slides I thought of a keyword and
it was just a medicine tactic variable
but you guys wanted it so here it is
minimum viable lifestyle alright so one
of my favorite coat quotes from coco
chanel is when accessorizing always take
off the last thing you put on I think
that's very true because people you know
people do too much they do more than
they need to in their life they think
that everything is helping them to
accomplish their goals but that's not
true so the question is you know what
are the accessories you should take off
over your life so I'm a big believer in
the Nietzschean becoming in the velocity
of iteration of self and I think that
this just like you know your access to a
gym is proportional to the inverse of
the square of the number of features or
baggage you carry in your life so we
want to nudge you toward parsimony of
features in your life so that you can
iterate and become a better person
alright so I'm just going to offer you
10 tit bits because this is a
five-minute talk a crowd that wears
black so if you had a crowd that wears
all black and standing outside a
nightclub and a crowd of people wearing
sort of all colored clothes I would
challenge you that the people who were
wearing all black they're more
individualistic they're more interesting
and actually much more diverse then
there you go okay so thanks for
recognizing that Lily um so I so my
concept for you and my my teasers
everyone has the same size feature space
polygon count in life and i would say
that monochrome adds like myself have an
advantage because we economise over
color space we don't blow all of our
features on our wardrobe okay so
also if you wear black nobody is going
to notice if you wear it over and over
again that's very helpful in life okay
denim if you have denim you don't need
to be washing it all that much or if
ever at all APC a French fashion brand
they're very clever they have a line of
denim called Butler jeans so the idea is
you can wear something out a raw denim
for six months and then turned it in for
a huge discount and someone else will
pay you know four or five figures for
your you know Warren Warren in denim and
the idea is that they say in the Middle
Ages people used to not wear their own
chain mail they used to get Butler's for
them to wear in their clothes for them
and its really nice because if you once
you realize you don't actually need to
be washing your denim all that much you
don't need to be owning all that much
denim and in fact I don't okay so I
traveled I travel a lot I like to travel
to you know Southeast Asia for two weeks
at a time on a very very small you know
10 liter backpack and people are like
well is that sanitary you know can you
get away with it and you have to realize
that like packing intelligently is very
important and underwear and undershirts
are the limiting reagent of your travel
you don't have to pack multiple pairs of
pants multiple shoes your your
toiletries bag can be very small but you
need a lot of underwear so I'm not
asking you to economize underwear just
remember that um the shampoo conditioner
industrial complex I was not drinking
when I read this light I gin I mean so
the story is I used to use shampoo and I
no longer up for over a year i haven't
used shampoo and think about it you wash
your hair your hair gets dry and brittle
then you use conditioner because your
hair is dry and brittle and your hair
you know gets nice and moisturized 45
seconds but then over time your hair
gets oilier you wash your hair more you
rinse repeat
because you need it and so they've
created this fictive product inserted
this need in your life that didn't need
to exist at all it because most people
say oh when I stop shampooing my hair
gets really oily that's just a recoil
effect so just get over it you know go
for especially if you're a guy go for it
for a few weeks and you'll see that you
don't need shampoo and conditioner you
just need some hot water to remove some
the excess oil and there's a lot of
reasons to avoid shampoo sodium laureth
sulfate being one of them it's a
surfactant it's very bad for you if
they're sodium laureth sulfate in your
toothpaste also it will give you canker
sores stop using it sports you don't
need to watch it because I used to watch
sports and after I stopped I got twenty
percent more time back alright so the
hegemony of recipes recipes are really
really complicated and not for I think
for pretty arbitrary reasons I have a
lot of chef friends and they confessed
to me that they have written recipe
books they they have recipes that
they've never cooked alright so why are
you following that so I think that the
way to do it is to cook for yourself
it's much more delicious cooked single
vegetables take you know some celery try
to steam it saute it braise it you know
do whatever you want understand the
vegetables build a personal relationship
with vegetables like you do with Jesus
all right prophylactic panaceas i was on
a litter a shin kick so i'm a big
believer in panaceas because they are
very economical one of my favorites is
saline so if you get you feel like
you're getting sick you can irrigate
your sinuses your ear canals your throat
with it I also use saline to style my
hair because you know as you know the
Ozzy's figured out that they call a surf
spray that surfers have really nice hair
well sailing is a great texturizer take
a really good multivitamin one way to
tell how good your multivitamin
is beyond all the BS the marketing BS is
look at where what the source of vitamin
E is there's actually eight or nine
forms of vitamin E and the cheapest one
is alpha tocopherol that is synthetic
it's from petrochemicals and you don't
want that one so you want the one that
has you know the best distribution
vitamin ease there's a lot of other
panaceas like adaptogens ginger turmeric
holy basil talk to me about it a weak
ties there is a really insidious uh
paper in the journal of sociology by
Mark granovetter in 1973 that everyone
sites that's the strength of weak ties
okay so I think people like got the
misimpression that they should be
networking I personally hate networking
and I think that it's much better just
to make real friends like friends you
really want to hang out with and just
stop networking because the few strong
ties you have if you wait all of your
connections by the strength of your ties
like strong ties will get you a lot
further like AK friends the metaphysics
of presence so um something that my
friend my good friend Linda stone cued
me into was our common therapist who is
a an existential investigator and she
helped to Q me into something that also
i read from a book called the Zen of
motorcycle of the art of motorcycle
maintenance which is this idea this
quality of being present none the not
the millisecond before and that the
millisecond after but being present
because that is like a news feed a
better facebook feed than facebook you
should be in on this and this this is
like really really good stuff to read
compartir so i used to i feel like be a
functional alcoholic and then I
discovered that white wine masks kind of
alcoholism pretty well but I found
another drink was more economical than
white wine even which is comparing so
you start with a Negroni which is
compartir
vermouth you can move to a ver you can
step down later in the night tune
americano then you can step down to a
compartir soda something lighter would
be an apple soda but all very much like
camp re and you can I like these feature
I like these alcohols that you can build
like a whole spectrum of drinks out of
anyways that's an arbitrary deck for you
that's good all right you guys um so for
the next few minutes I'm going to talk
about rumor transmission and how you can
get these kind of runaway communicative
processes that lead to rumor panics
apparently if you say the word satanic
panic everyone says who no one hear
about that um so just a little
background my research recently has
focused on informal communication
dynamics during disasters and crisis
events I'm using online data and rumors
are particularly interesting I think in
this case because they have real effects
on public safety not only that but
during this context you have situations
where information could be life-saving
so individuals are less likely to filter
it because of the high cost of not
passing it on so I promised I would talk
about satanic panic and what I'm going
to do is just present a quick case study
this is a case that was studied by
Jeffrey Victor back in the 1980s I'm at
the famous one of a rural town in New
York so appropriate to our current
setting and that became totally
convinced that a satanic cult was out to
kidnap their children and sacrifice
their virgins so this is a particular
interesting case to study as a
sociologist but because what seems like
from the outside illogical group
behavior turned out to be fairly logical
given the context and the social
processes that were happening at the
time so let me introduce the case study
just a little bit so the story takes
place as i mentioned in rural New York
in the late 1980s and in this particular
town Jamestown New York as well as the
whole surrounding area this whole group
of people were passing along these
rumors that this dangerous satanic cult
was going to infiltrate their town so
people are hearing these stories about
secret meetings going on in the woods
people are reporting instances of animal
sacrifice and kidnappings of children
suicides and everything is going on in
particular the culminating event here
was that everybody was convinced that
the cult was going to kidnap a blond
blue-eyed virgin and sacrifice her on
Friday the 13th so this is what's going
on all the people in the town are
reporting these very strange events and
the police have to start investigating
because everyone's very scared so the
police are investigating they're not
really sure what's going on they
discover zero evidence that this cult is
practicing or doing whatever they will
be in this town um but despite the fact
that there's no evidence the rumors had
a really big impact on the town so
people are keeping their children home
from school absence rates are up by like
four times their normal instance and
young girls are afraid to walk around in
the town they're staying at home because
they don't want to be that blonde girl
that gets sacrificed and everybody's
freaking out so on the surface here this
is a very extreme reaction but if you
think about some of the social processes
that occurring in this is exactly what
Victor did in this study then some of
these things tend to make a little bit
of sense um so one thing that was going
on that I thoughts particularly
interesting is the effect of shared
emotions so in this case people are
actually on edge about entirely
different things so they were very
concerned with their declining economic
status things were going on to just make
them anxious and so what turned out is
that the context and the cultural
effects of their shared prior beliefs in
what was a credible threat made them
more receptive to this information I'm
so this key reason why the bizarre
rumors are taken seriously by many
people is that they felt it would be
sort of unwise to disregard them in case
they were true in addition to that as
someone who studies social networks this
is a really fun case because what Victor
actually discovered was going on is that
the underlying social structure here was
affecting the communication process so
people were hearing these reports from
their children about weird things that
were happening at at school then parents
were talking to each other and in this
very small town the underlying social
network had the cyclic process going on
so if I told so many information they
passed it on they pass it on and all of
a sudden I hear that information from a
seeming third party and it reinforces my
own belief that that's credible
information so you have this very weird
sort of cyclic process going on and
everybody's getting their information
confirmed by third parties and are
pushing our beliefs to come more and
more extreme because of this process now
another thing that I thought was really
cool is the role of institutions in this
case so the fact just the fact that the
police were investigating everybody saw
that as a sign that there was a credible
threat in these rumors didn't matter
that there was no evidence but the
attention that the police were playing
because they were an authoritative
source everybody bought into that
information so these are just sort of a
few of the social forces that come into
play in this case and it's a combination
of these things that can lead to very
rational behavior which to us seems very
irrational and what happened in this
case everybody you know it comes to be
friday the 13th the town is on super on
edge everybody's panicking nothing
happens and everything kind of just dies
away so that's the end of the story but
I think it's a really interesting
complex situation here because of the
interaction with the communication
process and the underlying social
structure and there are many open
questions to explore with this kind of a
case so that's all I have to say thank
you
alright so I kind of promised you that I
was going to make you fall asleep I
don't know if I will accomplish that but
we'll see so my name is Andreas and I'm
really interesting weird stuff on the
internet and he's one of those things so
a while ago I was looking for I think I
was a laptop or something so whenever I
want to buy something I go on youtube
and look at unboxing videos and if
you're familiar with this whenever you
look for a product it's got on YouTube
and see how people experience unboxing
this product and it's a really good
experience to learn how the product
works and how people perceive it so I
was looking at unboxing video like this
one and what is interesting is that when
I look at the comments people were
obsessed with the voice of the person
talking about it and there were like oh
my god I can't believe you're using like
the rapping thing and that makes me
trigger and they start talking about
this thing called ASMR and I was like
what the hell is this so then I looked
at all the videos around that the
suggested videos and they were all these
kind of mostly women talking in very
soft voices whispering about all sorts
of things so it turns out that this
video was not really about unboxing this
iphone it was really about like
listening to this lady you do something
really in a soft voice so nice Thai
became really interested in this and
found this video in particular let me
see if I can play I think you want your
face payment for free
maybe just a few stars sparkled on your
cheek oh she's no pretending that she's
painting your face thank you and the
video goes for 13 minutes just her like
the integra pinkies and that she uses
the different instruments to paint her
face over your forehead something and
she's one of the most prolific ASMR
artists he's recalling ASM surface and
it was like more than half a million
views there's tons of them it is a whole
community of people and so I became
really interesting how these emerged you
can watch this video at home if you want
fall asleep typical so then I sir three
communities how it came to be that these
people found each other both the people
who whisper who may or may not be
experiencing the SMR experience and the
people who you know want this video's so
I found this is the earliest post on
this health forum on yahoo groups of
this person who was like have you ever
you know listen to you know people with
whispering or people with soft voices
and experience this amazing thing they
call it like brain orgasm or you know
they have all these terminology to use
it and they said you know I google like
weird thing when listening to something
and I found this discussion forum and so
people were like oh my god I can't
believe it you also experience that so
then even this meme was spreading the
community where people were like I can't
believe it has a name and actually the
name was invented by one of the members
of the community who wanted to give more
of a scientific sounding name rather
than brain orgasm and this was very
debated in Wikipedia whether this could
be an article ASMR thing it was removed
several times now he's back on because
he has gotten so much attention but it's
not a scientific term so then i looked
at the earliest post and see what people
were talking about and this is what
Tiggers people experience this brain
orgasm so you can see it's watching
people draw concentrate use something
fixed something or watching a video on
youtube of people doing that so that's
kind of what kind of people start
describing their
triggers as the kinds of things and
actually the classic example for people
to describe this video's is Bob Ross the
painter who speaks really quietly and so
people were also interested in sharing
their first ASMR experience so it was
like when I heard the voice of a teacher
of a guy or a girl or even a broadcaster
apparently NPR broadcasters are the best
triggers for the then people describe
where they feel this is your neck your
head your skull the arms the back etc so
it's you know different areas of day you
know the head area then obviously you
know anything we're on the Internet has
to have a subreddit so this is this
subreddit for ASMR these are the top
comments on on the subreddit one of them
is there is also like deadmau5 the DJ
you know this woman who said that ASMR
makes her vaginal cavities swell or
something yeah so actually one of the
biggest tensions in the community right
now is that some people have this kind
of more sexual attraction to ASMR and
other people just say there's like you
know a thing that makes you feel good
and sleepy and within the community
there is always this tension whether you
know it should be considered something
sexual or not and most people will
decide the reason why that you know
vaginal comment became really popular is
because people were really upset that
that was something that will come up to
the to bubble up as a representation of
the community because they're trying to
present these not as a weird fetish but
more of a kind of a good experience that
a bi-racial share and I'm just going to
show you the final this is you know the
classic meme that you probably seen
apply to ASMR and again you know when my
friends think I do most of day is amari
artists are women so most people when
they hear about the ASM are dating oh
you just want to look at you know pretty
girls talking softly for you but then
this is what my parents think I do that
I'm doing drugs like there's this
digital drugs meme that was going around
the news about people's listening to
specific sounds the what society thinks
I do that it's a fetish what the
internet things I
you what I think I do which is more like
a scientific approach to it and what I
really do I just fall asleep listening
to this video's thank you
I know I'm David and go through this
really quickly and take it off to really
quick notes about Corona I would never
ever drink corona in Mexico and if I did
it would be ironic in the way that
people drink papst ironically I think
and the other thing is that sinkhole in
my sort of exists Mexico but not really
like it is an actual holiday but most
Mexicans I don't think really know why
it's a holiday and it was basically an
invention of corona to sell a lot of
beer in the United States which they've
done very well so this was supposed to
be the 10 funniest memes that was going
to tell and then I realized that I would
be up here laughing and you would not be
laughing because I would need to explain
why they're funny and nothing's funny
after you explain why so instead it's
going to be a cultural introduction to
Mexico seen through the perspective of
10 different memes the first one which
is Edgar this is called Edgar Falls and
something to know in Mexico is that too
cause someone Bordeaux or gordito or
fatty it's kind of an affectionate term
like lots of people would call their
husbands a gourd alone like I sweetie hi
fatty it's a nice thing oh the audio
stopped working which is a shame because
the audio is the funny part is basically
a video of a sort of chubby kid who's
like whining a lot because his friends
messing with him and it was the first
viral video in Mexico everybody saw it
the kid ended up being famous for like a
year and then I don't know what happened
to him but he was on commercials and
stuff and there's actually there's a
really strong relationship between
internet memes and PR in Mexico still if
you drive around Mexico City i would say
twenty percent of the billboards are
related to memes and some sort of way
from social media another one there's a
culture mexico you should be afraid of
pops apps are not trustworthy in the
same way that they
united states so this guy I don't know
he did tengo miedo este momento it's
really funny for me oh so he's there's a
camera there and he wants everybody know
that he's scared he's I'm scared I'm
really fearful right now I'm there cops
here I'm really scared so there are a
lot of tweets tengo miedo I'm scared I'm
afraid is just a standard thing that
people say right now like my mom is
about to turn on the radio thangal me
yellow it's a tweet it's a hashtag
that's constantly used cops are in a lot
of these types of videos so these women
and that they were called The Ladies Day
Polanco like the witch Polanco's the
neighborhood an upscale neighborhood in
Mexico City and ladies and gentlemen is
not they're used to describe people who
are kind of like wealthy and total
assholes and so this cop was trying it's
a breathalyzer stop you know to check
for alcohol they had been drinking
obviously somewhere and so he says okay
you now you need a you know we're
checking to see if you've been drinking
or not and they just start screaming at
him like crazy and hitting them and they
say pinche puto and nila chinga tu
mother it's like the worst thing you can
say in Mexico it's your mom and
then this is amazing they say teen
choice LOL oh it person with a
salary just like
the weirdest thing weirdest insult in
the world but you know someone who has
to work for a living how dare you okay
the the former mayor of Mexico City is
Marcelo avodart who is probably I would
say the best twitter using politician
ever he's amazing and his most well he
has a lot of really famous tweets but he
was really well known for Mexico City is
a it's a volcanic area there a lot of
earthquakes constantly and while he was
mayor every time there was an earthquake
he would kind of let people know that
there was an earthquake which is silly
but when there is an earthquake you do
check Twitter to see like oh what are my
friends saying about the earthquake
right now or the other thing is that
because the the kind of rock bed of
mexico city is so soft every time a
truck passes your entire building starts
to shake so you don't really know if
it's an earthquake or a truck is going
by and then the mayor tells you know we
have an earthquake and he didn't put a
space between we have and in earthquake
so you can have this picture of him like
Ben we have an earthquake kind of
falling over uh he's also really funny
responding to people he's still really
funny responding people even though he's
not the mayor so here a Twitter user
says dear Marcelo Brad mr. mayor
your mom for having so many public works
around our city thanks for your
attention and then he responds to him my
mother already died and if we didn't do
so many public works then it would your
life would be much worse the the
intersection between class and ethnicity
is really
this is the gentleman de las Lomas
another really upscale area in Mexico
City he's asking the value partner to
help us with this car I think broke down
sup guys like sorry buddy I can't beat
my desk I'm not allowed to that's not my
job to fix your bar and this guy's like
Do You Know Who I am and there are so
many of these videos of like wealthy
important people do you know who I am
there's a senator also who does the same
thing she goes postal on some people at
an airport but what's what's really sad
is that one of the things that he says
there is a chain deal which is like you
 Indian which is still an insult
today in Mexico even though every time
you hear I think people kind of cringe
but but you still hear it which is
recently I think this was like last
month there they they raised the fee of
the metro it's one of the largest metros
in the entire world in Mexico City is
really clean it's beautiful I take it
everywhere it used to cost 25 cents to
go from stop a to wherever you wanted to
go in the city and they decided to raise
the fare from 25 cents to around 45
cents and people just went nuts tell us
it sounds really crazy like so it's 45
cents that's nothing compared to what we
pay here on the other hand they're
starting to invest there they use too
much money to invest in cars and not
enough public transportation so students
protested saying post is a way to save
boys which is like well I'll just jump
and so I won't pay for it I'll just
jumped the turnstiles and it became a
big campaign all of these students
started jumping the turnstile instead of
paying for it and they use the hashtag
post myself though which became very
viral and it's still kind of a protest
but there are also some epic FAIL videos
there are lots of those and then like
the week the week afterwards there's a
big energy reform and because of the
history of Mexico and the revolution
having the state ownership of oil is
very important especially for the
leftist prd party in Mexico and so this
is a deputy from the lower house of the
Congress and he got naked to protest the
the energy reform that was passed by the
three parties and so immediately the
hashtag became postman cuatro and all of
these people started getting naked on
Twitter which is always fun in protest
of the reform another a great one that
some of you might have seen I'll turn
the sound off on this one though during
the campaign the candidate who was
favored to win and it was now president
pinion yet though was at the biggest
book fair in the country in Guadalajara
and someone asked him what are three
books that have influenced your life and
you said the Bible and then like long
pause really long pause it's like and
then that other book by somebody else
and then he didn't you really couldn't
name three books which was really sad
Gandhi is sort of the barnes and noble
of mexico they had it's a big bookseller
and they have really funny advertising
and so people sort of used the gandhi
style of advertising to make fun of the
president which was funny i don't know
if i have oh yeah and so then his
daughter retweeted a tweet i had talked
about class a little bit saying
greetings to the big to all of you
idiots who are who are part of the the
pro lay the proletariat who says that
and you just criticize because you're
envious so that became so prolly kind of
the proletariat or I'm proletarian
became a really big thing saying yo soy
probably I'm proletarian and which also
became pro lay which is I'm in favor of
reading so like no I'm not I'm not rich
but I know I can name three books
the last one there's a theme in many of
these which is that there is kind of
this entrenched powerful class in Mexico
City and then there is a sort of new
middle class that is rising up that is
taking to social media to sort of to
criticize the old base of power lady
prophetic o is so lady is used for all
of these people who are kind of from
that older class lady profile is the
daughter of the person who's from the
consumer rights agency in Mexico is
there us equivalent so they're in charge
of consumer rights for four people and
it's a government agency very ironic
that this is the daughter of the person
who's in charge of the entire agency she
goes to a very hip restaurant in the
neighborhood where I live and says you
know I'm important give me that table
and the woman who owns the restaurant
says no you need to wait just like all
these other people are waiting for your
table and then she goes back to
prophetic oh and she talks to all of her
dad's buddies who work there and says
close that restaurant because they
didn't give me the table they did close
the restaurant and in order from the
consumer rights body and a lot of people
had tweeted and taking pictures of what
had happened so as soon as they ended up
closing in place there was this huge
Twitter protest and Lady profeta was the
hashtag I don't remember what happened
to her if anything but all of the people
who work within prophetic Oh who were
part of this were fired and I don't I
think for dad is still running it if I
remember typical but you know so what
this is generating is a debate this is
from the website on email political
which is a really good digital news site
and it's asking could social networks
put limits and influence on the pat on
the power of the juniors and junior is
kind of like a rich annoying kid who
thinks that he can do anything because
he's a rich annoying kid and there's a
on from fusion net from the Univision
the new channel they interviewed uplands
optimized asking about all of this and
he says what you have here is a clash
between two worlds it's a mexico that
values improving your lot in life
through hard work against the mexico of
privilege and arrogance we're family
connections get you what you want a lot
of mexican memes are just really funny
if you understand the context they would
have been funny if I said it here in
front of all of you but then there's
also this really interesting social
layer behind it where
have these two different senses of power
that are that are clashing online right
now thank you
so I'm gonna whisper my dog and then if
you feelin singing expert experience in
your head you can tell me a kind of a
tingly feeling in your neck
and it's working excellent hi there so
final talk playing with embarrassment so
I'm really interested in how to
encourage playfulness playful
exploration playful learning and the use
of play to motivate engagement in all
kinds of weird non play context like art
museums or civic engagement in the
street or civic disobedience in the
street or learning all these kinds of
things and the thing I ran in and during
my research was that one big thing that
keeps people from doing this is
embarrassment just to give you a
practical example this is a project by
Floyd Miller and Chad pop rock at RMIT
Melbourne who thought hey let's
encourage people to exercise with this
cute xer game which works like the
following you have a projector the
projector projects this float on a water
down there as long as there's a flow
projected you're allowed to stand the
moment there is not a flow projected
your have to pull yourself up as long as
there is no fault and then you let
yourself down right playful way of
getting people to exercise and for some
weird reason Chad came up with the idea
and said this would work perfectly in a
public tram and apart from the security
issues right the tram just taking a
course while you're pulling yourself up
there they notice people would not do
this and when they interview people why
would you not do this people said well
because it's embarrassing if I pull
myself up there in the right in industry
so that's for mean actual interesting
very important issue if we're interested
in playful exploration other context so
the obvious question for me is well how
does this work what is embarrassment and
how can we as designers mitigate that
and as an answer for that I'd like to
turn to some dead white male sociologist
um the first Network male sociology is
we are vomits you might know him from
the thermos thermos theorem who noted
that basically our social world the
world as we experience it within a
culture is made up of types of
situations like a presentation or dinner
together with a family and socialization
means that we learn the proper rules of
behavior for each situation from our
parents and peers in a word we learn to
behave ourselves right in church I don't
want to sit here in silence but I
learned this is how I should do it now
how does this red proper rules of
situation relate to embarrassment q in
the second dead webmail sociology
Charles
cooley who wrote in the 1920s at how we
come to have a self an identity an ocean
of who we are is not that we look at
ourselves in the mirror but that we
think about how other people might see
and perceive us and feelings like shame
or embarrassment or pride are basically
thinking about whether other people
might value or devalue what we're doing
in a situation and the realization that
they may devalue us in there from might
you know disconnect from us the fear of
that disconnection that's shame or
embarrassment basically you're fearing
that your peers or your parents might
think poorly of you and therefore might
not support you as much you're losing
social connection with them that's
embarrassment just to give you a
practical example right as children up
to a certain age we have no problem
doing all kinds of crazy weird wacky
playful but at a certain point in
time at a certain point in our H we
starts thinking about how do other
people perceive what I'm doing how do
they think we're feel about that that's
the moment when we get socialized into
culture that's the mount when we start
getting embarrassed and therefore stop
playing things that we are the drawing
things that we otherwise would not
proudly present even though they're
looking crappy because we don't care
about other people's opinion before that
so to summarize that's the definition of
embarrassment doing something
situationally inappropriate thinking
about how the other people seeing you
will think about you devaluing you as a
course and that creates fear of losing
social connection and that's with chat
and with the exit gate right that's what
keeps people from engaging from play in
non play contacts because they're afraid
of being embarrassed but here's the
weird thing weirdly enough sometimes
that actually does work like friends
here in the global non patna no pants
day which is was at January 12 2014
where people wear no pants in a subway
in a trend which was started 2002 pi
Improv Everywhere here in New York and
nowadays globally millions of people
walk into a trem dressed without pants
without being embarrassed or with this
thing which also works which are
festivals like ich fest or play publique
where game designers come together and
play weird games in the middle of the
street without embarrassment keeping
them from doing so so how does this work
why does this work that's
question i'm currently grabbing with
throw more ideas at me here's just 34
little things that i have observed that
explain these kind of things first
explanation is well this is a festival
situation right the no-pants days is
specified festival the egg fest plated
like there's a specified festivals and
festivals are types of situations where
we have learned in a culture that's
where it's okay that's where it's
expected to be transgressive right go to
a german carnival in a carnival city and
be the spoil sport who is not silly
drunk and does weird thing and you will
feel the full pressure of social
expectation on your shoulder right so
fast of all there it's okay because
that's expected in this situation second
reason is these situations typically
offer you a shield from disapproving
eyes it's typically not the way that
everybody looks on you that might might
might think badly of you for doing this
one of the players I interviewed said I
like to play in a train but I get very
emotionally worked up about about
playing a train so what I do is I try to
find the one single solitary cabin where
nobody else is and I sit in the farthest
corner behind have all these other
chairs in front of me so nobody sees me
and they're I can play without feeling
embarrassed because nobody else can see
me so physical shields from disapproving
eyes third reason there's normalcy in
numbers right on these play festivals
there is a play community of others who
by playing signal to each other that
what they're doing they're in this
situation is perfectly normal and
acceptable that's what we do together as
an in-group in this situation right and
people typically have different
embarrassment threshold which leads to
these interesting embarrassment cascades
right sure many of you know this into
internet video so basically right if
you're at a party and there is good
music playing and you would like to
dance but then you think well if I would
now start dancing I'd be the only one on
the dance floor and everybody would be
looking at me ooh so you need one weird
person who's completely okay with that
stepping in the middle embarrassing
themselves and then another person who's
embarrassment threshold is a little
lower says oh if that guy is doing that
I'm not the only one that's kind of a
bit more normal I'm okay with that and
then suddenly you have these cascade of
more and more and more people saying
yeah but I that look
fun and if there are so many people not
everybody's eyes is just on me and then
I can also join so if these interesting
kiss came and the thing is this works
right as community of people doing this
together but it also works as material
traces of others this is wonderful
example by 9s I'm on director of the
Santa Cruz Museum of Arts and history
done a beautiful participatory
extirpation all you need is love Britain
wonderful book participatory museum
every designer should read that book and
what they did is to encourage
participation to have these big walls
posting questions like what's the
craziest thing you've done full of right
imagine being the only person the museum
standing there with a pen everybody else
of the visitors looking at you while you
write your answer right now imagine you
walk in and they already pre fill it
with some answers and you see a lot of
other people having answered right
suddenly this becomes normal this
becomes okay this becomes appropriate
and this I would argue also works with
mediated imagined others right like the
Internet allows furries to think about
how I'm not the only one doing this this
is sort of normal um but still what it
needs is that first person that weird
first person who is willing to make him
or herself vulnerable by stepping into
the dancing foreign saying I am willing
to expose myself to ridicule an
embarrassment by the others but by doing
so by stopping in the middle I allow the
others to do the same because I'm
singling I have benign intent this is a
situation which is safe for you and I
think this is one of the reasons why in
play we actually enjoy being jointly
embarrassed as for instance of karaoke
right because think about it why would
people do karaoke why would you get
silly drunk and then stand yourself up
in a crowd and present to the whole
crowd that you're a crappy singer right
and I think the reason for I think there
are two reasons for this why this kind
of this interesting mechanic work the
first thing is this play community that
mutually signals to each other this is
ok you can sing crappy first it allows
us to shamelessly indulge in the kind of
things we would like to do but in
everyday life are not allowed to do but
here together in this right this is
perfectly fine right you can you can
sniff at my bottom because we're playing
twister and it's twister um but the
deeper reason is
I think that this this shared joint
situation of embarrassment creates a
deep sense of social connectedness and
of relatedness singing terribly in front
of others who cheer us works very much
like the same way in which young dogs
play with each other right on the one
hand you have the dog lying down that's
the person singing crappy and that dog
lying down that person singing crappy
basically signals to the others I trust
you not to hurt me I make myself
vulnerable here but I trust you to
respect my boundaries and not take in
our take advantage of the situation that
you can embarrass me and deride me and
vice versa the other people looking
there cheering instead of dividing the
other person signal their
trustworthiness they signal yes I see
that you have exposed yourself to me but
I am NOT taking advantage of that I'm
actually congratulating you for open
yourself up to me as well thank you each
year microsoft research helps hundreds
of influential speakers from around the
world including leading scientists
renowned experts in technology book
authors and leading academics and makes
videos of these lectures freely
