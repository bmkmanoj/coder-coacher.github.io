of Windows Azure and the components of
services that comprise it as well as
take a broader look at cloud computing
technology in general and how it
pertains the needs of research
scientists and data analysts at the end
of this video you'll have learned the
basic concepts of cloud computing
generic to all clouds not just Windows
Azure you'll get a better understanding
of the distinction between providing
infrastructure platform and software as
a service commonly referred to as IaaS
paas and SaaS so let's talk about this
term cloud
there are numerous related terms in the
industry for cloud computing cloud
services and the like
at Microsoft the perspective is that
cloud is simply an approach to computing
that enables applications to be
delivered at scale for a wide variety of
workloads and client devices there are a
few main types of workloads that work
well on the cloud the first is when
large compute jobs are only needed
occasionally in those cases cloud works
well because you don't have to buy a lot
of computers that then sit idle for long
periods of time many scientists and
researchers with large batch jobs have
exactly this use case a second use case
is when the demand for a compute
facility or application service may grow
at a fast rate but the rate of growth is
hard to predict beforehand so called
viral applications have this nature when
a user base or when the demand for
compute capacity doubles every month for
instance it can be hard for IT to keep
up with provisioning if your application
is hosted on the cloud turning on some
more machines and Microsoft's large data
centers is just one click away a third
use case is when an applications compute
needs are basically constant but there's
the potential for a sudden bump in
demand scientific work groups sometimes
encounter this on conference paper
deadlines loom or when a particular new
instrument starts generating data for
the first time or when some new data set
is first released by the government
related to this unpredictable bursting
is the use case of predictable bursting
this is when there are clear seasonal or
time-related dependencies for the need
for compute capacity
examples include shopping websites
during the holidays or actuarial and
financial companies around tax time
academic institutions see this when
students are first ramping up during the
semester
stur or as they race to complete final
projects the point is that in all these
cases cloud gives you the flexibility to
scale up and down as your application
demands change while only paying for the
storage and compute that you actually
use here's another way to look at the
cloud services taxonomy and how this
taxonomy maps to the components in an IT
infrastructure with packaged software a
customer would be responsible for
managing the entire stack ranging from
the network connectivity down to the
applications with infrastructure as a
service the lower levels of the stack
are managed by a vendor some of these
components can be provided by
traditional hosting providers in fact
most of them have moved to having a
virtualized offering very few actually
provide a bare metal operating system
the customer is still responsible for
managing the operating system all the
way through the applications for the
developer an obvious benefit with
infrastructure as a service is that it
frees the developer from many concerns
when provisioning physical or virtual
machines this was one of the earliest in
primary use cases for Amazon's elastic
compute cloud ec2 developers were able
to readily provision virtual machines on
ec2 develop and test solutions and often
run the results in production the only
requirement was a credit card to pay for
the services with platform as a service
everything from the network connectivity
through the runtime is provided and
managed by the platform vendor Windows
Azure best fits in this category today
in fact because we don't provide access
to the underlying virtualization or
operating system
we're often referred to as not providing
a true infrastructure as a service
platform as a service offerings further
reduced developer burden by additionally
supporting the platform runtime and
related application services with
platform as a service the developer can
almost immediately begin creating the
business logic for particular
application this potentially increases
the productivity in a considerable way
because the hardware and operational
aspects of the cloud platform are also
managed by the provider applications can
quickly be taken from an idea to reality
finally with software as a service the
vendor provides the application and
abstracts all of the underlying
components away from you
Windows Azure itself is
deployed across a global network of data
centers these data centers are massive
facilities that host tens or in some
cases hundreds of thousands of servers
currently Microsoft maintains data
centers in four regions in North America
two regions in Europe and two regions in
Asia as you can see on the slide we also
have a number of content distribution
network edge points which we can use to
cache your static content and deliver it
even faster for your customers what
you're going to see in the coming months
and years is that the data center
footprint will rapidly expand around the
world so you'll have more and more
options for running your applications
with Azure once you've built an
application you can choose where you
want to run in the world and we can move
your workloads from region to region you
can also run your application in
multiple regions simultaneously and just
direct traffic and customers to
whichever version of the app is closest
to them this gives you a global
footprint and a chance to reach a bigger
audience or customer base in new markets
Windows Azure is commercially available
in over 89 countries and territories
anyone within these countries can sign
up for a free trial or paid subscription
to use Windows Azure services to build
their applications of course the
applications you build can be used by
customers worldwide they are not
restricted to only the countries on this
list the advantages of using Azure are
many first there's no upfront cost
there's no need to buy any server
licenses however if you're running
applications such as a sequel database
or other sorts of private Airy software
on top of azure you will need to buy
license for those for virtual machines
and websites two of the many Azure
services we'll talk about in other
videos you pay simply by the hour
you can scale up and scale down your
solutions or even turn them on or off as
necessary the cost is scaled
appropriately and automatically as your
charges by the minute and by the
gigabyte of transfer and storage and all
of these things are easy to price on our
website the evaluation period is at no
cost now let's take a look at the azure
portal which is the primary interface
for managing monitoring and interacting
with all of Windows Azure --zz
components and services the main URL for
Windows Azure is simply Windows Azure
com
to access the management portal click
the portal button at the very top this
will take you to a sign-in window if you
have not already signed on in some cases
you may be redirected to a main
Microsoft account management page once
you're logged in you can see the basic
layout all of the top information is
related to your account like your
account name the subscription you're
using and things like that on the left
are all of the various components of
services that are available in Azure we
start in the all items view which shows
all the various services that this
account is currently using we can see
their status and any associated software
subscriptions if we click on a
particular category on the left
for instance virtual machines then we'll
see a listing of just those items here
are the VMS I've created so far I can
also click on storage to see the storage
accounts if I click on any of these
particular individual items I'll be
presented with a detailed control panel
for that item here I've clicked on the
storage account and we can see there's a
quick start overview and there are also
many audit options for configuring the
storage account at the top in their
lower left there is a big new button
with a plus sign this is where we go to
create new virtual machines storage
accounts services and the like clicking
on this you can see that there is a
nested set of menu items the compute
area is where we can create websites and
virtual machines data services include
SQL databases as your storage accounts
and HD inside clusters which is a sure's
built in Hadoop cluster technology you
can see there's other types of services
and apps you can create in your Azure
account in later videos we'll walk
through how to create several of these
items including virtual machines and how
you can use them for data processing and
analysis now if we look at the top of
the window we can see there is a down
arrow or Chevron next to the windows as
your name expanding this we can see
there is a menu bar with helpful links
to
a pricing calculator documentation for
Azure downloads which includes the SDKs
for various languages the community
portal which includes the azure blog and
event calendar and the link to the
support site for Windows Azure let's
take a look at some of these items now
in the documentation section there are
several very nice infographics that
illustrate and describe as yours
architecture at a high level here are
some of what they look like
you can interactively zoom in and zoom
out to look at various pieces of this
architecture diagram if you're new to
cloud services this is a very helpful
way to understand all the components
that go into the system there's also
link to the MSDN forums for Azure this
is a very helpful question and answer
site with many experts answering
questions at all levels of difficulty
and detail about the Windows Azure
system on the documentation site there's
also link to best practices this is a
very useful resource and contains lots
of helpful information as you're
designing a system around the services
available on Azure there are discussions
of how to ensure business continuity as
you migrate to the cloud and there's
helpful resources on capacity planning
and scaling the community section
contains several things worth noting
first there's a link to the blog the
azure blog is quite active with posts on
all aspects of azure technology and use
cases there's also the azure newsletter
you can sign up to receive these
newsletters via email every month or you
can browse the archives there's lots of
information here that ranges from fairly
low level technology concerns like HTTP
headers to higher-level topics like
comparing the costs of Azure vs. Amazon
Web Services the education page has
information for teachers students and IT
administrators if you're an educator
note that there is a grant available a
very generous one actually if you want
to use Azure in your teaching and your
research in the middle here is a brief
overview of the azure for research
program for academic researchers you can
see there's a separate site for this as
your for research com I would highly
encourage any research scientists
watching this video
to check it out and to think about
applying for the azure research award
program this provides researchers with
generous grants of compute and storage
resources there's also a training link
here on the azure for research page that
lists the training courses available
that azure performs all around the world
you can see there quite a few of them so
there's probably one near you
each year Microsoft Research helps
hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
