you
stop we have the Arts Center College of
Design from the US they're gonna present
reticle sensing super smelly
neuroprosthetic hold on to your seats
now hi I'm Sal what's way down is the
mic on my name is Jay Hong and we're
from Art Center College of Design
graduate media design practices program
so instead of seeing disability as
something to fix our professors brief
was to invert disability and design for
a superpower radical sensing is rooted
in the sense of smell and radical
sensing imagines a future in which we've
chosen to replace our noses with a super
smelling neuroprosthetic or a post nose
it filters
it shares and it remembers scent
the super smelling air prosthetic
amplifies isolates and recourse then
through hand gestures and customization
to your post nose for centuries scholars
have placed smell at the bottom of a
hierarchy of senses Condillac Darwin and
Kant they've all described the sense of
smell as the least useful of the senses
but we chose scent yeah we chose scent
as a way to really define for the
emotive non rational intuitive aspects
of brain computing and really thanks to
brain scanning imaging technology the
collapse the excuse me the hegemonic
divide between what we know and what we
don't know and the rational and the
rational collapse thanks to this so here
we see a scan going back a little bit a
little forward oh here we are here we
see a scan of the olfactory pathways in
the brain and really the scent the sense
of smell is actually the most complex of
the senses because of how it functions
and how its mapped through the brain so
we spoke to experts in computational
neurology anaplastologist our Dre
development and also we collaborated
with an independent perfumer this are
our three noses we imagine fitting them
to a person's face once their noses were
removed so it is a radical idea so why
not a radical prosthetic so for example
this one is inspired by techno this is
our techno nose and here we have our
sleeping nose to protect you while you
sleep and this one challenges the
architecture of the nose so what does it
mean for the replacement of the body
part to become aspirational so currently
there is no neural prosthetics for smell
so how do you design for something that
doesn't exist this led us the idea of
working with performers and by
performers we mean those with special
training and movement and dance radical
sensing is in dialogue to this performer
and body researchers second to the left
is Lucy McRae who works with boundaries
of human body and dynamism of Technology
so there are clear advantages to working
with performers
there's spatial vocabulary allows for
rich messaging and interpretation in a
very collaborative manner there it is a
symbolic and a metaphoric process it
turns formal movement into narrative
which then we work off so we created
this methodology which we started
calling performative prototyping and
instead of being a narrowing process it
is very divergent and generative and
this allowed us to really work with
concepts that don't exist over time
we've made working prototypes and this
were used for our performative
prototyping iterations and these
iterations led to these three areas so
gc-ms is a technology used by the
perfume industry and scientists to
analyze and to analyze a measure sent
you knows technology takes us to a
portable scale so if you imagine if you
imagine that this could merge with a
neuroprosthetics of the nose this would
be a huge change in the way we could
record and store scent this is how
memory works and based on this
technology we here are showing two
performers recording and sharing scent
to begin with conducted three centers
with a diverse group of performers we
were interested in the relationship
between language to smell and so we
asked the performers to verbalize their
reactions so that led us to think would
a smell memory device facilitate a
richer discourse around smell and would
that lead to a smell literacy to move on
to Augmented function we test that
stereo smell
we asked the performers to do
improvisation through long extended
straws which then made us think about
control so initially our questions were
what does it mean to augment smell to be
more precise or focused or enhanced but
later our questions became about what
does it mean to relinquish control of
smell both willingly or unwillingly this
led us to sherry
this test is about the sharing dynamic
between leader and follower and we took
this idea of sharing an intimacy to the
extreme by giving the performers a very
restrictive prototype which they
described as painful we repeated the
test with performers who knew each other
very well and they were able to be less
child it was less challenging for them
and they were able to move more quickly
so since they were moving so much more
confidently it led us to consider how
does familiarity affect ability and
through and we during our debrief they
mentioned about the synchronization of
breathe which too for them to move
easily yeah so and then through this it
allowed us to consider could the breath
be used as a cue and sharing of smell so
to recap we used the methodology of
performative prototyping to reach to
these three areas with memory how does
the smell memory device impact the
language around discourse and smell
literacy with control what does it mean
to design for an ability to control or
relinquish control of smell and finally
was sharing what the sensorial consensus
mean can we use the breath to facilitate
consensus we took a radical approach to
look into the future to explore
designing possibility around super power
and ability in the process we came up
with a methodology that we're calling
performative prototyping which led us in
a different direction than if we had
taken a more conventional approach
radical sensing looks at neuroscience
physical computing and performance
research to really explore the
potentials of designing around a radical
augmentation of smell and also a radical
prosthetic radical sensing imagines a
future in which we've chosen to replace
our noses with a super smelling
neuroprosthetic or a post nose thank you
thank you our center hole would like to
go first I'm yeah where did you start
it's it's a wonderful project and I
commend you on so taking the approach of
looking at augmentation of powers
superpowers and sort of exploring this
from a very different sort of starting
point the performative prototyping I
think is absolutely genius and I think
the video communication storytelling
that you do in this presentation is is
like amazing
right I mean you're just doing there's
all sorts of storytelling going on about
what you've explored and how you
explored it and I'm left very much with
the impression that you know perhaps not
as radically as you as you suggest in
this incredibly bizarre void in the nose
cavity but just that devices that you
know enhance or give us superpowers of
smell or we call or as you said record
and share there's something definitely
super exciting there and I'm compelled
to imagine a future and where you know
we have the sense of a heightened sense
of smell and and be able to share those
incredible moments
but anyway just just very bold very
creative great job yeah I definitely
certainly the subject matter is is
fascinating right especially when you're
exploring memory as it pertains to smell
this is something I've always been very
curious about I find my sense of smell
fluctuates different times in my life
you know it's more vibrant other times
it's last different months and so you
know the result here could be really
really fascinating and this seems like
one of those projects that really starts
to contribute to a base of knowledge
that we're going to need to get there I
really just like the presentation I
think and the project and the work and
to sort of be you for a second because
there's what art in this there's a lot
of exploration in this there's a lot of
creativity in it and it's a lot of
out-of-the-box thinking and so that's
very very exciting so you know what
resulted in its practical applications
here I don't you know I don't know but
the the step I think is really exciting
to see so great representation thank you
yep Echo's I love the way that you kind
of went out way out but kind of that
forced you to really think about some of
the things and actually you know what
would that be like and I think that's
something the you know some of the other
projects I think that you know kind of
would have been really helpful like what
would it be like to wear this what would
it be like to use it to be that to have
that as part of my daily life you know
if I capture a smell and I give it to
somebody else what's that going to be
like I mean those those are really
interesting questions to think about and
the way that you did it was was was
incredibly evocative I think that was
great you know so very kind of different
a different way of doing that and I you
know so I really enjoyed that and you
know and taking just a complete
departure of what does it mean to sort
of reverse that feel of it you know
contextual
ability well could you you know we were
being differently-abled as it was caught
for a long time you know actually yeah
be differently-abled have it like super
super nose is kind of a really different
way think about so that was great
project any questions from the audience
Stella so thank you very much for your
presentation and so here I own up I am
someone with this invisible disability
of having mostly no sense of smell and
what I love about your project is that
it actually shows things that I do for
example when I go for a walk together
with my husband he tells me now it
smells of grass oh is it really
and then I'm going okay maybe I can
smell just a little bit of it so I tried
so actually what this is is one of the
behaviors that you showed in your movies
and so what I think is really nice about
it is that it's beyond the product
because actually it enables me to
recognize that this is something that
we're doing and I can talk about it so
it's actually a direct mediator of
experiences without a product in the
sense that I'm using a product but
actually it enables people to share
experiences so I love that thank you so
much for sharing your experience I'd
love to talk to you more
any more questions
lady Shirky the performative prototyping
idea seems seems to even transcend your
project just as a general technique as
you guys were doing that did you think
oh I know what else this would be useful
for like when would you use that again
for what other kinds of projects thank
you and that's a really good question I
think we've been meditating on it or
trying to understand but I guess it
started when we took a dance
choreographic practice I have and
applied it to some design research and I
found it to be a very satisfying
experience but I think at least from my
perspective at this moment I see it as
really applying to brief creation and
maybe insight finding when the space is
very broad I think kind of how we talked
about it when you're really open and you
need to be read down a different path
but besides that is just really fun
thank you questions yeah unless somebody
else has a question okay so um that's a
closed point I mean it there are some
earlier work around sort of informants
and some early papers around that but I
think that's always been using the kind
of performance to tell the idea much
more than yeah that sort of prototyping
and using those performance and dancers
to kind of because as you say so good
with thinking their bodies like that
yeah
very much so that that was a great idea
thank you
questions or comments okay thank you so
