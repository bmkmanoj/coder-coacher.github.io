you
ok
welcome everyone as well as the viewers
at home we're happy to have guitar pro
Katya tell us about the chigger constant
of supercritical percolation okay thank
you all for coming or attending at home
I now discover and thank you for having
me here so the title is quite long but
the talk is intended for quite a large a
wide audience I'll try to define
everything besides what asymptotically
is and the square lattice sold all the
rest of the word would be defined it's
good okay so okay so so you can tell me
to to run so how what is a perimeter
everybody knows the basic facts so I can
skip this even the nice fact about even
the nice fact about the the first
reference without a visa perimetry
canard it then we can read the videos
even if you can go back but what I meant
is you don't have to define percolation
okay so okay so is apparently is the
general a class of problems or the idea
is to find sets with a given volume and
minimal a boundary measure so these
questions were originally asked in
continuous space by the Greeks and they
actually knew the correct answer and as
this slice the show so this actually
some a1 reference was saved from from
Roman times from 220 bc it's the story
of the princess Dido that she was a
finishing princess that had to run away
because her brother killed her fair her
husband and tried to kill her and she
went to northern Africa where she made a
pact with the local king that she will
get a bull's hide and she paid him some
money and the promise was that she will
get as much land as she can enclose
the Bulls hide so princess daddy was a
smart with imitation what you did was
take the Bulls hide cut it into very
very thin thin strips as you can see
here and then took the seashore as one
side and created a perfect half circle
as the other side and because which
solves is a permit required problem and
there she formed the kingdom of Carthage
cartago so this is this was all out
stated in Virgil's poems so in the
skreets i think that the is a poetic
problem is given by the chigger constant
just give the quick definition if you
have a finite graph g the trigger
constant defined is the minimum over all
sets of size smaller than one-half the
side of their or the size of the graph
the ratio between the edge boundary
which is all the edges such as one side
is in the set and the other side is in
the compliment and the volume of the set
ok and i'll give you one example where
application for this and if you take a
big torso n by N by n D dimensions
choose a point uniformly at random then
run of random walk until time which is
proportional to the volume so choose
some you larger than zero and write a
time T which is larger than you the new
time n to the D then together with shell
F using a paper of you violent and in
movies you can obtain using either
prometric inequalities that the mixing
time so you run run amok on this graph
the mixing time of this random walk is a
is the same as the torus up to an
iterated log factor so this probability
that it's larger than iterated log goes
to zero and goes to infinity just one
application is not the topic of the of
the talk so skipper collation skip
critical percolation right ok so we fix
some p which is larger than the critical
value and you know that there is some
giant component inside the box with very
high probability such that all
all other components are polluted poly
logarithmic in size bumper collision
yeah I skip this you told me to skip hey
so denote the giant component by CDN
okay so now this is going to be our
graph and denote by fear and the chigger
constant of the giant component now in
several several works by Binyamin in
Mosul Matthew Demi burger be scooped up
on Kozma and this note by patterning 08
it was proved that n times the chigger
constant is bounded between two
constants and little seen Big C with
poor bit attending rapidly to one this
lady tied to formally the following
conjecture that the limit actually
exists almost surely okay so the correct
asymptotics was known but not that the
limit exists and so with this conjecture
in mind together with laws in Italian
2011 we show that the variance of n
times VN is smaller than some constant n
to the 2 minus D which was at least in
high dimensions the chigger constant is
concentrated around it's mean and it's
enough to to prove convergence of the
mean but this is still open essentially
so in high dimensions we don't even know
this this so even the weaker conjecture
in expectation is still open and and the
topic of the talk today is a paper with
biskup lloyd irvin Rosenthal which we
prove the conjecture in two dimensions
so it's not yeah so fixed d equals 2 and
fee n is the chigger constant of father
mmm so the limit in two-dimensional
percolation exists almost surely now in
the way the proof is constructed is
first we'll have to describe what is the
wolf's construction okay so the general
physics notion that will describe the
wolf construction is is constructed by
some norms or willing to define what is
this known that that the shape is is
constructed with and there is some
discrete geometrical objects that we had
to to invent which to approximate
between discrete curves and continuous
curves and left to talk about this and
the proof of the main theorems em ok so
what is the wolf's construction let BP
be some norm ok for now it's the piece
just for later use for now it's just
normal are two and let's fit p be the
solution of this app romantic question
with respect to the norm better p ok so
it's the infimum overall simple curves
in our to with lebesgue interior one
okay take the infimum of the length with
respect to two better p now wolf in the
beginning of the last century was the
physicist conjectured that such a
minimizing curve can be constructed and
actually conjectured the correct the
correct shape so WP is the ball in the
dual norm of better p ok so if better p
is the l1 norm then WP will be the l
infinity ball etc and WP hat is just
urbanization of this such that you'll
have lebesgue area 1 so this conjecture
was made 100 years ago but it was
actually proved by Taylor in 74 that the
same shape is indeed a minimizing set
and I'll check I'll tell you later it's
not it's not the tailor that the other
day
sure was it yeah it was really stated as
a conjecture about it they would well
you know he's oficio T it was it was
stated a claim but for us it was stated
as a conjecture since it wasn't proved
and in 75 Taylor proved that the
minimizer is you make up two shifts okay
so the wolf construction is the unique
answer to the diplomatic question now
denote Wade eh the host of metric that
the l infinity host of metric for
instance and then a very useful
quantitive version that we use in our
paper by the bush in cotton skin
schlossman says that for any simple
rectifiable curve gamma enclosing a
region of unit lebesgue area if the a
better p length of the curves are close
the curves themselves also close in the
heart of hospital metric okay using this
claim we also strengthen the conjecture
of being a meany and we prove a shape
theory so for D equals 2 and here I
stated with the resistor normative
Moodle in a few minutes we'll construct
this norm and so so is the square root
essentially tight is that the right
so can it be strengthened I don't M so
defined by you hat the family of sets
which achieve the chigger constant you
show that every set which achieve the
chickens and other the correct
normalization converges to the wolf
shape with a specific norm ok so in the
house of metric so this is a shape
theorem ok so now for several slides
forget about the probability are going
to bode to talk about z2 geometry and
topology so in four wheels contracted
construction what you need is some sort
of tension right it was it was a it was
constructed for physical questions like
for instance the the geometry of a water
water drop right we have the water
tension but our tension has to do with
the number of so with the boundary so
essentially we need to find some norm
which gives us information about the
boundary so so the best set of
definitions now so so the right boundary
edge is the following so you can look at
the definition on top or the pictures
which are more clear so you look at the
path of three steps of the path if the
path goes up and then down then this is
the right boundary it did have the right
boundary edges of this vertex ok so
essentially is the law is you go from X
i plus 1 to x i minus 1 clockwise ok and
all the edges which are between are the
right boundary edges so in this case
there's only one in this case there are
no right away boundary edges and the
right boundary of a a of a path which is
denoted like this is a set of right
boundary edges ok who is this clear is
this definition clear now right mouse I
rightmost path is a path which is simple
but simple not in the original sense but
in the sense of the in the oriented
sense so
each edge you can cross at most one once
in each orientation okay and it is
recognized if it is simple and doesn't
contain any right boundary edges I want
to look at this picture so this is the
right boundary path so which goes like
this okay M the right mouse pad so yeah
these the the striped the striped edges
are the right boundary and you can see
that there that the path does not
contain any one of them and i want you
to notice also this a curly path which
is on the medial graph okay actually the
graph which so the vertices are the
edges and there a connected if the
sherry a phase VI a vertex and what you
can see is which which which is a claim
that we prove that for every right
boundary path this interface in the
middle graph is simple okay as a as a
patent in in r2 okay mm so that our X
vibe is a set of rightmost pass from X
to Y for every realization Omega of the
percolation and the rightmost gamma let
B of gamma be the size so the number of
open rightmost edges of gamma and II fix
and wire connected inside the
percolation cluster let be X Y be the
infimum of be gamma over all right most
open path between x and y okay so this
is a on the way of defining the norm and
that's one more small small definition
so for every vector in r2 let the
bracket of X denote the vertex and C
infinity this is nearest to X using so
shouldn't be the graph
God anymore but using some kind of
rotation invariant order okay him okay
so theorem the barn on forever EP which
is super critical and every X in R to
the limit be bracket zero bracket n x
over N is an almost sure constant it is
bounded from infinity and fabrics which
is different than zero it's bounded away
from zero the limit also exists then one
and the convergence in this uniform on
the unit circle okay which is essential
for our so big slice or given to two
vertices look at all the rightmost
pathway between them and the rightmost
boundary then big slice is the infimum
of overall the rightmost boundaries of
such paths and betta peaks is defined as
the limit of be 0 and x over N ok so the
claim is that it is homogeneous it obeys
the triangle inequality in particular it
is a norm ok so forever EP beta P is the
norm that we're going to construct the
wolf the wolf construction according to
so this this serum is by technical but
but I want to talk about to conceptual
points so the uniformity essentially
comes from this very nice paper of
casting from 93 it's called the speed of
convergence in first passage percolation
where invent this nice nice idea of in
of sins so that the trajectories are not
are not bounded because because you have
edges where you cannot cross you up or
you don't know how far you'll get to but
yet it's nice idea of giving some some
very large weights on closed edges and
then having a new weight which is which
sums up all of these all of these
weights and then this is bounded if we
prove the speed of convergence on this
thing and then it shows that that it's
the same so it
this didn't transfer immediately but but
this is the main idea so and the second
idea is subjectivity so 4 first first
its calculation subjectivity is trivial
but here it's just semi trivial so the
idea is that if you have to write most
path you can concatenate them in the
following way so travel with the first
one until the first time you hit the
second one and then continue with the
second one from the last time it hits
this point to its end okay so it's not
very hard to see that this concatenation
is the rightmost path and the difference
within the right boundary is at most two
so a constant difference does not does
not affect the subjectivity because you
can take the the norm plus 2n and show
the DC stability so these are the main
ideas now we call a rightmost circuit if
it's a rightmost path which is closed
and as we said earlier it is always
possible to find a closed curve which is
close to the rightmost rightmost path
and him so so you we have jordan's
theorem essentially so you have the
interior of this so the interior of this
of this envelope is well defined so
define the volume of a of a rightmost
path to be the intersection of the
interior of the interface the continuous
interface with CD C 2 C 2 n is this
clear this is definition so it's all
essentially all the vertices inside CDN
which are enclosed inside the set is
hazel for you
no to be the size of sorry okay now now
what we need to do is is is given a set
in CDN to approximate its boundary they
are the norm okay it's a jab component
before you use the imitation C infinity
now let's see the end now these two I
put C 2 n okay so sorry and so I want to
talk about how you approximate a set
inside CDI and we continue set such at
the length the big better p a length of
the of the curve is is close to this so
the first thing you do is a polygonal
approximation okay you choose some a
some fixed in fixed are and then and
then jump from vertices which are of of
distance at least our tour is is is is
an integer now in this process this
polygon that you get doesn't have to be
simple okay but a simple change just by
taking vertices which are very close and
creating a polygon with two more
vertices will produce in a finite time
so each one each time you do this
procedure the number of components
reduces by one so this will end at some
point and in from the convergence
theorem you know that once these edges
are long enough the bead of the right
boundary distance between them will be
very similar to the norm okay is this
clear good so hmm this is the serum
which which states what I what I just
said but we will get to it in a second
okay so let's let's say give us
so for every epsilon there exists a
constant update for every are bigger
than 0 with probability which decay
which goes stretch exponentially 21 the
following halls if gamma is any
rightmost open circuit inside the box of
side which is at least are to the 1 over
5 which is very central four sets which
achieve the chigger constant and and as
and and the size of the path is more
equal than the volume to the power of 2
over 3 then there exists a simple closed
curve lambda started that it is very
close to the original one in the house
tour metric ok the one is just the yeah
so so volume gamma is this side sorry ok
so volume gamma is what was defined
earlier it's a set that that is a the
intersection of of the interior of the
of the interface in CDM see to it ok and
the one here is just the distance
between the discrete and continuous path
and and the the better p length of
lambda is smaller up to some small
approximation than the right boundary
distance of a right boundary the number
of open right boundary edges of gamma ok
so I see that you're a little bit
confused maybe it's because it confused
you any questions
it's the first time in 25 years edition
for you haha yes what yes I'm
selecting know that I didn't like simple
for that which are not simple but but I
will not I will not say more than that
so okay so let's let's give a sketch of
the of the main theorem so want to prove
the that the limit exists we do it with
a lower bound in an upper bound when the
lower bound want to start with the set
achieving the chigger constant and you
can assume that its larger than some
constant n squared okay so by definition
few of n is the ratio between the fellow
delish and so by definition fee n is the
ratio between the boundary and the size
of a n now this is a restatement of the
of the previous theorem so you find a
closed curve lambda such that it is
close to the original envelope in the
house of metric m the better p length is
smaller than that of gamma then e m so
since the polygons were chosen to be a
to include the vertices in the envelope
of a n then you know that the best
length is better than the original
envelope part between the two edited the
two and the two vertices so this gives
you this inequality these are our volume
bounds that you get from this is from
the previous theorem and since you know
by by density arguments that the size of
a n is smaller than some so that I pays
the probability of a vertex to be in in
the infinite component so the size of a
nice more than theta P plus epsilon and
squared over 2 with high probability
this gives you the lower bound on the
chigger so CP is d is the wolf the wolf
number so forgot to say okay so this
inequality says that since this is a
a path with the correct with the correct
volume normalized it is bigger than the
wolf fed the wolf number so this is the
easier part a danger sign in the upper
bound we want to start from the wolf
shape but a priori nobody it tells us
the wolf shape is contained inside a box
right just a solution of some is a
prometric question so we need to show so
first of all we need to blow it up to
the correct size we need to show that
it's contained in the box so let's do
this so the red thing is supposed to be
the wolf shape this is not how it really
looks like this is for this proof so let
alpha be the maximal number in the x
axis which is still included inside WP
yes so we're going to use this convex
but i want to show yes but but how can
you how this is a corrected idea how can
you picture a convex set that lives so
which contains this vertices and leaves
this is enabled
we will stay to become excellent hmm
yeah but you want you want you want to
control you to bound it explicitly
because you want it you want you want to
approximate it to a set which can
achieve the chigger constant so it has
to have the correct size inside the
correct boxes so essentially you need to
you need to give a very good bound on on
the L infinity box which contains it ok
so indeed x so x by symmetry and a
convexity you know that if this point
exists and also this point in this point
in this point so the l1 ball fridays
alpha is contained inside awp now this
is why the picture looks ugly because of
the assumption by contradiction so
assume that the rigus there is some
point x which is to the right of alpha
ok so it leaves the L infinity ball then
by symmetry you know that also a the
reflection of X is in the box so you
know that X plus the reflection which is
a barracks mmm so has length which is
smaller than two times better p of n
okay so this means that x bar over 2 is
inside WP boots this is a contradiction
ok so so we get this trivial a measure
bounds and by normalizing it correctly
you know that the normalized wolf shape
contains the l1 ball of at least one
half is it contained it an affinity ball
with right this one over square root 2
ok oh this is not hard what this is
essential for for the nation ok so what
you want to do is is start with the wolf
shape and you know by definition that VP
is the length of the boundary of the
wolf shape now again what we do is
approximate it by some polygons ok and a
polygon which is a close enough to the
original shape this you can always
always do
and now from from each of the vertices
of the polygon what we show that you can
find paths which are almost optimal so
optimal up to some small epsilon
correction which are as close as we want
to the path so if you take this path you
don't get too far away from from the
polygon and that's from the original
wolf shape in the house tough metric
oh fuck
good okay so so again you do this don't
tell anybody in this building that I
never configured something of factors
stuff in my computer and so this is how
you find a path inside C so this is how
we find so this path are inside see a
site CDN okay they are close to the
original set and enter a rightness
boundaries smaller so this is choosing
the polygonal and blowing it up to the
correct size is taking this this pass
and and creating this a simple a simple
circuit with the with smaller right
boundary and now take take all the
vertices in the interior of this
envelope okay the size is similar to
theta pi over 2 times n squared so we
get also the upper bound which is clear
so there no itch itch itch move was was
a lie so we have to show that everything
happens with high probability we use the
uniform convergence right so so where is
uniformity important in the lower bound
we started from sunset and we did this
polygonum so you need uniformity for all
directions every starting point in this
proof the uniformity is not as important
but it talks are there any questions so
far Ori we move to the open questions so
so this is essentially proof for the
limit for therefore the bimini
conjecture in two dimension so the limit
exists
but but this is also already very close
to the shape theorem which I will not
discuss today are there any questions on
this proof before we go to the open
questions okay so so some open question
so when x equals 1 the so what is the
the what is our boundary norm
essentially all the edges are open right
so it's just the l1 l1 norm alright so
the wolf shape is the is Del L infinity
ball which is what we know right if you
just take a the tourists and then set
achieve the two constants are our
squares and now a square is not smooth
because it has corners but what acrylic
injector is want to take some P which is
between one and PC to already become
some may find very interesting and at
the moment we don't have any idea of how
how to prove this and now another
interesting conjecture is the is the
limiting shape as P goes to one half
so essentially nothing all right because
it's given its give it so it's it's a
it's a deterministic we know that it's
some deterministic shape but it's given
by by some norm now once you know the
norm you know what the what the what the
shape looks like but so when you're very
close to one it's it's easy to show that
the norm is close to l1 and then the the
shape is close to the to the square it's
also not very hard to show that that so
all we know to do now is Union bound to
take 1 minus epsilon 1 epsilon is very
small then essentially you cannot find a
path with yes fixed just just just do to
win the number of trajectories this what
I mean you okay and but but essentially
we don't even know to prove for instance
this thing which is very naturally when
P goes to one-half that the limit
limiting shape converges to the
occluding ball but this relates to
another open question about just the the
the graph distance in percolation which
is also not known so that the graph
distance converges to the occluding
distance when P goes to one-half and
another natural question is higher
dimensions so so on the were some works
on wolf construction in the easing model
that generalized it to higher dimensions
by by self but your your fan and
veronique
so these journals ations are quite
technical and and it's not certain that
that we can actually use some of this
because because there is a a big
difference between droplets and and and
subtle geometric questions like k is a
prometric set and but we're thinking
about it so for instance it's not really
even to define the norm right so in two
dimensions we define define the norm via
this rightmost path which is essentially
a the way we we found out you can
characterize the envelopes of settings
that in dead too but a higher dimensions
you don't have a jaw dancer right you
can you have all these weird sets like
the Klein bottle Alexandra's hold the
horn sphere so it's not certain how
given a path you know what is the what
is the orientation of the of the edges
that you're supposed to take so one way
for instance your journey to generalize
it is is is to do this twice influential
first look so take two point six why for
every set which contains x and y owned
on the inner boundary look at all the
past on the boundary of the set now the
set a boundary gives you the correct
orientation of the of the past boundary
and now take infant over all the sets
over and over all the passes but then so
so we're thinking about it's not easy to
show subjectivity that it converges
certainly uniform convergence will not
be easy but hope that it will succeed
okay question
so I think white they understand what
you know and what you don't go about the
shame so what sense it's usually fairly
standard to argue things about the
curvature of the worksheet that would
but if you know how to do that and
probably will place that open folder
tian shan so what's all so again d we
get the norm x by the sub additive
ergodic theory basically it's not very
constructive right so we know that there
is some limiting shape we have a
characterization of it but this is our
station s yeah exactly the norm is the
surface of the surface tension this is
the restatement of the second derivative
movie that's that's all hey yeah sure
yes the calibration usually so something
in 30 is to know that the second
derivative is a slinky positivity or
something like so I get
probabilistically that the norm is is is
is not very hard to understand right
given a path you have if the boundary so
so it's not hard to do the calculations
and and and use the norm even though you
don't you don't know what it is so all
we need is this bound to say that if
points are far are far away then the the
best path is close to the close to the
norm it's not not immediately than you
and we need all this technology of
casting but but this is possible without
knowing right like like you have all
this super critical claims when when you
don't know what the critical number is
so many things are easy are possible to
do without knowing what it actually is
so so we know that there is there exists
something it's deterministic but we
don't have a a mmm sure sure sure yes
noted yeah
so it is the dual bowl of some of some
norms so it's nice but but which norm
that's the question item and and you you
you pass from from a square to do to a
circle by what by what way what are the
fluctuation these things are are
interesting and very open</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
