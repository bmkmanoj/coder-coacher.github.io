researcher at the algorithms and data
science group in Microsoft Research
Indian my main research area is a design
analysis and understanding of efficient
algorithms I work on fundamental
problems which are of practical
relevance that said today there is a
divide between the understanding of the
theory and practice of algorithms for
instance for many problems practitioners
design very clever heuristics which seem
to work well in real life but we don't
have an understanding of why it is so I
get especially intrigued by these
questions let me tell you about one such
problem to do so I need to tell you a
little bit about some modular functions
these are set functions which prescribe
a value two subsets of an N element
universe what makes a function
submodular as the so called diminishing
returns property you may have heard of
this in economics basically says that
the marginal utility of an item
decreases with your endowment the
precise definition is not important
today but what you should take home is
that these abstract mathematical objects
arise in various areas like economics
biology information theory and in
computer science in machine learning
discrete optimization computer vision
speech recognition what have you an
important paradigm is that of submodular
function minimization that is given the
submodular function can you find the
subset s which minimizes f of X consider
how non-trivial this problem is if my
universe is of size n number of subsets
is 2 to the N so if n is 100 which is a
very modest size the number of subsets
already exceeds the number of atoms in
the universe so brute force algorithm is
out of the question but there is a magic
in submodel functions which allows us to
optimize in polynomial time in the last
30 years theorists and practitioners
have been trying to invent newer and
faster algorithms for doing so
the current champion is the so-called
Fuji she gave wolf heuristic it seems to
work very well in practice however or
understanding is not very well the best
analysis of this heuristic was an
exponential time analysis with my
colleague patike jan here at Microsoft
Research India and our intern bhavesh
qatari who is now the University of
Texas we managed to prove that this food
is you google furiously in fact runs in
polynomial time if you are interested to
learn how this is done you can watch a
longer video and read the paper on the
links below thank you
