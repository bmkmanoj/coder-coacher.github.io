you
thanks everyone for coming I went into
this under Shepherd earn the paper notes
in here that's roughly it yeah Anders is
the CEO and founder of worthy worthy a
service that enables crowdsourcing
copy-editing he will tell us more about
it what they has been running since 2011
and so there's a lot of lessons learned
in in the you know in the project behind
this so with that let me just unlock my
computer yeah thank you great thank you
very much thank you very much for having
me I call this wedding a brown back
because it's not going to be like a
sales trouble for Eddie is going to be
I'm gonna try to answer some of the
questions that andreas hat but I'm also
going to give you a bit of background my
background is that I solid political
science and philosophy my professional
career has been in advertising that's
prasad oakland and then I switched a
little bit to banking and I then started
worry basically I came up with the idea
were you I'm Danish which is our
disclaimer really so you're not going to
have kind of a fantastic experience of
me really putting everything together in
a great way and stuff that's not what I
do so you can always ask if there's
something that you do not understand if
there's something I'm missing just let
me know about it so that's a bit about
my personal background the background of
wordy is that I could see that I had a
growing need to quantify my own writing
so I'm of course I'm a Danish but most
of the stuff that i did was in english
and i did this for money right so I was
basically shipping a product that I
could not qualify I had no real tools of
qualifying this product
and every time I kind of liked thought
well off it goes and we'll hope for the
best and i sent my invoice and and i
hope that everything was okay but I was
basically shipping something then I put
my stamp on I put my signature on that I
couldn't qualify and I couldn't really
explain if the overall quality of this
thing was in good shape and that really
bugged me so the initial idea we're
actually which became the you know the
the long-term solution as well was to
basically say well I want to acquire
real time editing from the best possible
editors at a competitive price point so
by real time I meant if I had 400 words
I wanted to send out I was not going to
wait two days to have these 400 words
back again and if I had 4,000 words I
mean though I was not going to wait a
week I had to get this stuff back
quickly so i could so i could just ship
it along best possible editors is
something that has to do with the
quality of editors of course but also
has to do a lot with the cultural
background of the editor I wanted
answers that had an understanding of
what it was that I did at the time so I
didn't have to kind of bring them up to
speed every time and and that was
actually a huge thing for me and a
competitive price point of course even
though I was unsure of the quality of
the writing itself I was I could you
know sit down and spend an hour on a 400
work thing and make make sure that this
had copy for example was in really good
shape but I also wanted to do other
stuff and the value I could create by
doing other stuff which was of course
which or should be much bigger than the
the actual price of a pain editors so
the real time editing are the best
possible editor and a well a competitive
price point we're basically the the
operative words of the initial
and so to be answered here today is a
list of seven questions okay so I'm
going to try and do that for midst of a
question or something like that is
surprises in building wordy its
difficulties curves drought souls
competition our conflict payments
recruitment and publicity so that's
roughly what andreas asked for and
that's what I'm trying to do today let
me know if I don't and please please
feel free to interrupt so we can have a
discussion about that but that's what
I'm trying to answer I'm just going to
run through a few definitions here so
first of all I'll define product the
product that I work with as a text of
any length on any subject so basically
anything you can write be it short long
of public-private what have you I'm not
putting in value or yeah or anything
that will make you go well I'll not pay
to have this particular product make
better and i'll actually pay to have
this particular product might make
better not i'm not kind of scoring of
the product in value here i see that oh
I say that the product that we work with
are basically small short short long
academic advertising text you know
everything that can basically be put
down in writing and so that's our
product the service itself is a
distributed expert workforce with a gang
teed quality of output and of course
it's not a crowdsource workforce in the
sense that we just bring in people to
the platform where you can score them
and they'll you know slowly rise and
eric are icky and and you can then pick
the best ones etc and of course I so
platform as a platform we guarantee the
quality of our output of our product so
so that's the service and the offer and
this is taken from taking from our faq
pays its basically correcting grammar
and punctuation ensuring coherent user
in some consistency and coherent luckily
logical structure in the product right
so when it leaves wordy you will have a
text that hopefully was better than
before you send it to worry and
hopefully a lot better right so that's
what we try and do now just finally one
final definition is the definition of a
knowledge worker this is a very broad
definition but it also needs to be in
then I'll tell you why so it's anyone
who creates distributes and appliance
knowledge which funny enough is also the
the our cork line so it's all of you
guys is all basically all the guys that
sin through jobs while worthy so
knowledge workers are classified like
this and of course our editors are also
part of this group but the great thing
about our editors is that they can sit
anywhere and that's what you can
actually do with some part of knowledge
work not saying with your work saying
with some work you can actually make
sure that you can send this out to a
professional distributed workforce and
you'll get exactly the same quality and
output that you would have if you have
someone in-house and you can do that
with a lot of knowledge work some say
five some say ten some save much more
than safe much less but you can actually
do that with a lot of knowledge work so
the first thing is how we recruit and we
basically focus on three things right so
again we are an expert distributed
workforce so we're of course looking for
experience and we're looking for skill
and we're looking for time experience is
what an editor has when he or she has
worked a long time and editing has had a
fruitful career as a employee and it's
now a freelance for example and that is
something that we take very seriously we
can also do stuff with experience that
is growing quite great we can look at
the digital footprint of the editor we
can ask for references we can check
these reference
sirs and we can basically say well this
is an editor that would fit really well
into word time and then it's a needs to
be able to assign some time on our
platform during a workday and so it is
roughly between one and two hours that
any individual editor that Kent can
spend on wordy during a workday and of
course we need that so we do not have
these relationships where an editor is
on the platform and then 12 months
passed by and then the editors on the
platform again we need to have some sort
of way to make sure that these editors
actually regulate it as on the platform
and skill skill is not something that we
can measure with a digital footprint or
we can measure by asking for references
etc skill is something that we need to
test just as any old job interview we
need to test some of the skills that yet
it's a sess he or she has and so we have
a quite elaborate house style which
basically is how we handle content of a
generic how we handle product of a
generic nature and we have some quite
elaborate tests and how to actually
qualify and and yeah and verify the
skill of these editors so of course you
can say well now we want to have if we
bring in a lot of students then well
this one falls out right and we're just
looking for this middle thing here and
if we bring in a lot of fresh old
editors that are just starting out as
freelancers well perhaps it's either
their skill experience that that is a
problem so we are basically looking for
a combination of these free things yeah
not a request but it's something that we
like to see right so we follow each
individual editor in it if an editor
does a lot of work he or she is
promoting them system and especially of
course if that work is a fantastic
policy a lot of work bad quality the
opposite yes yeah yeah they don't get
paid for that this is actually these
free things are the real person we're
looking for is a freelance editor let's
say an editor that has local regional
clients but to do not have a global
output and is perhaps not aware that
that product that he or she or the
service that he or she is offering it's
a fantastic service and I really believe
that I think it's the best thing to be
able to actually construct and and 22
yet to polish language into something
that's well written that's easy to
understand that super hot easy to digest
etc that is a very very fantastic
ability to have and but these freelance
editors I'm afraid don't know that yet
so that's something that I likes only
reason I liked assume that is it is
actually something that that they can
feel proud of and a very very specific
skill of course experience a skill also
comes with with what is the editors
educational background and what is the
editors professional background so so
we're basically looking for 14 years of
experience two hours one to two hours
per day two beams work of course you can
go away and 14 days vacation right and
we're not but we are tracking that and
of course skills we're on our internal
ordering system we would like to see you
know eighty percent or more an hour on
our quality scale
who is that so that's the typical edits
on woody a man in a hat doing stuff with
a stick so that's the recruitment
process and this is of course what we're
trying to to automate as much as
possible but checking up on references
and digital footprints etc is something
that is very manual in a sense so
reviewing the five-star review when I
say that we have a not a crowd source
platform and we vouch as a brand for the
quality of the product we do have
internal scoring which also includes
stars but we do not show these stars to
clients because what we want to do when
we have these editors with these
excellent skills with a lot of
experience and and you know really a
they can do stuff they can do stuff on
their own and we don't have to intervene
they can also take on the project
mention role and and that's basically a
way of saying well when an editor and
the clients and a client hooks up
through worry the declined should feel
comfortable that this editor can
actually do the job and it's not you
know does not have a four-and-a-half
star review or or you know even a
three-and-a-half star and stuff like
that if there is an editor which goes
below par will of course make sure that
that enter knows it and if that
continues that it editor you know slowly
you know moose away from actually being
able to acquire jobs but the editors
that we do put in front of clients are
what i would consider five-star deter so
we do not make it your responsibility to
choose between this and that editor we
actually make it the editors
responsibility to choose work that fits
which his or her description
and that is something that I think is
very valuable from a client perspective
you don't have to go through endless
profiles of that it says roughly doing
the same thing all with five star
reviews they all look great and as an
editor you can actually pick and choose
between jobs that that fit your profile
so I say in this case what's the point
of giving a star review to an external
star review to to an editor in case of
conflict if the product if the client
feel that this product is simply not
good enough we review first of all we
look at the product before it went
through worry and we look at the end
product and then we offer a proportional
refund or not and this is basically got
to do with if the client asked for a
refund will give them a refund but will
also give them an explanation why we
think that that refund is unfair well
here are 400 words that you sent through
the editor made 50s or so changes and
the Texas actually much better now and
we rely heavily on internal scoring and
reviewing than doing that but of course
will give a client refund but will also
send a very detailed explanation of why
we think that that is that is a job
that's I've been well done or we can
agree with the client say well this is
simply not a well done job and of course
that's an entirely different thing but
we do try and and learn from these
conflicts and and you know since we go
through a lot of pain to actually score
and validate these editors we hope we
rarely see conflicts but they are there
right and it can be based on either the
end product or it can be based on some
court of communication issue during the
job itself yeah
yeah so basically we so the client
actually has to run a brief to start
with and some briefs are just ate this
and some brief are quite specific and
well the better the brief the better as
a job I say right and so if the editor
has any questions or comments during you
know you she's worked while she or she
was working on that job here she will
get in touch with the client and say
well I do not understand this and that
and that's a great thing again right the
project management role is now the
editors and the client so we do we don't
have to set an intervene and say well
you know right this live on back so
again by using this this this expert
pool of of people or this pool of expert
your people it's also you know you can
actually get a lot of quality from these
people and and and and I think the more
power you actually give the individual
editor to cancel jobs you can touch with
the client to do this and that the
better they perform and the more value
the client gets as well so so it's
actually a win-win thing so when we
started out you know Google Translate
was a great way of sending through jobs
and wordy and making sure you know
translation companies used us to qualify
really crappy product and we couldn't do
that so we had to say to customer this
is just not possible we cannot take this
piece of product and make and turn it
into something else it's not doable well
we refine that process where we don't
have to come to that we don't let
editors in that we have a feeling that
we will need to kick out at some point
right so the more refined that
acquisition process is the yetis the you
don't need to kick you out there
what is not a learning platform right so
as you say their skills could improve
over time and I agree with that but if
you put someone in front of a client and
actually charge money for that then the
whole learning experience is kind of
gone right we can actually touch in this
a little bit late because I think it's
actually quite important and it's
something that's we definitely need to
do something about because that is part
of being a part of the workplace right
that you improve and you do things
together and with a service like this
that interaction is just not there yet
but it needs to be there for people to
improve so that's the conflict side of
things right and and again if if the if
the first product is simply not simply
not in the state where we can edit it we
do not touch it and we reef on the
client if the end product is not good
enough we refund the client if the end
product is good enough and we feel that
the client has you know made some kind
of strange claim then we refund it but
we certainly learn from that experience
yeah we do ad hoc stuff like that and we
take you know 300 key accounts and say
how do you like this and that is there
is the one particular it said that you
really like is that one particular
editor that could do better stuff like
that but it's more ad hoc basis with
really short not long you know
interviews and stuff like that and of
course we look at at the client reviews
of editors as well because we have that
you know you can actually score an
editor we just don't advertise it so so
you can actually you know you can make
yourself hurt through that right
yeah cool but it said you know it's a
great way of keeping the presentation
flow
and of course the better people you have
the less conflict you have and I think
that's a real learning and payments well
it's fairly simple really we you know we
surf prices in euros pounds of dollars
and and and and that's for clients no we
then track whatever editors are doing
and we and we and we tracked with euros
for it says and then we basically just
pay them a price per word and and they
get that price every end of the month of
course there are some wonderful services
out there we actually do not lose that
much in a currency can conversion
situation so so it's actually it's got
cheaper to run a company like this where
we have so many variations of dollars
new zealand dollars australian dollars
canadian dollars u.s. dollars where
that's it bouncing of course your roses
put just one currency but also all these
transactions going up it's still a lot
of manual stuff but but it's it's it's
much easier now than it was even in 2011
right yeah so editors of freelancers and
they basically just they basically just
should give that kind of information to
their tax authority so we don't do
anything that of course with since we're
registered in UK we pay dat so some
editors who are registered companies but
that's it and so some of the micro
difficulties is of course to facilitate
that communication between the editor
and a client which is so valuable and
that is often missed but that is a
design issue right you want to say you
can actually get in touch with a rose
marie and you can ask your questions and
you can read her profile and you can do
stuff with that has to do with this
product and you can make it better and
you can learn from each other handling
impossible jobs right that's something
that we've gotten pretty good at it's
not that impossible jobs are there is
jobs that are simply not we cannot
conclude or we cannot finish these jobs
based on the quality that they have
but they're rare really and of course
the one thing that we are struggling
with is to ensure consistency across
jobs here's microsoft research here's
one document per month from Microsoft
Research and that document is is
probably done by a different edits age
time and has some sort of it there has
to be some sort of consistency between
these the these documents and that's
something that we are working on and how
do you actually solve them so we have
four different editors you know even if
perhaps a house style if know how style
then how can you actually ask the
clients say I really liked this job and
it was done precisely the way I wanted
to and I want to you know I just want to
replicate that process across all other
jobs to have that kind of consistency
but that is probably the most important
micro difficulty that we have right and
of course macro difficulties and this is
where I think it gets really exciting is
that we want to turn wordy into any
other and workplace way a place where
you can learn and where you can have
discussions about what it is that you do
and and and really better yourself in a
way with we we're not again we're not a
learning platform but but we want to
take these really good editors and make
them even better and we can do that
through social interaction between
editors but if one editors in Auckland
and and other editors and Vancouver it's
quite hard to facilitate that
interaction and it's something that I
definitely want to work on and of course
creating these real and lasting
relationships and not again another nice
fun this so I don't know how crowdsource
work really you know how crowdsource
platforms really work but if you see
each individual work as a silo in his
own right then you suddenly you miss out
on that really cool social interaction
that could be there and you want to
create these lasting relationships
because you want to you want to get
people to interact with each other and
I'm sad to report that so far we're also
just treating editors and silence and
Silas and and again to turn word into
work place you have to somehow
facilitate that interact
and then it's basically just adding more
value to the process and that value is
already there so the human capital is
there and and they can do so much more
so let's say you want to learn how to
write this and that you can actually ask
the edits about it let's say you're when
venturing into something you where you
can find an editor who can actually give
you give you some really good sparring
in that and so all that we need to
unlock all that value that cops that
comes from a yeah from an expert
workforce and there's so much good stuff
there so it's not just grammar and
punctuation it's also knowledge and how
to actually how to actually write
something that makes great sense and can
actually do what it is that you're
trying to do with that specific product
that's it so I think I think I answered
most of the questions I've seen worthy
demo yeah absolutely yeah
and maybe the Google Docs integration
yeah
can I get a way to access the Google
homepage here
so this is me and this is worried right
what
now it gives so boring with an on-screen
demo that was not prepared but this is
basically what you do hey yesterday I
sent through that presentation and Lynn
picked it up and she edited for me and I
can actually give you some statistics
perhaps that even better social here
right so I was up 6o seven a.m. london
time and i'd say so at lynn picked it up
and since it's just in since it's just
where is it since it's just 141 words
Lynn had it ready for me are there yeah
yeah Lynn had it ready for me six
minutes later right so that was my way
of making sure that this presentation
would not at least look stupid in print
and and and making sure that everything
was was was done right and this is
basically the kind of service I was
looking for a way back when when I said
okay I wanted this to be done really
really quickly and I wanted to be done
in this case six euros which roughly is
what 88 us yeah something like that it's
based on words in this case it we have a
minimum order so we have a minimum order
of 300 words you can use it which
reaches your group your tweets sorry
yeah
in this case it's a listen in this case
it's a PDF and I'm not sure if that's
going to show up real nice on the screen
I'm just go ahead and click it right
take a leap of faith and there should be
some changes in there there Linda's
remove the full stop there another full
stop see if again when people use yeah
okay yeah and again so you can see all
the little although not all I was you
know this is not a long text so nice not
so many things could go wrong so here
there are some things with how we set
this up but the thing is that this was
actually a quotation from wordy so I did
not change any of this even though Lin
would like me to write yeah with a
longer type job I've could have said to
a world this is actually a quotation so
could you please just ignore that stuff
types of like videos yeah so the reason
why I'm here is also that i'm in
vancouver right now speaking to my
developers and we want to be able to
track this because we have absolutely no
idea and you know i have a you know we
have pretty good understanding of what
it is that people actually send through
word docs is certainly up there PDFs are
also but Google Docs is actually picking
up pace and we just want to be able to
track that
that's an unfair question I was working
on this presentation but I'll probably
look at them later yeah so we have a
integration that basically it's not from
google side you send your well let me
rephrase that you do not install an ad
on Google side you actually hook up your
your account with your google drive
account so there's a handshake going on
there and basically it looks like this I
to go like this ah i'm pretty sure i
cannot show you yeah it could be yes
something like that yeah I couldn't
really answer that but let me try and go
to up there's my document right and then
I need a list I that's your account okay
cool yeah and then
sorry I'm opening stuff here that I
shouldn't so I'll just go ahead and
close this real quickly basically what
you can do so you can select a document
and you can send it out to work then you
are then taken to worry and you just go
through the ordering process as you
would any other job so what we will have
is an add-on where you actually just
push audio yeah you take that out on and
just and you just push that document
towards worry so you don't even have to
go away so I'm not a big fan of that I'm
not a big fan of the web application at
such because I think that it should
really go on where people are so when
you ask okay do you have that you overdo
did you hear about the new office API I
think that's a wonderful thing because
you don't want to leave that document
once you're in it right you don't want
to save it go too wordy right the brief
everything you just want to be in that
document just as you would you know send
it off for printing you would also send
it off for editing and that's really
where i want to take until the web
application to me it's actually yeah
it's a necessary
yeah yeah yeah so you can basically you
know you can attach your house style to
a document or you can say well I always
want this house style for all documents
right that's where consistency kicks in
where is really cool but if a client
does not have a house style and we try
to be consistent in cross jobs is a
little bit more it's harder but you can
I say well I want you to follow this
house tile link to it or I want you to
follow this house down upload it and
send it through with the job right so
but that's a huge thing especially for
academic often it's part of the house
style right it's just the document that
says you have to do this and that or you
have to adhere to this and that so let's
say that you're writing and an academic
peach Peter sorry and academic peach
let's say you're not doing that but
you're actually writing into the
academic piece for up for a specific
journal in the US for example then
they'll have some some some things that
you should you to adhere to and it could
be font size it could be that you have
to list your your quotations in there in
this special and it could be that you
have to use these special words that can
take a lot more time yeah it's part of
the cost structure as it is right now
and that's because jobs that takes time
jobs that take time even up you have
other jobs that take not that much time
so it you know I want to be able to
offer and since we are actually working
with these brilliant people I also want
to be able to offer fair compensation
for their work right and so we are
trying to adhere to these yeah to these
suggested hourly rates for predators and
and and some time yeah again some jobs
just take a lot of time other jobs don't
and that evens out
don't realize that
not much because you know research and
stuff is something that academic clients
do them on their own right we also have
ethical guidelines that say where we
cannot take that piece of terrible
quality and turn it into something
that's actually ready for publishing and
so so it's basically what we do is that
we that we have a very specific list of
things that we can do at it with a text
and a very specific list of things that
we cannot do to a text and and I've it's
not a problem that we see that often so
in some way we must have made it clear
to clients that this is actually what we
do right yeah Laurie appliance from only
companies yeah so companies put down
most support of yeah the monthly
turnover and it's from all over place so
i just mentioned euros pounds and and
and and you were in dollars right so
eighty percent of our turnover is in us
ten percent at no more fifteen percent
is in euros and just five percent is
actually euros even though pounds even
though we are registered in england
which is quite funny but that's how it
is and so yeah a lot of clients actually
in the u.s. also quite a few clients in
the middle east end of course in
mainland europe as well and these
clients are academic institutions larger
larger q count clients and then all
other you know private people for
example you know just sending through
this and that applications resumes
whatever you know just a hodgepodge of
of anything do you find that most of the
people are people whose language
yeah so this is a very very good
representation of the typical client you
know multiple nationalities under one
roof you know publishing a lot and
trying to get as much out of the door as
possible and so they can focus on other
things and that's really the typical
client that said it's also clients that
have multiple writers english first
language right but they did they have
multiple writers and they want to make
sure that there's a consistency across
writing so so that's also something that
we see ya
probably aren't insurers who have I
guess I'm wondering what sort of like
typical business activities has sort of
the surrounding ecosystem of starters
have really lagged behind
yeah we do not have one legal planner ok
yeah as far as they do not trust the
platform they do not trust us to
actually receive their content and send
it back again right but we have clients
that sent through yearly reports you
know press releases stuff like that
stuff which is actually highly
confidential but then we said and we
said an editor team for them of you know
relatively small editor team and we sign
the India in all that stuff but you're
completely right we cannot ensure that
kind of thing oh yeah and you know we
cannot make sure that this kind of thing
does not happen right so so it's also a
little bit of a leap of faith vote for
clients but yet again drawing from a
pool of experienced freelance editors
they also know these kinds of things
right and and but it it all goes back to
it's a question of trust rating and and
that's especially for legal firms not
going
yeah we don't have any insurance that No
nope well the thing is that we will look
at that insurance if a client comes up
and say well we'll spend this amount of
money that can actually you know yeah
they can actually pay for that kind of
insurance until then you know clients
find us and they use us we have an
indian place we do reach out to bigger
clients and say do you want us to sign
this yes we want you to sign an NDA and
all that stuff but when push come to
shop really we are even your if a really
great client says we have a problem here
then we have a huge problem okay
yeah that's it yeah okay so just yeah
but the 82nd the EO the client can
easily write could Lynn do this I want
Lynn to do this right because you did it
all the other four documents and she did
really well so I want Lynn to do this
you can bookmark Edison space ET right
is and it's a real process just to write
the Ellises name and and that's it all
the editors will hopefully leave it
alone and if it just sits there are
other editors will get in touch with the
clients a page you need us to do this
right and then in this it'll pick it up
um we have 150 yeah I say 200 new video
getting there and of course you know
some work a lot some don't work that
Martian that and that's basically it
right but just to come back to that so I
see what we do as a distributed
workforce a distributed expert workforce
right a crowdsourced across those thing
is another thing because then we
suddenly have the all these questions
compliance saying well I like this guy
and that guy's you know this fairly
often and the thing is that we do not
want to assume or we do not want to give
that client or we do not want to give
the client that task of project
management and quality scoring and all
that stuff because as you mentioned they
came to us for a specific reason they
cannot do it by themselves right so if
they cannot do it by themselves are they
then able to score us right and the
answer is probably no yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah but yes you know that's
the white labeling thing yeah we've
definitely had that question but it's
not something that we explored right so
it's like yeah you could do that the one
huge client that was almost ready to
that said mama they would like their own
system of your cell sheets the emails
going forward and back door and there
wasn't really anything we could do about
it because suddenly that this whole
discussion turned perhaps a little bit
political and then you have you know I
want to protect y'all and all that stuff
but it's a really nice platform actually
and if you have your own closed editor
team even in house right you can
actually do surf a lot quick and as a
project manager it's actually so much
more easy to just you know to dispute
jobs and sin on but but the one big one
that said we could actually try this did
not you know it didn't pan out so it's
like okay well perhaps we're just better
off by doing what it is that we're doing
and not and not stop using this platform
at
yeah i think the emitted question
answers that would be microsoft is
always welcome yeah but actually you
know in most organizations you have like
this copy desk and there somewhere and
you don't quite know where they are and
you do not quite know how to order this
and and suddenly it becomes you know
quite cumbersome to actually go through
this process so of course is you just
shiver of stuff that would be much
easier but that also brings us back to
that whole thing of having wordy next to
the print button right that's where you
want to have it and it shouldn't be this
whole web application you now in your 15
line whatever it should be you should
really be like this real-time experience
if just having someone else go for your
document so you can go and create value
somewhere else and I think that's the
real key of the platform yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah I thought about that
we're just waiting for the right we
can't develop it ourselves but I've
heard of one I think it's called Leia
Leia it yeah and you can you even it you
can you can implement conversation like
that into apps and they're coming up
with a web interface yeah could be it
yeah yeah yeah yeah but that's
definitely something and that would that
is the value creation process right here
you are here you go and there's stuff
like that that's just that's so
fantastic right you know you I have that
conversation about a specific subject
and you know you're 5,000 miles apart
you do not necessarily know each other
but now you suddenly have that working
relationship which is something that
only these platforms can do call them
crowdsource call them you know expert
distributed workforce it doesn't really
matter but that's the real magic of it
and that's also where that whole value
is actually where it's hidden right yeah
yeah it's really simple right create job
create account create an initiate a
conversation with with the editor know
when the job is done and that's
basically it right pay for job no no not
pay for job you actually pay for because
we charge up front so you can create job
but if you haven't got any money in your
account you have to go to wedding fill
it up so with the start with the Google
integration we have to update that whole
a API thing and that's that's coming
also in this quarter as well yeah
it has a son named yeah well because you
know that's you know translation is a
completely different game and it
requires a completely different you know
setup and structure and you have to do
you have to make a choice of where we
want to you know we want to do this by
hand or we want to have some machine
translation in there and then we would
send it through editors and stuff like
that so it's definitely something that
people ask for but I feel that we just
you know we have our own little niche
going on here and I really want to
explore that niche before we start
venturing into new things so additional
languages would be great arabic french
german italian stuff like that that
would really be great because that's
also what clients are asking for but of
course the next thing that they're
asking for is it could you take that
english piece and turn it into whatever
well i could do that but it requires few
emails going for them at and it's not
going to be something that we probably
probably not going to be something that
we integrate into word could be trusted
you know partnership API stuff something
like that yeah yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
