you
jackoff we have a very different take on
neighborhood very la style so I'd like
to welcome the Art Center College of
Design to come on stage and they're
going to be talking about a pop-up
sensor and nail salon hi my name is
Jenny Rodin house and I'm Christina
Ortega and we're two graduate students
at media design practices at art center
was experiencing some technical
difficulties with the clicker sorry this
isn't working oh there we go thank you
and the observation we sort of began
with was really noticing that there's a
growing population of wearable devices
and really wondering about you know what
new says systems or services that might
develop in order to support these new
devices and these new wearers and so
today we're really going to talk with
you throughout our process and kind of
present that to you so kind of taking
you through our research and
investigations and existing services in
Los Angeles our early prototypes and our
user testing which really became this
pivot point for us and where we really
develop these new insights for our
research so our investigation began at a
nail salon nail salons a really
important part of these rituals of salt
main self-maintenance in Los Angeles
there's a salon on every corner and it's
a place we can go and unload and have a
great time so Jenny and I went it was a
two-hour install and Jenny strap the
GoPro to her head and it started with
this fantastic negotiation between us
and the nail technicians and that really
turned into small tack and from that it
turned into gossip and from that we
really felt when we left like a sense of
therapy from it and the nails have a
three-week lifecycle from that life
cycle you have you returned to the salon
have your nails d installed and then be
installed going to this nail art salon
really opens us up to this passionate
experimental subculture
that's in LA and worldwide so from like
really being inspired by this nail
culture we started to mix kind of this
more tech aesthetic with nail aesthetics
so sensors and charms on one nail and we
also explored like new three-dimensional
forms and new sensor behaviors and from
this we kind of generated a full system
of different nail extensions exploring
piezo s4 and watch batteries for power
generation which is a big issue with
wearable technology as well as how to
distribute that power to your fingertips
so looking at sensor our circuitry nails
and 3d breadboards as well as different
sensor behaviors like just a simple led
all the way to something more
complicated like a haptic feedback or
flex sensor or something more lines as
like like space or proximity proximity
Thank You Fox amity sensor so after we
designed this set of nails we really
wanted to get people into the studio and
try them out so we started the user
testing scenario here I'm embedding
piezo to tap tap tabs tabs to Devin
attached to LEDs and Chrissy had
proximity sensors attached a haptic
feedback after the scenarios we talked
to Chrissy and Chrissy said I would use
these nails if I wanted to quit smoking
and at that moment we really realized
that it wasn't about what we designed on
the nails it was about the nails giving
Chrissy a platform to speculate for
herself and so at that like pivot point
in the project we really decided the
nails it wasn't about nails it was about
designing this space where Chrissy could
could collaborate with people and
speculate on what she wanted so you
really shifted our designs from like
looking at those nail extensions to more
this investigation of the salon or the
space so you know what are the new
juxtaposition of tool sets and then what
are these new roles so we kind of
thought about ok well there would be a
manicurist sitting next to a developer
and then there'd be an interaction
designer an industrial designer and then
there'd be a doctor yeah so
you know he could chart and keep track
of Chrissy's progress so it was really
about this combination of salon and
maker lab so two weeks ago we opened up
the sensor salon in my apartment and
here in LA and so we hired seven
individuals for a one-day opening so
this is our client Sarah and there was
such a great educational moment with her
and at this point she's ecstatic about
the possibility of getting an LCD screen
on her nail and this is our way this is
our nail artists she's a fantastic nail
artist to the stars and she's really
interested in embedding LEDs on nails so
we went through a whole demo just
embedding LEDs on nails then we have our
dev and design our development and
design team it's Marcus and Aaron here a
Whitney was the name of our nail artists
Marcus and Aaron here and also Clare not
shown and they helped with 3d printing
and coding and sensors and everything
and then lastly we have a sensor
ethnographer this is Erica and she
really helped us extract I'm interpret
what Sarah wanted and what she needed on
her nails and the day began with a
brainstorm everybody came in everybody
introduced themselves everybody kind of
explained what their skill set was and
then we went in and we explained what
was the sensor salon what these sensors
were how we thought they could be used
and there was a fantastic like
educational moment with Whitney and Sara
where they're not they're very new to
make our culture and they really you
could see the sparks light up when they
found out like with Sara finding out
she'd have an LCD screen on her nail and
they just her ideas went rampant so in
the morning you saw like the group kind
of was convened and brainstorm and
together and then they sort of broke off
so we saw two parts of the room sort of
form so on one side you see Whitney and
our client kind of form and that became
this like install on body area and then
on the other side became much more of
like the prototyping and making side
where more of the dev and design
collected where they started coding the
different sensors and sending 3d prints
to the MakerBot
and then towards the end of the day it
became very much more about the install
so the team kind of reconvened to
install on her fingertips and some of
the things that couldn't be installed
like say a GPS or the LCD screen it was
really great because we still wanted
Sarah to experience them so one thing we
did was have her like walk around the
block and watch her GPS coordinates get
logged and it nealy made her think of
all these other opportunities for like
running for example and then another one
was a great thing was we're coating the
LCD screen and we're like what do you
want it to say and she could just yell
across the room and immediately it was
just like the code would update and then
we could walk it over and make her smile
so this is Sarah's completed set of
nails it's really a collaboration
between everybody at the salon and Sarah
and she really got to have a say in what
she was getting both on the design and
the tech and another huge part for us
about the salon is keeping a note of
everything that she's had so writing
down who did what on her nail what code
was in the nail what STL files we used
for 3d printing so that her first
appointment at the salon and her second
appointment at the salon evolved and
then you introduce this upgrade cycle to
wearables so really our research project
tries to investigate and look at
multiple different themes some of which
were you know looking at a new culture
and new aesthetics so that combination
of nail art and wearable tech aesthetic
as well as like wearable tech
disruptions so we kind of learned that
it really wasn't about designing just
this one perfect object or device that
it was more about designing this network
of people sensors data and devices as
well as this concept of made-to-order so
we really love this idea that people
could like come in and program or
prescribe their own interactions as well
as a new service model so not only
making this like physical storefront
that you can visit but also looking at
this like new type of distribution
making installing and updating of
Technology thank you thank you
alright once their nails done so like um
if thank you for presenting one of the
best examples that demonstrates the
designers think differently the computer
scientists thank you but that's not
enough but that it's complimentary each
is essential neither sufficient and if
we only have one runner getting half the
insight and I love this because it shows
a different way of learning a different
way of knowing but converging I mean I
mean you nail it thank you very much but
but I follow that with the notion that
is that it shows that if your plane and
you're doing something that's almost
absurd that nobody would fund this in
the right mind except their new date if
they don't write because because in that
playful motivated thing your mind is
free you're not constipated I'm gonna
pick up your butt don't look strained
about you're doing that you're so
serious right you're free and and the
notion that you took this nail thing I
mean the initial thing of going out was
really cool with the webcam but the are
the the GoPro but but the notion of how
you went from the sing and said all of a
sudden we discovered something and you
epitomize in that example that nearly
all great ideas comes the unintended
consequences of doing some of just
pursuing a passion this intentional
thing we're going to do industry
relevant research industry relevant
design never get you where you want to
go you got to a completely different
place and I just want to say thank you
thank you thank you okay
I agree with everything bill said this
is and I appreciate your reflection on
it as a case study as well I think it
should be written up I'm also going to
encourage you and encourage Microsoft to
have you have an ear nail salon next
year at the research and and the real
reason is is exactly what bill said is
it elucidates what do you think of that
it elucidates this idea of design and
technology working together that I love
that you set it up in your house the
next thing I wanted after that was was
the the psychologist because I think you
were getting somewhere really
interesting with nail salons being this
psychological release I I found myself
asking myself if I went into a nail
salon and there was technology what I
just think work right as opposed to what
I do when I think when I go into a nail
salon now and I think total like brain
candy read dumb magazines don't think
and so I think understanding that the
perception of that would be really
interesting absolutely yeah I want to
echo what these guys said I think the
creativity and this was really fantastic
and and it brought out a lot of things
you wouldn't think of otherwise I want
to get you together with with one of my
former students jury in memoria who did
a thesis project around nail salons and
and social media on similar subject but
you brought home something that I want
to highlight and you mentioned it at the
end when you mentioned life cycle there
he talked about how the the typical
cycle of a nail do is three weeks and
then you're throwing in this idea of
nail embedded technology and then you
throw in the end the mention of life
cycle again and all of a sudden you
pointed out that when we start to think
about this kind of ubiquitous throwaway
sensors we're talking about a product
life cycle of three weeks that is
mountains of trash and that's really
good to bring that up because as we look
at other technologies that we're
developing we don't see that absorbed
limit when we look at something like
this we see that limit and we go holy
crap that is a lot of stuff we're
putting into landfills and we start need
to address it so those kinds of
exercises bill point only really come
out in these kind of good design
exercises and I think it's fine
tastic that you did so great work good
thank you thank you so much thank you
dude I think we have professor Ben
hooker here who worked with them as well
as an burdock and then Phil danni allen
also worked there thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
