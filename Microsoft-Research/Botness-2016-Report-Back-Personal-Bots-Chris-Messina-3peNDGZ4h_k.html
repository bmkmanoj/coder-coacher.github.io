will say that it was a bit of a sort of
like Wayback Machine moment for me
because I worked on the social web like
seven or eight years ago and I ended up
sort of going through this eka lilyc
moment of just kind of repeating myself
I don't know why it's sort of like this
tick that I have now and so we talked a
lot about kind of you know one what are
the use cases for personal BOTS one of
the useful when are they valuable what
do you want them to do for you what type
of interaction do you want with your own
personal bot how frequently do you want
to talk to your bot how often do you
want to update your bot do you want to
prove everything that your bot says
about you to the world should we ingest
all of your feeds and just sort of
automatically add all of your posts to
that bot and then have that bot repeat
those things when your friends come and
ask it things etc then there are some
other questions around what can you do
with a bot and how do you personalize
the output or the interaction of that
bot or what I might call your personal
agent for you so we talked a lot about
how one of the things that you know well
I'll put it this way if I think back to
some of the things that we were working
on with a lot of the OpenSocial web
stuff and I don't mean OpenSocial but I
mean social web that was open stuff back
in the day it was like how do you one
advertise the services that you use in
the web in a public machine readable way
to how do you identify reveal
information about yourself we developed
the number of formats for specifying
that information three how do you find
out where your friends are and where
your activities are we had formats and
stuff and specifications for that the
thing that becomes interesting is when
you can start to actually do
personalized output based on the viewer
or access ER of your bot so if for
example I access Esther's bot and I'm
able to prove to her that it's me let's
say because she gave me an OAuth token
because we just exchanged a lot of
tokens back and forth all the time then
the bot can actually personalize the
information or capabilities that she
exposes or shares to me in other words
if I provide the right token with the
right capabilities I could actually
write to her calendar and do certain
things so we sort of talked about a
number of things one what if we had our
own you know bought URL and at the end
of that bought URL I know Amir and I of
again talked about this a million times
we had sort of
text or me text or robots attacks that
described yourself and in that piece of
information you had a bunch of endpoints
now I'm losing myself um I just lost my
train of thought hold on it'll come back
was I talking about you know okay about
Tommy and information and accessing it
oh right so the question is how do you
provide this information in like a
machine-readable way well one of these
you can do is you could one type in the
URL to your personal information and
then the bot that's responding to you
can personalize its output to you right
so here's all the things that I want to
use here's the things that I know or
you're let's say we build this little
like bot tool this personal bought tool
it could generate an image that you
could share with bots and those BOTS
would know how to read and just the
information in that image let's say if
it's a picture of yourself that has a
bunch of QR code ish stuff around it
like the Facebook QR codes then that
information could actually include
information about for example where you
live one of the first questions that a
lot of bots asked me is like where are
you what language do you speak well I'd
like to be able to take like 40 facts
and just give it to these BOTS or I
could give it to a personal bot let's
say Esther's bot and it would suddenly
know oh this is chris oh you can do
these things so the question is how do
you make that information portable how
do you encode that information what do
you do with it and I think that's kind
of like where we spun off into oblivion
so that's that's where</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
