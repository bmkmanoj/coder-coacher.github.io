history of humanity and the earth as we
know it is under a threat that has never
been paralleled never been close we are
looking at ecological challenges that
are real immediate and extraordinarily
complex and we need you we need you to
engage in finding solutions for these
challenges that we actually especially
our children and our grandchildren are
going to face as population climbs
towards seven billion and as we
transform and impact the Earth's
landscapes are seascapes and really
diminish our global biodiversity and
really at stake is nothing less than
humanity every nation in every community
on earth without exception is going to
be affected by the systemic and the
local environmental impacts that
threaten our food supply our water
supply our individual and community
health our economies our cultural
heritage and of course our climates and
what inspires me today is that all of
you here and the group at microsoft and
all you the collaborators that are here
partners you have a track record of
innovation and you have the capability
to find solutions this matches with the
culture at Conservation International it
was encouraging to hear Tom hey speak
earlier today about the commitment of
Microsoft to really enabling scientists
to tackle global problems by going from
data to modeling that's really the
essential commitment and contribution
that you as great intellects and
innovators can make we want to engage
agents of development that's important
agents of development to work with them
to provide the tools necessary that
societies can ensure the health and the
well-being of humanity by protecting the
natural systems that provide everything
that we need
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
