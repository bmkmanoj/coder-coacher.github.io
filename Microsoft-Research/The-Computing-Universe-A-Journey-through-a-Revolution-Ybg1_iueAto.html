hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
thank you so much for coming my name is
Amy Draves that I'm pleased to welcome
Tony hey to the Microsoft Research
visiting speaker series Tony will
discuss his book the computing universe
he was inspired by the fascinating
overview provided by Richard Fineman in
his Fineman lectures and he details the
history of technology and computers from
the early days until now Tony is a
senior debt data science fellow at the
University of Washington's east science
Institute and he formerly was a
corporate VP with us here in Microsoft
research he has authored many research
papers and has edited or co-authored
several books including the quantum
universe and Einsteins mirror please
join me in giving him a very warm
welcome hi well it's it's really great
to be back and feel slightly strange to
be back in building 99 without my badge
but nonetheless it's it's it's it's
great to be back
III will tell you about why I wrote the
book it's meant to be about computer
science because we know I've read lots
and lots of books popular books on
science on physics astronomy genetics
biology all these things but the science
that's changed the world the most in the
last 50 years is endow to the computer
science computer engineering or whatever
you want to call it and there were very
few popular books about computer science
and my in England I have three kids and
they all did an exam at the age of 15
and it was on ICT information
communication technologies and it was
the most boring subject they ever did
and that is really so sad because it's
the world we live in now young people
can make a big difference and change the
world and that's what's evident from the
history of computing so it was because I
wanted to try and see if I could
interest even my kids and find computer
science was relevant and exciting that I
ended up writing this book
and so this is Ginetta who you all know
jeannette wing she had this notion of
computational thinking and I realized
I'm speaking to an audience of experts
this is normally not given to an
audience of expert so I'll skip some of
the details but the idea is that it's
more than just knowing how to use a word
processor or a spreadsheet I'm not
fitting on the slide and it's more than
being able just to write in code to
write in Python or whatever you have to
have something to do and making the
computer do something is an algorithm
and that's really the heart of computer
science for me is algorithms and clever
things ways to do it and this was
Jeanette's vision and it's a vision
that's been taken are very much in the
UK where they're now going to teach
computer science in the same way as they
teach physics chemistry biology and
computer science as a science from all
the way up school and and they're very
much inspired by this vision of
computational thinking computational
thinking came about actually from one of
the heroes of the early days of
computing Alan Turing is a computer
photograph of computer image of him and
Turing machines were deliberately based
on what a person would do how you get a
human computer to do a calculation and
you have a piece of tape you can move
back and forward you can marks on it and
so on and that's what the Turing machine
was and it gives the definition the
formal definition for computability and
it gives you a way of deciding whether
this algorithm is the fastest or the
shortest time or uses more memory or
whatever so you have a way of
classifying algorithms classifying what
things are computable and also what
things are not computable so algorithms
have been known for a long time that
first one is probably Euclid's algorithm
which is to find the greatest common
denominator for example eight over 12
you can divide by four and that's the
greatest common divisor and there's an
algorithm a precise where you give it a
fraction and you can go precisely and
find the crazy
common devisor and that's the essence of
an algorithm over here is a person from
the 19th century Charles Babbage and he
had this idea very much about what we
would call a modern computer they never
actually built it because the
engineering standards at the time he was
trying to do it were not quite available
to do it but you can see for example in
the Computer History Museum a replica of
his Difference Engine which was
completed after after his death it was
completed very recently and this of
course is Ada Lovelace who with Babbage
figured out how to program things but I
like this quote and it sort of typifies
what computer science I was a physicist
if we had an algorithm which did it yes
we'd like it to be as smart but we
didn't worry whether it was the smartest
or the shortest or whatever but what he
says whenever any result is sought by
the aid of the analytical engine that
was his machine the question will arise
by what course of calculation can these
results be arrived at by the machine in
the shortest time so computer scientists
worry about those sort of questions and
they're sort of typifies by just take
one example sorting algorithms so this
is sorting a list of names from Bob Ted
Alice Pat Joe thread May and Eve and you
just go through this list comparing this
one and if this is before this you
switch it and so on and this is like a
bubble rising up it's called bubble sort
for that reason it's a very inefficient
algorithm because when you've done that
you have to go through and do it again
and again and again and this is an
example of a much more efficient
algorithm for sorting the same names you
do divide and conquer and then you merge
them again and so these are the sort of
things that computer scientists care
about they care about new algorithms new
ways of doing it what's the most
efficient and some which requires least
memory and so on so and complexity and
so on comes from the fact that we can
base that on Turing's model of
computation so I started off as a
particle physicist and these are a
friend
this is meant to be a quark inside a
proton there were three quarks as you
can see from the arrow this is an up
quark
that's an up quark and that's a down
quark and that makes up a proton but
they never get out so these are funny
objects that they're inside the proton
and we all believe they exist but you
can't see one by itself it's called the
quark confinement present problem or in
this case gell-mann's quark prison and
that's what I was working on but I ended
up doing this building parallel
computers this is the Cosmic Cube at
Caltech Jeffrey Foxen and Chuck sites
and they built essentially a assembly of
hundreds of microprocessors put together
to make a very powerful computer and
this was the first message-passing
computer previous to that you have big
craze and so on and I was reduced to
doing this because Cray vector
supercomputer in the 1980s cost millions
of dollars and professors as you know
don't have millions of dollars so this
is the sort of thing we ended up
building and of course the difficulty
you it's much cheaper but the difficulty
is is is if you have to plough a field
it's much easier to have the plough led
by an ox than by a hundred rabbits and
so programming the thing so it actually
goes and and all these things do what
you want is the challenge there okay so
how did I switch well I was on
sabbatical at Caltech in 1981 and this
is Gordon Moore and the Gordon Moore
professor of computing at Cal Tech was
Carver Mead he was the guy who figured
out why Moore's laws true Moore's law
was here in 1965 there were 64
components on a chip and he said well in
75 it looks like a straight line I think
there'll be 64,000
by 1975 and roughly speaking with the
aid of large amounts of investment from
the semiconductor industry they've
managed to keep this Moore's law the
fact that the number of transistors on a
chip doubles every 18 months or so keep
it going for 50 years
so I went to a seminar at Caltech given
by Carver Mead and it was like this it
was the weekly seminar for the faculty
and students and we're all waiting a
carven me didn't turn up and someone
went and fetched him from his lab he'd
forgotten about it and he came with his
box of slides and gave a scintillating
talk about Moore's law and I remember in
81 he concluded there were no
engineering obstacles to making
everything smaller faster and cheaper
for the next 20 years and of course he
was wrong because it's gone on big for
over 50 years or together so it became
clear to me that that was really the
future and this just to give you a quick
see this was a key invention this is
Intel's memory chip around a few
thousand transistors on this chip in
1970 the big difficulty of the early
machines was the building enough memory
all right and we all know Bill Bill
Gates his famous quotation 64 K should
be enough for anybody all right it's
because memory was so expensive and so
difficult but this was the beginning of
making memory cheap and then this was
the thing that changed the game Intel
were approached by a Japanese
manufacturer who made a whole thing of
calculators and rather than make they
wanted a range of chips for each
calculator with different capabilities
but Ted Hoff and his colleagues at Intel
said well why don't we make a chip that
we can program and then you can program
it to do this this or this and it's only
one chip and that was the beginning of
the microprocessor and I don't think
Intel fully understood you know the
implications of that because now we find
those in cars in refrigerators in mobile
phones everywhere we find
microprocessors so it was really the
engine of the revolution and this had a
few thousand chips in 1971 this is an
Intel Xeon 2015 has four billion
transistors now that is remarkable that
challenge of computer science is
actually can you get four billion
components working together doing
something useful it is really a
remarkable achievement of computers
managing the complexity to do that and
this is a slide from Gordon's original
paper in 1965 long before there were pcs
here he had notions cosmetics and handy
home computers so it was really an
interesting paper so after that I went
really enthused to solve my quark
confinement problem on a parallel
supercomputer using micro processes what
I didn't know at the time was that my
hero richard fineman he was famous for
the Nobel Prize for Fineman diagrams
he also wrote a very famous series of
lectures on physics the big red books
three volume lecture series on physics
with Caltech and he also was on the
challenge of inquiry and did a famous
demonstration live showing what the
problem was even though the Commission
he was on the trying to whitewash it and
he wouldn't have any of that so he's
that he's a very good hero to have and
he was my hero
and what is not so well known that he
spent the last five years of his life
lecturing on computing and because his
son went to Caltech
phiman as you know when he gave a
lecture he was really entertaining and
sparkling and he used to take great
pleasure in annoying philosophers right
so he say you know philosopher says is
essential for physics that the same
conditions produce the same results well
I've got news to him they don't and you
know all the philosophers used to walk
out of his lecture and he used to be
enjoyed but then his son went and did
philosophy at MIT which upset him but
then he changed the computing and work
for Thinking Machines and Fineman was a
consultant for Thinking Machines anyway
so this is his fireman's view of
computer science that limitations due to
maths limitations due to noise to
thermodynamics do engineering and also
the limitations due to quantum mechanics
and in this he sort of proposed a
quantum computer which as we know is
being pursued by a number of
three-letter agencies based around DC
but also by companies such as Microsoft
and these lectures I wrote up at his
request
and they're really aimed at Caltech grad
student but they were really very
insightful and Fineman also I discovered
gave a course I gave a lecture at the
Esalen Institute on Big Sur now that's a
very sort of an alternative therapy X
thing and you can just imagine the sort
of audience who was listening to Fineman
telling him how computers work and so if
you look at the video that was one of
the things that inspired me to try and
make a popular version of this and
that's what what this is an attempt to
do it's meant to be a popular book about
computer science it's meant to interest
young people if they still read books
that is done so it's got pictures and
anecdotes and stories and also shows how
young people changed the world so let me
now just take you a quick run through
and show you where we've got to and what
sort of applications we're going to be
doing in the future so what I like is
Butler Lampson who is a Microsoft
technical fellow he likes to classify
the ages of computing in terms of the
types of applications so for the first
30 years we were using them for
computing basically we were doing it the
design aircraft to do galaxy formation
to do weather forecasting and things
like that by and large in computation
spreadsheets as well and then we got to
connect them up together and we've been
learning how to do them with the
internet and we now have all sorts of
applications the search engines we have
web pages and so on and social computing
is the latest development in that but
since 2010 they've been engaging with
people in in intelligent ways and that's
what adding AI to all this computing and
communication so let me give you two
examples of what what what's meant by
embodiment which is what he calls the
third age I think I prefer intelligent
but but he this is what Butler says so
to give two examples I was shopping in
England with my son Jonathan and we got
back from the supermarket and I there
was only a tight
King spaced and he was in his Volkswagen
Touran and he said uh what's this dad
and he pressed a button and the wheel
turned by itself and it did a perfect
parallel park now that is something we
would all like parallel parking is
particularly challenging at times and
that's something we would welcome but as
you'll see from this this talk that
along with the good things sometimes
come some bad things so I was visiting a
friend of mine Horst
in Lawrence Berkeley Lab up on the hill
in Berkeley and he was telling me the
story he had to go to Livermore
Laboratory to see one of his bosses and
he took a lab car to go there when he
got to Berkeley his boss said I'm
terribly sorry host but I'm gonna have
to report you for speeding the car had
reported him for speeding he didn't know
that so that's a little slightly scary
but that's the sort of upside and
downside of these applications that have
intelligence so let's quickly go through
the first stage and it started really
with these guys John Mauchly impressed
by Eckert at the Moore School of
Engineering in Philadelphia and they
built this machine it was eight feet
tall it was 80 feet long weighed 30 tons
and had 17,000 vacuum tubes and of
course all the early computer pioneers
thought the major challenge was keeping
this this huge amount of hardware
running it's a complicated thing but
actually all the work were done by these
people and these were the women
programmers of the ENIAC and you had to
program it by connecting up the various
components for the particular problem
and as we all know the challenge in
computers is really as much in the
software as in the hardware and so these
people now finally have got some
recognition for their work but I would
like to give because I'm English
a little English diversion here as I
said the early computers the difficult
thing was getting memory to store enough
data and results and so on and because
of that Morris Wilkes was a professor at
Cambridge in England and he built what
he called the EDSAC it was in homage to
design document called the edvac which
was put out by Eckert mortally and not
von Neumann and it was the first fully
operational stored program computer
where you could store the program and
the data for the program the
calculations in the memory and the
reason he could do it was because of
this these were his mercury delay lines
the signal can go up and down here and
so you can delay the signal and the
reason he was able to build it before
von Neumann before mostly and Eckhart
Merkley and Eckert were in a patent
dispute with the University typical
problems in the universities and the
norman was using a different technology
but he had an astrophysicist called
Tommy Gould
he's the guy who figured out what pulses
are rotating neutron stars so he's
famous in his own right but during the
war he'd been working on radar where you
do a sweep with radar and then you do
another sweep and you have to compare
the two to see if anything's moved so
you have to delay things and he built
delay lines mercury delay lines and that
was the reason why these guys were first
to offer a computing service for a
university and that's what they really
built and this guy is the first computer
science PhD I guess 1951 what did he do
well since Maurice Wilkes I can remember
the exact instant when I realized that a
large part of my life from then on was
going to be finding mistakes in my own
programs and we all know that but the
idea was what they what they invented
was if I figured out how to multiply two
matrices and got some complicated
machine code to do it which works it
makes no sense for everybody else to do
it so you'd like somebody else to be
able to use my code so they invented the
idea of software libraries and then you
had to go through the program going
through the program instructions and you
had to go from this point over here
where the program for matrix
multiplication is stored do the
multiplication and then jump back and
that's called the wheeler jump and he
invented how you do that and David
wheeler and and Wilkes wrote probably
the first book on on computer
programming okay enough and then the 50s
60s we had IBM where you took your cards
and handed them to an operator who was
the high priest and you weren't allowed
to touch the computer the programs look
like that mine wasn't quite as big as
that but it was not good to drop your
card deck on the floor and have to re
order them but really the the exciting
times came in the in in the seventies I
would like to say about the miracle at
Xerox PARC Xerox had this Palo Alto
Research Center and they built what was
called the alto was the first
recognizable personal computer in that
it had a wuzzy wig word processor a
Charles Simoni was one of the people
there of course who came to Microsoft it
also had Ethernet you could connected up
and they invented the laser printer so
you could actually go from here printer
document on the laser printer and it
also had a Windows Windows interface
with the mouse icons pulldown menus and
all that sort of stuff and this is Chuck
Thacker and Butler Lampson and they were
that they're both now a technical
fellows at Microsoft Research and they
were the architects hardware and
software for the machine there's a nice
story about Louis lampstand butler's
wife she was the first person to have
her thesis remember these two type
thesis typewriters and these two have
carbon copies and you took them to the
University and handed them in and so she
did that took two copies and she handed
them into the clock and the clock said
bomb which is the original to give to
the library and she said oh it's done by
a laser printer they're identical and so
no no no no no no and so they had a long
argument and in the end she said that
one okay so and then we have this of
course is the famous picture of Bill and
Paul at Lakewood and that's the famous
picture of Microsoft when it was in
Albuquerque I think there were two
people missing at the time and this was
the the the alto built on the Intel's
new 8800 chip and you had to program it
with the switches so having a basic
compiler was a hell of a lot easier and
that's how it all started
but in the middle 70s it was the
hobbyist who made the progress it wasn't
the professional companies
computer companies nor was the academic
computer scientists it was a bunch of
hobbyists this is the homebrew Computer
Club now at the time I was a physicist
this is at Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center and to my chagrin I was actually
at Stanford Linear Accelerator in 1975
it was a very exciting time we just
found a new quark the charm quark but I
didn't know any of this interesting okay
so and then of course Steve Wozniak
produced the Apple one Steve Jobs
realized that people wanted it packaged
and so that was the Apple 2 and then the
Mac and so on and the rest is history as
they say the only application that they
didn't have at Xerox PARC was of course
the spreadsheet and this is Dan Bricklin
he was sitting board in a lecture in the
Harvard Business School and had to do
all these exercise we changed parameters
and realized it was a hell of a lot
easier if you could do it on the
computer and so that was the thing well
I should say about the Xerox PARC effort
it never became popular machine but that
was partly at the time it was done in
the early 70s when memory was very
expensive it used a huge amount of
memory but Chuck and Butler both
understood Moore's law and they
understood it was very expensive then
but it would be very cheap later on as
indeed it was and then this is the the
thing that sort of established Microsoft
and established pcs in the business
world
control-alt-delete was invented by an
engineer at IBM called david bradley
there wasn't quite enough room to put a
reset button on the board in a
convenient way so he chose these
combination of keys be difficult and
there's a nice conversation of him and
Bill Gates and Bill is complaining about
control-alt-delete being such a pain and
and Bradley said well luckily you were
the person who made everybody use it
and the course this is a this is another
of the the killer apps if you like for
the consumer market computer games
this was pac-man it was the first game
that actually appealed to both sexes
okay Second Age of computing this is my
hero in computing JCR Licklider
professor of psychology at MIT and he
had this vision a concept of the
intergalactic Network which he believed
everybody could use computers anywhere
get data from anywhere in the world this
is Larry Roberts the guy who built the
ARPANET he went to the ARPA and got this
vision his successor got the money and
then Larry Roberts built it and this is
a thing from their paper these nodes
connected by these message processors
and the idea was that everybody had
these very expensive computers and what
you could do was connect them and then
you know someone at UCLA could use the
computer at Utah now this was the first
our Pinet node it's all on the west
coast that was because all the guys at
MIT Harvard and places we don't want to
share our computers with anybody so they
were not very keen on this and they'd
invented most of the stuff and that's
why that these were the the first in
1969 this was the ARPANET work and of
course very quickly it became much
bigger 73
I remember logging on from UCL in London
to Cal - Cal Tech to use a computer at
Cal Tech in the 80s and this is the
killer app for that Bob Mae Tomlinson
that BBN had the idea of using at there
was email on on on a computer locally
and he just put this so you could
actually do it across the internet well
was the ARPANET at the time this is
representation of the Internet tcp/ip
and all that and of course now we have
billions of computers connected to the
internet and roughly three more than
three billion people in the world can
actually log on to the internet 1/3 of
the population but it was this guy who
made it usable I gave him his first
honorary degree when I was head of
department in Southampton Tim
berners-lee and as an amusing story I
was watching the Olympics on on NBC when
they were in London and they had a whole
elaborate opening show and at one point
they honed down the open doors and there
was this guy hacking at the computer and
the NBC commentators in America had not
been briefed they didn't know who Tim
berners-lee was they do now but it was
interesting they had no idea who he was
and what he'd done anyway so he was
saying welcome to the world and this is
the first photo from of friends of his
who had a amateur singing group at CERN
and of course then these guys came along
1978 I was using a browser called Alta
Vista and it was good mama but these
guys being young Sergey Brin and Larry
Page had the idea Stanford grad students
they could do better they wanted to look
at the communication stuff so their
algorithm that they developed was very
much like citations of academic papers
in the search and so instead of counting
how many times the words mentioned on
the page to be most relevant they wanted
to see how many links pointed to it and
of course the more links pointer may be
more relevant but if you come from sites
where nobody cares become some
University professor of a Nobel Prize
winner or industrialist like Bill Gates
or whatever then that site is more
important than they gave it more weight
and that was the PageRank algorithm and
they said that the network to do the
search on Stanford campus and then they
tried to sell the algorithm they went to
Alta Vista which was owned by digital at
the time and they said no and he went to
Yahoo and they said no but one of the
founders of Yahoo David fellow who was
actually also a Celtic a Stanford grad
student said you know why don't you try
and set up your own company ok they did
and this is a shot from the Microsoft
Digital Crimes Unit just random shot
just to show this bad sides as well
you'll see that most of Spain seems to
be a botnet
so does Mexico Brazil and USA don't do
too well
Canada does quite well but that nobody
lives there of course so so anyway all
right enough computers for embodiment so
let me show you yeah here I want to go
here what if your car could actually see
what's ahead and respond right in the
moment a radar sensor and advanced
cameras including a new stereoscopic
camera in the windshield allow
intelligent drive to recognize objects
360 degrees around the vehicle radar
sensors give it foresight long short and
multi range radar scan the environment
in front of the car behind it and out
from the rear corners the intelligence
comes from insight advanced computing
power interprets what it sees determines
the best response and springs into
action faster than humanly possible the
systems of intelligent Drive can
recognize a pedestrian entering your
path vehicles ahead slowing to a stop
and even cross traffic at a nearby
intersection the moment it does it lets
you know as soon as you break even if
it's too lightly intelligent Drive can
increase it to the precise amount needed
even applying full braking power and if
you don't respond it can initiate
braking on its own all to help reduce
the chances or severity of an accident
okay so that's Mercedes there's advert
for Mercedes and you've seen things like
that so I used to work with people like
Mercedes and BMW in Europe on industrial
projects in the 90s and therefore I've
been slightly puzzled by you know the
Google driving cars because they've had
this technology for many years in these
companies but the difficulty is
legislating and making sure it's you can
drive it safely who what if it has an
accident who's responsible and so on is
the programmer is
or whatever so like deploying it is
interesting and it'll be interesting see
see where that goes that clearly can do
some things really well like self
parking and stuff like that okay
so how does that work well how does it
recognize a person from a car from a
building well those are the sort of
things that I learnt about in my time
and Microsoft research people like David
Heckman and Carl Kady who taught me a
little bit about machine learning this
is also I do have a paper on neural
networks this is an artificial neural
network we have about a hundred billion
neurons or so in the brain with
trillions of synapse connections between
them obviously this is a very simplified
version here we have three hidden layers
output layer input layer but we have
lots of connections between them and you
can adjust the strengths so for example
you can train this to recognize a number
plate so you can change to recognize e
or eight and you can adjust the
strengths until the output identifies
that it's an eight or an E and so on and
then you can have a camera that
automatically reports you for speeding
by recognizing things number plate on
your car so computer vision is one of
the areas speech processing is another
and these are this is one of the
earliest types of machine learning
algorithms from very early on with von
Neumann and McCulloch and people like
that but there's been great excitement
recently with these deep neural networks
with multiple layers there where you
could train it in to recognize different
features and there's been great progress
and it's ironic really that a small
child can recognize it's a cat not a dog
in a photograph and that's quite a hard
thing for the computer to do but we are
making dramatic progress in these things
with these deep neural networks and so
that's the sort of algorithm another
algorithm is the one that we all know
that connect this is the 3d camera
showing you three dimension this is
further away than this and then you
train it on lots of images these are
synthetically generated images of people
fat short a young child old Sheldon you
want to recognize it it's my hand
not the hand
the person next to me or my arm may be
obscured by me standing next to the
person and of course you have to have
good sound engineering and that's again
using a different machine learning
algorithm decision trees decision
forests was how that was done by the
Cambridge group and help from other
Microsoft research labs with the Xbox
team and of course now you put those two
together the computing and the
communication and you have the cloud and
that turns this sort of device into
something really powerful so
unfortunately this audience I can't make
my normal joke you see this is Cortana
and and Master Chief here and so when I
speak into my phone I say well the
audience will talk to Siri because most
of them do but on this audience you'll
talk to Cortana as well and I say
Cortana
opened the pod bay doors and the signal
goes up to the cloud where the
processing is done they understand what
said they do the speech posting they
generate the answer and the speech comes
back to me in less than a second and
says I'm sorry Tony I can't do that so
it changes these devices and it changes
the world and that's really an exciting
set of new possibilities for
applications and so I just list to here
this is a device you may recognize which
can actually you know that measure all
sorts of things about you you can you
know alert you to the fact that you have
an appointment it can know your diary
can know you have to go buy flowers for
your wife or your husband or whatever
and it can also send text to your doctor
that he's having a heart attack and
things like that so lots of potential
for these sort of devices in medical
areas and this is the the you know I can
speak in in my Skype in English and it
comes out in Chinese to my colleague in
China and vice versa
so these are the sort of applications
you'll see and then you know I've talked
mainly about transportation but
healthcare is a big one and and there'll
be lots of applications in these other
areas and that's really clearly where
the battlefield is coming and smart
applications in all of these areas
we'll come but I would like to say you
know you've seen the good things but
there's also bad things so idlers asker
showed me this which you might find
interesting this is a regular new car
the masking tape is only there because
we agreed to obscure its make and model
well give them the illusion they control
the car for now coffin has been working
on this for five years with multiple
research team so I hid the fluids oh my
gosh there we go there we go what's that
what's that what's that yeah the
windshield wiper fluid no wait so this
is something that a hacker hid
that's right hackers obviously you
didn't turn on using a laptop the hacker
dialed the car's emergency communication
system and transmitted a series of tones
that flooded it with data as the car's
computer tried sorting it out the hacker
inserted an attack that reprogrammed the
software gaining total remote control oh
my god
they could control the gas the
acceleration they could control the
braking that's right and they could do
this from anywhere in the world so just
try to stop at the cons here she thinks
she's gonna be able to stop right at
those cones let's make sure that she
can't she's gonna drive right through
him
while complete control about breakers
all right there we go oh no no no no no
wait I cannot oh my god I can't operate
the brakes at all oh my word
that is frightening that is frightening
that is frightening you all know that
Dick Cheney had the wireless in his
pacemaker turned off so because there
was a plot in one of the movies then
they killed somebody by attacking the
pacemaker he felt he was under threat
okay so just to conclude with some light
relief those are the sort of
applications the intelligent
applications that the the computer
scientists of tomorrow Microsoft Google
at Facebook and so on will all be doing
and it really is an exciting time you
can have people starting companies and
doing all sorts of things and the cloud
makes that easier so that's what's
really interesting so I'd like to end on
a sort of academic note since I'm back
in academia I'd like to talk a little
bit about real intelligence and
artificial intelligence weak or strong
AI this is from Russell and Norvig
recent book the assertion that machines
could act as if they were intelligent is
called wit you're simulating
intelligence as opposed to the really
thinking and of course all the movies we
see are the ones we're really thinking
and that's called the strong AI
hypothesis and so that you've all seen
the imitation game I hope and if you
want to find out the correct history
read my book right because it's slightly
pervert it's great great movie but but
the history is not quite right but
anyway he had the idea that the Turing
test you had connections to computers or
people in two rooms
could you tell between a person or a
computer and that was the idea that the
Turing test way back in the early days
of computing he thought of computers and
artificial intelligence this is 1997
Gary Kasparov over here playing deep
blue here and of course it's well known
that Kasparov lost now we would have
said that to play chess requires
intelligence but of course deep blue had
large amounts of parallel processing
power and has special chess chips it was
primed with all the openings and all the
finishes and actually it just beat
Kasparov because it had so much
computing power it could go deeper and
see all the possibilities
Kasparov could go fairly deep and he
could also
see patterns and intuition the computer
had none of that it just did by brute
force it was able to beat Kasparov so
that's weak AI and then more
impressively in 2011 IBM Watson built
the to beat the two best players at this
rather obscure game called jeopardy
Judas likes it yes it is so it's a
curious game so you have to teach the
computer lots and lots of information
has to know about Belgium dinosaurs
notable women you know a huge amount of
all sorts of stuff and and also it asked
the question in a funny way it gives you
the answer so it could say Brussels and
then the what you'd have to say is
what's the capital of Belgium all right
and that's the way it does these things
and so you have to it has to understand
all that and it actually beat these two
champions at jeopardy but David Ferrucci
who was the IBM Majin here in charge of
the project also had a screen that the
audience could see which had the top 5
guesses that Watson was going to come up
with he only gave the top one in public
but he showed the five and he said you
could look inside Watson's brain and if
you did that you would find on some
things that Watson had absolutely no
idea what the question was about it was
completely in left-field all right and
it really had no understanding of the
question in a completely misunderstood
so this is a philosopher at Berkeley
called John Searle and he's been one of
the people who's attacked the idea of
strong AI and so this is his Chinese
room you put things in here and you look
in the book and so did you get this you
put that out there and actually what
you're doing is answering questions in
Chinese his argument was that he doesn't
understand Chinese and you know it looks
as if the room understands Chinese but
he doesn't he's just he's just a rope
machine and so what he said about
Jeopardy and Watson was Watson doesn't
even know it was playing jeopardy let
alone that it won so
will we have r2d2 coming in to rescue us
or will it be Arnold with the Skynet or
will you fall in love with your
operating system and of course there's
lots of other examples transcendence X
mash inner I recommend hex mash inner
it's a sort of Turing a test if you
haven't seen it it's a very interesting
thing it's interesting that even Bill
Gates and Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking
and people have said this is really you
know a really serious possibility for
the world and that we're you know could
be the last thing we ever invent because
the machines will take over I think
that's probably overblown but the
question is are we going to go to the
next singularities his reycarts felts
and the singularity is near computers
will become more intelligent and design
better computers without us or this is
fineman's example what he told people at
esslyn his example was of a computer
it's a really dumb file clock what does
a fire clock do he goes to the filing
cabinet takes out a card takes it over
here does what it says adds the total to
this puts the car back takes an X ran
out and does it and that's that's
actually the von Neumann principle for
doing a computer and in order to tell
him to do that you have to instruct him
in excruciating detail how to do
multiplications or ads and things like
that but the reason why it appears smart
is because it goes so fast the inside of
a computer is as dumb as hell but it
goes like mad is what Finance says and
so in this position you know it's just a
very smart dumb machine or are we going
to get a singularity well I think we'll
be down here for a long time in my view
but you never know and just up the road
at the Allen Brain Institute human
consciousness is just about the last
surviving mystery what makes we have
four billion transistors on an Intel
Xeon they only have a hundred billion or
so neurons what why do why are we self
aware and conscious and so on thinking
what makes these simple little neurons
actually give us awareness the
it's a really exciting problem but it
could be a very long way off before we
discover how to do it
thank you very much for listening
so I finished more or less on time Amy
people are free Tony but I'm happy to
answer questions until I get stopped by
Amy yes you suggest reading your book to
figure out the imitation game meaning no
disrespect why shouldn't he read Alan
Turing's paper I was just I didn't say
to figure out the imitation yet to get
the history correct Alan Turing's paper
tells you about the imitation game
doesn't tell you about history Russian
spies and all this sort of stuff
oh who actually built the bomb and the
fact that the first prototype was done
by poles with assistance from the French
that's the sort of thing you'll get from
the book Alan Turing is Alan Turing yes
mentioned Fineman I have to ask you so
Fineman after that he was at the
Manhattan Project during the war the
atom bomb and afterwards he went to
Cornell and he it was he was so he
thought be nuclear disaster and it took
a long time for him to get back into
working normally and he had these ways
of visualizing things and he went to a
famous conference at Pocono Inn in New
York with all the greats it had you know
Oppenheimer it had POW Lee it had Teller
all these famous people from from
theoretical physics there and and they
were trying to understand how to do
calculations electromagnetic
electrodynamics right so the things that
explain light and everything else
it's called relativistic quantum
electrodynamics and and trouble is you
had all these things that suddenly did
the calculation you got became Infinite
and people couldn't make sense of it and
so there were two papers there one by
him
and one by Julian Schwinger from Harvard
and Schwinger gave a very elegant
mathematical presentation he was really
powerful at maths and Fineman waved his
hands a bit and he talked about
electrons and positrons and positrons
are antielectrons and he talked about
treating positrons as negative energy
electron
going backwards in time so you can see
why his audience might have a little
problem with things like that and so he
came away enormous ly depressed but a
few weeks later he was at a American
Physical Society conference in New York
and there was a presentation by
Professor slotnick was giving a talk and
it was about the equivalence of two
particular types of couplings of
different particles to prions and he
concluded that they were different and
after his talk the great professor
Oppenheimer stood up and said professor
suddenly thank you for your talk I'm
afraid however I must tell you your
calculations must be wrong because they
violate cases theorem and slotnick said
I'm terribly sorry
let stopping him I've never heard of
cases theorem - and I said don't worry
professor slotnick you can remedy your
ignorance tomorrow by listening to
Professor case present his results so
slotnick an you can imagine crawled off
the stage and and and was not a happy
bunny Fineman couldn't sleep that night
and so he thought he'd do the
calculations that slotnick did using his
methods and so he did them and he found
slotnick the next morning and he said
slut Nicole chap why don't we compare
notes it's not Nick said what you mean
compare notes yeah I did your
calculations overnight what you mean
overnight took me six months so I've got
these methods see anyways why don't we
just look and so they looked and he said
it's not Nick said what's Q squared time
said Oh Q squared it's just the
scattering angle you know he said but
took me six months do Q squared equals
zero time I said no problem just put Q
squared equals zero in my formula and we
can compare so so they did and Fineman
agree b slotnick and then case got up to
give a talk and gave his talk about
cases theorem showed that they were
identical to all orders and after his
talk everybody applauded and the back of
the lecture later yes professor diamond
i calculated
the calculations last night and I agree
with slotnick so your theater must be
wrong and then he sat down that was when
he knew he had something and he was
going to win the Nobel Prize
lots of funny stories about firemen I
knew him when he was on he was he was
happily married his third wife an
English librarian like mine and he was
had won his Nobel Prize so he was very
relaxed he used to have lunch with the
postdocs and grad students most days so
it was kind of fun so do I think the
connectome project
okay so funnily enough when I was at
Microsoft Research I funded the
connectome project at Harvard for four
years and I didn't think I got anything
out of it we could automate what it is
it's cutting through slices of a rat's
brain to try and find the connections
between the neurons and the synapses and
it sounds great
you're finding the wiring diagram of the
brain right so everybody wants to know
that I came to the conclusion so what we
were providing was technology that could
help you automate that process in
looking at this slice and finding the
connections and stuff and that was a
valid thing for us to collaborate with
them for and that was ok but I found it
was rather like as illuminating as
imagine a tangle of spaghetti cutting
through a bowl of spaghetti you really
don't find very much and actually you
need to know it's it's a dead brain by
that point it's a narrow slice of the
brain you need to know what signals
what's happening what these neurons do
so I think by itself it doesn't maybe
with MRI and and you know it may be that
poor land Brain Institute there will be
progress but I think it's a long way to
go but I did fund connect him Judith
- whoo yes youth youth young people yes
so I'm sure you've been speaking around
the world on your book and so on and
maybe you've spoken to young people what
do you think they're going to do with
computing now that we're into this third
generation and that may be the syllabus
has changed in the UK and so on well
first of all IIIi think there is really
opportunity for them to go do things but
only if they're sufficiently educated
and they understand that these are the
skills they need to learn that's one
thing and not everybody can do that my
real worry I'm reading a book by Martin
Ford it's called the rise of the robots
technology and the threat of a jobless
future because these things are really
smart right you're making really great
stuff and they will take out lots and
lots of jobs that we currently think as
needing intelligence and it's not
obvious every previous thing you know
the Agricultural Revolution everybody
moved from the fields but then the B had
factories in the cities and so on we
replaced them it's not obvious this time
is what the book says that we're going
to replace those jobs so I think it's
it's protection to some extent but I
think their opportunity especially in
the internet of things of doing
interesting things and there doesn't
cost a lot and I try to show young
people Tim berners-lee and Sergey and
Larry for example all very young and
they and they did these things and made
a difference in the world and I think
that's one of the things they can do but
I think it's it's to some extent
self-protection and working in IT and
computing technologies is a very wise
thing to do in my view the book also has
terrible examples
Martin Ford's book of sushi house with
no people there because they have a
machine to make sushi and they have a
way your color of your plates that it's
automatically put them in the bin and
they can send you a bill and and and it
goes to your table there isn't even a
manager on on-site and then apparently
there's a new machine coming out which
can make gourmet hamburgers so you don't
need
to make that anyway so there's all sorts
of Technology that are threatening jobs
and I think you know that's the message
I would get across so it may be
different this time because of you guys
what Moore's law was an observation made
1965 from that four points yes
and of course it's actually being kept
true by the semiconductor industry I
think Gordon Moore once said it's
becoming exponentially expensive to keep
Moore's law true and so and they've done
really hugely innovation they have this
semiconductor roadmap which maps out the
technologies but actually I do think
we're getting to the end of Moore's law
because I'm a physicist originally and
now we're getting down to atomic
dimensions and at the atomic dimension
things don't behave like the sort of
billiard balls that we like to visualize
and therefore I think Moore's Law is
coming too and there's already a
slowdown and actually what replaces it
is extremely interesting is is the
industry going to be like Airlines you
know we crossed the Atlantic or at least
I do at about 600 miles an hour it
doesn't go faster it hasn't gone faster
for the last thirty years maybe we will
reach an asymptote and then maybe you
don't have to throw away your phone
every two years you know it changes all
sorts of things so I think there could
be some profound changes coming from the
end of Moore's law but there will be new
things to replace it and that's my stuff
here on FPGAs for example is an
interesting thing and we have GPUs maybe
we will have sort of graphical
programming units neural programming
units that's what IBM are talking about
in Watson and so like that so maybe
different types of specialities and I
think there's plenty of room for
innovation but Moore's law as it stands
will come to an end but
it's been a huge effort by the
semiconductor industry to make it so and
it's it's it's truly driven everything
yes
mentioned the cloud I did mention the
cloud I had a picture of the cloud and
don't forget I talked to the cloud
utility like running water or
electricity or or any other sort of
basic service you wouldn't think so if
you went to green water Washington on
the way to Rainier you can't even get a
cell phone signal the cloud I think is
important I mean I one of the projects
we did in Microsoft Research was a
called Greek fire there were these fires
on the Greek island on Greek mainland
which which nearly reached Athens which
you know the 3,000 buildings down and
killed 300 people something like that
and so if it happened on an island it
could sort of wipe out the whole island
so what they did with the Greek
Microsoft employees plus some people of
Microsoft research with the Greek
universities they developed an early
warning system which took data from
satellite data took real weather
forecasting data
it had topography of the island it had
population the roads it had a new
weather far trucks were and things like
that and if a fire started here this was
the most likely place where would it
spread because the wind direction he
could do all those things now there's no
computing for supercomputer on an island
so that really did depend on having the
cloud to do your computing and those are
the sort of applications that are made
possible by the cloud so I I think the
clouds great and I used to do startups
with my staff in university and you know
instead of them having to get large
amounts of some angel funding to buy
equipment you can just start immediately
and it just makes a big difference so I
think the cloud is really important for
all sorts of innovation and I didn't
talk about
the other killer application which is
social networking which also things like
Facebook and Twitter and Flickr or all
these things use cloud right so those
are clearly going to be important so I'm
sorry if I didn't mention it
sufficiently I think it's important
though everybody now has clouds thank
you very much Amy thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
