hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
so yeah so they can everyone this is the
last session of the workshop and i would
like to start by saying a big thank you
to do it organized cigar shop and it's
not quite over yet but really enjoyed
the community here everyone just walking
on a related subject and i think that's
really great to bring together this set
of researchers to to see how we can
improve education and learning how to
program mmm Thank You Me class would
never have got here without your
inspirations of course it's leave out
there so I first speaker guys Alex okay
so uh yeah thanks also me if I to Judy
for inviting me for organizing this it
was very interesting so what I did was
to ask basically people around the room
I was trying to kind of summarize what
were the major themes and issues and so
on so several people responded so thank
to all the people responded and what I'm
going to try is just kind of summarized
what the what the what the information
was the information I got and use that
you know classified along four different
three different things so one is the
themes that emerged from the workshop
the other one is open issues and open
issues is the one with the biggest you
know with a number of entries and then
opportunities so in terms of teams
actually the main one it seems to be
really the overarching theme from a most
of the talks and most of the discussion
is a feedback so it's all about
basically the kind of feedback that you
want to give to the to the students who
ever is using a using the system and for
example one one particular and your
theme or sub him in this context was a
closeness so this idea how do you tell
the students or whoever's playing the
game that they're close to the solution
how do we indicate how close they are
how do you direct them towards the right
solution and you know some people talked
about providing you know the exact Delta
with respect to the solution or possibly
an abstracted version of death so ratio
was ten you're talking about that we
don't have to talk about you know this
idea of the doing it based on the number
of in on
counted the number of inputs for the
Reno right and wrong solution so there
was many many ways of doing that they
were discussed and I think that you know
that's a really interesting team in
terms of open issues and this is
probably of interest for and especially
for you guys or actually the developers
the minds behind that code hand so one
is like you know these kind of
overarching questions like the elephant
in the room which is is the approach
predicate pedagogically good so how do
we know that people actually teach
people actually learn by doing cold hand
more than by traditional means and I
know we discussed a possible study which
would be very interesting so trying to
see okay if you have the kind of a
student population you cannot split it
and half of them are learning through
code hunt or similar means and half of
them are learning through traditional
methods how will they you know will be
the difference in the in the learning
and so what that's an interesting point
in fact you know as I teach online
classes and others all this discussion
all how do we know that the online
classes are working as a well and you
think about what how do you know about
the traditional classes but the duration
of classes everybody's assuming that
they work right so it's a very valid
point and in fact I think it would be
good to just test all these methods and
see what works and what doesn't work you
know including also the traditional ones
but it's very very very valid point so
but nevertheless I think you know a
study of that kind would be very
interesting and you know especially if
the results are good that will give a
lot of you know fuel for this kind of
approaches another open issue that was
mentioned by several people was how to
make a puzzle riding easier and I think
you probably did the restaurant is with
you as well and in particular how do you
make it easy to provide good guidance to
the two that players which also goes
back to the idea of feedback so how do
you give them you know kind of something
it is useful so that they learn you know
how to get to work towards the same that
the right solutions or do you mean test
cases well it's you know however you do
it right whether you do it with the
product right in the right test cases or
by providing hints what's the best way
to tell the students okay you're kind of
get in there it also goes easily goes
with it back you getting closer but you
might want to look at this or you know
or you use the right inputs of the day
they can
they might be easier to find the
patterns and so on so that's a that
that's definitely an issue on deciding
and now you know you guys showed us how
to do it by basically tricking the
system by for example you know put in
their specific conditions if you want
something to be considered it might be
it would be nice if they were kind of a
more abstract and general way of doing
that and also maybe a more understood
way because sometimes you know i think
when i when william and i were trying to
kind of make their you know kind of
improve the puzzles it's hard to figure
out you know what will help them well
not so you do it you think you did a
great job then you try to like oh now
that's not really good so it's I think
that that's an open issue that would be
no worth investigating the other the
other things that I heard from a couple
of people is that this fact that the
knowledge of symbolic execution seems to
be a little too necessary for whoever is
developing the the problems so basically
you have to know what's underneath was
the machinery underneath in order to do
the right thing and it will be nice if
that could be kind of again abstracted
away a little bit so that you don't have
to understand symbolic execution for so
it's which is not a plan for many of the
people in this room but might be a
problem if you want to kind of
generalize the the approach so sometimes
the results might be surprising because
you don't know that how the symbolic
executor what it's like for example the
fact that you have the different tests
every time so how come you have
different test is kind of all because it
depends really on how the paths are
explored there are some number two minis
and so that's a kind of trying to
decouple the underlying technology from
the puzzle creation and I mean of course
you know anybody should feel free to one
and try to summarize what I what I heard
them well my impressions as well so feel
free to add and jump in another issue is
like it all deployed the problem
creation so how to choose interesting
problems and you know and what feedback
season again to use an ax and this is
really you do what is good and what is
what is now good again there's that you
know tons of vino studies on on water
you know pedagogically good you know
examples to use but it is it's not
really clear what will work and what
would not in terms of teaching the
students and one other point that was
made here is that there seem to be good
problems for different purposes so some
problems that are good for a given
purpose might not be good for
a different one like for example there
might be something that is great for
teaching a specific topic to the
students but if instead what you want to
do is to engage new students into and
get them interested to throw the
development maybe you have to do
something completely different where
they don't learn anything but have a lot
of fun and it's not clear that these two
things necessarily go together so it
would be good to have some sort of
classification of what problems are good
for learning what problems are good for
engaging and maybe you know other
categories as well for us now you know
everything is kind of sim seen as seems
to be seen and not together as a kind of
as a whole let's see primitives oh yeah
that's something that really I know it
was really interesting for me as well
the primitives for the developer for the
designer so for example you know that
you can provide in this higher-level
language in which you can can add some
of the the information to the to the
example to the promise for example
filters it's like you know now we have
to do it you know this assumes to avoid
the null inputs it will be very nice if
you could just say I want to see any
known input and at that point you just
you know remove the generation of those
I don't want to see any overflow so you
don't have to worry about you know what
you know how that kind of happens when
in the generation have to use the the
assume you just specify that at a higher
level something else like specific
impulse you might wanna see might say oh
I really want to see not 25 as an input
here because I think it reveals some
interesting aspect of the problem and
again you can do it by adding a branch
modèle requires that you understand how
the system works so we'll be nice if you
could specify that or a set of inputs
something that was brought up by winning
which i think is rather very relevant
the non determinism so it will be nice
to be able to reason so to mix and non
deterministic choices in the Indus packs
and forcing variety something that
actually I found very difficulties in
many cases when you develop the problems
you end up getting the same values for
the inputs and that is not very
interesting doesn't mean to provide much
information to the to the students so we
ended up kind of put in there a lot of
as you know assumes on differences
between different elements of the array
and it gets very complicated it will be
nice if you could just kind of give some
sort of directive I want to see some
variety in the Indian proceed are
generated so that
you know maybe they explore a wider part
of the domain of the solution they might
reveal more interesting facts to the to
the students and for sobriety or and
also hints maybe a possible way of
saying oh if this happens or if you
follow this specific path I want to I
definitely want to you know mention this
to the students and it's something that
you know the in research work was done
automatically maybe you want to also
provide the developers of the designers
a way of kind of providing specific ins
because they know that they will help
the student another issue that was
brought up and that was discussed quite
extensively is and just tell me if I'm
talking too much ok what is the best
metric to track the prom in difficulty
so how do you decide whether you know
the problem is difficult or not is that
the number of tries is that the time and
you know and I agree with you that time
is not a good metric because you don't
know what you know the students are
really doing I mean unless it's a
controlled environment on the other hand
the number of trials we so we listen to
different people at different strategies
in some cases people just like the
feedback so they're like oh I submit 300
you know slightly different solutions
because that's going to help me getting
you know very quick to very few you know
a very fast way to the solution and so
there should be a way maybe in kind of a
smart way of figuring out what is the
amount of effort put into the solution
it could be something that was mentioned
I think was for example the fact that
small Delta's maybe you shouldn't be
canceled more frequent Delta's shouldn't
be counted big data clearly exploratory
mode and so big maybe there is a way of
you know the kind of quantifying that in
a more in a more rigorous way and some
some issues that were not mentioned by
anybody but we know we listen them
yesterday so i wanted to i extracted a
couple that are not covered by the rest
and one I think was you know received a
lot of kind of interest watch this idea
of preserving tests including the order
and that seems to be really necessary
feature because I mean as you were
mentioned some people write down the
tests that they see and I ended up doing
the same when I was trying to solve the
puzzle so it would be very nice because
II okay freeze this test this one's I
want to see again and it seems like it's
something that should also be relatively
easy and everything is easy to do right
given the given time ahem maybe to just
jump in here but I want
listen to the entire list of it yeah I'm
almost done I think a general one can
distinguish two kinds of feedback there
are those that would I couldn't consider
bit controversial in the sense that sure
you would like to see more values more
diverse rail you in an ordered way
immediately but I think it would totally
or to a large extent destroys the fun of
the game all right because it's about
this discovery was so there are some
things that I think are controversial
and maybe we need to study to see what
the impact is on the educational aspect
versus how quickly people solve it
versus with it's fun and engaging it's a
fascinating and there are some other
aspects which I think everyone agrees
with it's it's it's an interesting
challenge how to come up with good hints
or how to design hazards those are
definitely hard problems and and it's we
don't have any answer mm-hmm so
suggestion in general I think when when
looking at all of these feedback
something to keep in mind there's some
things where it might go either way and
then there are clearly research
deficiencies or are big big
opportunities that we don't know any
answer okay keep going keep going all
right in the in general may I never
again that this is you know it's clear
why is not there but just you know to
mention it again the designers so the
user friendliness of the environment but
as you say it's for internal use so it's
perfectly fine but if you wanna have a
broader adoption of course that you know
that people will want more features like
completion and you know better feedback
when you when you write the code and so
on and so forth so educators will tell
you that they don't want completion oh
really right why wonder students who
actually oh no no I was thinking for
whoever is designing the problem for the
model students for the teacher anytime
you you in fact some I'm so many care
say I love the fact that there's no
completion a lot of these java ide
rather than completion they take away a
lot of the yeah but before weather is
designing the problem it will save you
time if you don't have to remember the
exact syntax of the language but we have
haven't we discussed whether we would be
able to get the moniker a deterrent code
hunter
that would give more it's a possibility
like but what like what PD said it's not
clear that we really want to write mean
again it's like having more values in
and all that way it you want it but it
will how everyone is it's probably more
doable than having a complete you know
ID experience at completion right now
because we have to compile the code in
the browser and things that we don't
have a compiler to see sharp well in
fact they happened in packs for fun we
do have completion fuzzy shop you have
completion we haven't migrated it yeah
for a reason you know you can also think
in terms of you know the pedagogical
aspirin if you're doing very simple
coding assignment and yeah you might
give me you don't want completion if you
get to a point in which that the key
thing is really figuring out the
algorithm then at that point completion
doesn't mean you want a computer because
we don't want them to stumble on that
way all they got hung up on one of the
smallest things out here and in fact one
where I mean out of all of these
challenges whether an idea Eva's code
completion or not aspect of Education I
wonder if somebody already studied it
because you don't need coat on for that
just just split up your classroom into
two and give some some programming
assignment you should we should do our
homework and look that up okay in there
helping or not well did it help you this
what did the students think I know you
had some thoughts about that organ
didn't you at one point auto completion
yeah whether it was a good thing or not
a good thing I think that the purpose of
code hand is not to to know the syntax
or the API of C sharp or Java what are
you using it's a auto completion with
the Polly but you're under time pressure
you have to produce something that's
fantastic Lee correct compiles yeah so
he's saying it would be a good thing to
have it I don't know what I'm thinking
is that it's at the purpose of learning
those things so why not support it in
via in this ID it's tricky yeah coloring
is easy
finding we have done it it's quite
possible we made another interesting
experience when we first rolled out coat
and in a contest that was done in China
so at least until recently there was no
windows azure data center in china
mainland and maybe that has changed by
now the closest one would have been in
Hong Kong but it still has to go through
the grid fiber so so we had feedback
basically that there's a huge latency
for people being in China and and if a
lot of data is being sent around in the
browser it's a bad experience so so
that's another thing to come oh it might
even get unfair depending on whether you
should behind a slow connection or fast
connection so that's another thing to
consider just slowing it in and go
completion would be probably inside
JavaScript right so so when you well gee
that means you have to download the jazz
group when we take that the editor those
too slow we actually use a text area and
we don't use any kind of fancy editor
okay that means all these players would
would be unfairly disadvantaged because
they know they all access to colors yeah
it is easier concern or the alternative
it doesn't just all happen in the bother
but then you have a round trip every
time I mean we would need to see shop
compiler or Java compiler that runs in
New a powder and i'll choose that
evening it goes too far band would not
be so what I'm thinking I just did some
right now and another sharpdevelop from
usually Java or Ruby and always I don't
just upper case for the properties right
we will return you yeah yeah ND but that
was kind of knowing it was good for us
what's been on your and write uppercase
but Java is lowercase right but I you
see foie gras because yeah obviously did
you have more jealous I have a few more
yeah quickly let's see I think that's
yeah that's the only last one I have
four issues and opportunities now which
is yeah it's all about right so what
next in terms of opportunities so I
think several people including myself
and very interesting what we can mine
from the set of solutions submitted
which can be seen you know from many
different perspectives of one think will
be out
people get to the solution where do they
make mistake you know how can you learn
that you know I think take the class
reviews are interesting how can you
learn typical mistakes how can you use
the feedback you then make the
assignments better and to teach better
to the students what if you have like
you know and student that submit
solutions are correct but bad then they
get better how do they do that process
so can you learn how you know how the
improvement maybe you can speed that
part up so there's really partial
solutions versus complete solutions is
really a lot that I think can be mined
and I don't think we have a clear
understanding of all the opportunities
there so the fact that you guys are
making the data available yeah would be
great in including that for program
synthesis for people working in program
synthesis can you use that to then sort
of simulate that the way in which a
human being synthesizes code and maybe
have a better program synthesis approach
that is a more similar to the one day
humans you so that's a my opinions
really that and all kind of the best
opportunity here we we have this
unprecedented set of data and we can use
it to to learn how people learn so
that's pretty good something else I
think was mentioned and I definitely
seems to be interesting is a be testing
so it will be interesting you can do a
lot of AP testing because you can have
the different for example hint systems
different input generation system
techniques and just you know you get if
you get enough players you'll be able to
really explore you know what works what
doesn't work what works for what kind of
population so what I was mentioning is
you can do it even in your own classroom
where you actually add a comment that
gives the specification for exact sizes
and you can look at your dashboard and
see what's happening with you two
classes yeah is the stickiness gone and
things like that invented ma I think
this is something is true in general for
anything that is online and within our
participants you can just try different
things for different puzzles as long as
they're you know you can separate the na
in Canada in a fair way the students
assume it's a class but he's taken for
credit and you can really do that
Bailey's point I said why it's not
entirely trivial to plug in a new hint
system what basically anyone who goes
home after this even
can do is you can upload two different
zones yeah which define maybe
description so in other ways and compare
how students do in a pretty nice
automated fashion yeah am I even just
what we were doing to improve the
different problems where you can say you
can try different strategies and see
that works yeah yeah that's not very
doable and the other thing that's
actually the part is more for me than
for anyone else but I mean I don't teach
introductory classes and so I normally
teach software engineering classes which
means that we're dealing with a more
complex code and I'll be really
interested in see whether you know you
can kind of take this to that level and
having a more complex systems I mean of
course it's not going to be exactly the
same thing is one of the beauties of
cold hand is that is no itself contains
relatively small you see the whole
program but maybe there is a way in
which you're kind of pushing the concept
so that you can have design and
development and you can kind of you know
use the same approach sort of gaming
approach her for for a kind of at a
higher level of abstraction for larger
challenge your your best students with
this I'm sure the students will tell you
so can get really hard yeah it's
difficult Hannah no and I don't think
the range is limited to intro if you
have enough industry structure that's a
couple of rays or instant arrays and you
can start having enough pointers that
gets retreat oh no I understand about
the points like you know if you're
teaching for example a software
engineering class and you have this kind
of issues a lot people will jump you
know will jump on you because they are
not here to learn programming right I
want to learn how to design a system tao
has some interesting ideas on how to
leverage the system to teach design
patterns I mean we start by showing you
yeah you fill in this one function but
really you can write 64k of crotas
classes and so in other words the one
challenge or you can see it look at the
challenge how can we use this framework
to to teach patterns how had some ideas
but I think he just kept the surface and
there's not much more to discover in
patents is only one part of software
engineering
but you're right it is it has this code
yeah it has this cop let's go but it
will be interesting to see maybe if it's
a variation of this can have a kind of a
broader scope and maybe it can be put
together because then you can leverage
some of the the truth the problem with
these kind of assignments is that they
know for example in one of my
assignments in that I just brought a
couple of days ago is you have to
develop a small android app that that's
something right and there's not a
correct solution and there's not you
know easy test that you can run and so
how can you you know use a system like
this on on in that context and no is it
possible i know it's i don't know it's a
like for example i think you know the
cluster you think is something that you
could still do right if you want to do
as i say you get all the solution then
you you cluster them to identify
patterns of development it might be good
or bad and then you classify them you
keep feedback to the students so it's
probably is not going to be the same
thing which you submit your app and it
tells you good bed and then you send me
in another one but maybe you know if you
kind of abstract away a little bit the
feedback on you know other aspects of
the code complexity of the coda cohesion
your android app that's something really
hard kind of in the core of it and ya
know the whole shell about doing android
and you know in getting all the SDKs
inside but at the heart of it there's a
hard I ready to crack then you could
think that your students would just pop
the window and start testing it we could
have them get a better feedback than
just trying to write themselves and
write a test feed themselves mhm and we
found some time you were developing pex
we were just pop the browser and we
needed a little parser we wrote it ya
know it was completely correct and then
incopy backing tutors together yeah that
might be all the way to the recording I
green design 10 so I will toss a line
where the question is is there a correct
solution that you can characterize or is
there some subjective aspect to like an
Android app so how it behaves how it
looks and that's clearly outside of the
scope of what this is all about I mean
suburbia fert from our when we run
contests or from recruiting is that the
appealing as well again from teachers
the appealing aspect is really this
fully automated system
which doesn't require someone to assess
the quality of solutions so so if one
keeps setting minds that should have to
figure out what problems can fit and
which don't so I'm there put certainly
some aspects of design patterns where
the result is the beauty is in the eye
of the beholder but then if it's about
having a visitor for a tree I mean
either your visitor producers writers
I'd it doesn't so if so that's how I
would characterize the problems and then
see where that fits or not I say also
for it for mobile apps for example you
might think about constraint a little
bit and you say ok so these let's say
that you you have to pick your wrap you
know in a suitable way my life for
example there is a display or the app
and you have to have these input fields
and so on so at that point you could
characterize that and that becomes you
know you're in for the system and there
you could really do something along
those lines it has to be a specialized
system but maybe you know if there's
enough interest in a specific domain you
could have a customized version of that
you know code hunt for mobile apps you
know something might be worth
considering that's actually all I had on
my list so I grabbed being here try to
hear a ladder I can immediately Felina
on that opportunities list we didn't
mention it but one of the aspects within
the sandbox that Nicola has already been
talking about or just on the surface or
edges of it has been the idea that we
should be able to have levels the build
on levels so this is a very typical game
experience that if you pass one level
what you built in that level enables you
to unlock and get on to the next level
but also you use that so what that would
mean in the context of code hunters if
you built a procedure in one function in
one level you would be able to call that
function in the next level
actually built something and then you
can move on with that and that's a sense
of achievement that you're not currently
getting its it would be another fun
aspect you know build your axe get your
elixir and then move on and kill the
dragon sort of thing right think about
you could break down even come very
complex systems into the city matter
what do you know Jim Kelly was sayin
until then and then the second level of
that would be that equity are actually
doing is building a class so since we
don't yet of objects maybe the idea
would be that you could structure coat
on so that what happens is that within a
sector you can build a class and then in
the next sector you can instantiate your
class so that's a thought we haven't
thought it through completely and it
would obviously be something that would
require a lot of building but I think it
would fit within the model nicely I do I
think it's a really great idea and I
think that that actually ties back to
some of the questions about difficulty
to because I think there if you want to
structure those levels in a way that
that difficulty progression make sense
so really having a good grasp of what
difficulty is and being able to measure
it for an individual it's really
essential I think I don't that
experience be a good one for learning oh
my yeah i'm really interested yeah I
remember like the last summer we had
some discussion on Oh exactly no we
didn't we did it was on our list and
it's still on the list I just want to
check the progress but I think Pedro
well so this season this kind of brings
us to to implementation of action to
some extent the bare fact is that that
Microsoft will eventually and prop
sooner rather than later stop
development on the project itself and
for many good reasons not not for bad
reasons but simply because it makes
sense actually to involve for other
people's good ideas and get other people
working on it so each of these
suggestions is a packet of work that
somebody could work on should they wish
to that assumes there's a decent
interface that enables them to come in
and we would have to ensure that that
that is available the most decent
interface is that you send an intern and
the intern works on it unfortunately
that's also not possible all the time
because we might not have slots so we
might be busy with other in terms of the
times it's not a silver bullet the
intern option I mean like I have solely
discussion with one team but basically
is I assuming that I mean life example
my group they were certain features like
I mean how to really have it hook it to
be it live at least in a small scale
right so that we had female looked at
data to see how things go I think for an
hour side for example how to get the
crown resources I mean I've seen easy
ways I we host of service on our server
or our crowd whatever be we get but this
is difficult for university to get that
kind of budget to really like have
hosting but maybe send on the faculty
grants myself research has as your
research and could put a black for that
and get okay no pm's and get some yeah
and get me so long as you're too are you
talking about hosting the surface or
hosting the data the services of core we
need to have some way to get the data
right soon
fso service will be used that data would
come in right so naturally the data
would be at least part of the data would
be missing so we saw so I don't know if
it became clear to l1 how the system
works also there's a back end which does
all of the grunt work of doing the pecs
explorations it can scale up to use a
lot of cpu power and this potentially
cost a lot of money to us then there's a
fondant aspects that socialized websites
and guides you through the sectors so
those are basically two different
aspects of the system and some of the
things we talked about I really wanted
related so if you want to do a be
testing where are some users see certain
things that other users don't that's
mainly a fountain tissue or even if you
want to generate certain kinds of hints
then if that's your own hint generation
engines and it's again about showing
something to some users and maybe not to
others if you want to do a/b testing so
what so there's a back-end possibly cost
a lot of money to run and then there's a
front end which is how the lightweight
and so one option we were thinking about
this to make that font and open source
which would allow other people to pick
it up make some changes and then you
could either deploy that locally which
would be you can do it on your laptop
and have your students party on it or if
you did something really great we could
actually deploy that on our servers
since it's open source and we all work
together but so assuming that the basic
idea of the distinction between
front-end and back-end is reasonably
clear how does that sound does anyone
have any thoughts what kind of
experiments would be possible in that
setting or what kind of addition you
would want to add or do people does
anyone feel that what you really want to
do is
something about the back end you
interested in generating different kinds
of values or any of that but I'm sure
some of you have some ideas of the
research question you want to answer or
some some feature you would like to add
that does anyone have an opinion to what
extent an open source font and foot
would help or if that's not really a hip
yeah so how hard would it be with the
infrastructure where you're proposing to
access things like a set of samples of
code attempts rather than the data about
number of tries things like that so you
could actually see well you probably
went here this morning but we are
releasing that yeah okay yeah so that's
that's easy and in the back end yeah the
only thing you're talking about with
access to the back end here is to change
the way that that back-end works rather
than just believes it so yeah no I like
the idea of being able to use that front
end and getting access to the data
exactly that's enough for work so the
plan is to regularly reduce chunks of
data first run will come and within a
couple of days just making sure it's
right and then you know every few months
will bring out another lot different
data yeah I mean one idea would be that
if you upload your new even universe you
have access to the data but just like
you think'll fun right then if you
upload the University owned it yone all
the programs that are entered through a
universe yeah that's already the case
but you not accessible to the teacher
nah ah it's there in the silver right
right what your user okay I think that's
one of the changes we ought to change I
do to enable a dashboard for teachers to
do yeah current solutions but also he's
Tony closer if you want to do studies
then you would be able to query the
cloud and download you're an impatient
another way for a drop yeah you know I
the faster iteration on experiments
ideally like to have something like you
know could hunt as a service right in
which you can have as you know I can
access the different aspects and for
example you know I want to use the back
can but I want to use my own front end
and I can just you know provide you with
the whatever is the proposed solution
and you give me back the results or i
can use the different pieces but i don't
know how much modular you can let's make
that there are exist but how out like
where does it break down so what are the
individual modules that you can use the
big distinction is font end back end
right so the backend managers the data
and performs the test case generation
and it's it's driven by the front end
which that's all zui basically and if
let's say we make the font adopt sauce
and you could go in and change the
weight interact with the back end so
instead of using text to generate test
cases you could call your own test
generation tool to produce it so that's
the rest interface that you were talking
about exactly we had an injured this
summer build touched Eva we built code
hunt in touch debate that's nobody wrote
a plug in touch give up any basically
rebuild a complete front end based on
the touch of language with a cross
compiler to see sharp and then in the
risk and that was done without any need
to modify the back end but nobody
vacation that's good yeah I think that's
the kind of thing that will make it they
know vary with respect to what new crop
opposes you not making the fun and open
source as in tests varying order if you
want to do I some work on the UI right
but for some of the work for example him
generation testator generations
detection right I mean there's some kind
of well-known important features I mean
if you could expose that as a mole I
call back service I mean we just forget
them and then we configure through your
website has particular kind of
configuration parameters if we just use
the one that we hooking in so some
talent and that's exactly what we want
to go open source you would you would
define these looks at you build your
system
and we would take the pull request and
would see where and implement in on the
north side right okay because you can do
the similar I'll stick with the same
interface like the rest interface right
you could just a you submit the request
for me I want to set this parameter of
this way the Sun parameter that way I
think there would be if I understand
what you mean are you saying if you
define the parameter for example how you
do symbolic execution and right yeah so
many of such extensions you can probably
do just by tweaking the phone yet for
the hint generation it turns out that
actually the hint generation was pretty
much a complete standalone project
there's a very few exceptions it needs
access to the secret solution and
attempts from other people which would
actually learn all that time but if you
plug it in somewhere in the middle it
also would like to have access to the
existing database so the tricky part is
to figure out what do you need to do a
particular extension that you might be
interested in then like what PD said
once you identify that we can add the
right hooks to to make that happen so
again if anyone at this point has some
particular research idea said he is very
interested in then there will be
interesting to know and then we could
discuss what particular extension points
you would actually need to translate
into reality yeah one counting so I need
validation fast condition is very good
we have those so you would want by the
user intercept program and then when
they click the button in parallel you
would want all of the past conditions
that packs discovered to be sent to your
server to be analyzed yeah once the the
Oracle and the taste different mm-hmm
that's oh the other mismatches yeah that
that's a very interesting concrete ask
okay I can see that that box is
interesting in that it doesn't even
reveal the secret program in all detail
it's kind of an abstraction that's
interesting five day the past condition
both together the payout you will be
review to something same yeah I guess if
the user program is completely trivial
then it's going to miss much pretty much
everywhere and that will review the
entire program here Amy past condition
that's interesting any other thoughts
when we we thought about the c
programming system and the extension
mechanism in there and you said you
already thought about other extensions
do you have some experience in the
surface area of the API the interface
that is in between an external extension
and your system or do you still think of
that as you which week it as as new
extensions come up yes we can tweak it
so as of now we are having very simple
mince pie waste are you there so
file-based interfaces but yes sir as i
said i did not get much time to design
this thing these are getting developed
as we progress in the course there but
it long wooden will have to think about
creating clean API is it we're kind of
in a similar situation for coach and
when it comes to extensions right so
this is kind of logistic question I mean
since we are getting the data phone on
you right any specific carnival a little
bit synergetic kind of activities that I
mean all these researchers could could
do I mean I could imagine some
competition on particular kind of
feature imagine on whatever it just
leaves you I mean because I I see like a
lot of result more results would be
produced by these cuddly be loosely
coordinating kind of well I think Sam we
thinking of doing some analysis of the
data Jurgen is that still in the chapter
or did we dump it for right now it's the
letter okay so you mentioned that you
had some tools that that can analyze
programs it's just pmv and check style
better both ma some static analysis
tools dad right get some hint about
quality so you would be looking just
probably as Willam is at the grades
whether they're going up or whether
they're going down and I think you were
also doing that yeah so I'm not sure
whether we be having competitions but we
could be having paper collaborations
right once you know we start analyzing
this data because we'd be analyzing it
in different ways and so I think another
thing it would be like I mean kind of a
completely like I retreat or open source
I mean I for example in the past all
these extensions that my students my
group build around petty which is
releasing compacts why I mean then other
people could could leverage set attempt
at of whatever uses they could so since
we are really working on similar data
set or the same data set right and
buildings and fitch I think some of them
could be data analysis right some of the
tools could be just buildings and
feature in generation they test data
selection progress indication whatever I
think it really makes sense you have
kind of a sharing in terms of the
progress and the infrastructure yeah I
mean right now so we give you the data
but it doesn't exactly come with a
built-in analysis framework right so
just sharing that kind of infrastructure
daniel has some infrastructure based on
rosslyn that is able to to pass code and
yeah that's a good first step for
anything right and that's I don't know
what kind of state it is right now it's
all right there was something fabulous
that my posting tools all into a mesh
with my synthesis code so they're not
really particularly portable other users
yeah so you should spend some time
factor that ultra possibly yeah you guys
having a shout which repository is that
right I mean my goodness hbu quiz I mean
based on earlier experience walking
around peg he also advised instead and
as features I mean it's taya but of
course in order to accept it to be
usable extensible to it into spends an
effort so yeah he also a practical
question what what's the best way for
the community to keep in touch and share
ideas and eventually email just gets out
of hand what's custom form on bottom
here or insane to me good way okay so
which forums to people maybe we should
release the day down yet huh yeah yeah
we at least the data on github and then
we can sit for him up there that's right
okay I think if you keep everything in
get and they'll be such a great really
shoes and in discussion Heather house
right the data release will spring that
often cheaper mm-hmm thank you um for
what to do with the data um one big
problem area that we discussed and then
you're presentable you already did is a
sin generation how we can have people to
actually move forward how can we
identify that people are stuck there's
another dimension that I think we be
very briefly mentioned but then didn't
discuss in more detail quality
assessment of the code so I know what we
do is V and we count msil instructions
by code instructions as a proxy of how
compact is your algorithm and and it
seems to motivate people to keep going
but we don't really know if that's even
the most engaging way of keeping them
going sometimes it's confusing and
there's our quality metrics complexity
or some other beauty metrics so given
the data one could certainly have
different quality assessment measures
and and under Dover the code base so on
only on the day to exactly the winning
the winning solutions are identified so
you know there's there's a progression
of attempts and then put the winning
solution so one could just take winning
solutions and then apply different
objective criteria oh and see how they
stack up against each other and of
course there's no information about the
players right no except you know what
you do you know it's clear one but
there's no demographics no no no not
only that we could actually add to it
yeah the three-point thing that is self
added by players which is whether they
select themselves as novice intermediate
or no probably anything that can be
added to the data I think we'll be okay
you can do some clustering yeah so this
could also in the air or so you can
analyze it on the data but what does it
really tell us that is something we can
also turn into so generating real hints
is difficult but another competition we
could create is let's say you come up
with your own new assessment then
because it out in the cloud and give
different players different assessments
from from from different groups and see
which one creates the most stickiness
that people actually stay in the system
so for that you don't even need to know
the secret solution you just have to
analyze individual program snippets so
that would be another so you've also got
time steps on the data so if you want to
do a few if you want to do a evaluate
winning by time stamps etc how long it
takes you can go and do that computation
if you want to I mean for me the
criteria for the best solution is the
one that is passed but you actually are
sitting on that information because you
had that already when you do this in
Bali execution where we sample it it's
not exhaustive typically if you have
anything that's truly interesting with
loops but there's interesting
information we should make available but
so the data we give you contains the
user submissions and what what you can
do easily this with some script that
again when should be in that github
repository you can fire that off to the
cloud to get the actual test cases out
so i think the data we will distribute
doesn't actually have the test cases in
it that were generated now but it's all
sits in the cloudiness available behind
the API that I showed and again
admittedly today's it wouldn't give you
the past but a projection of that to the
test cases and and we could give you
more yes good feedback good feedback
yeah i mean with which version two of
the day two we could do that kind of
thing yep okay so i think we should have
our last question so that we don't
overrun town like you could also run
packs ya know really not know cop salute
control and even extend packs with your
own extensions to go ahead more
execution paths beyond to such a second
limit yes yeah so yah grunting a
question it seems a comment like java
platform in the mining software
repository of the conference community
say we expect studied the data challenge
check basically every year they just
pick one or two open source project with
booze and history powerful data if I
mean people could just like do something
upon the data not defining what you need
to do and sometimes they have specific
task and then in the end they have this
more like competition but they are
setting the paper presented papers at
the conference the separate chair and
that could be combined with workshop
idea we discussed yeah could be very
much very much I think data is a key
that opens many doors yeah hmm you had a
question before I in a comment that we
can have some kind of advanced duel
where we give a program and ask to the
people to shorten it right there msi
sections which does not make a challenge
that sorry may I challenge that idea
that shorter cycles are better in a
program I come from a soft revolution
background and usually programs that
have the shorter cycles might not be the
one that from a comprehensive point of
view are better so what are we trying to
teach the students are trying to teach
the most performant way of course I
think that totally different dimensions
and all of them make sense the compact
program has advantages in some setting
the most the best complexity you want in
another setting and I its social
exercising program understanding right
if you if you like because you have to
understand the program very deeply in
order to be able to shorten it so I
think that maybe not you know in a
license and so this is how you should
write code but this is a program see if
you can understand it well enough that
you can write a kind of aversion is half
as the size and the same is when you're
learning a language you learn pretty
hillard summary yellow losing
comprehension we we should expose all of
these different dimensions to the player
because I might be interested in I
tomatoes ever learn and they can look at
all of these axes but what you also can
do since we have human being involved
try to figure out what of what is most
fun to optimize for ya so there's this
component um this is all great for
teaching but what we have found is that
the fun aspect is really what's uniquely
what keeps people going and that is
something that you should also study to
keep this going by itself I you don't
want to have a teacher sitting down you
to write do something from a didactic or
pregardia perspective I remember in high
school I tried to do the shortest
solutions and see right not to try to do
all everything in one line and as I went
on programming in actual companies from
a soft revolution perspective a
maintenance perspective this doesn't
make sense at all I mean not so on one
line part yes yeah
Daniel you want you dead something just
say oh so because of because we're
measuring msil instructions and not like
count of characters in the file it's
actually often quite unintuitive what's
the shortest right in fact when I was
like playing I'm trying to minimize
stuff in code hunt thank you go to law
school I'll output the disassembly I can
figure out what Y some yoga is actually
not shorter figure out what the compiler
is actually doing otherwise minimizing
lights isn't saw you same thing to do Oh
a master code enter ok so on that note I
think we should close our workshop thank
our panelists have very much and go
forward to do great things
each year microsoft research helps
hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
