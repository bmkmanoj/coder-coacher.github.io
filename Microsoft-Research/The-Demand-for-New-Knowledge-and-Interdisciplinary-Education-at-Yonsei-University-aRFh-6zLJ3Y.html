you
well good morning distinguished guests
ladies ladies and gentlemen the fellow
university faculties first of all I
would like to thank you very much for
inviting me for the for sharing my bill
on interdisciplinary education &amp;amp; Young
says case of interdisciplinary education
let me start with the Korea South Korea
has been overwhelming success in both
education and information technology
over the past century Korea has
transformed itself from a receiving
country in from overseas aid donor
country which being labeled abella fund
there is envy of neighboring countries
and Korea's education system is open
credited for national success at all in
operation server in February 2013
president / promised a second america
honda / following in the footsteps of
her father one of the key word during
preg park kunis administration has been
her ideal way creative economy which
requires an interdisciplinary approach
to research industry and economy as the
basis for this creative economy predator
part has prioritized the importance of
industry technology convergence for the
expansion of growth potential and
creation of new jobs based on
cutting-edge science technology
information and communication technology
the law of higher education institution
becomes even more critical in the
creative economy since universities are
at the front line of knowledge creation
and education cooperation and
collaboration between academia and
industry in
stations and cooperation the soldiers
and lawmakers are critical in this era
of globalization and reference
technological in advancement
universities and our industry partner
must respond to demand for new knowledge
in our information age and
interdisciplinary education is one of
the answers to this demand for new
knowledge yonsei university was founded
in 1885 129 years ago by Christian
missionaries and is widely considered
Korea's best private university as well
as Korea's most globalized one we have
always held a leading law in Korean
higher education we are one of the first
universities in Korea while changing one
on audiences prosecutors was first
Korea's modern medical school more
recently we have been at forefront of a
liberal art and residential education
true to his missionary origin yonsei
university seek to educate leaders who
will contribute to humanity in the
spirit of truth and freedom and the
servant leadership and we encourage a
strong spirit of community contribution
yonce is curious oldest and the largest
private university and upheld is rich
tradition of excellence while
positioning itself as Korea's most for
looking and liberal institution of
higher education throughout his history
yonce has been the pioneer of higher
education in Korea by presenting new
paradigms in education and research
according to The Times had higher
education reputation ranking yonce is
one of the top private universities
worldwide
SOS in Asia in quality education
cutting-edge research premier patient
care and community service has
world-class University since my
inauguration as president in February
2012 I have emphasized the following
forces as the key element for success in
today's world communication creativity
convergence II and cultural diversity
communication involves not only language
and the ability to listen and speak with
others but also the empathy and the
strong personal qualities that enable a
person to be a good communicator in
order to communicate well a person needs
to be able to truly understand and
connect with others even with those who
hold very different background
creativity is the ability to think in
new and innovative ways a skill that is
critical in all fields today creativity
drives inventions and positive change
and permit us to grow a new direction
without near idea the world would be due
and aesthetic plays a place without
chain or invasion the dynamic
convergence of discipline the striking
grows in interdisciplinary and the
integration is a neutral trend in higher
education and research today such
convergence in academic field requires
at the same time a back-to-basics
emphasis on general education and
traditional horde discipline of the
torture history and philosophy we need
to remain true to the fundamentals of
higher education while accepting and
adapting to change convergence II allow
us to remain
to our original idea while also adapting
to the first is the change of the world
around us finally we live in era of
globalization in which cultural
diversity in our societies now the norm
we need to recognize and acknowledge
that we are different from each other
and yet have the insight to see the
similarities deep inside us on the
outside we may seem to be different in
appearance cultural belief and history
and yet inside we all share the dream of
a better world and butter of 80 tomorrow
we need to embrace and reconcile diverse
and seemingly incompatible
characteristics based on the principle
of the 4c yonsei university is leading
change in acs higher education by
responding dynamically to educational
and market trend and sobbing as the bend
guard in research education and Industry
tie interdisciplinary education is
gaining momentum as a keyword because
our complex information which society
requires flexible thinking and on
ability to adapt a new input that
depends on a knowledge of cross
discipline and on ability to process
various different kind of information it
brings together two or more distinct
according field and works with research
methodologies that draw upon
perspectives and the skill from several
disparate the discourse on inter display
ed studies goes back to platteville i
still can't hagar plot advocated
philosophy as a unifying science and
view the philosophers as someone careful
thin thighs knowledge similarly other
thinkers right
is the current untangle and contour so
share the vision of the unit of
knowledge until mid 20th century
interdisciplinary education was
considered a way of the new university
and college by the late 20th century it
was not just an experimental program for
alternative to the traditional
curriculum what entered is who now even
the oil city holds for more
interdisciplinary exciting primarily
primacy of the practical the oil CD
accounted for the rise of
interdisciplinary education or I to five
factors first development of science
which led to the creation of a new field
of lila knowledge and attempts to define
element common to this print second
student demand for knowledge that was
applicable in reality third problems of
university operation or heben
administration for spoke a chanel and
professional training requirement by
industry and john mccain fifth the
original social demand via dot indies
and new subject cannot be contained
within a single disciplinary frame such
as environmental research these demands
were felt in korea and in Asia as well
and the youngest among the first in the
reason to respond and develop ie and
research program while I poses
challenges for university because
faculty and programs are configured our
own line of existing department field
and discipline the answer support this
future direction and is promoting new
paradigms in education research and
campus infrastructure toward this end at
the answer one of the ways in which we
are promoting
interdisciplinary education is through
the Lieber lot which by nature promote
critical thinking and emphasize tools
over content in process of deep
emphasizing majors of field or study on
a sphere in the general higher education
noted a student at liberal at callies
are significantly more likely than those
that are the college to understand and
sympathize with people from diverse
background according to what was your
national study of liber8 there are seven
outcomes of liberal arts education
integration of learning inclination to
inquire to inquire and lifelong learning
effective listening and problem solving
moral character intercultural
effectiveness leadership and well-being
tying the search word liberal rod on the
internet we can find this image it shows
many of keywords that accompany lead to
liberate in Asia however the Liberata is
a new and unfamiliar concern because
universities in the reason have it
registered traditional emphasize only
professionalisation liberal arts
education is a fairly decent trend and
yonce is pioneering this move for the
first time in Korea yonce in for the
first time in Korea and also in Asia USA
introduced a residential college system

international student from over 50
countries around the world you are
seeing as program a couple of the ways
in which we are utilizing our new campus
located in turn as jumping off point to
the becoming Isis World University
yonsei university stands at the cutting
edge of research ventures as well we are
strengthening our research capacity by
responding to the needs and potentials
of barriers convergence research
initiative and activity actively
engaging interdisciplinary research
project in the process we are supporting
the development of future technology
young sir encourages research and
development in advance the science and
technology the development of new
medicines and new biomedical technology
through the expansion of the engineering
school and establishment the school of
biomedical science and technology
development of new medical and
biomedical technologies will improve the
quality of life and prosperity of future
generations and will be essential in
creating future values in Northeast Asia
the Asian continent and across the grown
our new campuses in channels houses the
USA Institute of convergence technology
is affiliated on the grid protein scrub
integrate technology stability in 2011
the Institute of convergence technology
focuses on four main areas research
computation communication sameness
transportation smart living and the
medical system the next generation of
expert in this field is forced by screw
into
technology supported by the Korean
government industry partners and the USA
this innovative undergrad program aims
to train future leaders in smart
technology ICT and as an environment in
2013 yonce established the icon
Institute of convergence science which
consolidated 50 existing research
centers on all four campuses and
provided on incentive for formational
interdisciplinary research Tom's drawing
on faculty from diverse field icon in
promoting creative and innovate
convergence research while encouraging
sustainable development in each of the
individual research centers contributed
to president parks vision for creative
economy icons will serve as a leader in
global convergence science research on
the administration side also we are
actively promoting information and
resource sharing among our various
campuses qin qiong one jus Sandow and
yonsei university health system to
better facilitate the use of resources
across campuses we are sending network
communication and cleaning among them in
initiative ranging from great
information sharing to collect the
workshop we hold 93% of employers say
that a demonstrated capacity to think
critically communicate clearly and solve
complex problem is more important than a
candidate on the on the grid major more
than seventy-five percent want higher
education to place more emphasis on
these skills
and eight percent agree did regardless
of their major or college student should
acquire broad knowledge in Dibble art
and sciences employers recognized the
fact that a liberal art education better
prepares students for real-world
problems and job this has been
demonstrated to be true in the United
States and we are working on persuading
Korean employees of the same as the
world continued become more
technologically advanced with a new
discovery made every day knowledge is
more accessible and you because the
neighbor in such a narrow a simply
sharing of knowledge is not enough and
we need to move to critical creating new
knowledge ease new forms of social media
and Internet platforms enable bezel and
interactive means of information sharing
with information traveling fast and
further the thirst for new knowledge
demand creative and innovative ways of
thinking and is up to universities to
provide an environment and the source to
enable thought she thinking
interdisciplinary poses challenge for
university because our department pays
to the nature will existing faculty &amp;amp;
program faculty and sometimes student
can be resistant to the programs that
are unfamiliar or the change existing
patterns of funding research or teaching
yonce is striving to break down these
barriers and implement a true
interdisciplinarity through the
residential college programs and unload
international college at our
groundbreaking international campus we
have changed the pigeon of undergrad
education career through new research
initiative and sharing information
technology among our
or four campuses we seek to promote
synergy in our multi-campus structure
next year 2015 yonce will celebrate
130th anniversary we are upholding our
mod excellent here come the grotty
excellence with dignity through
excellent in research and education
while maintaining dignity throughout in
a world of materialism and capitalism
