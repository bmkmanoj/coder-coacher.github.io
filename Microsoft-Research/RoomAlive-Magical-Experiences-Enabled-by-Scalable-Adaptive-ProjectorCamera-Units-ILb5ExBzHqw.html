it transforms any room into an immersive
augmented magical gaming experience room
alive uses projectors and depth cameras
to cover an entire room including the
people in the furniture inside with
pixels that can be used for both input
and output with room alive users can
touch shoot and dodge augmented content
that seamlessly coexists with their
existing physical environment our system
consists of multiple projector camera
units or programs for short each unit
contains a depth camera a commodity wide
field-of-view projector and its own
computational unit these pro cam units
can be used individually or combined
through a scalable distributed framework
to cover an entire room the pro cam
units are Auto calibrating and can self
localize within the room as long as
their views have some overlap the auto
calibration requires no expertise or
calibration fiducials so the pro cams
can easily be installed by end-users one
just positions the programs in the room
and the system does the rest
the system automatically creates a
unified model of the room by combining
the depth maps from each pro cam unit in
addition to the 3d model our system
automatically extracts the surfaces in
the room identifying vertical and
horizontal surfaces and the floor plane
we expose this information together with
a 3d model and the program controls in a
plugin to a Unity game engine this
enables game designers to author rich
immersive gaming experiences to show how
room alive can transform your living
room we have created four interactive
experiences room alive supports
procedurally texturing the living room
transforming the room into a new
environment here the living room can be
transformed into a holodeck an indoor
Factory or can show a river running
through the floor with dynamically
generated raindrops virtual critters can
also be procedurally generated to appear
around the living room the whack-a-mole
experience shows a virtual animated Mole
appearing around the living room
to play through the experience users can
move around the living room touching the
virtual malls to gain points in addition
users can also shoot the malls with a
gun controller users can also control a
virtual character that performs non
physically realistic interactions in the
living room with a standard game
controller the virtual characters can
move up and around walls robots randomly
appear around the living room to chase
the virtual character lastly as a user
walks around the living room
darts emanate from the walls that the
user must avoid when the user is hit
visual elements are shown to indicate
health damage these experiences are just
samples of what is possible with room
alive in summary room alive enables any
living room to be transformed into an
Augmented interactive display
