hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
thanks for coming we're very pleased to
welcome Alexander mama chef from the
University of Washington formerly of the
Ukraine and has been in electrical
engineering u-dub for thirteen years a
long time and works on sensor networks
and so on one of the principal
motivations of this when I first met
Alex through his first book on stream
was why he was not using latex like
everybody else does in science in
computer science and in physics and the
reason was that you were doing
multidisciplinary collaborations with
other scientists who didn't want to use
latex and so having to actually
understand what their problems were and
understand how to write scientific
documents collaboratively in Word was
one of the motivations for the book so I
was very excited also by Marie who was
has had a long passion for mathematical
equations in word and producing a great
editor and it seemed that this was one
of Microsoft's lesser-known functions
that have functional word was and I
think it's actually something that even
people in this building could find out
about if they go read the book so it's
very pleasing to have Alex talking about
creating research and scientific
documents using Microsoft Word Alex
thank you
I have only a few slides but I have some
examples which we will go over the
introduction was indeed very accurate we
are yes I'm pleased to have my cursor
here as well
Marie Sargent and I have a separate
slide dedicated to our poster shape
activity here okay
I would like to start remind you about
the motivation for this work with there
is a great comedy office space where the
let's see I am going to switch my mode
here so I can jump between Windows and
so just to remind you about him I won't
play it in this case but there is a
character Peter Gibbons who comes to an
office and as part of his interview he
mentions that in a given week I do only
15 minutes of real actual work and this
is how sometimes I feel and this is why
I have to think about business
productivity in research environment I'm
not a Microsoft world teacher or expert
in just everyday as a director of a
research lab I have to manage the
production of manuscripts by perhaps 20
people work in my lab 20 people who
collaborate with me in interdisciplinary
projects 20 people who work in the
companies that I help help to start or
to operate so these issues they come in
every day every day every day and they
come in perhaps more often than my core
research my my sensors and meeting with
with medical professionals and it keeps
amazing me how little attention is paid
to the to the issues of quality and
productivity when it comes to writing
technical papers when we submit a
mid-size significant medical proposal
and it's for National Institute of
Health's it's a five million dollar
document we are asking for five million
dollars from the government and every
professor in the country is playing this
game of asking hundred thousand million
famine tell me Leo from government and
if you think how suppose you want to
sell five million dollars worth of
Ferraris you actually have to set up a
dealership get a bunch of Ferraris work
for a long time until many buyers come
through the presentation and you have to
sell many many of those Ferraris to
accumulate five million dollars but when
the same bad for the same amount is made
enough in a form of submitting a
document very often people are when
people are quite sloppy they they could
have errors that they could have low
quality materials go in there and in
this activity becoming more and more
difficult more and more cutthroat and so
I have to keep paying attention to these
issues so you would think that indeed I
in in the world the physical scientists
in an academia many people
organizationally would pay a lot of
attention to these issues and I would
like to show what actually happens with
Microsoft Word in these situations
whenever again organization puts a
requirement for the document they
actually don't care how much time it
takes to produce it I will play this
time this this little video the scene
from the casino movie there is not one
single thing I will not catch as Remo
yours but look at that
this is nothing the company who bears
your muffin has and how many mine has
yours is falling apart I had not only
talking about like everything else but
you don't do it this self never gets
done I want you to put an equal amount
of blueberries in each mother an equal
amount of blueberries in each muffin you
know how long that's going to take I
don't care how long it takes to put an
equal amount in each muffin okay so
here's the attitude that we can observe
my own University University of
Washington see how can I switch to this
I'm doing that I probably have the right
clicking and a full presentation not so
I will just copy this
it's meant to say big all right so this
is University of Washington front page
requirements for the document sample
thesis title page and sample doctoral
dissertation title page a little hard to
see there small unzoom a little more
okay and as you can see they are in PDF
they describe you would they want to see
sample copyright page also in PDF sample
abstract also they provide a PDF they
provide some that the university does
not provide technical computer
assistance in formatting your document
using latex well there is a fellow Jim
folks and he provides a custom class
file there is a file that is useful and
formatting the document in latex and
that's it and there is no template in
Microsoft Word use your favorite
software and figure out how to do this
the University of Washington is a big
business it's not as big as Microsoft
but it's a three billion dollar business
1 billion is teaching 1 billion is
Hospital activities and about 1 billion
is research of that research a lion's
share is the medical research and I can
tell you that and medical research
people will not use latex so this toy
and share of these PhD and masters
teachers produced in medical research
and of course there are many other
divisions they are going to be in
Microsoft Word and these highly paid
professionals doctors and surgeons they
supervise these activities and as part
of their activity today they are using
Microsoft Word because that's what they
know and they using it as a typewriter
they open a page and start typing
it's it's still the situation here's the
example from I Triple E I am an
electrical engineer I will take this
link
the world's largest professional
association for the advancement of
technology these are templates for
submissions thousands tens of thousands
of publications per year they have
templates you can download a latex style
file you can download template and use
latex you can notice that those that
work in health and medicine they have
templates and Doc it's just a telltale
sign there isn't they expect Microsoft
Word document
there is template and instructions how
to create your document and I already
pre opened on my computer this template
to make it a little faster I think so oh
maybe I didn't
I will I will open it here
here's the template in for a Tripoli
transactions the staple of scientific
research
I've been here sorry
no that's
I knew I pre opened it okay so right
okay so this is it this is one of the I
Triple E templates okay transactions
it's not what I needed to show I'm sorry
that's already all modification
expect it to work okay here this alright
so this is the template and it very much
shows the philosophy of we don't care
how long it's gonna take for you to
write this - to format this document if
you look at the equation here it's a
it's just text it's a typewriter it's a
manually formatted equation equation
number one if you look at the figure
here it's I think it's in a text box
which already will mess up the number
and and it's just text I am highlighting
it and it's just text okay look at the
table table here is just X so here's the
document where everything is manual all
the numbering of all these elements are
menial and if you start creating these
complex documents you normally enter
this field you download if you work in
Word if you are in Medical Sciences
specifically that you don't load this
and you start using it and you type in
figure because documents are not little
written linearly normally we get I get
this chunk of text figure xxx figure yyy
and then people mania to this and then I
observe groups the that that process
takes so much time that it comes down to
this to 15 minutes of real actual work
is very very large proportion of time
goes into this minutia so I am my entire
talk about today is not that about the
depth of research more common talks that
they do but about the my new shame how
much it takes and how I observe it every
time and it wasn't like that five years
ago and was not yet ten years ago
this is publisher Wiley and down at the
bottom there
I've considered that but this is the
last link so it will be faster for me to
finish yeah I I agree that that's a fair
comment but I'm almost done doing that
oh okay
so um here and sounds very high level
- script guidelines for scientific
technical medical and scholarly so
complex heavy with figures equations
complex long documents okay
they have latex style files and they are
pretty good and I'm not until I that my
PhD thesis was written in latex 709
pages the longest thesis not the best
but I measured the thickness how much
they would take and I wrote the longest
because I had a lot of experimental data
in in the department at MIT and it has
Easter eggs has all kinds of latex
features so I my work with word comes
from understanding latex quite well and
here is a template right so here's a
template for for the books Microsoft
Word authoring template right so you
would expect something okay somebody is
going to write a complex document a book
so the publisher is going to give us a
template let me open the template for
you
that's it this is the template okay I a
number of books a publish this number of
publishes and although there are some
little exception mostly mostly this is
the situation there are publishing
documents this book was written in
Microsoft Word but then in order to
enter the Microsoft press process I I
understand them they they were very
helpful I am grateful for them we we
wrote this book together but I also
observed it I give them the book it's
fully set it's done it looks exactly to
specifications it's done hit the button
PDF it's finished but they need to be in
control so another four months went into
switching it to InDesign and they
produced a nice book in InDesign but for
many organizations its it's just not
necessary okay
moreover the requirement is typically
from publishers strip all the automatic
features and just submit us a typewriter
text and we will do it for you okay now
so this is 2014 this is the world today
it remains and I just observed how many
intelligent people how much time they
spent on minutiae and I have to at least
solve this problem for myself so I would
take an existing book and I would use it
and there are many books and work but
they everything I came across comes has
a different philosophy very thick word
Bible you can look up at every feature
that you want but
a typical scientist engineer program
merit medical researcher would not use
such a bill when you talk to now I can I
think I can switch to presentation mode
thank you so when you talk to
scientist technical technical
professional they would say well we are
real scientists we use latex sometimes
it's done without a layer of arrogance
sometimes it's even one of my colleagues
who works but collaborate is Microsoft
and medical professionals well I think
we said he said I observed that when I
submit my grants in latex their
likelihood of being published it is
higher of being funded is higher than
they do it and work well in my opinion
this is because when he does certain
work it's a lot more difficult for him
you cannot just enter a picture cannot
just manipulate the page you cannot make
them look good he doesn't know how to
use 20 he is 20 he's 30 years in the
field
he does not know how to do this it we
were writing a multi-million dollar
grant and there was a pointer still a
week left for first submission I was not
a leader of that grant and it was done
in word everybody submits their pieces
groups from different universities and
Cup about two weeks before the
submission it occurs to me that we
should should enter there is this great
graphic that would really come across in
the pictures worth a thousand words
there is a great information we should
enter it in our document it's important
I sent the ten with a little text and
the response comes back no there is
discipline there's two weeks left we are
in cutoff mode we already numbered our
figures okay
they already took their typewriter text
that was pretty recently gave it to the
secretary who does it and they numbered
manually their figures okay so
we didn't get found it okay and perhaps
one figure I don't think so
but because the entire system is they
they could not edit they there is no way
to improve and polish in this very
important element of editing okay
because take they can't once there is
number of things sometimes when you work
with lawyers on intellectual property
it's you know they they would love to oh
yes
add another figure and so they send us
about five thousand dollar bill to end
one figure and why well because it has
to go to fill to our office to
paralegals who will enter figure ten and
everything after figure 10 becomes
figure eleven twelve thirteen so we
spend a lot of time here is a five
thousand dollar bill well for lawyers
probably they maybe they want it this
way this is their income but for other
situations okay I can tell you them
surgeons hard doctors they work is data
wanted they are on a deeper day they
have patients they want to go but they
said that so if you think of it if you
think about this statement that real
scientists don't use word that it really
comes very much from how it happens okay
if a real scientist wants to write
something only thing first they get the
book on latex there are several great
books and it's it's on their desk that's
what's typically it's done ok they read
the book and they understand how to
automate number in position in how to do
all this - yeah you read it once you
spend a few hours and then for the rest
of your career you don't spend time on
it you know how to do it you cover it's
second nature okay a key book as a
reference updated from time to time and
they have to do this because there is no
way around it the latex doesn't give you
an option of
type in all these strange-looking to
most people the streets looking and she
HTML will HTML like commands just a
little out of your head okay you cannot
do this so you don't load the template
and you never know how the template
works usually just use it and then
organizations as a head shown they tend
to provide generic templates if you want
to write your thesis in latex you know
you can get it from University of
Washington there is template if you want
but all your previous papers were
written in word because your heart
surgeon who works with you is not going
to take latex from you and then so you
have this real scientist now who knows
that you can write well in latex but but
in word or word that's that's for many
methods for dumb managers so I observe
people I work in military projects and
somebody who is as a PhD in math and of
course the math is produced in Oh way
tech and and related packages but then
the boss comes in and says I need it and
work because the boss needs to take
little pieces put it on PowerPoint and
go present it in general to generals
right amid manager at at Boeing you know
somebody who did not come through the
past of masters PhD okay that person
comes in and insist that is that that
they need a 10 word because they need to
reuse it the first attempt that this PhD
latex user sends them a sentence in PDF
Word PDF s not can you cannot copy
pasted on his PDA easily so then you
have a whole lot of cursing and
complaining and they are forced to spend
their time days sometimes taken their
wonderful math and graphics and
converting it the word and it looks
horrible after they have done it
and what is commonly done with people
who enter scientists is how they start
they open word they have this nice
scream they have a ribbon now open
document and then they have a blank
blank document to select or sometimes
you could go to templates you could have
a birthday card there you could have
maybe a resume there you could have
things that look that in fact you could
make by yourself all you have to do is
to change phones perhaps an artist but
put nice phones for you okay but if you
go open template a book there is nothing
there as of today something that that
you would reuse shampoo that you would
be equivalent to a latex template for
writing a complex document okay so you
open this blank document you start
typing you're complaining about the gum
managers for the know how to use latex
sometimes you use online help and you
just share your frustration okay so the
argument that I'm making in my group is
if you want to make if you want to get
engaged in activities of that complexity
overwriting a multitude of complex
documents and manipulating content in
these documents and not spend excessive
amounts of time and ability in this
document so you can focus on on your
essence then you have to follow this
style you have to actually get the a
good template you have to get a good
book where you can look up the things
that you need to do get a reference book
and and then operate in that manner
so we have written a book with the
championship from Tony hey with called
Coulter ship of Maury who has written by
far the longest and most intense
intensive chapter of how to do math in
work the book allows to get templates
provides good templates in my in my
little world we have templates for NSF
National Science Foundation proposal and
for national institutes of health health
proposal and the same organizations
there is thousands of NIH proposals
going in and the thousands of people
they don't provide a word template for
it everybody operates and work so there
is this piece that is know so there is
this piece that is now done there is a
book so thank you for Microsoft prayers
for for making a book on latex and for
price and a low it was pleasant surprise
for me
you know authors usually don't have
control of the price and it's made it
inexpensive okay and the book would
teach person this is a person list but
we are not quite and and it provides a
template there is a website there are
several websites where templates are
available but it's not quite as you can
see organizations did not catch up with
it so far there there are exceptions I'm
aware of the few exceptions there is a
university in Canada and they have a
wonderful template for for the fees for
their students one out of I reviewed 20
universities and there was one that had
I could make it better but that was
decent it was pretty decent
okay um but usually this this part this
part number five is not quite done
then it provides the mass as I mentioned
and keyboard shortcuts especially for
math it's a frequent misconception
frequent complaint from the real
scientists who don't eat quiche that you
cannot do math in the world because you
have to go and use your mouse you cannot
use it by keyboard you cannot use the
wonderful backslash alpha latex like
commands in order to get your your own
symbols and none of it is true in the
last couple of maybe even more last few
years the Microsoft team I am not part
of it but I'm just aware they went
through a great effort of upgrading
their math facilities and now there is a
very rich rich set of tools I was
learning myself as I was reading this
chapter from my co-author you can do
practically everything in word that in
ladies but the convincing people that
it's possible it's it's an entirely
different matter in my little world when
I'm lab director when I know a little
boss I just tell people you do it this
way and they do it this way okay but oh
outside of it it remains the same
okay so the templates are in transition
we we have you have them but we don't
have them for a wide variety of
documents okay have a template for
Microsoft res book if somebody is
interested to write for Microsoft rest
it will be at least be easier to create
the next book was Microsoft press every
single automated colors numbers
cross-reference everything okay
everything you could do and you say all
done and follows this time but there are
many other types of documents and so
this is the bottom there is no really
ecosystem where people create templates
and the users they are full of
misconceptions and it's
when I try to explain I decided I have
an analogy of what happens with this
misconception some years ago I took a
Russian peasant who was visiting visit
in the United States took that person to
a nice steak house to a restaurant
expensive and then through his eyes
everything was wrong okay so we walk in
we order food and then we have to wait
so it's not like cafeteria you come and
get food you have to wait what is that
we paying all this money and we have to
wait for them to prepare the food okay
but that that's already nonsense okay we
sit at the table and talk and meanwhile
these disorganized people the chefs are
still cooking our food and in his view
food cooked orders not even it's a long
lecture to explain what it's about okay
and late and then the steak the meat the
meat was old its aged steak okay so my
god he first was indifferent fresh it's
it's old and and then it was a single
chunk of meat and so they didn't bother
to grind it to make nice Cutlass so you
have to actually take a knife and cut it
okay rather than you have a ground meat
you make patties you fry the patties
they're really tasty and easy to eat so
and it was filet mignons of medium-rare
so in his view it had blood in it they
didn't cook it
they the chef was so bad it didn't even
cook they mean it's bleeding in front of
you on the third it's horrible
okay and to top all of that we drink it
with wine and it under get drunk with
wine how much wine you need to drink to
to get drunk here he didn't okay so
there is this gigantic this he is over
there
okay and and I could spend the whole day
explaining you know it
it's a different
the fear of life and and this is how I
feel often when I talk to people who are
very ingrained in latex they have their
beliefs they live in their world okay
and they say you cannot do this you
cannot do this you cannot do this you
cannot do this and in my experience and
I have to convince them because I have a
system I have the oil well oiled machine
that that produces this man manuscripts
in Word
but every time I cannot just say easily
like oh no no that that's okay you can
you can put figures at the bottom of you
can take a figure and you make make it
so that the text flows around the figure
you don't have to Center it in the
middle okay because very often you have
limited number of pages you have six
pages 10 pages you have X number of
pages to convey your thoughts in your
grant okay you send the proposal the
most frequent comment is the the
proposal did not address this question
okay well there is not enough space so
when you send it second time you squeeze
squeeze as much material as possible so
every proposal has these fingers
squished in squish - squish and so in
latex it's just one simple command in
its equation okay and the text flows
around but but in word if you put them
in text box you could put it in text box
then you the auto numbering doesn't work
so you have to have to actually one
optimal a very good way is to put it in
a table make a table invisible and in
that invisible table it will be nicely
handled by by the computer actually put
me here store I would that solution
myself me a quite an expert it wasn't
obvious so there is this constant battle
that remains that resolve these
misconceptions so I see this and then
everybody keeps inventing the bicycle
they have their own techniques right
their techniques don't work okay they
would they would try to number an
equation they would put in the crease
and they make space space space space
and we would align the equation number
but it's poorly aligned it looks it
looks bad
okay the equation number should be
nicely aligned on the right the reason
we have a template for it works works
beautifully you can cross reference them
but there are seven different ways to
number an equation and six of them are
bad and randomly people hit on one of
those lousy waste number equation and
then that's their opinion now now you
can't it's just okay and so that that
reminds the challenge how do you
describe a sunset to blind man how do
you explain to them so from my own
perspective it's like I take care of my
group but I think there is a potential
for philosophically may in in our little
way and making the world a better place
okay there is a potential of resolving
this still existing set of problems so
that the doctors can focus on their
medicine rather than on the minutia okay
I won't acknowledge my Kozar Marais
sergeant Tony hey
who championed this entire process
because writing a book with Microsoft
press he doesn't just make a phone call
to Microsoft press and for recognizing
this this type of a problem they have an
Musgrave who is a manager well he
managed the process at Microsoft press
his art directors and he's very artsy
person okay so I think his title has
worked art in it and Jim Payne common
also in Katherine holiday they both work
with 20 hey and working with us and I I
had a lot of help from Microsoft
reviewers and advisors a lot of help
from Microsoft press stuff when I
started putting all the names the phone
became very small service apologist
thank you / / / all their health but
there was many people helped him okay
these are names of the students who made
particularly important contributions to
this process so thank you and I am open
to take questions
I've heard of even when you just open up
word these days you're presented with an
array of possible templates and I think
one of the options is go to Microsoft
Office online and get more templates
maybe we should just expose some of
these templates for books and things you
know but in fact it might even be a good
idea to have on that opening page that
were displaced with the blank page first
you know and your resume and a greeting
card where we ought to say books or
technical books it's just a
representative thing which would go into
a number of possible things and expose
it that way I think it would be a
tremendous help
right it's outside of my control but you
know somebody that Microsoft has has
this control tremendous help to the
users very often very very often person
tries to write a book and Microsoft Word
and there is a lot of frustration I'm
using Lee some of these people some of
these frustrating stories came to me
from Microsoft employees from very
experienced high-level Microsoft
employees was I was trying to I'm trying
to write my book in Word and and you
know it's like we will defeat it and
they keep reinventing the bicycle there
is a care should be taken as two people
need to understand what they are given
so that they can use this tool properly
okay because they're still like that
that Russian peasant many people and in
a very different mindset and even if you
give them the template they might come
back and complain I tried to use it and
it didn't work for me because it's a lot
easier you know to mangle a complex
template for a complex document then you
know you have a postcard template okay
you have happy birthday and you have
three fonts okay so that those templates
are more useful so but
properly it would be tremendous help but
those templates would be a lot more
important than I think for at least for
for hard sciences users yes publishers
so I've been wondering why publishers to
use the XML version of word and I think
the answer is it all the users are using
all versions of word and so giving
formats which xtr for the modern word is
not what most people when they have word
are using and that mismatch is a problem
why well so there are two parts to that
they have two parts to this question
wipe publishers do not use it there is a
variety of reasons I think a big one is
it is just inertia okay they have done
it this way for years there are
individual people it works
don't break what works and they don't
care and all the pain of putting the
same equal amount of blueberries in each
man and all the pain is on the author
side and it doesn't affect their
business it's not their business
advantage oh but about backwards
compatibility
I myself have to deal with it all the
time okay so every template that I have
that that I do not write every time that
works with you can go three four
versions of Microsoft Word back it opens
and it works seamlessly I actually that
makes templates a little bit less slick
and a little bit less useful than they
could be okay but because I know that I
need to be able to send it to a whole
bunch of people and oh yes I'm sorry I I
wanted to share a video this is how
there is one more piece of my
presentations a three minute video when
I send it the whole bunch of people I
need to explain to them and here's an
example of
I wanted to show what this sort of what
these templates can do already open the
video but here it is no no hello
I'm Erin and I'll be demonstrating why
you might want to consider proper format
in the documents and so let's assume you
have two papers you have sample paper
one and sample B been sitting minutes
you've written them both you like some
of the information in sample paper too
that you want to draw in to sample paper
one we want to put it to be a need down
here now one problem with that a lot of
people who are running into and I'll
show it off with you you might want to
put this figure into your paper but
unfortunately you'll notice is that this
is figure one and this is figure one and
this number didn't update so you would
have to manually delete this you'll have
to manually believe this you have to
manually delete and change this and
moreover if you reference any of these
figures in your text you have to make
sure that these numbers get updated to
y'all could keep track of that and then
manually update these numbers I think
that looks like a headache and it is a
headache trying to manage all of that so
I'm just gonna undo and show you there's
a much easier way so and before I begin
I would like to draw attention to the
fact that these documents are not
consistently formatted you'll see that
this is all caps this padding right here
is all caps with a pretty big space
between this not only isn't a Roman
numeral with a period it's just a
regular one with the relatively small
space and it's blue and it's not in all
caps the headings are different the way
that we handle our figures our
difference between different between the
two papers this is bald this isn't as
well as the indentation for the
paragraphs this is a pretty wide
indentation this isn't this is
times new roman' this is Ariel you know
this is size 10 font this is size 11 so
right off the bat you can see there's a
lot of formatting that you have to keep
track if you want to have the entire
paper consistent in formatting you have
to make sure that all of these features
are not in present here but all of this
text is conforming to the requirements
in this document if you properly format
your document using proper string tools
that's not a big deal at all in fact
it's not even a headache it's nothing
really
so you highlight the text that you're
interested in you want to take this
section and put it at the very end
highlight it you copy it and you put it
into the document and next you'll notice
that without having to make any changes
to the document the headings already
conformed to the headings that are above
from you know little space here to an O
Roman number Roman numerals this isn't
all caps and this is blue now moreover
you'll notice that this is bold when the
table you know he didn't used to be bold
and so the one thing you'll notice that
didn't change yeah any more so you'll
notice uh this is Ariel 11 versus it
used to be times more than ten
indentation also changed the one thing
that didn't change on its own is the
figure numbering this is figure three
and it jumps back to figure one and in
text it refers to figure one although
that's quite annoying it's actually
easily read fixed you select it all
press f9 and suddenly the document will
Auto number them all and figure three
then follows figure four in text also
updates figure four and you also notice
headings in text over here we referred
to uh animals but moreover we preferred
to add this subsection penguins referred
to in text right here the numbering
updating it's now a 2.1 penguins which
is consistent with right here so it's a
lot less of a hassle you don't have to
worry about the formatting it updates
itself it's useful to learn these
techniques it'll save you time
especially if you uh want to work with
considerably large documents if you have
50 pages to surf through to find numbers
that may or may not have updated that's
a hassle you really don't want to worry
about thank you for your kind okay yes
that's Erin szalinski it work who's me
did that video what I want to explain is
there is no discovery this of course
this is use of simple features as mine
in Microsoft Word my challenge is not my
God look what you can do I say I have
let's say 20 students who work in my lab
the challenge is I am sure that almost
every of those students given a task and
one day can figure out how to do this a
little better little worse but the
challenges that all 20 of them in one
hour or less and half an hour and said
get trained to use the same template
that no matter who who creates
everything I can copy paste from single
column to double column to middle-sized
to any style I want and every single
will be done the same way so that it's a
complete compatibility across my entire
group even greater challenge if it's not
an undergraduate student but if it's a
surgeon then I have 15 minutes I have to
explain how to do that they have to
convince the surgeon and maybe the
surgeon will never learn but at least
the person who works for the surgeon
will get the message okay get this learn
this in half an hour and start working
with it so so that they can get out
there other papers that we are going to
reuse that material take it here take it
and turn in our new document and in
click a couple of buttons and we are
done you're not just formatting we can
focus on our
okay that that's really the challenge to
get people use it not to figure out
specific how to use styles
yes to these things like this video it's
lighter materials I mean if this ends up
online I just linked to the red chapter
yeah I find all this help rather meager
know if you ever go to off yourself and
decide is very helpful I usually just go
figure it out myself because it's
quicker workflow publishers this kind of
small nails you know there's no post
about how we can do this event yeah and
it is they get some time ago probably of
us not be able to do this but they have
many nice sharp post about let's do less
time to this in this house well that's
cool we can begin extending on canceled
pressure would be more
Justin Davis many these ordinary time
there is individual answer to every of
those how to do this how to do this
there is always individual answer it's
just there is no system you can show
them that if you may have some acres but
then they may decide no I will do it
later I need to just fight this village
because
 and I don't care about this or
people just this is they understand but
they don't have time just be right or
you don't know how to do them teach them
from user experience time and user
experience designers what they can do to
help a jacket but we don't let me easily
just change the forms from tension
around training points 14 points just
because there's a button there's no this
is about any plane I would say ever I
would say emphasis or something like
that and then it's linked to the
particle style the deceptive set of
tools I can use the meta is limited if I
figure you have taken form around it or
whatever right
do your provided this limited set of
tools everything you can do everything
open is very hard it's really the first
thing you see in the toolbar or even
before you change your form notice on
the right hand side
do you think that actually limiting
amount of things
option seasoning is presenting it was
help organizing just me oh.just
limitedness I know very current from
word there's a tremendously successful
problem it's just a very very and and
it's in its very much because there are
these easy options but for those who
want to write write complex documents
well it is the way we do it in the book
here we start with explaining what
styles are and if you want to work in
complex documents you you do not go and
change the font you don't know you go
and you pick the right style for it so
that later if this entire these five
pages travel into a different document
there is a new set of styles and
everything will be updated by itself but
it takes certain amount of discipline
when people sign up if people sign up in
in my case they do sign up for for this
type of mentality then everything else
is so much easier so it what gives you
both options you can do manually and you
can do it automatically and it's it's
both blessing and a curse
and it's more of a curse than a blessing
and in many cases the riches would be a
parent oh yes I agree with all the
observations comments yeah if they do
one time versus another right it's
probably hard to catch them honey is one
of our figures in your papers 59 is
everything about date on this one you
know it's very hard for you to catch
right so kind of situation who
expressions instruction of the document
of these
maybe useful feature like what's wrong
why they don't follow your
recommendations all right it'd be useful
it would be I can give a one example
that we had to introduce along these
lines a little different for the combat
but sometimes the cursor friends get
mangled and there is this error
exclamation point message error okay so
in my writing process I had to
explicitly the last thing before you
sent the document you do the search for
error exclamation point because it shows
up when everything is done when the boss
approved the document signed in and this
is when you upload you're ready to
upload it to the website somewhere it's
but that document went to some other
computer and some secretarial assistant
is uploaded in it and she did not update
the links and there is this error thing
so the last thing you do so this is one
of the examples of of sanitation somehow
it seems like it would but in years of
use that never happened to me that some
some figure would not be Auto numbered
maybe because just because my group is
disciplined and and and it happens but I
can see that that might might happen to
someone else the one that's acting a lot
probably outside of this you write a
paper and then you can use save it as
PDF because you're only allowed to
upload the PDF to these sufficient
friends and it comes out two lines
longer and so page right right right
right
and it's a huge issue a lot at fifteen
fifteen pages and you know fifteen pages
and two lines
yeah so you know they whether it should
be in our case the whether we do it I
have this other book stream tools and
and the last last thing before you
submit a document there is a checklist
and so which a checklist for error
checklist if your PDF
has the same number of lines this often
happens when the figure shifts a little
bit a table shifts a little bit
unexpected a yes so whether it should be
an automatic feature in word I think
what would be more natural perhaps many
many programs have this set tips you
know the next step shows up the next as
you work as you work in in the program
there is a little square tip you could
do this okay this entire system would
fit into 50 tips okay so you could learn
it and then the tips could help you some
automated features in the next version
of word could be like email now email
packages if you right word attached and
you press a button it checks for you
they do you mean to attach something it
helps you sell things like that could be
these are like icing on the cake once
there is a system there is there is a
way I think to improve that systems I
mean you have some challenges finishing
a book in word with your Canadian
collaborator so it's his main beef was
that he that he never understood the
underlying model the underlying
abstraction of what word was all about
and so he didn't know what features to
go for all right City understood Frank
Mecca and me understood lytec but never
ever could it would take some ecosystem
some instructors for that that have the
right set of material for the faux for
for the right set of people to explore
to emphasize these features of these
features because it's hard to attach an
individual person to everybody yeah
through truth publishers so when I was
writing one book a long time ago they
were very very good and they'd obviously
worked it out and and they gave me the
this sort of sandbox and they said you
work within this and initially it was a
pain because I had to work within that
wonderful one of the users I would
suspect that people in Microsoft
Research moving from latex a word is
that they have all their references in
bib tech in latex and how
straightforward is it I mean as I
understand from the book the citation
management actually provided with word
isn't really adequate for doing complex
that Saturday the built-in citation
manager turn inward is weak there are
strong citation packages and note
reference manager there's a couple more
the I I think EndNote is the most
popular is that what is in medical
medical committee there are some others
they have tools you take the entire
biftec import it press a button and you
have um no database and you start using
it like you were using it yes but you do
buy in yeah you have to buy and know
they have separate teaching videos how
to do this how to do this how to do this
so it can be done and I would say it's
simpler to use and not that big tech it
has a lot of these interface what this
is but they get a lot of advantages when
you search for the papers in the in the
library and the databases you want this
one this one this one this one you pick
you pick they go into um not there
they are now available whenever you want
to cross-reference them in in your
document you pick pick pick you never
have to type them into biftec
it's just button good button click and
you cross-reference them
I just wonder how easy it would be so
people do have to buy that you have to
buy it maybe we share the psychosis in
in my book and stream tools I do the
kind of the business analysis how much
do you spend buying the software and
maybe training your people to do this in
this system and what is the return on
investment how quickly you get in
interest time as time is money how much
time you are wasting on the minutia very
often a return on investment depends on
a unit organization but the return on
investment is days it's not months yeah
you have to buy it for some situation
it's an issue but $50 it's less than
hourly salary of an employee and they
spent hours and hours translation just
just enriched in one big document from
Playtex toward there are tools by the
way all set to go from latex toward
German students spend time writing those
translators but they are kind of like
google language translate you can guess
what it means but it's not literally
translation same same here you can take
latex document translate it onto work
there will be some figures there will be
some text then you have to spend hours
to reformat in it and that's how how you
do it yeah so for I I understand that
many people will remain and I'm not even
anti latex many people were in male you
will remain in latex but the moment they
have to step out and you know start
doing good doing something
interdisciplinary very often they will
be in a situation they don't have a
choice and the way that they don't have
a choice they have to use work then they
have a choice they can complain about it
suffer and complain or the entire system
they see the basic system is taught in
half an hour
the
you open the template I have this
template she open template and he said
you you know you know if you want to put
a failure in equation and table you take
an existing figure you copy/paste and
reuse it copy-paste and reuse it you
have to master the basics before you
start drawing in 3d so like you said
sandbox first will limit the people eg
you can only do this and and later man
once you learn to do this you can start
exploring so to get somebody going takes
really less than half an hour or half an
hour you can do everything but if you
want to division creatively that's
another few days of reading the book
and the other comments just say it
sounds like a great idea to me I've been
here 20 years and I've written lots of
papers when they taken that written to
it word each time I do it I swear I'll
never do it again
and I think a lot of us do with you know
I've always faulted Microsoft
documentation for not keep presented in
terms of abstractions it's always a list
of I want to do this this this is this
and it says to do these things you do
these 27 different keystrokes or clicks
in a row and they don't tell you why
we're as opposed to saying there's this
model that you know well there's a
program and there's a style and there
Shawn here's how you override said right
and you have a mental model of how it
works and every time I've gone to people
and talked about it responses well
you're an advanced scientist engineer
type and that's what you want but our
users would never want that that's the
PM response from from windows world is
well what people want to do is they want
to get their new birthday person filled
out and we have instructions for that
and I really think that most people with
the right mindset who could live with
word a lot better if they simply had
somebody you know write a chapter or so
it says this is the way the world is
organized if we want to change something
these are the right levels as we
shouldn't do something
it is the only thing that we get assist
the office team to do but the two the
two kids that that helped in pooping the
book just in Davison and cable they are
really very familiar with all these
tricks with styles and stuff like that
so they they might be quite receptive to
suggestions this is the analogy that
that I found flies well you break the
rules you must first master the entire
system depends on just very few rules
you you can introduce these rules
literally and I said another half an
hour quite a few sometimes I get person
going in ten minutes and they are
already happy okay it's the other pace
that dangers there are people who know
every possible trick in the world but
you cannot work with these people
because you have to know all of those
tricks you know it and you keep
reinventing the bicycle so first you
have to be given the template and just
that you just work within this template
and you start enjoying it and after you
enjoy it then it well how do I actually
make it so that my figures are flowing
how do you put your learner efficient
and then how do you put two figures next
to each other in the word so that like
this it's ten different ways and there
is only one or two that's good then you
go to the book and look at it so I think
the best so templates that we have they
are actually self explanatory in the
template of in the text of the template
that says there in the end of this book
and they download the book from the
website except one one website now
instead of dot-com has to be dot org we
got a squatter host or website so we
have to but there are several places
where templates can be downloaded so you
just give it a bit and you read it and
and reuse it we we have to do it for I
Triple E for this right report papers we
take the typewriter template as a call
from I Triple E
change it to stream tunes template that
has all the features and everybody who
uses that they love it they just they
just love it
but I don't have enough stamina or
charisma or perseverance to go to I
triple and say look this is so good
don't add this to your websites or
300,000 members can use it okay somebody
who is who could complement was their
ability to break into organizations but
what would make a great service to the
world I think there is something we
should do with journalists to educate
people and you know having templates
it's fine happy birthday cards but
having the template - might decide to be
documents great idea would be that's
something what what's the name of the PM
statistic Justin Davis but it's just she
works for him so yeah okay I'm fine Tim
yeah oh very good they're very good and
they're very receptive to but it just
seems that we don't make enough of all
the features that you could use and
there's any don't teach people yeah the
the facilities are there and so now it's
just a matter of exposing it in a way so
I think pretty putting one one technical
thing on that front page that shows up
when you open work if it's old was just
as I'm kind of it yeah it seems that's
that should be done you know here's one
more advanced template and by the way we
have lots more Marais was one of the
current converts and we were right in
this book you wrote that n-word and he's
great the expert on many aspects on the
board but I gave him a template also
because they had template and he was
producing immediately so I do think
don't get any notice is a slightly
missing competition well they'll have to
if they're one of the majority of
scientific papers don't have more than
14 15 references resistant if you're
doing a thesis it's a different story
next is the reality it's okay the
reality in my world in my world is that
actually the medical researches they do
have a note and they use references they
actually have this aspect salt
it's the positioning at the numbering
management actually they don't have that
taken care of</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
