hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
the next speaker is Rick Russia doctoral
crashes is the worldwide head of all our
research labs he is a founder of
Microsoft Research and he founded it in
1991 and the prior to that he was a
professor at Carnegie Mellon University
and he his area of interest research
interest is in artificial intelligence
operating systems networking and
multiprocessors he got his PhD from
University of Rochester and he has
interest in Star Trek so anybody has any
questions on Star Trek you can actually
write it down for the session later and
you can ask him to answer those I
request dr. crusher to come and deliver
his
you
so I love videos like that because it's
just a great way of showing off just a
tiny fraction of the things that are
going on within Microsoft Research the
you know it's funny as video was saying
just a minute ago I i came to Microsoft
in 1991 to start microsoft research
before that I've been a professor at
Carnegie Mellon University and when you
have the opportunity to start something
from ground zero start a new research
lab and then grow it the way Microsoft
Research has grown it's really quite a
privilege and it's a lot of fun for me
to come to work every day and see the
efforts of all the researchers that we
have but to be honest truth is when I
started microsoft research in 1991 and I
was employee number one I never imagined
speaking in front of an audience this
large about the research that my group
was going to be doing this is in fact
the largest audience we've ever had
protect vista in in india and its really
really excited
now when I when I came to Microsoft
Research I had a vision of what I wanted
to do what I wanted to accomplish and
this slide embodies that vision it's the
mission statement for microsoft research
and we have the privilege of having had
the exact same mission statement now for
more than twenty one years and certainly
in the corporate world that's very
unusual and in fact it's actually
unusual for someone to have my job for
as long as I've had so you're being at
Microsoft and running microsoft research
for such a long time I'm the Microsoft
executive that's been doing the same job
for the longest time and it's allowed me
to be able to to have the level of
consistency that we've had within
Microsoft Research now when i came to at
microsoft i had three things in my mind
first and foremost our number-one
mission goal has always been to move
forward to state-of-the-art in the areas
that we do research our goal is to be at
the forefront of whatever we're trying
to do now what's interesting about that
goal is that nothing about that that
first part of the mission statement of
expanding this state-of-the-art nothing
about that has anything to do with
Microsoft does it say Microsoft on there
at all what it says is that if we enter
a research Harriet if we if we're doing
work in a research area now we want to
push the state of the art we want to be
the best that we can possibly be and the
best in the world and the reason that
that we have that goal is because if we
don't do that ultimately we're really
not as much value to a company like
Microsoft we need to be creating new
technologies and moving forward that
state of the art now when we have great
ideas when things work you know then the
second part of our mission statement
comes up and that is we work really hard
to get our ideas into use into practice
which it Microsoft means getting it into
our products
so that that literally a billion people
around the world can use them so that's
the second part ultimately both of those
lead to the third part of our mission
statement which is really about the
future it's about making sure that
Microsoft has a future that our products
have a future in really that the field
of computer science has a future and
while you may say to yourself gosh you
know it's you know Microsoft such a big
company of course it's going to have a
future almost none of the companies that
that were Microsoft competitors in 1991
when I first joined Microsoft almost
none of those companies are still around
the world of technology is constantly
changing we need to constantly innovate
we need to adopt and if we don't do that
will disappear and if the field of
computer science doesn't keep doing that
and if we as a field don't keep creating
new things and creating new value and
changing the world then the field will
if not disappear it'll certainly
stagnate and become much less relevant
so that's really those those three
things say a lot about what we've been
trying to do for the last 21 years now a
similar slide on and on put a similar
slide up to talk about how microsoft
research has grown today we have over
850 PhD researchers in our research labs
worldwide to put that in some
perspective that's more PhDs than brown
university house we have more members of
the national academy of engineering and
science in the american academy of arts
and sciences that most universities do
in the united states we published more
basic research in computer science than
any other organization in the world so
we are the number one creator of basic
research in the entire field of computer
science so in this 21 years a lot has
happened and there's been a lot of
growth
now one of the things that I'm often
asked is why so why did Microsoft decide
21 years ago to invest in basic research
when basic you know when frankly most
most companies chose not to very few
companies these days make the kind of
investment in basic research that
Microsoft does so why does Microsoft do
it why do we spend so much money why is
it the case that one percent of our
entire workforce is basic researchers
doing fundamental computer science
research well there are a lot of reasons
you can give I've got some reasons that
are up here I mean these are often the
things that people talk about when they
say basic research you know one of the
things that people will often say is oh
you do basic research so that you can
create new technologies intellectual
property you're a source of intellectual
property and certainly a well-run
fundamental basic research group does
exactly that you know we do create new
technologies you've seen some of the
video is already I'll talk a little bit
more about some of the things we're
doing in a minute but we absolutely do
that but I would argue that the reason
you invest in basic research is not that
if you if you do great basic research
you will get new technologies as a
byproduct of doing your work but that's
not the reason to do it you could say oh
I know you invest in basic research so
that you can do problem solving you have
all these really smart people you give
them problems and they'll solve them for
you well there's certainly truth to that
I mean we do solve problems I love
solving problems when you come to me
with a product group comes to me and
they they have an interesting problem to
solve that's really exciting
our researchers are trained to solve
problems were really good at it and they
love doing it but again I think that's a
byproduct of having a great research
group it's not the reason the you that
you start a research organization it's
it's it's a value you get back from
having it another thing people say is oh
you're an early warning system and we're
certainly an early warning system may we
often see the technologies in our
research labs and in the research labs
of our colleagues that will be the
technologies of the future and it's
important for us to to give that
information to our product group
colleagues but again these are all
byproducts of doing a basic research lab
they're not really the fundamental
reason you do it the reason I think that
you you invest in basic research whether
you're a country or company or a society
is this it's agility it's it's survival
benefit wish who's one of the the key
leaders in the united states after world
war two that helped to create the
National Science Foundation he wrote a
great paper on this and he he talked
about why it was important for the
united states after world war two to
invest in basic research and in what he
said was that you know America the world
had just come through a great war and
scientists and engineers researchers had
created the technologies that had a huge
impact in winning that war and he looked
and he said we need to make the
investments in the future so that if
there's another war or if there's a
disease or if there is a famine that we
will have the the treasure chest of
ideas technologies and most importantly
people that will let us as a society
adapt and change and survive and I think
that's why you invest in basic research
it's for survival a company like
Microsoft invest because let's say
there's a new competitor or new
technology or a change in the business
climate we as a company need to be able
to rapidly change and Microsoft Research
creates for Microsoft that treasure
chest of ideas and technologies and
people that can lead microsoft microsoft
through change so i think that's why you
make those kinds of investments and
again as I said almost none of the
companies that were Microsoft's
competitors in 1991 exists today those
companies did not invest in basic
research Microsoft did and we're still
here let me give you a historical
example that can sort of convey the
sense of of what how a research idea can
change a company it can change the
company's future and I'll take an
example from Microsoft Research in the
very early days so in the very early
days of Microsoft Research you know one
of our researchers actually with small
group came up with this idea to reduce
the working set size of 32-bit programs
so a working set is basically the amount
of memory a program takes at when it
runs and our researchers came up with a
really a lot of mathematics that that
proved that you could reduce the amount
of memory a program took by about a
factor of two now we went to our product
groups and we were really proud of
ourselves you know and we went to our
product groups and we said this is a
really great idea this is a great
technology
you know and we explained it to them and
just about every meeting we had God was
at all those meetings back in back in
those days just about every meeting we
had those product people looked at us
and they said at the end of the meeting
you guys are really smart I mean we
don't even understand all that now right
you guys are just really smart but but
we don't actually have this problem you
know first off it's 1992 we only have 16
bit programs right this is back in the
old days and we know we're going to have
32-bit program someday but we figured
there's memory sizes are going to be
growing really fast and we'll be able to
use that up well the problem was that
because of some you know political
economic trade issues back in those days
that period from about nineteen ninety
three to nineteen ninety-five memory
sizes for computers did not increase and
what happened was then Microsoft in 1995
was bringing out its 32 bit operating
system which was windows 95 and his
32-bit versions of office which is
office 95 and unfortunately they took up
twice as much space because they were 32
bit instead of 16 but the memory sizes
of the computers hadn't changed and so
that was a serious problem for the
company well luckily we in research had
this technology we were able to allow
the company to simultaneously ship those
products and our competitors didn't have
the technology so lotus and WordPerfect
the competitors Microsoft had at the
time they weren't able to ship their
32-bit products in the same time frame
is a huge economic value to Microsoft I
mean we made you know a few hundred
million more dollars that year and we
were a small company so that was a lot
of money for us but more importantly it
gave us a huge competitive advantage
during a period in which
the world was changing you were
switching from one kind of computing to
another so that's the kind of thing that
a research group could do a technology
that our product groups didn't even want
us working on became important to the
survival of the company and its
long-term future and things like that
happen all the time within Microsoft
we're always confronting new challenges
and we're always inventing new
technologies today if you look at
microsoft's products almost every
product has technology for microsoft
research or was built with technology
for Microsoft Research and I'm going to
specifically talk about a new technology
that I think is really exciting just to
give you an example of the things that
we do there's a technology in microsoft
office 2013 the most recent release of
microsoft office just coming out right
now call flash fill and the technologies
is is it's sort of a like magic you you
have a column in Excel and you have
another column and you let's say you
make some changes or some
transformations you give it a few
examples and it'll figure out the rest
of those examples for you and fill in
the rest of those college in a way
that's very magical you'll see it you'll
see that in just a minute that
technology which is coming out right now
is actually based on fundamental
research in automatic program generation
so the ability of computers to
automatically write software that's
always been a dream in the field of
computer science we're now able to do it
for small programs but nevertheless
programs that are real value and we're
using that technology in flash though
I'm going to run a video so you can see
more about it I'm cement Cavani from
Microsoft Research Redmond I'm going to
tell you about a new feature in Excel
2013 called flash fill which had its
origins in Microsoft Research suppose
you have a collection of Social Security
numbers that you see in the first column
and you want to format them by inserting
hyphens as you see in the second column
if you have hundreds and thousands of
these rolls then doing it manually would
do very cumbersome a more principled way
to do this would be to write an excel
macro but if you are a non programmer
like most Excel users then you would be
stuck but now you can use the flash fill
feature to automate this task by just
the press of control e which is a
shortcut for flash fill the flash will
feature builds over our program
synthesis technology that can generalize
examples into programs so this is the
opposite of program verification
methodology that is used to generate
test cases from programs to expose bugs
and those programs and this has seen
decades of research but now program
synthesis does the rivers it takes test
cases or examples and generates programs
that are consistent with those examples
in fact we generate a huge number of
such programs but we have efficient data
structures and algorithms to compute and
represent such programs then we use the
machine learning technology to rank
these programs we take the highest
ranked program and run it on all the
rows in the spreadsheet to give the user
the output that they desire now in
general it might not be possible to
learn the users intent from just one
example as would be shown by the second
scenario where I have a bunch of medical
billing codes some of which are missing
a right bracket at the end by some of
which have a right bracket suppose my
goal is to clean this data by adding a
right bracket wherever it is missing so
if I give one example then flash will
generalizes it into a simplest program
which is to add a right bracket
everywhere maybe this is what the user
wanted but otherwise the user would
observe that rose 62 row 10 are all
incorrect and the user can fix any one
of these flows so the moment I fix row
six then flash fuel is able to fix other
similar roles accordingly flash will can
also be used to perform complicated
extraction tasks so consider this
worksheet that is lot of customer data
in the first column so suppose my goal
is to extract the constituent elements
all that I have to do is to give an
example in each column and hit control e
flash fill can also synthesized programs
that have limited form of conditions
and loops as is illustrated by this
scenario where I want to generate an
abbreviation if you want to learn more
about this technology then you can look
at our CS CMD search highlights paper
you can also use this feature yourself
in excel 2013 so flash feels really a
great example of how very fundamental
work in core computer science research
is able to create in this case a
wonderful new feature in one of our
products that's like magic that people
are very very excited about when they
use it now the field of computer science
is changing faster now than then
certainly at any time in my career and
I've been around a long time so this is
this should be exciting for you because
so much is happening I mean one of the
things that's going on now one of the
the changes in in computer science is is
referred to by the term big data it's
the fact that now we have the ability to
process really astronomical amounts of
information we have enormous data
centers Microsoft has incredibly large
data centers hundreds of thousands of
machines we can process petabytes of
information and do analysis and learn
from that that information this is
what's called big data suddenly were
able to collect data about the world
about ourselves scientific data and
process it in ways that we were never
able to do before I'm going to show you
a project at our research group in in
Cambridge England called fetch climate
that really leverages this idea of big
data what fetch climate does is it
collects environmental data from many
different separate data sources around
the world
brings it into the cloud brings it into
our windows azure environment and then
makes it available for scientists and
ordinary people to get access to and to
analyze let me show you the video hi I'm
drew Purvis I'm a researcher at
Microsoft Research Cambridge I'm in the
computational ecology and environmental
science group the mission of that group
is to carry out computational science
that should let humanity manage natural
resources better as part of that
research mission we develop new software
tools predictive models in geographical
information services that should allow
people to carry out that kind of
cutting-edge research more widely today
I'd like to show you fetch climate which
is an easy fast way for anyone to
extract complex information about the
climate either just with a few lines of
code in a program or even just through a
browser so here's our browser running
fetch climate i'm in redmond it
microsoft headquarters so i'm going to
zoom in on the area around redmond and i
can just really easily draw a square
here to populate a grid and hit fetch
what's happening is this a silverlight
application which is communicating with
an agile service that service is looking
over a large number of large data sets
and it's using the best date of to
answer the query it's then doing a whole
bunch of complex mathematical
calculations and sending the result back
to our application running in the
browser the answer of that query is now
being visualized on top of being maps by
a dynamic data display which is another
prototype tool that comes from our group
because in that interactivity we hover
the mouse over here we can see for
instance that the average temperature in
this place is about 2.8 degrees we can
download data so we just hit download we
get a choice of formats and we can see
all the information that we would need
from that query it's got different times
as well so we can do a query for a
fraction of the year or even a fraction
of the day and then we have the air
temperature data itself we have the
provenance so the data source that was
used to supply this information and we
even have an estimate of uncertainty
that uncertainty is something that the
experts find really hard to assign to
data that was a research project in its
own right and yet that's always supplied
every time with a fetch climate query
now we can for the browser version we
can run multiple
piece of fetch climate at once and so
I'm going to show you a couple of
examples of fetches that I did earlier
so here's one of wind speed over the
eastern US that's the kind of thing that
you might want to look at if you're a
energy company or the government
planning wind farms and in this fetch
and put a string of locations across
Africa and for each of those locations
I've extracted 60 years worth of
rainfall data and we can just hover over
one of those points and see what's
happening to rainfall and unfortunately
this looks pretty worrying because it
looks like there's been a steady decline
in rainfall over the past 60 years it's
the kind of thing we probably all seen
in the headlines recently African
droughts and so on so thanks to fetch
climate anyone can get that kind of
information really easily it's live it's
ready go and find it have a go and
please tell us what you think so again
your veg climate is really a great
example of how now with with our ability
to process big data you know we can make
information available to everyone if you
want to use flesh climate you know go
out to microsoft search engine being
type in fetch climate and you can get to
this website and do your own analysis of
your own area see how the precipitation
is changed over the last hundred years
see how the climates change and
understand what's going on now another
area of a very rapid change right now in
the field computer science is is in the
way we think of computers interacting
with us and with the rest of the world
increasingly we are giving our computers
the same senses that we have they can
they can hear they can't see if you use
Microsoft Kinect on an xbox you're using
a real-time 3d computer vision system
they know where they are they have a GPS
they have sense of movement
accelerometers they have a sense of
touch you can play with it your your
display so we're giving computers the
same kinds of access that we do and it's
changing the relationship between what
historically was the virtual world of
the computer and the real world
we live in and it's giving us new ways
of interacting with our computers often
referred to as natural user interfaces
but it's also giving computers new ways
of doing things so for example if you
come to our research lab in redmond we
have a computer vision and machine
learning system that monitors people
walking up to our elevators as you walk
up to the elevator it can figure out
that you're going to take the elevator
and it brings the elevator down for you
and opens the door for you so that the
time you get to the elevator the door is
open and ready for you it's it's just
like magic it's very funny you get used
to a system like that very very easily a
few days ago before I came on this trip
we the system was turned off and someone
walked I saw somebody walk up to the
elevator and they just stood there and
they didn't even think about pushing the
button because they they hadn't done the
head and pushed the button in a long
time I mean just like Star Trek the door
is just open when you need them to open
so that's the way the world is changing
i want to show you another video that
talks a little bit about the new kinds
of capabilities that we're giving to our
computers to be able to understand us in
monitor what we're doing digits is a
wrist-worn 3d hand tracker for gestural
interactions on the move the wrist-worn
sensor allows the full 3d pose of the
user's hand to be recovered in real time
while removing the need for wearing a
data glove that covers the entire hand
the recovered hand pose can easily be
used to recognize diverse gestures even
while on the move our system can be used
in a variety of scenarios including 3d
gaming and augmented reality where both
discrete or continuous hand gestures can
be used to control input as the device
is wrist-worn no line of sight to an
external sensor placed in the
environment is required the user can
perform subtle gestures while resting
their hands on their
leg or table digits this built using
only off-the-shelf hardware the main
components are a wrist-worn infrared
camera infrared laser line generator
additional diffuse infrared illumination
and an inertial measurement unit one
interesting interaction possibility
digits enables is 3d spatial interaction
around a mobile device that is seemingly
interweaved with traditional touch
interaction here the user starts
semantic zooming using an in-air pinch
gesture and continuously controls the
zoom factor with the remaining fingers
another gesture is used for panning the
interface or manipulating an object once
it has been selected through touch
another interesting design space four
digits is eyes-free interactions where
no visual feedback was required to
control a mobile device in this example
the user controls functions of a mobile
device while the device is left in the
pocket here the user turns on the radio
switches channels by mimicking or
turning of a different
changes the volume by moving an
invisible slider up and down and finally
answers a call by doing a thumb up
gesture digits can also be used for
fine-grained 3d interactions for example
as a wearable gaming controller in this
example the user mimics a gun with their
fingers to shoot targets and navigates
within the virtual environment by
performing a grabbing motion and moving
the arm and also selecting objects using
hand gestures we have presented digits a
wrist-worn sensor that recovers the full
3d toes of the user's hand in real time
while removing the need to cover the
entire hand of the user thank you so
again I think what's really exciting now
is to see all the new applications and
the new ways you can think about using
computers now that they can see us they
could hear us they can sense where they
are and they know a lot about what we
are and what we're trying to do now
another area that that Microsoft
Research works in isn't just me so in
some sense I said before our goal is to
move this day they are forward we're
trying to make sure that the field of
computer science stays vibrant stays
active constantly generating new
technologies but but microsoft itself
will never do all the work that needs to
be done in the field and so we want to
work with academics and from the
beginning of microsoft research now
we've always had a vibrant program of
working and collaborating with the
academic community microsoft research
runs the largest PhD internship program
in the world over a thousand PhD interns
will work at one of microsoft research
labs at some time you know over the
course of a year to put that in
perspective I think that means we have
or PhD student hours than almost any
university in the world working when our
with our labs I think that then makes us
the largest academic institution as well
as the biggest publisher of basic
research but we also support basic
research at universities we fund basic
research we support faculty we support
students so those have always been a key
component we also believe strongly in
education and in finding ways of making
education better and more effective
because we think that's the way we're
going to get the next generation of
scientists the next generation of
mathematicians and engineers I'm going
to show you a video of some work that
we're doing trying to find ways of
making online education better and more
effective and this is some work that's
being done in Microsoft Research india
i'm going to show you a quick demo of an
exciting new project we're working on at
Microsoft Research India called vid wiki
vid wiki is an online platform to
leverage crowdsourcing to annotate
videos for legibility and clarity as
well as translating on-screen text by
adding layers to a video users can
improve edit or translate videos without
having to create their own videos
releasing the burden on authors to
update content or make videos in
multiple languages as an example here is
a comic Adam e video playing on the
platform with annotations appearing over
the handwritten text which is much
easier to read
if I toggle the annotations off and then
on again you can see the change in
quality using auto translation tools
like Bing Translator supported by
crowdsourcing to tweak translations you
can view this same video and other
languages as an example here is the same
video playing with Hindi annotations the
real power of the platform is the
ability for members of the crowd to
create their own annotations here is a
video that has not been fully annotated
so I'll help out by creating an
annotation in the edit mode there is a
list of annotations here on the left
along with timing information there's a
list of tools at the top along with some
annotation properties on the right so
let's add an annotation here I'll use
the text box tool to add some text I'll
first go to the time in the video that i
want to add the annotation then i'll
draw the text box on the panel and type
in the content I want to see using the
properties I can change the text color
and size to match the on-screen palette
finally I'll move the annotation into
place now if I play the video my
annotation comes up over the handwritten
text i have several other tools i can
use such as shapes to emphasize parts of
the frame i can also add equations
written in latex and render them on the
screen adding such equations is
especially useful in science or math
lectures where symbols and subscripts
can be hard to read in handwriting to
add new content I can draw in an image
using its URL on the screen here i'll
add a graph of the historical exchange
rates between dollar and one and then I
can use the free draw tool to highlight
certain parts of the graph once I'm
happy with my additions I'll publish so
others can benefit from my annotations
and I'll indicate how complete I've made
the video so that's been a quick
overview of vid wiki our project at
Microsoft Research India to leverage
viewers of online videos to improve
their quality
make them more accessible across
languages thanks for watching
so in my in my job at Microsoft in the
work that I do at Microsoft Research you
know they're there really are times when
when I get that I get to feel like a
magician or a sorcerer I can do things
that that that really changed people and
amaze them I was in China in October
giving a speech much like this one to a
group of to a group of students about
2,000 students at 10gen University and
there I was able to demonstrate a system
where as I was speaking my words were
being translated and spoken in my own
voice in Chinese things like that
experiences like that you know are
really why we do basic research we're
trying to change the world we're trying
to wake the world a better place and I
think computer scientists and
researchers have an opportunity to do
that that is really unique whether it's
in creating new ways of thinking about
personalized medicine personalized
education or in changing the way humans
interact and solving some of the
problems that we have in communicating
with each other I want to thank you very
much for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
