recent advances in wearable ha
resolution head-mounted displays hmds
have opened the possibility for truly
immersive virtual reality
however for a truly immersive VR
experience three properties are
essential quality responsiveness and
mobility no solutions today provide all
three properties in this work we present
irides a stereo hmd system that
simultaneously attains quality
responsiveness and mobility hideous
achieves this by offloading rendering
work to a high-end GPU in the cloud in
this model that hmd is the thin client
and only requires a wireless network
connection yet receives high quality
moreover power-hungry GPU rendering is
not needed on the hmd mitigating
concerns of thermal radiation near the
eyes
however network latency has an acute
effect on responsiveness with naive
offloading the motion to photon delay
must include the additional overhead of
network latency a round trip over the
Internet can exceed 60 milliseconds and
may surpass 100 milliseconds
unfortunately at just 30 milliseconds
users easily feel lag discomfort and
even motion sickness
you
to overcome internet latency and deliver
sponsored pneus iridium ploy speculative
execution on the server and compensates
for miss speculation on the client
the basic principle is to use
statistical inference to speculatively
generate possible output frames and
transmit them to the client a four round
trip ahead of the clients actual
corresponding head movement
if the speculation is wrong the client
applies a simple warp on the speculative
frame to obtain a result that is a close
approximation to the ground truth the
server can undo wrong speculations in
real time
a key is that the client
network wait time between head movement
and receiving a corresponding frame that
is ready to show
