and now please welcome Sarah Simmons of
citygrid my name is sarah simmons and
i'm the founder of city grit which is a
culinary salon and aletta and many
people ask what a culinary salon is it's
a term that we made up to describe what
we're doing because I have a restaurant
that doesn't operate like a typical
restaurant we we host dining events and
food culture events and I cook half at
the time and the rest of the time we
bring in Chester all over the country
really with a focus on bringing in the
next wave of up-and-coming chefs so the
rule is if you're super famous that you
can't look at City grit unless you bring
two chefs with you that no one's heard
of or that isn't well known because we
really want that model of the opening
acts for the headliner because getting
exposure to New York diners and New York
food media can change the game for you
and you guys being a chef is a really
hard life I've realized this and so
anything that we can do to help these
amazing up-and-coming chefs get a leg up
is um we've done our job giving back so
a little bit about me I am a product of
having been given a leg up and so that's
why it's so important for me to try to
do the same for others I was a retail
strategist started off my career as a
trend spotter in the tech world after
the first calm fall out i thought to
myself i need to have a more solid job
I'm going to assign myself to something
that has a revenue number attached to it
and I'm going to be in retail and so I
worked for a number of retailers as a
consultant and then went out to work for
Pokemon to run the retail division
outside of Japan for a couple years um I
got to travel a lot eating a lot of
amazing places and I didn't get to see
my friends so every other weekend I
would invite
my friends over to my house and make
dishes that had either inspired by
dishes that I'd had on the road and so
it started to become a thing you know 10
friends would come and then two weeks
later eight of those people would come
and they would someone would bring
another person and then they would
become a friend and then so it became
more of a supper club and it was good
fortune that food &amp;amp; wine magazine was
having a contest looking for the
nation's best home cook and a lot of my
friends are super bloggers and early
adopters and said flickr account stacked
full of pictures of food that I've made
so it was really easy to submit a lot of
content and get the support of my
friends to talk about my food and my
passion for cooking on the food &amp;amp; wine'
community so as a result I was named to
the nation's best home cook and it
opened a ton of doors for me and so I
was sent on this amazing trip with five
of the world's best chefs Eric repair
and Grant Achatz and Jose Andres and I
was taking six months off to do research
on a book that I was writing about the
future of retail and these chefs when we
were talk about it would say you talked
about retail and it seems like you like
it but you should be doing something in
food because that's what you love and so
I thought okay I'll do something in food
so it took me a good year to figure out
what that something was going to be and
really city grid is the product of that
year it was traveling around the country
meeting with a bunch of chefs every chef
that I met that didn't live in New York
would say oh my god I want to cook in
New York one day but the options are
really limited it's either cooking at
the james beard house which is
invitation only or friends that has a
restaurant has to shut their kitchen
down for the ninth which is really
disruptive to the flow of the restaurant
and so I thought selfishly I want a
restaurant where I don't have to cook
the same food every day and I don't have
to cook every day so I'm going to cook
most of the nights and then two or three
times bringing guest chefs and really
that's where the concept of City grip
was born and now it's turned out that
it's
it's more than just the guest chef
program but it's less about me and my
food and more about really bringing
attention to these up-and-coming chefs
it's a little bit about citygrid as a
whole we have five revenue streams and
the beginning eyes i started citygrid
with only 25 thousand dollars of outside
money because I'd never run a restaurant
and I barely worked in a restaurant I
begged Michael Anthony Gramercy Tavern
to let me work for free in his kitchen
just so I could see and learn and who's
going to give me money I wouldn't give
me money and I met with someone and they
said you just have so many what-ifs not
only do you not have this experience you
no one's done this so there's no model
to to replicate and so I said I'm going
to put my money where my mouth is and
I'm going to just see what this first
year brings and it was hard i mean the
$25,000 was gone in the first four weeks
because we were open but no one knew we
existed and we really leaned on our
friends and digital channels and got our
friends to advocate for us and spread
the word through twitter and facebook
and we forward our newsletter to every
person you know and it worked if people
started coming but it still was slower
than then we thought like the getting of
the business off the ground so we had to
rely on other things so the core of the
business is my dinners which here's an
example of something that I cooked this
week actually my friend Francis Lam as a
food writer and he's his good great
storyteller and he did some work post
Katrina and Biloxi and he met these
amazing people that are really the core
of food and Biloxi and so he came and he
had collected oral histories from them
and he came to talk about these people
and when I think Biloxi I think
african-americans and caucasians and
everyone he talked about was there ravit
nummies and French in Croatian they have
these amazing stories about how they got
there and what they were doing and so
with each story he told I created a dish
that was inspired by one of these two
raise and then here you see an example
this is Ford fry he he's a really
special chef he his restaurant that he
opened last year was named the best
restaurant in America by Esquire and he
is opening a restaurant in the spring
called duke and king that our King a
Duke that is bringing cooking back to
colonial times I think is interesting
compared to what you were saying is that
he's built this 24-foot wood-burning
oven in the center of the restaurant
where every single thing is cooked from
it so the meats are roasting and then
they're dripping on top of the
vegetables for flavor and and it's just
something that everyone's trying to
create foams and you know hydrocolloids
and like this is like going back to what
is ancient form of cooking so he's
coming to do a preview of his menu but
in the beginning before we got the guest
chef program off the ground and before
people knew who we were and what we were
doing we had to find another way to
bring in revenue and so what was great
about it is that we found i was using
private dining to subsidize the lack of
income coming in from the guest chef
program and for my dinners and i
realized that there was a huge demand in
new york city for a private dining space
from 25 people to 40 people and so we
just really tapped into our friends
online and our tech friends that you
know through private dinners or had
lawyers at through private dinners and
we started to book these dinners which
now is a core part of our business and
subsidizes some of these programs that
enable us to offer the top-of-the-line
food for half the price that you would
pay at a normal restaurant for it so
we're serving the best ingredients and
from some of the best chefs in the world
and you're not paying its on 150 352 and
fifty dollar tasting menu something that
I didn't realize until it happened last
year we opened in September and in
December I didn't realize that no one
was going to come eat at city grid no
one's going to come dude these weird
dinners and or
come to a guest chef dinner because the
holiday parties there was too many
there's too much competition and so we
almost went out of business before we
had really even gotten off the ground
and so I for four days I cooked
everything I knew to cook that someone
would eat or by during the holidays and
we turned our dining space into a store
and we just sold so much stuff like
literally people were buying chex mix
like I mean in my head I was like that
is you're paying like ten dollars for
four ounces of cereal but they were
paying for it and they were excited
about it and they were putting baskets
together and we made enough money to get
us into January when we really were
rolling out the guest chef program for
the second version of it and then this
year so I knew to plan ahead we did
twelve-thousand dollars in gift basket
sales Food Network used it as their
corporate basket we were able we donated
five dollars from each basket to the Red
Hook initiative and every part
everything we got from catering as well
we had ten percent of that donated to
the Red Hook initiatives to it it was a
really the experience that I'd had in
December that almost crushed me that was
really painful previous year was enabled
me to really make smarter decisions this
year um and then we have a strong
catering program a catering is so not
glamorous but it also is very profitable
and and just enables us again to do more
creative things that are more accessible
to a bunch of people so how have we done
this I think a lot of it has been
through our friends and Twitter and the
media we've gotten a lot of great press
this is something I'm really proud of
because a lot of amazing chefs and food
writers have been and they're now
customers and they're writing about us
and supporting us and post-sandy we
again almost closed we made our first
profit in October and then lost thirty
four thousand dollars because of what I
now call that whore sandy and so I I
thought like I'm tired I don't think I
can do this and so but we did it we we
survived we've recouped
twenty-six thousand of that thirty four
thousand dollars that we lost in five
weeks which we think I mean I think it's
pretty huge but it was something bigger
that made me it gave me the energy to
recoup this loss it was one of my
friends said if you can't quit you have
all of these chefs that are coming in
January and there's people that are out
of kitchens for months so you need to
help them like your platform is it's a
great place to help them and so it gave
me a bigger reason than myself to kind
of buck up and start really hitting the
pavement and so now we have chefs that
are coming in that are using the kitchen
to make products that the other kitchens
were destroyed in Red Hook and we've
raised over thirty thousand dollars for
the mayor's fund for Sandy relief and by
the end of the year our goal was to
raise at least a hundred thousand
dollars and we're giving these chefs
that are like I have a friend who has
needs a popsicle machine and they're
twelve thousand dollars and she lost
three of them so she's doing a dinner
and she's keeping the profit so we're
really I'm really proud of those things
that we're doing other things that I
think are exciting is that we opened a
restaurant that you can't count on for
that chicken dish or that pasta the menu
has never been the same I've never
served the same dishes we have chefs
that no one's heard of coming in so what
we were pleasantly surprised at is that
we have so many people that are coming
back we have forty percent of our guests
have been twice twenty percent three or
more times we have I think it's 19 or 20
guests that have been more than five
times and a handful of people this one
girl comes alone because her friends
don't like food and she's been over 20
times
perfect i don't know they just don't
they're not willing to pay for to sit
and eat things that they don't choose I
mean I think that's the risk is that
we're certain you don't get a choice
you're coming it's five courses six
courses you don't get to choose what you
eat the newsletter so having been giving
digital marketing strategy advice to a
lot of retailers I always harped on the
newsletter being important because
statistically it showed that but really
thought to myself I mean I delete like
30 things every single morning that are
in my inbox that I never read so I think
that that is something that was exciting
that it's not just that people read it
but when the copy isn't good enough they
write us and tell us about it and so
people aren't just in it for the food
they're in it for some sort of
entertainment um so anyway I've I'm just
really excited I hope that you guys can
come visit us and i think that's it they
made questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
