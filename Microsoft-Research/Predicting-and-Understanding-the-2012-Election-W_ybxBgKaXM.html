hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
the cool talk series my name is your
bonnibel Krishnan I run the cool talk
series for MSR and these are set of
talks that we do regularly pretty
regularly or twice a month or so just to
reach out to everyone in the in
Microsoft the product groups in
particular the business groups and it's
mostly talking about technologies
interesting trends innovations coming
from MSR that we think have a broader
impact this of course has brought it
back to all of us so and it's very
interesting talk so David is new to
Microsoft came from yahoo research just
recently we have a whole new lab in New
York City that is a new Microsoft
Research Lab all housing about 15
researchers that's correct several of
whom are some economist some behavioral
psychologists and some machine machine
learning people yeah that's the sort of
expertise there and they're all applied
they've been were you know working for
various lengths at Yahoo David in
particular when they're only a year at
Yahoo and prior to that God is PhD from
the Wharton School Applied Economics so
with that I'll hand it over David take
it away thank you i thought well thank
you guys and thank you guys for coming
today it's it has been a pleasure being
at microsoft of course we only been here
for a few months but it's been working
on very nicely so there are entire labs
excited about it today's talk is talking
about forecasting in particular focusing
in on the 2012 election and the end but
really focusing on the idea of
forecasting for economics and related
topics as well as politics and I'll get
into in a second but when it comes to
elections this is big business upwards
of ten billion dollars are going to be
spent on the 2012 election cycle so this
is this is a very serious serious
industry and only that is that similar
techniques that are developed thinking
about economics and thinking about how
to gather information
for forecasting politics is coming into
political economy questions marketing
type questions economic indicators etc
pretty much anything which I'm talking
about upcoming election you could be
thinking about how much copies of halo
fours can be sold or how what kind of
jeans in be popular next year or whether
or not people are going to use the new
initiatives in Obamacare so any sort of
these types of questions in which
individuals are making some sort of
collective action the same sort of
forecasting techniques can be utilized
and the kind of scary thing about it
though is that the forecasting that is
used and used to bake really serious
investment decisions hasn't changed very
much since 1936 so in 1936 George Gallup
came up with the idea of randomly
polling a representative group of people
and using that as a basis for forecasts
of what's going to happen in election
and if you froze him after the 1936
election and thought him out today he
would be pretty comfortable with what is
being done to find data for a 10 billion
dollar industry but that's going to
change very quickly and it's going to
change in the next five to ten years and
I'm going to talk today about how a lot
of that innovations can be coming out of
out of our lab and other related labs in
Microsoft Research and how it's going to
impact not just politics but also
hopefully have some really neat
implications for Microsoft as well so
when you think about forecasting and you
think about forecasting elections the
first data point that comes to mind is
going to be these poles of voter
intention so if the election were held
today who would you vote for this is the
standard ubiquitous that's been around
since nineteen well it's been around to
the 1920s and perfected by George Gallup
and the third is but in addition to that
there's kind of four other groups where
I put data that you you do hear about
and sometimes you don't think about in
the same sort of way but kind of
fundamental data is all this stuff that
people talk about where they imply that
it has some sort of correlation with the
outcome but a lot of times they don't
really go into how or the exact
mechanism but
past election results incumbency
presidential approval ratings even for
Senate and House races and governor's
races economic indicators was the latest
job reports prediction markets for those
of you who aren't familiar with
prediction markets prediction markets
are actual real money markets where
people can buy and sell contracts which
pay off if a candidate wins and don't
pay off of candidate losses and they
become very strong indicators of the
probability of an event happening so if
it costs sixty cents for a contract that
pays one dollar if Barack Obama wins
which is essentially the case right now
that's a very closely aligned with about
a sixty percent probability from the
collective people in the market experts
they can say whatever they want and
social media so social media is just
started to be coming into its own
Twitter data facebook data search data
all sorts of real-time data and which
people are trying to think of how do
these correlate with outcomes of
different events and so I'm going to
focus first in this talk on the Vic uist
pull and I'm going to be talking about
how stuff that we've learned in research
about prediction markets is going to
help shape how the pole is going to
transform over the next few cycles so
this kind of outlines the key
differences between prediction markets
and polls I'm going to walk through this
but I want to keep something in mind too
is that research into polling which has
been fairly stagnant over the years is a
totally different track than research
into prediction markets and it's kind of
weird because essentially these are just
two different ways to engage individuals
gather information for them aggregated
together and then say something about
something say something about someone
coming back get a data point but yet no
one is really kind of work to kind of
bring the two together and think about
how they differ and how they have they
share similarities polling likes to
think about gathering a random sample of
a representative group of something so
in elections it's likely voters for
marketing it's going to be likely people
in the market for Xbox or for her jeans
or whatever you're talking about
prediction markets rely on a
self-selected group
people who have superior information to
join a market bid on contracts and
provide that information self-selecting
group questions prediction markets focus
in on asking the expectation of what's
going to happen they're asking people
about whether or not something is going
to hit or not whether someone's going to
win election whether or not sales
figures are going to cross a certain
threshold and polling focuses on the
intentions so the same thing in
marketing it is in politics will you buy
this product will you go see this movie
will you vote on this election who will
you vote for in this election
aggregation polls focus in on simple
obligation methods generally averaging
or some sort of weighted average based
on some prior demographics polls use the
sorry prediction markets proxy for how
much money you're willing to spend as
some sort of proxy for confidence so if
you're allowed to put more money into it
if you feel a confident you can bid up
in a prediction markets and finally
incentives polling is generally not
incentive controlled so the ascent is
may align for people to be telling the
truth they may not and there's a lot of
questions about that versus prediction
markets which are directly assigned to
have properly aligned incentive so that
you are supposed to be able to bid up to
about the probability that you feel that
something is when you place a purchase
order now I'm going to focus in though
first on this questions so polling they
focus in on attention questions
prediction markets focus in on
expectation questions is there something
we thought about here where you can kind
of go into polling and see maybe if
expectation questions make a difference
so when polling individuals in order to
forecast an upcoming election generally
you have this voter intention who would
you vote for if the election were held
today if the wording is pretty much
identical for any of the major news
sources that you see from Rasmussen to
gallop to to Fox News's polls to ABC's
polls and MSNBC it's all the same voter
expectation question
Oh direct education question would look
something like this who do you think
will win the election regardless if
you're going to vote for who do you
think snow in the election and the
reason that this interests us a lot is
is this idea that everyone has a pool of
information whether about an upcoming
event such as an election or whether or
not it's a marketing question so on
elections we know a lot of things we
know who we're going to vote for we know
who our friends and family are going to
vote for we've seen the news we know
what other people are talking about it
and when you ask someone their
intentions you're getting a small sliver
a very small sliver of that data right
you're getting just that individuals
intention over it expectations going to
respond with something about their
individual information as well as
information about their social network
as well as other centralized information
this is the key motivating factor behind
it and so in order to compare it we were
able to and this is work with a
co-author of mine Justin Wolfers who is
now who is at a warden school at
University of Pennsylvania we were able
to find a data set a collected data set
essentially a 345 times were the same
people at the same time were asked who
they're going to vote for an election
and who they were going to who they
thought was going to win typically in
state-by-state electoral votes that went
from 1952 until two thousand eight and
this is the the basis of the data 345
races 217 of the times they both had
greater than fifty percent both their
expectation and their intention pointed
towards the winner of the election 45
races are thirteen percent of the time
they both point it to the eventual loser
eighty two races are eighty three races
twenty-four percent the time one poll so
the same people at the same time more
than fifty percent of people intended to
vote for one candidate more than fifty
percent of people expect at the other
candidate to win and by the way just to
be clear we're talking here about the
major party candidates so we dropped
people who intended to vote for a third
party candidate and or expect
to vote for a 30 part expected a
third-party candidate to win in which
case no third-party candidates have one
so was as relevant three-quarters of the
time the expectation question points to
the eventual winner one-quarter the time
the intention question pointed to the
eventual winner and so just on the sake
of this kind of binary outcome it's
pretty clear that there's a lot of
information coming from this expectation
question but it's kind of head off some
like very obvious questions about this
first of all is that there are many
examples in here and many more examples
in life where there is no intention poll
kind of publicized before the election
so one of the first thing you're
thinking of is oh people can do
expectations well because they probably
saw the intention poll but a lot of
these states you're not really seeing
publicized intention polls before the
election second thing I've mentioned is
that we actually part of the research
which i'm not going to show today is
that we we gathered amount of about
several hundred actually of times where
this type of question was asked prior to
intention polls so prior to nineteen
thirty-six we gathered a data set from
eighteen eighty to nineteen thirty-two
in which people were asked who they
thought was going to win insert in
elections and show that it actually
provided a lot of information even prior
to the availability of any sort of poles
of voter intention but more importantly
I think for kind of this example I'm
thinking about major races where there
are in tension polls what we're able to
show here is that when both intention
polls and expectation polls are
available there's a time where intention
polls are very very poor let's say
there's a very small sample size or is
it a good sample selection expectation
polls dominate and provide just tons
more information in the in the most
advantageous position for intention
polls perfectly run large sample size
major polling companies etc etc
expectation polls still carry more
weight than the intention polls also we
have individual level data for these 345
races and we're able to show that
there's an extreme amount of
heterogeneity so if you think about it
if everyone just expected whoever they
voted 4-2 win then there'd be
the intention poland expectation polls
were the same if everyone was seeing the
same thing from the media then everyone
would expect the same thing regardless
of their intention what we see is a mass
amount of hedge annuity which shows
there's some middle ground this
information coming from the center the
coming from this kind of social network
data are coming from some other thing
besides Justin your intention and the
central signal and finally I think this
is most important for some raisins too
is that even if there's extremely well
publicized in tension pole which one
would you rather ask somebody if you
only asked one person and you ask them
their intention there's a close race
there's about fifty five percent chance
to maybe write a forty five percent
chance they may be wrong in that sense
but if you ask them to expectation
there's a much higher likelihood you're
gonna be right and this kind of carries
over this kind of basic idea carries
over through this idea of asking this
question so now of course this the
binary outcome is is nice but that's not
really what a lot of people care about
the end of the day what especially when
it comes to forecasting people think
about expected vote share so what I have
down here on the x-axis is the
proportion of people who intend to vote
Democratic so this is the polls that we
just talked about on the last slide
although I've dropped 2008 from here
because that becomes at a sample and so
this is 2 311 different elections this
have a portion of people who tend to
vote Democratic and the y-axis is the
actual vote share now this is what you
see a lot on the news is it kind of
naive implicit vote share and we're
going to see is that there definitely is
an upward slope here definitely the
higher the poll the more boats end up
getting but it's clearly not a one for
one ratio right so this naive vote share
is not that great and so we do some very
clean and transparent calculations where
we say that the poll essentially equals
the actual boat chair plus some sort of
house biased plus any sort of party or
incumbency bias plus some sort of time
bias most of this is actually a clear we
don't have much time variation they're
all taking about 30 days before the
election plus answer error term and
we're able to translate the raw polling
data into an expected vote share and
look something like this now the
interesting thing though is when you
look at expectations so in the
the x-axis is the proportion of people
who expect the Democrat to win and the
y-axis is the actual vote share it
doesn't doesn't look that that clean it
doesn't really show very much and this
is one of the reasons why people have
not been using this poll for very much
because if there's a ninety percent of
people expect to counted eight to win
what does that mean I mean it could be a
close race but everyone still knows that
the the outcome is going to be or could
be a very wide race and so implicitly it
doesn't doesn't look like expected vote
share and it doesn't look like
probability victory doesn't doesn't look
like much at all actually there's an
upward slope to it the higher the
expectation the more people expect a
candidate to win the more both end up
getting but clearly not one to one but
we do the same transformation and it's
in the exact same transformation we use
for intentions and this is what we get
and it may not be cleaning because you
didn't see the other one right next to
it so if you look at the two of them
right next to it being on the 45 degree
line means parody that means that the
the expected vote share coming from that
pole equals the outcome and you can see
just looking at these that the
expectation data translates into a much
cleaner looking for cast of the actual
vote share for the numbers people we can
just show that the two when you take the
expectation data which is the second
column and turn that into an inspector
vote share versus the first column which
is the intention data into that an
expected vote share you have a lower
root-mean-square lower mean absolute
error it's closer to the forecast the
forecast is closer to the answer more
often higher correlation incumbent singh
regression but this is the kind of thing
which which i like to focus on is this
last slide here this last number here is
that if we were to put a weight on which
forecast we would take you get tons of
significance and a lot of weight on the
expectation and you get a little bit and
no significance on the intention and to
be clear here what major polling
companies use is is one hundred percent
and zero right so even if you don't
totally buy it right here we have a very
very strong finding and which is
essentially one hundred percent in zero
in the other direction
so we wanted to think more about what
this means and how this could help us
beyond just this question and in many
ways we wanted to kind of interpret the
power of it as well so let me just give
you a quick interpretation imagine if
when people are asked their expectation
over what was going to happen election
they went out and they just pulled
random boaters on the street they just
pulled random voters in the street the
data is as powerful for expectation is
if they went out and they interviewed
ten random voters and then included
themselves in it so essentially if they
just gave us a binary answer you know
Democrat Republican based off of poll of
11 people which was them plus 10
additional people we don't think they're
actually doing that obviously but that
just kind of shows the power of asking
this question versus the other question
so this is massive multiplicative effect
it's like having a pool of ten times as
many people but not just ten times as
many people it also solves one of the
hardest questions in polling which is
what's the representative sample so when
polls report a margin of error when you
see Gallup has a margin of error of plus
or minus 2 or must minus 3 what they're
reporting to you is the random sample
error if they knew exactly what the
likely voter is we're going to look like
so they knew the demographic breakdown
an election day of who was going to show
up and then they went on and pulled a
thousand people that plus or minus three
percent plus my two percent that's the
random sample error based off the fact
they only interviewed a thousand verses
you know a million or everyone but it
misses this other major source of error
which is that they don't know who is
going to vote and they're having this
likely voter model which is a lot of
guessing work and that's why in the two
thousand eight election the day before
the election of the major polls that
came out and pretty much every major
polling company up pulls him out they
range from Obama up by 22 Obama up by 11
and it wasn't just from random sampling
error it a lot to do with this hard
problem of thinking about likely voters
but that's not what actually happened so
we want to figure out more about what
actually happens and as we said it is
this idea about you know there's there's
this we know that the people those
intentions involved we know there's
something about this localized
information they have and we know
there's something about the central
signal and so one of the things that
we're working on is we actually have a
bunch of stuff in the field actually
with Gallup of which I've been working
on priority getting here and then also
we're asking to be asking these
questions inside Microsoft's network
with Xbox and with some other platform
in which we're going to be asking people
about not just their expectation
intention but asking who their friends
and family are voting for who they think
that the media is saying is going to win
and trying to put all this together to
actually break down the information
we're getting because the question about
expectation is the question we had to
use because it's asked before as Donna
bomb stove said you go to war with what
you have not with what you want what we
want doesn't involve the central signal
because I'm the leading expert in the
world and what the central signal is so
I don't want people regurgitating to me
what they think the polls are saying
because I can do that with less noise
than they can I want to know what
they're providing me about their friends
and family I want to be a task a pole
and get that information and thinking
about the social network data that's
coming from it and that would be the
ideal and that's what we're
experimenting on this year let me see it
when show you a little bit in the field
this year so as I said we working with
gallops a galloping kind enough to be
asking these questions for us this was
taken in November during the Republican
primary and what you'll see that this
point Romney and Cain if you remember
him were in a dead heat but when we
asked them their expectations Romney
dominated later one month later you had
a Romney getting crushed by Cain game
was as are not gain Gingrich Gingrich
sorry it just kept on floating around so
I forget who was leading a different
points there's actually in the intention
poles there was about 15 different
leaders it was like one leader than
Romney another leader than Romney is
Swift back and forth the extra patient
pool even at the lowest point this will
be about the lowest point never waver so
every time we asked the expectation poll
that always said romney even when
it was being dominated in the intention
poll so there's clearly something that
people knew when they're coming into
these that was providing us meaningful
information and so what do we have right
now we have a mix of pulls up there so
if you look up at a real clear politics
or pollster which takes the latest polls
up there I think this was real clear
politics that pull this down two days
ago they had Obama up in four different
intention polls they had Romney up in
three and they did tie in to not all of
them had expectation polls but everyone
we found so far in this entire cycle has
Obama up a good example would be the
latest Washington Times poll in which
they have Romney up forty two point
eight percent 242 almost a tie in the
intention but they still have Obama up
big time and expectation so let's talk
about sample selection now so this is a
pretty interesting thing because the way
the polls are worked and this is in for
everything we spend a mass amount of
money in time thinking about this
representative sample and it's the basis
of all of this kind of polling has
always been to gather representative
samples random groups representative
samples but what were able to show with
the same sort of data is that I can take
the most bias on representative sample
possible just those people who said
they're going to vote Democratic or just
those people who say reboot Republican
and actually create a more accurate
forecast than the whole group and why is
this important declining landline
penetration on representative online
surveys difficult contacting working
families twenty thirty percent in some
demographic groups don't have landlines
anymore pew ran a survey recently has
showed that getting people on to
standard random digit dialing polling
which is the standard gold standard nine
percent is what people are averaging now
of how much you can gather they did a
kind of gold plated one where they got
up it's like the 20s by calling 35 times
or something crazy like that if you
could take non-representative samples
like Microsoft and other major
corporations handle louie ins and any
given day billions right of not
represented people who ping them for
different things and ask them simple
questions and you can make it work for
you then then you got something going
and another thing to think about is that
you know in contrast the polls and just
going back to prediction markets
prediction markets are dominated by
generally elderly or kind of people in
the 40s and 50s Oh overwhelmingly
wealthy and white and male this is a
very unrepresentative group and they've
done a very good job in predicting
outcomes of Elections just to be really
clear what we're doing in this standard
you take all the poll people who said
are going to vote Democratic people say
the Republican that's your voter
intention expectations let's take the
whole pole all the people involve the
whole sample expectations what we were
able to do here is by accounting for the
correlation between intentions and
expectations we're able to take roughly
half the sample size either just those
people who can vote democratic or just
those people but republican and able to
get a more accurate forecast of the
upcoming election so i'm not going to go
into the math because i'm not kind of
time here but this was really big
because this kind of showed us that we
don't need to do polling on fully
representative samples if we have some
historical data and if we have some
understanding about d biasing we can
actually make unrepresentative samples
work for us i'm going to go over this
real quickly because i'll be low on time
which i am aggregation methods and
incentives so what are we thinking about
here we're thinking about here is a
combination of gamification and a new
graphical interfaces and so this is what
we call the ball and buckets method
which we've been working on in which we
get lay people people with you know
non-experts and they fill up we ask them
a question we have them fill up the
different distributions between the
different ranges and actually they end
up creating a probability distribution
so we ask them in this case about
quantity of something there it announces
we have some say what where's the answer
likely to fall they push these up until
they distribute 100% likelihood across
these things and we've been to show the
people have been able to create really
amazingly good distributions normal
distributions uniform distributions
right to fusion lesser distributions
really able show their confidence and
their kind of full understanding where
the answer may be able to lie more
importantly we've been also developing
other things
are actually less cumbersome which are
just kind of fun games that people have
been playing in order to provide
information for us and what it's doing
is two things number one is that it's
allowing people to reveal their
confidence over their answer reveal
their confidence without being a
money-based thing without being up
having money as a proxy for it because
what we're showing is that confidence as
the standard deviation of their
probability distributions is highly
correlated to how accurate they have
been so we've had people play these
games like this the tighter their
standard deviation the tighter their
distribution the more accurate they've
been so we're going to use that to wait
for caste-based limit and second thing
we were able to show is that if we make
the games fun if we have people have
incentives beyond money we can actually
incentivize them properly to give us
meaningful and truthful answers without
having to make it a money-based game and
so in short when we're thinking about
polling and how we're going to help
transform it is that previously
basically everything's in based on this
random sample of representative we're
switching to the idea that we could use
random sample even self selected samples
of non-representative groups questions
we're trying to think of the
intersection between intentions
expectations and people's social network
rather than just relying on people's
intentions we're working on waiting by
revealed confidence and we're working on
making things incentive compatible by
gamifying things rather than thinking
about having to make sure everything is
money based and so redefining polling by
having polls meet prediction markets and
where's this kind of be useful moving
forward to is that obviously Microsoft
has massive amounts of engaged
non-representative users and so in this
election cycle we're going to be asking
some of these questions a lot of these
questions and pushing it forward with
experiments on the Xbox where people are
going to be have the opportunity to
answer polling as well on some other
platforms and the idea being that we
hope to be able to create very
meaningful forecasts predictions as well
as also some analysis on sentiment and
interest from these people coming from
this non representative group
furthermore will also running some
experiment
games which are running off of Microsoft
and right now these are not advanced
enough but we've been toying with them
in the idea of making even more advanced
prediction markets which we're excited
about can really utilize and really be a
lot of fun for people but I should also
put a caveat here on this question of
non-representative is that our user base
is not necessary representative of
likely voters but it is representative
of xbox users in this representative
Microsoft users and also it's also
somewhat representative a close to
representative of a lot of demographics
that are poor and a lot of people so the
ability to also do some really cool
market research some advertising
research and some other very useful and
very direct things is not lost on us by
the fact that we don't need a perfectly
representative but reasonably
representative stuff hit randomly or hit
even self selectively our ability to
start d biasing that data and thinking
well I'd rather just have this many more
hits and not be representative we can do
bicep properly we can actually answer
some really awesome questions and with
some massive scale so let me start
putting this into a little more context
so I'm going to kind of put things into
three categories here so what I just
talked about is kind of active Microsoft
ow this is data that we're going to
start collecting in different realms
with experimental polling experimental
games on the far left this is kind of
passive outside data that is generally
used in making predictions for for both
kind of marketing to have questions as
well as elections type questions and the
middle kind of only furthers passive
Microsoft data this is Microsoft data
that we have that we we don't actively
Cole for this use now the really
interesting thing is when you start
thinking about this in terms of election
forecasting a lot of stuff stops at this
kind of passive level right so you hear
a lot of people report the latest daily
poll but they don't kind of translate
down to expected vote share for you or
probability victory or something people
talk about the latest jobless numbers
and say this is important but they're
not there's ways to translate that into
what does it really mean like just a ten
percent take up in the unemployment what
does that do same thing with Twitter
everyone loves to report we're all
Twitter numbers you know there is this
many retweets of something what does
that mean like put down contacts is how
many tweets are normal right
and so the idea really of what this kind
of greater project this falls into is
taking all of this data this passive
outside data this passive Microsoft data
this act of data we're calling and
really work it into real time data
visualizations and tables in which
they'll be internal dashboards in which
people can utilize to learn about
different things as well as for external
market research type things and then
external facing charts and tables that
try to take all of this data into
aggregated together into very clean kind
of predictions of things social media
interests and things and sentiment
around things is that's kind of the the
overall kind of goals this is kind of
the second stage so before I was talking
about the first stage let's talk a
little bit about the second stage and so
when you think about this in terms of
forecasts the idea is to gather this
information and aggregated and I kind of
think about it in for kind of key things
a one is thinking about accuracy to is
thinking about timeliness three is
thinking about the relevancy of the
forecast and four is about the economic
efficiency and so what do I mean by
these things so let's think about
accuracy I'm going to talk a lot about
combining data and so what you see a lot
of is the people providing you
individual data streams but I don't
inherently care about Twitter I care
about what Twitter can forecast for me
or what it tells me about sentiment
about interests you know I don't
inherently care about gallops pulls
versus rasmussen spools right I care
about the forecast they're trying
projector doesn't make much sense the
fact that people don't think about this
and what the first type of thing is to
think about kind of within data type
aggregation so you get a benefit from
you know aggregating rasmussen spools
from Gatton galas poles and taking an
average it's pretty much always better
than grabbing one versus the other d
biasing it so with polling we know that
there are their biases whether or not is
from in polling there's something called
the anti-incumbency bias so incumbents
pull lower around Labor Day or a couple
months before the election than they
actually do in the outcome and these are
very simple things that you can do I us
combining different data streams
together combining prediction markets
and polls is their advantage
to it and then kind of D bias and whole
thing together and I'll give you more
examples so this is a data from 2008 and
so essentially what you're seeing here
in the blue line is all pulling for the
national election and I have aggregated
the different polling together by taking
assembly a linear trend on any given day
of the previous polls and then I did a
very simple d biasing method which is
very transparent and created a
probability of victory that's the blue
line and this is for the incumbent party
which was the Republican Party's this
was McCain and what you see is he floats
around forty percent pretty stable and
then Lehmann goes under and his
likelihood of winning the election just
crashes toward zero now what if I've
done the same method but I just taken
the daily polls any given day so rather
taking a trend of the previous all the
previous polls together I just took
whatever the latest poll that came out
was that's what the exact same thing
would look like and this is what you're
getting basically right when you turn
the evening news people are talking
about that latest poll about a bomb or
maybe there are two poles out today and
they averaged them together for you but
there's really no reason to believe that
the underlying value of this election
was bouncing around like that on a daily
basis it's pretty safe to say that it
looked a lot more like this blue line
and so this is what happens when you
just kind of do some basic within data
aggregation so they talk about
prediction market time so people like to
report prediction market prices and it's
been pretty clear with the research that
prediction market prices as far as raw
data goes are a really strong indication
of probability of victory but this says
polls from about two days ago we just
see on the top line there is Michigan so
this is a the top line in yellow is
essentially a contract that pays off
let's assume at a hundred should
obamacare e michigan it pays off 20 if
he loses voice to you there's a pretty
big difference here between the bid so
people are willing to pet spend 75 and
the ass people are willing to sell it
for 86 and then the last purchase was a
73
so it's not exactly obvious what the
price is and what the number to pull
from this is what we generally take is
something that is actually in order to
do this in real time is actually a
pretty long string of if and buts
conditions which comes out to something
roughly between the middle of the bid
and ask unless the spread gets too large
but then there's something else which is
a question of de biasing which is you'll
see main here at sitting at you know
somewhere around 97 or 96 that will
never go any higher because of
transaction costs and opportunity costs
no one's actually going to be at main
all the way up to 100 and we know this
and we see that systematically so we
have ways to kind of say let's do bias
what we call the favorite long shot bias
which is that really slow contracts tend
to move up slightly higher than they
should and really high contracts don't
go all the way to 100 this is from
another set of research which I've done
using kind of fundamental data so this
is created based off of past election
results pass election results and
combined with economic indicators and
company and other other things like that
and what you see is that pretty early
before the election you can actually
take all this data aggregate all these
different kind of data sources together
and create a pretty accurate forecast of
what the expected vote shares to be so
the x axis is the kind of forecasts that
I can create on june fifteenth of
electioneer the y axis account for the
actual outcome and what you see is it's
a pretty nice line but it does speak to
this question of when people just talk
about job numbers to talk about things
like this you know we spent a lot of
time thinking about how they actually
correlate in if you actually think about
you can actually break it down I can see
you know the trend in job numbers how
important that is how how much does
incumbency by you and that's why you
kind of want to create these models and
think about it more in this kind of full
ed biased form but that being said this
is taking that kind of fundamental data
adding it to prediction market data and
polling data and this is from against
the last few cycles both presidential
and senator races this is
the kind of main forecast model I use
this is how accurate it can be 103 days
before the election 103 days before the
election obviously today I hadn't picked
that number to randomly but so this is
the forecast that my model had created
for the last couple of election cycles
about 202 races so it's the last three
presidents the last three senatorial
psychos the last two presidential cycles
and you can get pretty darn accurate if
you start pulling all this data together
and this will just get more and more
accurate as the election approaches
because more and more informations added
to prediction markets or poles or
fundamental which are the main inputs
going into this model so now the
question of timeliness this has always
been something that just just bugged me
in the sense that academia and the press
tend to judge forecasts from us anything
this includes economic indicators
especially right before something comes
out when it's almost completely
meaningless so whether or not you can
forecast the jobless rate you know three
minutes before the jobless rate comes
out or generally they come out a day to
five days beforehand you can't make
major decisions based off that right
essentially you need that data coming
when you need it and the earlier you can
make these predictions the more valuable
it is to actually make investment
decisions and so I work on making sure
that all these forecasts are updated in
real time so they're as relevant when
you need it when you need it it actually
adds a massive layer of complexity that
we working with because of things like
prediction markets breaking down it can
get confusing when there's no bit and
asked in some prediction market how you
write the right code in order to make
all the stuff work and then second of
all the granular nature of creating
forecasts that update all the time makes
it so that you could do some really
awesome research about the effect of
different things so if i have a forecast
that literally moves in real time and
someone say analysis it's a surprise vp
candidate you can actually see how
quickly and and how precisely this moves
these forecasts move and that allows you
to study things that you can't study she
have a forecast that comes out once a
month or something and so the question
of relevancy to and so generally as you
know with elections the first thing that
people talk about is the raw poll
numbers this is raw data right and
hopefully to see if when I was talking
about today is that it's very easy to
make it into something much more
meaningful but yet what people generally
report is well data wrong number for
sweets wrong number on a pole the price
on a prediction market the jobless
number these stuff doesn't help most
people this is raw data then you cannot
to transform it into the most popular
thing is to some sort of estimation
about share but most people don't
actually care about estimation vote
share the reason that estimation of vote
share has been the kind of granddaddy of
forecasting for elections is because
it's the easiest forecast to make and
polls implicitly look like it but most
stakeholders don't care if Obama wins by
negative points if he lousy wins the
election and they don't care if he wins
by a thousand what they care about is
who wins and so probability victory is
actually what most stakeholders have
shown they care about but what very few
forecasts focus on and because it's a
little harder to make and a little
different but trying to think about this
thing's some of the things that we've
been thinking about a lot in trying to
make whatever we create whether or not
they're sentiment index or interest
index or predictions more relevant and
so finally kind of social media data and
I'm apologize if I didn't talk enough
about social media day today but the
bottom line is that there's a lot of
ongoing work on it but currently people
embarrass themselves frequently when
they talk about social media data in the
popular press and also in academia too
and the reason is because there's very
hard to calibrate social media data
without comes to this point because
social media data has changed so rapidly
and there's so few outcomes to correlate
them with and the bigger problem that
comes with this very very hard problem
of people taking this raw data and then
confusing it with many different types
of outcomes not being clear what they're
talking about they talked about how much
people are interested in something what
they think is going to happen or the
sentiment around it and a good example
would be Ron Paul which was getting a
lot of news during the primary was the
fact that Ron Paul is dominating social
media and so a lot of media people kind
of made ask themselves by talking about
maybe this is some sort of indication if
he's going to win well there's no
indication if he was going to win had
nothing to do with that it was some
indication of how much people on Twitter
which is a very small self-selected
group of people that we are able to
actually quantify which is even smaller
group of people you can actually pull
sentiment from happens like ron paul a
lot but people weren't putting that into
the proper context they also weren't
putting it was was this a question about
sentiment or was a question about
interest and all these types of things
are very difficult to do and these are
kind of things we're working on what
we're trying to do is pull out all the
social media data combined with other
rapidly moving data and putting into
proper contacts into kind of three main
buckets one is a prediction of what
things are going to happen to is an
interest index which kind of says
something about how big something is and
how long we believe that this offense
gonna last so if an issue pops up during
a debate can we put down to context of
earlier debates how big the Twitter
reaction was to it or the Facebook
reaction to us and how long we feel it's
going to last and then finally putting
it into a proper sentiment index which
shows things like pretty much every
candidate has massively negative
sentiment on Twitter so unless you put
that into the context you're not
applying anything meaningful so if I
take those first two steps then we're
going to try to bring into the next two
steps which is kind of info graphics and
stuff thinking about how do we get lay
people to understand this in a very
clean and meaningful manner and then
supply this Dale Steyn media and the
reason why we're interested in doing
that is to kind of build this feedback
loop and this feedback loop is that the
more we can talk about the really
meaningful and interesting data that's
coming from Microsoft the more we can
get people to supply us data and utilize
our systems but also the interesting one
is kind of the other inner back loop
which is that the more we can figure out
how people can understand things if I
can get people to understand a
probability distribution then I can get
them to supply be more interesting
information so the work we're going on
to create data visualizations that
people can understand that is the same
data visualizations that we turn around
into these graphical interfaces to get
people supply that information and so
let me talk about the 2012 election then
let's see here I know it's always tricky
to go live during a talk but so the
outcome of this is that
and these are currently sitting on my
personal blogs but they're going to
transfer over to Microsoft space at some
point very soon is that we're able to
turn around real time and what we
believe extremely accurate forecasts of
the election and so this table along
with accompanying map form is something
which is updated every two minutes or so
and it's updated with the latest
prediction market data and other data
that's coming in in real time and we
feel like this as I said very accurate
but also very meaningful that it comes
in when you need it and what you're
going to see from this list of the
Electoral College is that you can focus
in on this middle section here which is
the swing states so if you add up
everything above that point you're going
to give Romney 191 electoral votes and
everything so that's everything up to
Tennessee and everything Wisconsin or
below is 247 electoral votes for the
presidency now I'm extremely clear is
that these things are well calibrated so
when I say there's a seventy-seven
percent chance of covering Wisconsin I
do mean that there is a one in five
percent chance or almost a one in four
percent chance the president will lose
but and this is kind of tricky and this
is really interesting research whilst
doing as well the correlation is such
that if the president loses Wisconsin
most likely it's not the swing vote at
that point because most likely if he
loses Wisconsin he's lost a lot of other
states as well and it says something
kind of thinking about rather than think
about these independently your best
thing is to think about these almost as
a ranking method and where it's very
unlikely the states jump across too many
different states if the president
carries Alabama he's pretty much won the
country but the swing states point to a
really interesting thing which is that
the fundamental data as I said we looked
at this fundamental data that comes up
through mid-june or so and Romney's
should be winning by all accounts if you
look at just even uncommon see against
him but you look at the economic
conditions you look at some of these
other kind of wall data that comes in
that's not directly related to the
campaign but Romney is getting killed in
favorability ratings compared to the
so Romney's favorability is still
sitting around 43 where the president is
closer to 50 and the president has
extremely high presidential approval for
someone in the economic conditions and
once I translated into is an uphill
battle so if I kind of refocus on here
again as I said once you get up through
Tennessee that means that Romney is only
up to 191 right there he pretty much
needs to carry Florida which you know
has a pretty good shot at but he needs
to take Ohio in Virginia and then he
needs to take one of the following four
states so that means the president needs
to defend either Ohio or Virginia or
just these other states Iowa New
Hampshire Colorado Nevada which does
translate into what we have right now is
roughly sixty percent chance of the
president winning the election now and I
say one thing which I was just talking
to Jennifer in the audience about those
few seconds ago this doesn't it's kind
of scary because it does rather than
kind of adding things to watch it really
subtracts it into a kind of scare Lee
small small segment of the country the
Senate list though is a little as a
little interesting as well so the
Democrats currently have 53 seats which
they're controlling that includes two
seats which are attached and controlled
by independent Bernie Sanders who is a
socialist and so he is not in danger of
caucusing with Republicans and Lieberman
who is an independent but is retiring
and so if you take a look at this list
right now you have to put in mind though
despite the fact that the Democrats
control 53 seats right now they have 23
seats that are up for election
Republicans have just ten so the
Democrats need to think about it in
different way is that they're going into
the selection with 30 guaranteed seats
the Republicans despite being down are
going into the selection with 37
guaranteed seats so 33 seats are up for
grabs the Democrats have 30 already
right now and the Republicans have 37
and the really interesting thing is that
you just think binary right now so if
you think the Democrats captured
Virginia through Washington and the
Republicans capture Montana through
Mississippi and now
ignore mean for one second that
essentially gives the Republicans to
sorry the Democrats that puts at a 49
seats and the Republicans at 50 seats
main right now is highly likely to go to
an independent which I have sitting out
here because only one of them there you
go his name is al Gus is king and he
refuses to say who he's going to his
King sorry he fuses sake he's gonna
caucus with although he said he's going
to vote for the president so it's likely
hope caucus with the Democrats and then
of course there is a 50 first tiebreaker
which is the presidency and so you have
to slide that in there as I said about
sixty percent chance that the Democrats
control that tiebreaker and about a
forty percent chance Republicans control
that tiebreaker what this translates
into is simply as tight of race to
control the Senate is pretty much
possible essentially fifty-fifty with
races to watch not that surprising which
is Massachusetts in Virginia the two
races people have been talking about
Massachusetts which is incumbent Scott
Brown who upset and took Kennedy's old
seat after his death against Elizabeth
Warren who is the popular professor from
Harvard who was recently ran the
consumer finance board consumer finance
Protection Board and then Virginia which
has George Allen who lost to web in 2006
after his racial slur incident running
against the former governor Tim Kaine
both of these votes elections which are
essentially toss-ups so I think that
about covers the predictions so I ran a
little long but does anyone have any
questions
so the biasing that you're talking huh
wires to do the accurate requires a ton
of prior data that's crack-smoking yeah
otherwise it's like a magic variable
that's right and so which I didn't go
into too much so a lot of this requires
a mass amount of historical data which
is one of the major issues when it comes
to newer data social media data Twitter
etc Facebook but what we're looking at
with polling data of course is is a
tremendous amount of historical
information but then on the other end
you look at something like even
prediction markets and you only have a
few cycles of them so it is something
that's continuously updated with each
new cycle of information that comes in
which will make us more more accurate
but is something that requires
historical information yes yes
progression on those factors so some of
it is going to be kind of straight
linear type regressions for very simple
things a lot of things though on the
probability is looking at pro bits or
loads which are fairly straightforward
as well some of them do go a little
beyond that a lot of them have
polynomial terms or kind of fact oral
terms in order to show how essentially
the effects differ as you move away from
the middle so I won't give you an
example so when it comes to polling per
se there's this this idea called the
regression essentially polls which are
ten point leads turn into something like
three point or two point victories on
average but that kind of factor only
hits the very high lead ones it doesn't
hit the small lead one so there you have
a square term and some other things like
that to work on that mainly you think of
de biasing is looking at incumbency
party but then thinking about how does
it change over the days before the
election which is very key how does it
change based off of different election
types and then how does it change this
I'm saying when something is very close
or not very close I'm start working in
all those factors but especially the
days before the election is an
interesting one because they are you
thinking about combining you see
fundamental data does extremely strong
140 days out but essentially provides no
additional information
and 10 days out there you're focusing
only on other tips data say oh he
doesn't historical day then I was
turning them all very well right here
looks very well up to now so how do you
write so I think there's kind of a
couple ways in which we've been doing
that for depending on the different
types of Elections so so for some things
like the fundamentals or the polling
individually we do have many many years
and there we were able to very easily
drop years and do in sample and
out-of-sample examinations of that and
the same thing even with prediction
markets though we have in sample and add
a sample for anything that we've done
anything that I've done but more
importantly also as well is very
cognizant of the the Odyssey of this
kind of concern we do end up I do end up
depending on we or me sorry of
competitor working with some we're not
dropping variables that would or
dropping terms and different conditions
that look very strong in sample if
they're not working at a sample and so
we've done very strong on that making
sure that we're not over fitting and
it's been a big concern and so the basic
paper that i have on this last kind of
combined model I talk a lot of over lot
about overfitting and things that I
dropped back and scaled back on because
I was concerned about it yes
you made a comment about
the only thing you're interested was the
probability of victory the only thing
that mattered was when someone was here
what did I look at the manager
xbox yeah I'm really not interested in
victory or I'm really interested in
actual unit sale yeah so let me let me
tell me answer that question in
essentially that's for elections and so
for elections not as concerned although
everything is run also for that for a
stroke in comparison what we're working
on and what I'm doing a lot more into
research on thinking about when it comes
to marketing is actually full
probability distributions because I
think that that is the answer more than
even just level so again it's more
thinking what's the relevant thing for
the valve and condition I could be
thinking about forecasting the number of
sales on xbox but if I and maybe that in
a standard deviation maybe that's
development thing but if the relevant
things probability distributions that's
where actually gunning for to thank you
can we actually take that to the next
level and get what we feel could be for
some of those things be actually most
especially if there's a probability of
something of a skewed distribution of
some sort so we've been working towards
thinking about that just what's the most
relevant for the right context
riza second question gives an intriguing
people's information about the
comparison between diction markets and
polling data and show that I think
expectations tend to win roughly by a
factor of three two one the track and
that's provide a separate elections so
is there anything come between those
three fourths of the lady election the
60 election or something common about
the other so the characteristics of the
election that make one method right
better than we are well so the thing
which which I'm happy to say is that it
doesn't there's there's different
varying sample sizes that occurred in
these in different days before the
election and it was not relying on the
kind of basic variables that we thought
and so really cut through fairly
consistently and so I didn't show a
slide but we if we broke it up by those
major factors we didn't see anything
very very strong correctly the more
pious for the higher intent for example
those much more likely to today's vote
Democratic for example yeah did you say
that their expectation better no so what
to be clear so I could take the
expectations of just those people who
are going to vote democratic or just
those people vote Republican and take
that that group and D bias it based on
historical data to create a more
accurate forecast of expected vote share
and probability victory then I kid with
essentially just thinking about the
intentions of the whole group but both
the Republicans and Democrats were
capable of doing it
when you're talking about gamification
and yes you're getting information from
the fire how do you know if or when
you're losing so for what we're doing
right now we're running samples
generally using Mechanical Turk or other
side of outside groups in which you're
going you're winning you're losing based
off of bonuses that you're receiving or
based off a points you're getting in a
different game but you know what points
to give me a piloting the information
right you're fighting for so generally
in these type of things we're provide
you're providing the information on
either outcomes that have already
happened that you don't know about or
things that are randomly drawn in the
future and then taking that data to
provide the points for it use real is
starting to go for this new together be
kind of watch is sure start over yeah
yeah so some of them are including so I
i tend to blog on some news outlets as
well as the New York Times has a
statistician in-house that does some
things and probability though I'm not a
big fan and I was I was but he's moved
away from some of the things and some
other news outlets are starting to kind
of refer to at least aggregated
forecasts or from in trade prices or bed
fair prices or things like that but i
think it's slow because essentially
there was always a kind of loss leader
to talk about the latest poll that
they're conducting and they want to
conduct these polls and talk about them
so i think what you can see quicker and
more aggressively as people talking
about you just raw social media data
because that's kind of the prestige
thing for people to talk about now
whereas it used to be a prestigious
thing to drop a hundred thousand dollars
on a couple poles during the course of
election now people they need to have
their twitter guy talking about the
latest twitter reaction to a different
event but so i think people are still
far away from it still people know this
is out there except this still are just
reluctant to kind of switch over
so I've heard that the poles that are at
these days are mostly registered voters
but in the future gonna start doing
likely voters yeah so it transfers over
look I could change the whole
essentially that that quite that
transfers over sometime around nowish
where we're essentially early in the
cycle you're having pulling on
registered voters and then you start
building an elective voter models it
actually switches over kind of
organically throughout the end of the
summer and what you'll see is is is
going to be a mixed bag because
different companies use different likely
voter models and so it's very hard for
them to predict who's going to come out
and a lot of that is where the bias
between different polling companies
comes in so you have Rasmussen and some
other companies on the right and that
are tend to come out with poles of a
bomb be slightly reading and then you
have some polls which are known to have
a slightly less bias and it's all coming
from their estimation of who's going to
come out and vote and that's their way
for them to kind of cyclo through
statistics well they use it increasingly
meaningfully as the short of it so you
know five or ten years ago the basis
statistic that people worked on was
primary voters so he was a Triple D or
tripled our which meant that they had
voted in previous election cycles and
the primaries as a strong indication
that was kind of the extent of the data
mining the people were doing and now the
polling has become ridiculously
sophisticated as far as transferring
tens of millions of dollars from
different states looking at whether or
not as prediction markets are polling
but more likely it's these internal poll
pollsters that they're hiring as well as
teams of kids especially on Obama who
are translating Twitter data and other
things whatever they claim they can do
but my guess is that it's I haven't seen
inside any of the campaign's but I think
they probably have a long way to go to
actually make it meaningful but
definitely impactful so I'm meaningful
in the way weather out there correct but
impactful in the sense that it does lead
for a huge amount of investment
decisions are being based off of what
they can decide on these
right um I don't I think Microsoft will
allow me does not would not want me to
work for one camp or the other but you
know anyone who wants to you know take
our publicly available data is more than
happy to translate that into investment
decisions I guess are you expanding the
expectations Morgan go to the sides of
my social network and arms of the saloon
sitting in the Vega and you know yeah
that's my expectation and it opposed to
someone who's a social help no questions
so it's been a that's kind of future
work which we're really excited about is
waiting people by how much how many
people they know about so right now
we're kind of been torn on it we've
asked people how many people do you talk
to you about politics and the numbers
actually come out fairly consistently
but then there's you know some people
going to say a thousand people and
something we're going to say one and
obviously we're not going to wait people
based directly upon that we also have
been working on kind of deducing it from
how accurate people can be and it's it's
been a fun challenge but something where
we definitely like to go yeah for their
Facebook friends and you know in the end
of the day the idea is to be able to
pull this information more organically
that I think the key thing to think
about is like in five or ten years is
that the idea of an actual pole won't
make much sense to people at that time
because it's all going to be ongoing
data collection which is going to be a
combination of passive and active data
in which you won't be able to tell the
difference you're not going to realize
you were just pulled per se in the same
way that you know Google and Microsoft
and Yahoo and all these companies are
you know predicting things all the time
on an individual level why wouldn't we
be able to do that on for elections and
other things like that and so pulling
from social network day one would
definitely be part of as well Ryan could
you
ask some kind of a question that
somebody who pays attention to the news
might be the answer to like you can ask
them about this Obama sector and Ryan
crashed his car if a person knew but
that didn't maybe they're not going to
be there's this there's a massive
literature on on breaking down in
political information and what does it
mean and it's actually a very tricky
question because it's not always clear
which questions translate into which
outcomes but there's actually a lot of
people doing research on those type of
things like which questions can we ask
and then what does that imply if people
understand that or don't understand that
and also thinking about people's
confidence in those questions is
actually where my research has tended
towards though and that we show that
people who are extremely confident in
their responses to these political
questions are also less likely to be
influenced by certain things and and
trying to figure out exactly where does
all that lie and what do we know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
