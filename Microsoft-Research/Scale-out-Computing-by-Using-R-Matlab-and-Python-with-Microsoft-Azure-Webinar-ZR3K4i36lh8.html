computing using our MATLAB and Python
Microsoft Azure to learn more about the
ways you can participate in today's
event please click on the Q&amp;amp;A button in
the lower left-hand corner of your

today's event over to your presenter wen
Ming Yi senior research program manager
wen Ming you now have the floor Thank
You Stephanie
my name is wen Ming Yi I am a senior
research program manager at Microsoft
Research and here at the bottom you will
you can find my Twitter alias if you'd
like to follow me and especially if you
have further questions after the web
webcast I'll be very happy to answer the
questions that you may have so today's
topic we is on scaling out on Windows
Azure so as many of you know that cloud
is scalable by design we have multiple
data centers and we have many many
millions of machines in each of these
data centers that are able to handle
workloads at the global scale and the
ability to use the cloud at a scale is
also a very desirable technical skill
these days many companies are looking
for developers and as well as users that
are able to take advantage of compute at
scale the second part of the webinar
here is to look at some of the options
for technical computing as scale on
Windows Azure or Microsoft Azure as we
have just renamed it some of these
options are for running executables that
you compile yourself and you optimize
and that also includes MATLAB are which
are very popular for
people who are doing technical computing
or machine learning or any type of
statistics work we also have Python
which is an open-source ecosystem it's
actually much more than just a
programming language now in fact Python
is actually happening in a Montreal as
we speak so we're looking at some of
these options for scaling out those
computer so it goes beyond simply your
desktop which is where the value comes
in for cloud computing and finally we I
would like to introduce you to the
Windows Azure for research program that
Microsoft Research is running we have
over a hundred projects in progress
right now we're working with its various
academic institutions trying to really
bring the people together to innovate
based on the fact that we now have the
ability to do collaborative research in
a common platform which is Windows Azure
so the first thing I want to talk to you
about is the global footprint that we
have so if you look at some of the blue
dots here those are the data centers
that we have around the world we have
data centers in the US there are four of
them north north central south central
east and west we also have two data
centers in Europe and one in China and
we just opened up two in Japan as well
and there are there's another one in
Hong Kong which is relatively smaller
and then we have a very large data
center in Singapore that serves the that
region of the world some of these data
centers as you can see are extremely
large and they cover many football
fields worth and they are generally in
the cost the cost can range from
hundreds of millions to billions of
dollars for these data zones are usually
located very close to electricity
sources that are cheap
that also allows us to keep the cost
down and passed that savings on to our
customers which many of them are
internal such as being and office 365
and many of other services that runs on
Windows Azure continuously and every day
the first item we want to discuss here
is the
the paradigms or the various offerings
of cloud computing this is important
because these different computing
paradigm target different users and this
is something that is very important when
it comes to selecting what you want to
actually use is it's very popular it's
probably one of the most popular cloud
computing I would say paradigm or
platform so the idea is that you simply
the idea is that you simply host a
machine that is using using a virtual
via virtual hard drive I just saw a
PowerPoint went out for a second now
we're back the the idea is that you can
take a virtual machine image and put it
in a cloud and you can also download
that if you need to use that on your
local machine so this is really targeted
towards IT administrators and sometimes
developers and users because you're
simply hosting a machine in the cloud
this is more or less a server that you
own and you administrate so there's
there's no additional things that you
will have to learn to be able to use it
very quickly but the problem was that
approach at scale is that you will have
to have a virtual hard drive attached to
each of the machines as you are
deploying them as you can see there's it
can become a fairly large task if you
started building a cluster using many
infrastructure as a service
servus virtual machines so you can
essentially go started to have hundreds
of disks laying around they all each
have their own states
so the second paradigm here is the
platform of the service which is very
much what Microsoft has invented this is
what we initially started to use so the
idea is that you have stateless machines
meaning that you don't save anything to
your hard drive locally even though we
do have local hard drives and what's
really important here they do scale they
scale very well and okay and a lot of
the scalable services are built on top
of platform the service we have services
that are running that can go beyond
thousands and even tens of thousands of
machines by just you know simply
clicking a button and deploy that but
unfortunately that's mostly targeting
developers so you have to go into visual
studio and run a lot of that yourself
so you have to build the software
yourself and a lot of the software the
service the systems are built that way
so you do need to developers skills to
be able to do this the second part the
third one is software as a service which
which is you know very easy to use this
is something that someone has built for
you or developer has built for you and
we have an example of that it's mostly
targeting domain users so you're simply
consuming a service such as your email
service very simple simply put and
what's important here it's targeted
towards domain users for people who are
not developers who are not IT
administrators software the service is
what you really want to do here are some
of example or clothes that really need a
cluster to be routed to be able to use
one is one of the most popular one is
the digital media rendering and encoding
and it turns out many of the
supercomputing the capacity today are
actually used for that
so there's about CGI or
computer-generated images or animations
that are done that way and financial and
risk calculations those are also very
popular that extends to Windows Azure as
well we have financial companies that
have hundreds of thousands of course
they use each day to do risk
calculations and finally engineering and
modeling and simulation this is more
traditional and HPC application where it
may require some specialized hardware
such as InfiniBand which I'm very happy
to report that Windows Azure does now
support InfiniBand
and high compute instances and finally
the computational life science which I'm
seeing a very large growth in the US
especially the funding agencies are
starting to do provide a lot more funds
or areas having a shift towards
traditional science towards
computational life science which demands
a lot of computational power and so
let's take a look at some of the
different scale out scenarios or
applications that people have been using
so the first one is MPI so this is the
traditional HPC crowd essentially you're
running matrix solves at a large scale
solving OD ease solving PDEs those type
of applications requires InfiniBand or a
very very low latency and high bandwidth
interconnects so Windows Azure does have
that and you have to use Windows HPC
will look at those software options in
the second section of this webinar the
the second the second scenario is
embarrassingly parallel applications
which are essentially each of the
compute units or each unit of work is
independent of each other and this is
very much suitable for the cloud because
cloud has hundreds of thousands or even
millions of commodity machines that you
can simply spin up and run applications
since they don't necessarily the generic
instances don't necessarily have
InfiniBand
you can simply spend the hundreds of
them up and be able to scale linearly so
since they don't really have to
communicate with each other very much so
we will show some examples of that as we
go and forward and also finally there's
this i/o intensive application which are
starting to become much more popular
there's the MapReduce paradigm the idea
is that you take your computer where the
data is essentially a lot of these
compute nodes have a huge amount of disk
space and very fast access to the disks
and you're trying to build a virtual
file system on top of it such as the
HDFS and then it will do the
partitioning for you automatically
so and then you have a scheduler that
sits on top that knows where the data is
on each of the nodes and how they're
partitioned and would be able to
schedule to have that code run on that
machine so we're not going to cover that
because this is a different topic but
instead we're going to focus on compute
intensive applications that includes
many of the technical computing software
so I have a demo here which shows you
the Windows as your in action so this is
a piece of software that we've written
or a software service that we've written
that sits on top of the platform as a
service which I explained earlier
meaning that the VMS are all stateless
so you don't keep any states on the
virtual machines that allows you to
scale so when you first deploy these
applications to platform of the service
you would actually have a startup script
which copies the necessary software onto
each of the machine
and then you submit jobs to a global
scheduler and they're run in parallel so
here is a here is the simulation so one
of the really important thing about the
cloud it is extremely reliable and it
takes care of all the patching all the
other things for you so you don't have
to worry about it
for example my service here which
originally was intended to run for two
days turns out it has been running for
two years because it's so easy for a lot
of us to be able to demo as well as you
know our some of our attendees like for
conferences like to just simply check in
and out so the service has never been
taken down if any hardware has been
broken it will be swapped out for me
automatically if the operating system is
out of date it will be swapped out for
me automatically if there is any patches
that needs to happen it will do that
automatically and I don't have to worry
about any of that
I simply focus on showing the demo and
just you know having the service running
reliably so that is something that no
one else was able to have before cloud
was available so we've run 2300
simulations over the years and we're
simply running a very you know very
small sample and when you go to that URL
right now so it will take a few seconds
for me to switch over so and just be
patient and just watch the screen change
over and in meantime I will go ahead and
go to the website and start that service
hopefully everyone should be able to see
that website right now so Dee the
website is done in such a way that we
have some web front-end so you have a
web front-end we also have some back-end
that does the actual computation so so
the website should show up on your
screen right now
so I have a gallery here which shows all
the simulations that has been run in the
past and you would be able to look at
the simulations that has run we also
have ah that's interesting it looks like
I have lost some connectivity's here and
what I will do is I will go ahead and
show you show you how windows azure
works and and look at some of the
different heat maps so right now the
website is is running on Windows Azure
and let me show you where the cloud
services so this is the Windows Azure
portal which is the back end of this
particular service so if I click on the
if I click on the service it looks like
the service has actually stopped for
some reason I can go ahead and start
that start that again looks like there
has been done by mistake so the idea is
that we have the dashboard which allows
you to look at what the cloud service
looks like so I actually went ahead and
started the service again so the
configuration and there's configuration
monitoring and scale so if I look at a
scale you would be able to see that you
can move a slider and increase the
number of instances that you can have so
for this particular service I have three
different type of instances as you can
see there is an instance count of four
this is the actual compute services so
the compute services does the heavy
lifting it does the actual web forecast
for you and the and then there is a web
instances as you can see there's a web
instances which is the front end so I
have two of them to allow the skate
allow the SLA to be to be really good at
99.95% it doesn't really help if you
turn off the
servus so emotionally redeploying it
again but as you can see there's two of
them upfront and we also have some head
node we also have the head node that's
running here one of the hopefully it
will take a few minutes for it to
actually deploy if I haven't stopped so
so what we will do is we'll kind of go
back to look at the looking at the slide
and it will come back to it so see if it
actually deploys for us properly
the other interesting thing here is that
I have a heat map it which shows the CPU
so at running at 99.9% which simply says
that the service has four jobs currently
that are currently running so we will
have this deploy it again and show it to
you in a bit so I'm going to go back to
the slides and perhaps perhaps we will
be able to see some of the slides that I
have recorded earlier so that you have a
few of what it looks like and once it's
up again we'll take a look at it again
so we're back to the slides yeah great
thank you go back to the site so here's
what it actually looks like there's the
website and there's the the services
that are running so on the left hand
side it shows all the simulations that
has run over the last two years and if I
didn't accidentally just turn it off
today it would have been running for
exactly two in a two years and three
months for awhile and the second pieces
are showing you the Bing map overlay of
the actual forecast each of these
forecasts run for about eight hours and
once people have submitted them they
will be queued up and run in the backend
let's take a look at the architecture a
real quick so as you can see there's a
front end which is just simply a website
I hope that are running and then the
back end we have some compute our worker
nodes that are running running the
actual simulations so the jobs are
submitted through the forecast front end
and then they're submitted they're run
by each of the compute nodes and they're
usually on-demand and I
can scale them up and down by simply
moving a slider and then this there are
almost I think 50 million objects that
are currently stored in the azure blob
storage and that includes the images
that are overlays and so also some of
the log files and as well as the
simulation results data that are post
processed for this so the important
aspect of this is that we built
something that is that is using a
platform of the service which I simply
deploy a package on through hundreds of
machines and without having to worry
about without have to worry about the
you know actual saving things to the
disk if I let's just say I just turn it
off right so if I want to turn it back
on again it will be exactly where it was
so just to give people a progress we're
actually deploying it's copying all the
files as we speak the second interesting
thing is that you can take a you do have
monitoring tools which allows you to see
whether your CPUs are running so it put
this particular instance there are
twelve cores running and you can have
you're seeing that 98% CPU utilization
that simply means that you have all the
instances running at full capacity and
you can simply as I said move a slider
for the extra large instances to be able
to run the compute so we also have Auto
scale so if there is a lot more demand
coming in if you allow that to happen it
will Auto scale to multiple core many
more cores if needed so here are
instances I showed you earlier we have a
head node which has two instance has two
instances and we also have a front end
which I have two web frontend for people
to be able to hit against in a ROM robin
fashion and then also of course we have
in the back end we have a computer
service here is actually a heat map of
96 cores running this is a essentially
eight jobs that are actually twelve jobs
that are running so you're running a
simultaneous simulations on twelve
cities
we speak and here's - hold what the
portal looks like which I would have
showed you live right so there's there
many cities that you're running
simulations on they will show you the
progress that they're updating once
every minute or two and then this is the
actual processing steps so wrf by itself
which is the simulation code that
happens has to go through a workflow
which does all the post processing and
pre processing for it to happen so in
real world there's really no easy
embarrassingly parallel application a
lot of times they involve post
processing and pre processing that
actually happens so what a why cloud
computing you know that's actually a
really good question I love many people
that asked me I have you know concluded
that the abstraction for hardware and IT
infrastructure is probably the number
one reason you would not you want to do
cloud computing so for example I have
three large Cray desktop deaths site
machines which has 128 a cores total so
I really use those machines anymore
because the fact that I can simply go to
the Windows Azure portal click on a
button deploy a cluster and it's running
so if you were to do that yourself you
have to firstly install the operating
system you have to tune it you have to
make sure everything is working you have
to install each of the machines and then
you have to install the software and
that's really a one week process if you
want to deploy any type of applications
and centralized computing and data
storage so the idea is that if you have
all the compute and data store in
central location you suddenly have the
ability to give access to your
collaborators which is extremely
convenient for any type of collaboration
that you want to do and finally the
always-on feature is really important
the fact that your services always can
be running unless you turn it off of
course the they will be they will be
guaranteed
to work essentially the downtown equals
about maybe two three hours per year so
the second piece I want to look at is
the technical computing options which
are very important to many of our users
here one is that if you want to build
something scalable what are the things
that you will have to do right so Visual
Studio and Azure SDK which you can use
to build pretty much any type of
scientific applications or business
applications you like so the way of
dword would work is that you go to
visual studio you say file new project
you can add the type of roles you want
so it could be a web role as your front
end and then worker roles that are
sitting in the back end and then inside
the worker Rose
they can call Python MATLAB or are
through a system process essentially
you're doing P invoke and to run these
sort of these executables this is very
easy to do
and for most developers they have no
trouble but if in order to make
something that is reliable and robust
and has the web interface it takes maybe
days or even weeks worth of work so
there's a project that I recently
started to build which would be
available to many of you and if you are
part of a shuffle research program we
will even help you to use it but we're
also trying to make up the community so
that I'm looking for people who would
like to test it so the idea is that for
researchers they're not developers they
don't necessarily want to write code or
you know spam they don't necessarily
even have the time to be by the write
code form in a month or maybe even weeks
so I think we what we can do is we can
actually consolidate a lot of the work
that has been previously done so I built
the simulation runner so you can simply
go to a web page put your input file in
a Dropbox and run a parametric sweep
application which is very much suitable
for the cloud
and we will pre install things like
MATLAB R or Python so and we have give
you options of selecting different ones
so it gives you the flexibility of not
having to learn a new system as well as
the ability to scale out your
computation at a very clean way or very
good practice using this piece of
software whoosh it we will have some
demos later in the process so the second
part of this the third option is windows
HPC server so we actually have a
commercial product which is called the
HPC pack which you can install on
windows server so it's a very nice piece
of software but it's almost running like
running a slurm or or node leveler or
any of those job scheduling tools or
running your own server farm that
requires you to no windows server
sysadmin this admin knowledge so you
have to be able to run a cluster and
have to understand domain controllers
and a lot of these that Windows server
administration it's not difficult but
it's not necessarily something that one
researcher would want to do which is to
do administration and all that and the
other interesting thing you can do with
Windows HPC server first is that you can
install the MATLAB compute server a
computer a computer test cluster server
so yeah the way it would work which I
saw a question in the audience's the you
would connect they will you install the
software on Windows HPC server and the
individual nodes would do a dial in or
call in into the MATLAB license server
on the internet and we'll have some
screenshots of that in a later later
part of this and the second part the
third part is the actually the fourth
one is the Linux cluster so this is IaaS
so the idea
sorry I got disconnected just for just
one second I apologize so we were just
talking about Linux clusters so the idea
that Linux clusters would work is that
you can simply deploy a Linux cluster
however you like these could be images
that we create for you or these could be
images that you have yourself or you can
simply you know build them one by one so
you can do them by hand or you can
deploy them through a script so I
actually do have a demo of that and you
can find that in a hands-on lab of the
Windows Azure training training site and
the idea is that you would be able to
run all that through a script create a
cluster but you will have to do
administration on your own Linux
clusters and currently we only support
Linux as an IAS option which means all
these Linux machines that you created
will have to attach have an attached to
disks to DOM and fuck the we have
support for multiple languages so that
includes Fortran and nodejs net Java PHP
so all these languages are supported so
pretty much anything that runs on
Windows is supported so the other thing
I want to do here is to actually look at
the generic implementation of a scalable
solution so which is the simulation
runner so many of you would probably be
using it for some of your work
especially for the azure for research
program so while we're at this maybe
so I am loading the desktop as we speak
it will take probably just a few minutes
ah great so as you saw at the very
beginning of the presentation I
accidentally turned off a cloud service
which has probably a hundred cores
deployed and as we are simply speaking I
just had to press a button and redeploy
it and it's all up and running as we
speak
so there's absolutely this is absolutely
or the best platform you could possibly
have when it comes to running compute
and think about the complexity of this
if I were to do that myself
right so if I accidentally did something
to a cluster that I've built and now I
would actually have to do all kinds of
troubleshooting and instead what I have
done is that I've been talking to you
through the slides and the windows azure
has been doing work in the backend for
me so so the service is back up and you
can see in the gallery it shows the
simulations that are has been run in the
past you can also look at the processing
queues you can see that some of them are
being download and some of their being
computed so this is a live service that
everyone has access to so it really
shows you the power of software as a
service and I can submit its submit a
computation if I need to so I can simply
go to perhaps let's just say we'll pick
San Diego here oh how about some
somewhere warm we'll just put somewhere
warm here we just put somewhere or I
want to have vacation there you go so
yeah I can go ahead and save that in
eight hours it will have a simulation
done for me so this is the power of
software service so that brings us to
talk about the simulation Runner the
simulation Runner is a work in progress
but it has gotten to a point where it's
stable enough that I'm ready to look for
some testers if you're part of the
Windows Azure program and you're also
welcome to use it in the next two weeks
once we have it once we make it public
so here's something interesting here
which is the simulation Runner allows
you to simply go deploy a cluster by
setting the sum of the environment
environmental settings so the way we've
envisioned it is to allow you to go to a
web page and simply say here's my
Windows Azure credential and I want to
go ahead and deploy a cluster with any
of these installed so what I have
included here is the canopy Python just
a generic Python canopy is something
that is done by a company called in
thought so it's a 64 bit version so
includes all the machine learning
packages all the computational
scientific computational packages that's
there and there's a another company
called continuum which includes the
Anaconda software at so that also
includes many of the software that you
want or suffer packages that you want so
you can simply click these packages and
say save and it will deploy them onto
your cluster and we also included MATLAB
runtime from eight point one sorry eight
point zero through eight point two as
well as R so this once you have deployed
it you're going to see that you're gonna
have a little cluster and you can also
scale so this particular setup has the
ability to scale to as large as of your
account is I currently have nine nodes
running you can scale to 100 or even 320
which is the limit of this a particular
account if you want so you can also when
you deploy you can also choose between
small instances which have one core as
well as two up to
a core instances which which is extra
large so you will have to make sure that
your application scales at a thread
level if you do use
large course and we will allow you to do
core based scheduling as well later
so let's actually look at some of these
uh code that I run earlier as you can
see I'm doing some testing on the system
here so this is actually a blast run so
see many of you know that blast is a
Genoa genomics code which which allows
you to search for certain features
through a database right so it has a 4
gigabyte database that you have to
download and it has an executable that
you run and then the results are simply
the results that you're gonna see if
there is a match or not
so you can click through thee matches
and you will see that in this particular
one there are some matches that actually
occurred in the sequence that you gave
you gave to the program which is blast X
that you run so for to submit a job it's
actually pretty simple as well so here
you can select from local files and you
can select them from Dropbox this is
actually in the feature that people ask
me because people don't want to deal
with lots of files if I have a package
that has let's just say 15 files it's
just a directory executables and support
files you can simply put them in a
Dropbox and it will pick it up and put
them in each of the nodes to run you can
also pick them up from Azure blob
storage you can upload them locally
which has to be a zip file and then you
can run your parameter sweep application
and just simply submit the job or save
it so you can't also resubmit jobs if
they fail right so here's a job that I
see that ran very well I can simply
click on resubmit and it has all the
different options as well as you know
things that has been filled out for you
so apparently this is actually from
Dropbox you can see the structure it
read from the Dropbox and allows you to
be reviewed of running here so that's a
demo of this piece of software if you
would like to try it out or use it
please do drop me a line or you know you
sent me an Ewald shoot the email to
email to me or tweet me so either way it
would be great so we would love to get
your
get your ideas or any new ideas that we
can we can do it will also make it open
source so that you can use it yourself
the nice thing about it is that it's
simple and it uses platform this as a
service at scale which means you don't
have to write any software to be run
your scientific code so we support our
Python MATLAB any executables that you
want to do a PowerShell even you know
Ruby if you wanted to run that so let me
switch back to the presentation again so
as we're waiting for the presentation to
show up here again there you go
so the nice thing about the simulation
Runner is that I will be able to help
you with a lot of it if you and also I
would be able to add features if you
would like to have that so just a quick
review of what it looks like so this is
the Dropbox used to play take all your
stuff into Dropbox and it will be picked
up and it will just run whatever you
specify in the simulation Runner so as
you can see that these are the what it
looks like so creating a Linux cluster
so this is something that you can find
on the Azure training training content
which is listed at the back of this
presentation the resource section the
virtual machines for Windows Azure that
support Linux we have different flavors
of Linux and they're always updated our
partners are very keen on working with
us to make sure that they're up to date
there's any security problems they have
it'll be fixed it will be patched so
these are all supported distributions
you can also upload your own so you can
create a VHD and upload that to be used
on Windows Azure there are tools that
allows you to convert VMware images onto
VHD and then you can upload them onto
Windows Azure so it's pretty
straightforward and as I was telling you
guys earlier
I have scripts that can deploy clusters
of them
so it's simply using the Python SDK to
spin up instances so in this particular
example here is that if you go to the
training kit it goes through step by
step shows you exactly how to deploy it
so I'm simply using the ipython notebook
which connects to the I pee can i pee
engine or the ipython compute engine in
the backend and have a small cluster to
be to run a Monte Carlo simulation so
there are many ways for you to run
embarrassingly parallel applications and
we also support multiple platforms the
only downside to linux cluster is that
you have to roll your own and you'd
probably have to secure them yourself
and the other important thing about it
is that they have to each carry a disk
so if you have 25 machines you have 25
disks that are sitting near a blob
storage and you probably have to
maintain but if you just use a script to
deploy them you may simply say ok I
don't really care about these disks I'll
destroy them and I will
you know redeploy them again but they
have to have the disks when you deploy
them but it's certainly an option if you
have to have Linux be able to use Linux
so here are some other infrared links to
how to use Windows Azure command-line
tools
so there's command-line tools that
allows you to copy files deploy VMs look
at your subscription automate a lot of
the creation processes this is where you
want to go so go to the Windows Azure
comm and search for CLI tool so the COI
- is written in no js' and it's usable
on all platforms so another option I
want to talk to you about is Windows HPC
server so Windows HPC server is really
about IAS which requires administration
so the idea is that you create a head
node in the cloud by your system admin
so he'll create an ad EO create all
these different things it takes maybe
two or three hours or to do so for it
Apple the software service options you
simply deploy it and you don't have to
worry about it but here you're actually
installing a server you have to learn
how to do administration on Windows
Server which is really fun it's
definitely worth doing once at least in
your lifetime and learn how it works but
probably not for a researcher that would
want to administrate a large windows
cluster and then the stateless nodes
those compute nodes are platform and
services that allows you to be able to
scale so it is an option for people who
want to be able to do who have you know
some sysadmin knowledge but want a very
robust solution that is supported by
Microsoft to be able to run embarrassin
and parallel applications so we do have
commercial customers that use this but
they do have sis admins that takes care
of their cluster here are some that's
the animation and here's an animation of
how it works
so the Windows HPC server you can also
take that head node and leave it on
premise so you can do that as well it's
very flexible but it's the same problem
you have to know how to do
administration on a Windows server then
there's you you are allowed to add notes
that are local machines so for example
there's actually companies that run this
on on their desktops and the you can
also add Windows servers which support
Symphony band and then you can add
Windows Azure notes and so this is the
platform as-a-service nodes that you can
add to it we also support HPC SKUs now
so this has to be done through the HPC
server we support 120 gigabytes of RAM
QDR
which is 40 Giga bps InfiniBand so this
is my understanding it's only available
in the Amsterdam a data center and I
think it's becoming available in the
Chicago data center as well
we have probably thousands of these
machines that you would be able to
access and run real HPC applications if
you're needed to so it supports MPI
supports all the things that you will
need for complex scheduling
so if you want to do that which is
traditional HPC type of work
please use Windows HPC server it works
and here's some here's some screenshots
so if you want to create a node it's
simply right click and say I want to add
you to add some Azure notes make it a
hundred make it a million and and here's
what a job submission looks like as you
can see it's very similar to the
simulation runner which I simply copied
some of the interface from HPC server so
the difference is again it's user versus
sysadmin target audience right so you
can essentially run your jobs you can
see two jobs submitting this is actually
a MATLAB job so so we're running some
MATLAB runtime work on here and sure
here's another simulation that we did so
this is something called motorcyle we
did some very compute intensive work
using the HPC server in the cloud to
process Mulder's satellite data and that
takes years that essentially if you were
to do that and estimate a queue I said I
remember it was 30 years or even more so
we were able to do that in the cloud by
scaling out to hundreds of nodes and
obviously that didn't take a long time
to take maybe I would say a month or so
for the computation to complete rather
than 30 years here's and the cost is
also becoming much cheaper so these are
some of the older numbers right now the
compute service has gotten a 35% off and
also the storage services now 65% off I
think he you can store a gigabyte per
month is that two cents three cents two
cents I think it was and the compute
instances are four cents I believe you
can get that done so here's a map
preview of what MATLAB cluster
installation looks like so you can't
install MATLAB so it's not a problem on
Windows HPC server and it would actually
have the licensing all done for years so
in fact you can see that I ran through
the cluster configuration and it
finished up just fine so you have the so
you install
HPC server installed a MATLAB compute
cluster and and it will just run but
there's a minor issue you have to
install VPN so those are still things
that we're figuring out for you and we
will have a more detailed write-up for
you later on and for the future I FPS I
would encourage you guys to look at so
if you're using MATLAB please do and
we'll be very happy to help you to get
that working on Windows your so that
brings me to on number three which is
let us help you to scale your research
so we have some training schedules we
have we've been running almost a hundred
trainings are worldwide by now maybe
done that maybe not that many but we do
have also the content available it's 200
megabyte downloads which shows you a lot
of things that I showed you today and
also you can apply for the Windows Azure
for research RFP program which I will go
into in detail as well and also use
Windows Azure too and you can get help
that through our support program so this
is the azure for research program and
you can go to asher for research which
is the URL here and you'll find on the
main page you'll find that this this is
the actual proposal that you have to
fill out as you can see it's really not
that many things you have to do so
you'll fill this out your institution
which university or good you're from and
also you need to write a two-page
proposal about what you would like to do
on Windows Azure it will be a free gift
to your University and includes
almost half a million more than that
actually more than half a million
compute hours so if you like to take
advantage of the program will also help
you to use some of our programs as well
as help you look at some of the design
so I adjure Windows Azure program is
really about bringing people together
and that's really the definition of
innovation when you bring people
together onto a
compute platform together I think this
is where we can really scale not just
simply for the computation you're doing
but also the knowledge that you'll have
as well as the innovation that we can
have so you here are some URLs that are
very interesting so Windows Azure com
this is constantly being refreshed
there's there's a a team of writers that
does a fantastic job of keeping things
up to date we also have the Windows
Azure for research website which you can
go to you can look at training schedules
you can look at technical papers and you
can also you know ask questions if you
wanted to so this is actually a URL for
technical papers so it goes into details
of a lot more so such as big data such
as how do you use Windows Azure storage
how do you use compute so these papers
will continuously be updated and you
should go there for your technical
resources we also have an online
training this is a very light version of
our you know you know hands-on training
which is two days so this is probably
takes you an hour to look through these
videos and they're done by Peter Wong
Peter Wang who is a fantastic developer
for for scientific applications and a
founder of continuum and finally we have
a LinkedIn group which you can join and
also here's my Twitter which you can
follow and if you need to ask questions
that's probably the easiest way to reach
to me and finally there's a few more
URLs that you can look at and we'll make
this deck available to you any questions
I think there is one so I'll read it out
so when using the simulation Runner how
do you install custom libraries which
requires compilation such as Python
modules involve C extension or
simulation instances so that can be done
through Dropbox you simply drop your
compiled code into Dropbox and it will
probably be in the bin directory and you
specify and it will just work so we're
trying to make this as easy as possible
and
you can also use SkyDrive we haven't
built the support yet but you can also
just zip up we were a code and say
upload and distribute and it will
distribute on each of the nodes so
that's something that we saw as a pain
point for the users and we're trying to
make it really simple for you and the
other questions there is one more
question I'm gonna submit that to you
fantastic Thank You Stephanie
so the simulation runner project
packages is that currently not yet
available fund for download but we'll
make it available very soon and so you
should probably ping me in I would say
in 8 days so by Friday of next week we
should have it up and up and running and
if you have something specifically you
want to run or test we would love to get
you know the the specific program you
want to run and we can test it for you
so you can send me a tweet and I will be
happy to work with you offline to do
this and what we really want to do is to
make this part of a community and make
it really simple for all of our
researchers because there really aren't
any good free web-based scheduling tools
out there so this would make things so
much easier and to make it better it
requires a community effort so please do
send me even those and it's actually
running right now a simulation runner
cloud app that you can play with it it's
a it's very very rough shape at the
moment but we'll make it work I've
already tested on Python I've tested on
MATLAB I've tested on you know complex
simulations like the blast which is
non-trivial because you have to copy a
lot of database files over i've also
tested it for
some other programs that I
cross-compiled MPI does not work on
across that many nodes but it works on a
single node I did test that earlier so
you just simply package up MPI onto it
and you just run MPI using in each
individual nodes so I think that
concludes our webcast and if you have
any further questions please send me
send me a tweet if you like and I'll be
very happy to work with you and I look
forward to your submissions for the RFP
program for the next deadline which is
April 15th and I apologize that
coincides was the tax day and once again
I'll hand it back to you Stephanie
thanks everyone for attending okay great
