your computer many many times to work
create and play and during that time
you're essentially working on a
2-dimensional canvas we wondered what it
would be like to create a display where
the contents of the display could pop
out of that 2-dimensional canvas so that
we would be able to bring it to life and
what we've done is we've created a
couple of prototypes where we've shown
that that's actually possible and what
we are doing is using two sets of highly
engineered micro structured plastic
films to take the light from a
conventional liquid crystal display and
recombine that light in the space above
the display in such a way that it looks
like the displays hovering in the space
above it
so here the earth which looks like it's
hovering there we're actually detecting
my gesture with a Kinect and you can see
that I can rotate that in a very natural
way so in this demonstration we've shown
that we can create a display which
floats in the space above the surface
but there's nothing actually on the
surface in the next demonstration my
colleague Utica is going to show a
display which we've constructed where
there is both content on the surface and
floating above it in this demo we
created floating this spray on top of
the surface display we created that kind
of system using the high speed projector
with high speed the heat crystal
structure by projecting the to image
which is much faster than the human eye
can see now in creating the to proceed
screen with different image on the
floating one its own floating and jazz
is on surface in this gaming now we saw
in the floating dragon on top of the
brand we saw in the shadow of the dragon
on the surface so the user can feel more
3d world since dragon is floating on top
of the surface
now you can touch this dragon with this
shot rocking camera and you can do the
touch interaction on the surface so with
these two prototypes that we've built
we've been
able to show that you can create a
display which produces an image that
floats in front of another image so you
can take your creations your games and
literally bring them to life by having
them pop out of the screen here at
Microsoft we're passionately committed
to bringing these very unique very
engaging experiences to life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
