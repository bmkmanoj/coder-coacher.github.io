partner in being a part of the computing
community so ACM and microsoft research
work together frequently in multiple
dimensions is not just journals and
conferences it's everything from
education policy to technology policy to
recognizing great research around the
world through sponsorship of awards so
Microsoft is one of the most responsible
partners and citizens of the computing
research community that I know to me the
most important part of Microsoft
Research is its role in the entire
academia industry government ecosystem
of research and here I speak with my
National Science Foundation hat on
because I saw how important it is to
have industrial research labs industrial
research labs akin to the old Bell Labs
and for computer science you know the if
you look at the history of corporations
there's always been you know maybe one
company that would put money into basic
research and computer science and right
now that one company is Microsoft
Microsoft Research is the world's
strongest computing research
organization and computer science is the
world's most important field in terms of
changing our lives that's the story
