you
okay so hi everyone and welcome to the
inaugural nib symposium algorithms among
us the societal impacts of machine
learning so in the interests of kind of
reducing the negative impacts of having
the symposium Rome massively over time
I'll try and start us as soon as
possible that was a joke so feel free to
laugh if you won thank you very much so
and my name is Michael Osborne I'm just
here to kind of kick the whole
proceedings off the first thing I'd like
to do is to thank our sponsors and in
particularly this symposium would not
exist without the incredible support of
the future of life Institute who work to
promote the development and safety and
benefit beneficence of new technologies
especially machine learning I'd also
like to thank baidu the future humanity
Institute and the center for the study
of existential risk so thanks very much
to all our sponsors and so a few admin
points the first is that we're running a
fairly tight schedule and there are a
lot of you so we won't actually be
taking audience questions throughout the
symposium so instead what we will do is
ask you if you do have a question to
submit it at the top link on this slide
it's tinyurl.com / algorithms among us
so there you can tag a question for a
particular panel a particular speaker
and we'll do our best to get to it in
the panel discussions to follow we're
also super keen to keep in contact with
you after the symposium finishes so in
the interest of doing so we've left
pieces of paper on the seats and please
add your email address to that or if
you'd prefer go to the bottom of the two
links on the slide where you can in
digital fashion add your email address
we promise not to spam you too much
again in the interests of reducing the
negative impacts of machine learning but
of course that will help us to keep in
contact after symposium finishes and
would also like to conduct a survey
about your thoughts on these issues
which will send out some time in the new
year so I thought I'd also flag up some
recent developments in this kind of
sphere that might be of interest to you
the first is a new project from the
Royal Society
on the potential economic and societal
impacts of machine learning in the UK
and so you can tell this is a pretty
serious and interesting issue of even
the Queen is interested and so the Royal
Society is particularly interested in
hearing from you the machine learning
community so if you have any thoughts
that you'd like to feed into that
particular project have you say at the
links that are visible on the slide and
if you can't read that I appreciate it
might be quite small for those of you at
the back we'll try and put the full link
up on the website for the symposium I'd
also like to call upon zubin guerra
money and he'll tell us a little bit
more about another exciting initiative
in the UK and here is even to tell us
more thanks Micah I'm very excited to be
at the symposium what mike has called me
up here to announce is the launch of a
very exciting new center called the
leverhulme Center for the future of
intelligence which is just being
launched this eat this coming year
thanks to a 10 million pound donation
from the leverhulme trust and this is
going to be a new interdisciplinary
center to explore the opportunities and
challenges of artificial intelligence
for Humanity so it's going to bring
together computer scientists
philosophers social scientists and
academics from every one of the relevant
communities to examine technical
practical and philosophical questions
artificial intelligence raises for
Humanity in the coming century it's a
collaboration between the University of
Cambridge with links to Oxford Martin
school at the University of Oxford
Imperial College London and UC Berkeley
but really it's not meant to be a tribal
thing of just a few universities or so
on the whole goal is really to reach out
to the wider community of people who are
interested in
both the opportunities and the
challenges of ever increasing machine
intelligence there are a lot of great
people involved in this the director is
Hugh price Nick Bostrom who's here
somewhere i think i think is is part of
the center Mary Shanahan Stuart Russell
at UC Berkeley Adrian Weller and and
many other people so this is a very
exciting Center and you know we look
forward to engaging with the wider
community to try to think about all of
these issues and to try to work towards
you know all the benefits and and also
think about all the challenges great
thanks so um thanks very much Steve and
I apologize for not having introduced
you properly now rather than me telling
you what this symposium is going to be
bad it's my very great pleasure to
introduce Tom deters who is the
distinguished professor and director of
intelligent systems research at Oregon
State University and of course triple AI
president so I'm Tom please take it away
and i'll just bring our pure slides
okay thank you very much that's the very
last slide so let's go back to the
beginning so of course I think a lot of
the impetus for initially launching the
this and several other events that have
taken place in the last 12 months was
the declarations by various prominent
people Stephen Hawking Elon Musk and
even our colleague Stuart Russell about
concerns about the very long range
future of artificial intelligence
thinking about AI systems that could get
out of control and and take over the the
planet from us so that's one strand
that's contributing to this workshop
today and it will actually be the topic
of the last section of the of the
symposium but in more recently there's
been a lot of concern about more it's
interesting so how do i prevent auto
advance on a Mac
yes on the pc it was set not to do this
but the defaults are lovely okay okay
okay where's my mouse I don't see my
mouse either mirror show but it should
be under slideshow it's it's it's not
saying use timing so well okay well go
so the first set of concerns are very
much in the end of in the longer term
future there are many concerns that that
are facing us today and so if we think
about privacy issues particularly with
face recognition but also with the
combination of advances in activity
recognition from video and ubiquitous
video surveillance their concerns about
safety here represented by the by the
recent sort of beta release of the
autopilot for the Tesla and and there
are concerns about labor markets and
what is the future of employment for
humans when when more and more tasks are
automated by AI techniques and I don't
have an illustration for it but
obviously there are concerns also about
law and governance what kinds of laws do
we need for assigning responsibility for
accidents that happen and so on and so
forth and then a sort of third strand of
concerns came out of some work that that
Eric Horvitz and I published in the
communications of the ACM last month
where where we focus a lot on on the
questions of more of autonomy rather
than intelligence because a lot of the I
think the long term concerns and the
medium-term and North Shore term
concerns really comes to the fore when
we create systems likes a real-time
stock trading systems or the automatic
pilot of aircraft that are autonomous
even if they're not terribly
intelligence and so one problem of
course is that
there can be bugs in the software and AI
systems of course particularly ones
trained with machine learning do not
give perfect performance and we can have
errors like this which perhaps in the
hands of a of an automated law
enforcement system might lead to trouble
there are cyber attacks of course and AI
systems open up new venues for for those
attacks there are problems of mixed
autonomy when we have say autopilot
system but where the human operator
needs to take control from time to time
so the control passes back and forth
between the human and the autonomous
system how do we make that combined
system robust there's a tendency I think
among us as as engineers to focus just
on say the self-driving car and not on
the reliable car plus human system and
then the last thing is is this issue of
the computer misunderstanding the user's
instructions which is another way of
saying how does the computer know what
is appropriate behavior versus what a
person might have said briefly like
bring me some water says Mickey Mouse to
the to the to the bewitched broom and
doesn't specify any termination
condition so there's another set of
risks that I think will come up today
these are not really so much the risk of
AI technology but the risks to the AI
research Enterprise so if the fear about
artificial intelligence research
continues to grow and and take root in
the in the mind of the public we can see
research funding cut we could see
corporations that are engaged in AI or
associated with it in some way driven
out of business we could see that legal
uncertainty about the legal status of of
deployed a I could prevent the
deployment or at least slow it and and
and one can imagine even the most
extreme things may be AI research
becomes tightly regulated and can only
be carried out in some kinds of safe
facilities or maybe you know in the
United States it might be placed under
export control which would severely
limit the nationality of students that
could work on it or it could in the
worst case even become classified
so today we're going to deal with three
sets the three main sets of issues and
then perhaps touch on some of those
research Enterprise issues as well so
first we'll we'll have some speakers and
discussion about near-term concerns
including the kind of software
engineering issues i mentioned privacy
the future of human labor and and maybe
some discussion about what are the best
applications to be deploying first then
after coffee break we'll come back and
talk about human level AI and perhaps
discuss what we might even mean by that
term what path technological path might
lead us to it and when and then finally
after the supper break we will engage in
the longer term discussion about super
intelligence fully autonomous systems or
systems over which humans lose control
and what research should we do to
improve the chances of a good outcome so
the goals of the symposium really are to
first help us understand the full range
of issues I think many of us who have
been spending a lot of time thinking
about these issues still feel like we
only understand some of them and then I
think to try to identify what is the
research that we as a research community
can do that is relevant to beneficial AI
so all kinds of things in the area of
safety and robustness and so on what can
we do for instance that might help us do
a more realistic risk assessment of the
loss of control of AI systems and then
perhaps discuss what kinds of policy
should be put in place do we need
something like the underwriters
laboratories to be testing high-risk AI
a deployment of AI and high-risk systems
to somehow certify at safety do we need
new laws on privacy and liability and
and more generally I guess what should
the strategy of us as researchers be as
we begin to see our research turn into
actual deployed systems so the schedule
you've already heard for me
and next we'll have two more speakers
here bring up some incur we'll discuss
various as other facets of the sort of
concerns of today and in the near term
then we'll have a panel discussion the
coffee break and then I said the human
level AI panel dinner and then two
speakers on the long-term prospects Nick
Bostrom and Percy Liang and then a final
panel discussion so I guess let's get
started
