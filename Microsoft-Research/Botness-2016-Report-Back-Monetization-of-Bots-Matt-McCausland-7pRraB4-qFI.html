and i think i should note that this was
more for brand or for bots that were
sort of platforms and their own products
and not bots that were built as sort of
like an ad so so yeah i guess there were
five five ways that we came up with like
traditional app store sort of paper
install like the user pays to install
the app but no one really wanted to do
that type of thing traditional
advertising like after an interaction
ends inside of an app you can show them
an ad there's payment and sort of like a
freemium model where you get some stuff
for free you have to pay for other stuff
that seemed to be pretty realistic
because everybody wants their bought to
have a lot of users I same as apps you
want a lot of users so you want to offer
it for free but then you want to make
money so you want to charge them for
whatever they're using it for it there's
a SAS model that we kept trying to talk
about but it didn't seem like anybody
had any really good ideas there except
for the sort of freemium SAS model and
then there were tools and tech because
we've experienced this and a lot other
people experienced as people go oh you
got this cool platform why don't you
just sell that to people so they can
make a similar bought but with their
brand and no one really wanted to do
that because we all want to own our own
our own brands and products and then
there was selling data which apps
consume a lot of data and it seemed like
it might be unethical in some situations
and maybe against the terms of service
it was actually called monetization and
when to do it because kick rent noted a
problem where they started they were
like okay we got BOTS we got a boat's
shop let's start monetizing this and
they ended up taking a step back because
it seemed like BOTS might not be ready
and so they wanted to get engagement
with bots up and get really engaging
BOTS into their store into their bot
shop and so that that's kind of what
they're working on now figuring out what
drives engagement before they charge for
it and they also realize this is
specific to their user base but they
don't have any money they're kids so
they introduced kick points and there
they're going to release an API to allow
you to consume those kick points so that
the freemium model could be done with
points that kids can actually get for
free because other brand
paid to give them to them so that seems
pretty interesting one one thing that we
spend a lot of time on that kind of blew
all our minds when we realized it was
that monetization is platform-specific
as different platforms have different
ways to monetize and there's one weird
thing that we that that we came across
where a certain platform some platforms
charge for integrations and so if you
have more than 10 integrations then if
your enterprise if your team on slack
has more than 10 integrations then you
have to pay so then the team goes in and
goes okay which of these integrations do
we not need because we're trying to
avoid paying and it's a weird situation
where if you're the 11th one you might
not get added or if you're the first one
you might get booted but you're not
actually getting a cut of that money
even if they decide to pay for unlimited
integrations so there was a weird thing
there we started talking about all the
other platforms that do it this was very
specific to one very specific person in
the group so but I think that it'll be a
symptom everywhere where you can
monetize like the platform's can
monetize on the bots but the bots need
to see some of that money otherwise the
bots disappear and the then the
platforms don't make any money off of
the bots you know you see how that works
so kind of that those are the two main
things that we came up with it might it
might be too soon to monetize bots we
got platforms got to do a lot more
learning and then monetization is
platform-specific thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
