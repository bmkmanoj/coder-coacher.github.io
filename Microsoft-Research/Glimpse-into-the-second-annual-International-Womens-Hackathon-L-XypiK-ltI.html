and we also speak about how to you women
are represented and professional STEM
jobs
and I think whether it's writing or are
or anything that you're doing having a
technical background joining us from the
Hoosier State miss congresswoman Susan
Brooks I'm speaking to you today and to
all of you from Indianapolis via Skype
now that wouldn't have never been
possible when I was your age when I was
growing up I have recently had the
opportunity to learn about Microsoft's
participation in what's called the big
dream movement this is an international
movement that showcases women using
science technology engineering and math
steps skills to transform entire
communities I'm so excited about the
computer science skills that are
bringing you here together in only six
years of 2020 there will be over 1.4
million new computing jobs in our
country but yet we're not turning out
enough young people into these fields to
fill those jobs there's a lot of
technology available and your loan you
no problem the whole vegan use under fit
that's
sheriff
so I want to thank Microsoft for
organizing this hackathon I hope to
visit it someday in person I hope you
have a great weekend and that your hard
work benefits those two great
organizations teens against distracted
driving and the UN Women
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
