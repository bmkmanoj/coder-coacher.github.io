hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
thank you so much for coming my name is
Amy Draves and I'm thrilled to welcome
Gretchen Rubin to the Microsoft Research
visiting speaker series she's here to
discuss her latest book better than
before in which she brings a provocative
yet practical perspective to habits
Gretchen is one of the most influential
writers and bloggers on the topics of
habits happiness and human nature she
started her career in law and was
clerking for Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
when she realized that she really wanted
to be a writer instead so she's since
authored several books including the New
York Times bestsellers happier at home
and the happiness project please join me
in giving her a very warm welcome well
thank you very much a very happy to be
here today I love Seattle so I'm very
excited to be here so I'm gonna talk for
a few minutes about habits and why I was
drawn to the subject of habits and then
I'm going to throw out some things that
surprised me about habits when I was
doing my research so that you can use it
if you want to shape your own habits or
what's much more fun try to shape
somebody else's have it um and then at
the end we'll have time for question and
answers which is always my favorite part
so please be thinking of your questions
I got the idea to study habits because
for years I've been researching and
writing and talking to people about the
subject of happiness and I began to
notice a pattern which was when I talked
to people about a big happiness
challenge they were facing it was very
often something that added score was a
problem with a habit so somebody would
say to me well I'm exhausted all the
time well that's really about the habit
of getting enough sleep or somebody
would say well I want to write a novel
in my free time and that's about the
habit of making consistent progress so I
became more and more drawn to the role
that habits could play in helping us be
happier healthier and more productive
and then I went to lunch with a friend
and she said something that got me
obsessed with habits she said to me well
I have to say I'm a little bit of a
habits bore I'm constantly quizzing
people about their habits and she said
to me well
I would love to have the habit of
exercise I know that would make me
happier and here's the thing when I was
in high school I was on the track team I
never miss track practice but I can't go
running now why and I thought well why
it's the same person same behavior at
one time it was effortless now she can't
do it what is going on and I became
determined to solve the puzzle of habits
and as I got into it I became more and
more curious about subjects that no one
ever seemed to talk about like it's
maybe easy to understand why we have
trouble forming the habit of something
we don't like to do but why is it that
people just as often complain about not
being able to for him to have it as
something they love to do why is it that
we're so unmoved by the consequences of
our bad habits research suggests that up
to fifty percent of american adults do
not take prescription medication for a
chronic health condition why is it that
habits sometimes form overnight
sometimes they vanish just as abruptly
so I became determined to figure all
this out but there were three questions
that I felt I had to tackle before I
really got into it and I'm sure you've
thought about these questions yourself
if you thought about your own habits and
one is why even bother thinking about
habits I mean we've all got a lot to do
why worry about your habits well it
turns out that habits are like the
invisible architecture of everyday life
studies suggested about forty percent of
everyday existence is shaped by our
habits if we have habits that work for
us we're much more likely to be happier
healthier and more productive if we
change our habits we change our lives so
what is a habit anyway and a lot of
times they have it when you read about
habits there's a focus on repetition
frequency the familiarity of cues around
a habit but I have really come to
believe that the key aspect about a
habit is decision making or really the
lack of decision-making habits are
freeing and energizing because they get
us out of the draining difficult
business of making decisions and using
our self control I do not decide to get
up at 6am I do not decide to skip
dessert I made those decisions long ago
this is my habit that
behaviors on automatic pilot it takes
nothing for me now when I tell people
I'm writing about habits a lot of times
they say well that's important because I
want to go through my day making healthy
choices and I'm like no you don't
because there every time you make a
healthy choice you have the opportunity
to make the wrong choice choose once and
then stop choosing make it a habit and
then you don't have to make decisions
you don't have to use your self-control
so then the question is okay well how do
you change i have it and there is no
shortage of expert advice right do it
first thing in the morning start small
give yourself a cheap dick do it for 30
days all of these work for some people
sometimes but they don't work for
everybody all the time and what i found
is that there are 21 different
strategies that we can use to make or
break our habits and sometimes people
get kind of terrified when I tell them
they're 21 it's too many you know give
me three but it's actually good to have
21 because it means there's a whole menu
from which to choose some of these work
for some people and not others some of
these are available to us at some times
in our lives but not at other times so
there's a lot to choose from but the
most important thing the crucial step
that I think so many people skip to
their detriment is that we have to begin
by thinking about ourselves what is true
about you if you want to change your
habit how are you going to do it in the
way that's right for you because just
because it works for somebody else to do
it certain way doesn't mean it's going
to work for you and I think a lot of
times when people fail when they accused
themselves of being lazy or lacking self
control it's because they've tried to
form a habit that was never right for
them in the first place for instance
morning people and night people this is
a real thing I'm a morning person and I
used to think everybody could be a
morning person if they would just go to
sleep on time no it's genetically
determined to a large degree and it's
also a function of age there is a real
difference between morning people at
night people and I have a friend who is
a hardcore night person he's barely can
get to work on time in the morning he's
at his most help you know energetic and
creative and productive much later in
the day any
look me in the eye and said this year my
new year's resolution is to get up early
every day and go for a run and I said
have you met your stuff because this is
not going to work for you it might work
for me because I'm a morning person but
for you that is not the right way to set
it up there's a better habit strategy
for you that's going to take into
account what's true for you okay how
many people here are morning people how
many people here are nice people right
it's a real thing so set it up on the
way that's right for you so now I'm
going to talk about some strategies to
think about as you're thinking about
yourself and as you're thinking about
how you can set up your habits for
success and again these are things that
surprised me strategy of monitoring you
all know about the strategy of
monitoring if you monitor behavior
you're much likely to do a better job we
don't have talked about that get your
Fitbit you know use your app to budget
to keep track your spending it's
powerful it's effective but it's
familiar but here's something that
surprised me and that is the strategy of
abstaining and this is a strategy that
works extremely well for some people and
does not work at all for other people
you must figure out if you were an
abstainer or a moderator so abstainers
are people like me and I realized I was
an abstainer when I was reading
something front by the the 18th century
essayist Samuel Johnson one of my
favorite writers and Samuel Johnson goes
to a party and someone asked him if he
would take a little wine &amp;amp; Johnson says
I can't take a little abstinence is as
easy to me as temperance would be
difficult meaning i can have none but i
can't have a little and when I read that
I thought that is me I can have no
cookies or i can have seven cookies I
can't have one cookie I have never had
half a dish of ice cream in my life and
the thing about abstainers and this has
to do with a strong temptation when
you're facing a strong temptation
standards are like All or Nothing people
we find it pretty easy to have none but
once we start we're going to go all the
way but we find it pretty easy not to
have any now moderators by contrast get
kind of panicky and rebellious if
they're told they can never
have something they do better when they
have a little bit or when they have it
sometimes and when I understood the
difference between modern I brought
moderators and abstainers a mystery that
had plagued me my entire life became
clear which is what is up with those
people that keep the bar of fine
chocolate in their desk drawer at work
and once a day they have one square of
fine chocolate because if it were me my
entire day would be concerned with now
later 23 it's my birthday it's raining
you know the whole day would be about
that candy bar until it was gone because
I'm an abstainer but for a moderator
that's what they like to do so who here
thinks they're an abstainer and who here
thinks they're a moderator so here you
see the seeds of many a marital fight
and an office conflict because one
person walks in with a giant box of
donuts the other person said why didn't
you bring in the donuts you know I'm
going to eat the whole the whole box
today and the other person says you just
need to learn how to manage yourself
better and high jinks ensue it's not
that one person's right and one person
is wrong it's just that there are
different ways of fighting strong
temptation and this isn't just about
food it often comes up with technology
you know it's like my sister she said to
you know candy crush was actually
affecting her career I know a guy who
said that it took him an extra year to
write his PhD thesis because of World of
Warcraft sometimes you can't have a
little bit it's easier to have none so
it's just good to know yourself and
which strategy works for you and accept
the fact that just because something
works for you doesn't mean that it's the
right strategy for someone else and this
sort of related but much more fun is the
strategy of treats this is definitely
the most fun strategy of all the
strategy to have a change so treats
energize us when we give ourselves
treats we feel energized we feel cared
for we we feel taken care of we're like
cell phones that need to get a charge
and a treat is not the same thing as a
reward a reward is something that you
have to earn or justify a treat is
something that you get just because you
want it and treats are important because
when we give ourselves treats our
self-command Rises if there's one thing
that we all want it's a lot of
self-command especially when we're
trying to keep our good
habits and research shows this when they
would give people a little treat either
in the form of a little gift or having
them watch a funny video people
self-command rose and so you want to
have a lot of ideas for how to give
yourself some features a healthy treat
so that if you're if you're in that mode
when you're thinking I need it I want
I've got to have it you reach for
something healthy and you know some
people can't really think easily of what
their treats would be so you want to be
thinking about what you could do so I
know a guy who he doesn't even like
camping but he loves the stuff so he'll
go to a camping store just like look
around that's for him as a treat I have
a friend who has to get her whole family
out the door in the morning and so she
gets dressed she gets to everybody out
the door and then she gets back into bed
fully dressed and she says it's the best
part of my day um you know and it could
be playing with your dog I have a
podcast now with my sister I'm happy
with Gretchen Rubin and a lot of people
say they use podcasts to give themselves
a little treat buying yourself new music
whatever it might be so that when you
feel like you need that jolt of energy
you have it but you want to give
yourself healthy treats um because
unhealthy treats are very attractive and
you don't want to do something to make
yourself feel better that in the end
just makes you feel worse and what are
the three big areas of healthy treats
and healthy treats I think you know food
and drink shopping and screen time for
some people these can be healthy treats
for many people they're better avoid
them because they can quickly become
unhealthy trees the treats matter
because when we give more to ourselves
we can ask more from ourselves now this
next thing that that that surprised me I
have to say it was so surprising to me
it was so opposite of what I expected to
see that for a long time I like sort of
denying my observation of the world
because I couldn't make sense of it and
what was really weird was that I kept
hearing the same exact story from
different people i mean same exact store
like like as if they were all getting
the same message beamed into their
brains from the CIA because it was
practically verbatim and most memorably
and the thing where I really decided I
had to figure out
was going on was I was at my college
reunion and I am a habits bore and i
will ask everybody about their habits so
i was talking to my friend brad about
his habits and and Brad told me the
story which was like the 10th time that
I'd heard this identical story and Brad
said I wanted to get in the habit of
exercise I wanted to get back at the
habit of running so I decided to train
for the marathon and I ran the marathon
and I love training for the marathon and
I had a great time running the marathon
and then I took off those rest days that
they tell you to take after you run the
marathon and I haven't run since and
I've heard this from many people
specifically about the marathon and then
I thought well you know and there are
other examples of this oh I gave up
sugar for Lent and I thought this is
great I finally quit sugar now even more
sugar than ever oh my friends and I did
a yoga 30 day yoga challenge and I
thought this is amazing i'm doing so
much to yoga now I don't do any yoga see
this didn't make sense to me because
what I would have said what I would have
predicted would have been that these
kind of accomplishments hitting a goal
like this it's going to energize
somebody it's going to make them feel
positive it's gonna make them feel more
attached to the habit it's gonna like
it's going to make that habit solidify
but that's not what I was seeing it
seemed like it was having the opposite
effect it wasn't helping it was actually
seeming to cut off the habit but she
didn't I like what was up with that and
then I finally realized what it was it's
that these people were hitting a goal
they had crossed the finish line the
marathon the 30 day yoga challenge Lent
and what happens when you cross the
finish line you're finished it's over
and then if you want to do that again
you have to start over and starting over
is often much harder than starting and
that the finish line was kicking people
into a feeling of that it was over they
had been aiming for it and now they were
off the hook and the thing about setting
a goal is setting a goal is a great way
to reach a goal but with habits it's
often not about hitting a goal it's
about doing something indefinitely now
don't think about that because that can
scare people when they think about like
indefinitely so just let that be a misty
hays but it's not about running the
marathon it's about exercising forever
it's not about quitting sugar for Lent
it's about eating more healthfully
forever and so it's much better in
habits not to be thinking of finish
lines but to think be thinking of
milestones it's an exciting milestone to
run the marathon but that is just one of
many milestones that you will pass in
your lifetime of exercise and I think
this is one of the reasons why I
successfully eaters often end up failing
because typically what happens when we
go on tonight we said okay I weigh 160
pounds my goal is to weigh 140 pounds oh
I lost my goal weight of 20 pounds now I
can go back to eating normally and what
happens when you mean normally you go
right back to 160 and maybe you even
blow by it it's not about hitting that
goal it's about just passing the
milestone and the last this one I'll
talk about very briefly because this is
weird I just didn't think about it for
years because it came up and happiness
and I still can't I can't figure it out
but it's true it's true for me and it
seems to be true for a lot of people
which is the weird degree to which for
most people outer order contributes to
inner calm inner calm and her
self-command a sense of energy a sense
of optimism it is clearly trivial if
you've got an overflowing coat closet or
you're in basket is stuck with paper and
yet over and over people tell me that
when they get control of their stuff in
this of the stuff of life they feel more
in control of their lives generally if
it's an illusion it's a helpful illusion
and I had a friend who said to me I last
night I cleaned out my fridge and now I
know I could switch careers and I knew
exactly what that felt like it is just
weird and if all the habits that people
say that they've changed that have
specifically made them feel happier
healthier more productive and I'm not
saying this is the biggest change that
you could make in your life the most
significant change but he does seem to
be the thing that people like most often
specifically mentioned is the habit of
making your bed there's something about
this little habit that makes people
happier how many people here regularly
make their bed how many people who
regularly make their bed in a hotel room
on the morning they check out
yes we will talk later there's something
about this little habit so think about
making your bed and here's another kind
of because because maintaining order is
really hard there's constantly that's
come on the surface of life that we have
to fight and here's a good habit for
your consideration the one minute rule
anything that you can do in less than a
minute do without delay if you can hang
up your coat if you can print a document
and file it if you can scan something
and throw it away if you can put your
coffee mug in the sink this keeps all
that stuff from just accumulating it's
trivial on its own but it can make us
feel weighed down and when you get rid
of that stuff it's just weird how often
people say that they just feel they just
feel freer and and and it just form more
full of possibility and the last thing
that I'm going to talk about I have to
say of everything in my entire life that
I have ever any intellectual challenge
that I have ever faced this was the
biggest intellectual challenge that I
struggled with and it almost like I
could feel the smoke pouring out of my
ears at certain points when I was trying
to understand this and this is this
personality framework which I I saw
through the lens of habits but then I
realized it's actually much bigger than
habits on call it which I call the four
tendencies and so what I'm going to do
is I'm and explain the four tendencies
and then I'm going to go through i'm
going to ask you to raise your hand
because that'll be very curious to see
who's here where you are on the four
tendencies and then i'll go back and
make some observations about the poor
1080 see you can think about how you
might use your knowledge of your
tendency to manage yourself better or
how to get along better with other
people but before i start i want to make
a few notes first of all it sounds
really boring when i start but i promise
it gets to do see so stay with me and
the other thing is that sometimes I get
the feeling that people are trying to
figure out what is the best tendency and
kind of shove themselves in their
category um but this is like anything
happy to do is self-knowledge it's only
helpful if you're honest with yourself
all of these include people that all
categories include people who are very
very successful and also big big losers
so you know be honest so here we go the
four tendencies
well you know they say there are two
kinds of people the kind of people who
like to divide people and to get two
kinds of people and the kind of people
who don't I definitely am the kind who
does so you're going to hear it right
now so it this has to do with whether
you're an upholder a questioner an
obligor or a rebel and the what's
different is how do you respond to an
expectation so there are outer
expectations like a work deadline or
request from a sweetheart and there are
interests in our expectations like your
own desire to keep a new year's
resolution your own desire to get back
into practicing guitar so upholders
readily meet outer and inner
expectations alike they meet at work
deadlines they keep a new year's
resolution without much fuss they really
want to meet others expectations from
them but their expectations for
themselves are just as important or more
important next question errs questioners
question all expectations they will do
it if they agree that it makes sense
they hate anything arbitrary or
inefficient they are very interested in
explanations so in a sense they make
everything into an inner expectation
because they'll do it only if they
endorse it next obligors obligors
readily meet at our expectations but
they struggle to meet in our
expectations and this explains the
mystery of my friend on the track team
when she had a team and a coach waiting
for her she had no trouble showing up
but when it was just herself her own
expectation that she was going running
it was much harder for her finally
rebels rebels resist all expectations
outer and inner alike if you ask her
tell them to do something they are very
likely to resist they want to do their
own work in their own way in their own
time and they don't even like to tell
themselves what to do like take a class
at ten a.m. on saturday no okay so those
are the four categories so now i'm going
to ask you to raise your hand first
upholders readily meet outer and inner
like I'm my hands up because I'm in a
folder okay next question is questioners
question all expectations will do
something if they think it makes sense
next obligors obligors readily me
outer struggle to me dinner finally
rebels rebels resist all outer and inner
alike okay oh okay and who here feels
like they do by the way if you're
thinking to yourself I question the
validity of this framework that's a good
time at your questioner um so and he'll
hear feel like they were not they do not
find themselves in this framework at all
okay pretty good um okay so what we saw
here is very very typical overall rebel
is a tiny tendency very few people are
rebels it's a conspicuous tendency but
it's tiny what came as a shock to me was
to realize that my tendency upholder
tendency is also tiny very few people
are up holders and this came as a huge
shock to me as I was writing my book and
I basically had to rewrite the book when
I realized you know I went into it
thinking that I was very typical and it
turns out i'm on the freaky fringe which
by the way came as a shock to no one
except me that i have an extreme
personality but i did not realize that
it turns out very few people or
upholders so rebels and upholders of the
two extreme personalities their small
overwhelmingly people are questioners
and obligors overwhelmingly now this
room it's interesting i can never really
i think obligor is the biggest tennessee
in this room we had more questioners but
we had a lot of obligors do so those are
the big ones and that has a lot of
implications for anyone designing
products or devices or doctors or anyone
trying to get people to do things you've
got to remember that a lot of people
that you're going to try to convince
need either that they need to be reached
through their questioners Tennessee or
they're a blogger Tennessee so what are
some things to observe generally about
the tendencies and some things that
maybe you can be thinking about as
you're thinking about people at work
people at home friends like whenever
you're trying to get along with other
people what can you take into account so
first of all the tendencies I believe
are hard-wired they are a pervasive
aspect of your personality you're not
one thing at one time of your life in
something at another time of your life
though we can often be difficult to tell
what a child is by the time we're adults
I think that is
what you are it doesn't change in
context they're not tied to gender
they're not tied to birth order or you
know religious upbringing this is part
of you know the hardwired aspect of your
personality and people often table can
you change your tendency and the fact is
I think with wisdom and experience you
can learn how to get harness the
strengths of your tendency and offset
the negative parts of your tendency but
I don't think you really can change your
Tennessee except for like the rare you
know every once in a while I don't know
about you but very few times i have met
somebody who truly has been changed they
are not the person that they once were
either they had like a catastrophic
health challenge or they went through a
period of addiction or something
fundamentally change them other than
that I think your tendency is what it is
and rather than worry about changing
your tendency which is what some people
want to do it's better to think about
how to bring about the circumstances
that are going to allow you to thrive so
let me make a few observations about the
different about the different tendencies
because they all have sort of their own
striking patterns upholders on you know
they're great they're their self
starters they get things done so they're
eat their kind of easy to have around
except that they can be very hard on
other people because they don't have a
lot of empathy for what other people
might have trouble following through for
things they can be kind of cold and kind
of judgmental because they kind of get
their own thing going they got to take
care of themselves they put a high value
on things like self-command and
execution and you know it's like oh yeah
I know you want me to help you proof
read that report but I cut my own report
on yeah you want me to help you with
your homework but I got to go for my
daily run I have a friend one of my law
school roommate she's even more of an
apolar than I am and she told me that
like in last year she'd not gone to the
gym like five times which to me I was
like wow that's pretty cool other people
like that is sick that's crazy you know
so that's very upholder like you're
sticking to your things and you're going
to follow through questioners now and
there's a lot of questions in the room
so I'm going to talk a little bit at
greater length listeners so one of the
things about questions can be terrific
to have around because they are very
healthy
organizations because they're the ones
saying like why are we doing it by
Friday why are we using the software why
are we hiring this firm why are we doing
this at all why am i listening to you
yeah that's really good they're keeping
people from wasting their time they're
super interested in efficiency they love
data Excel spreadsheets often like very
associated with on with questioners and
um and so that's that can be really
healthy to have around however Questers
can also drain other people and
organizations because their constant
questioning if a team has decided that a
question has been asked and answered and
the question will not let it go then
everybody else can get very exasperated
by that also like sometimes they're
questioning can seem to be undermining
or uncooperative or not showing a team
spirit so for instance a question who's
in a classroom who's questioning a
teacher or a boss who's being questioned
might feel like their authority is being
undermined or they might feel like that
person is not showing respect where the
questioner is like it's not that I mean
I just I just want to understand like
why are we doing this but sometimes it
can come across in a bad way and this is
a place where more socially adduct
questioners are good at framing things
like yeah I I really i don't see why
we're going this way so help me
understand it so I can do a better job
execute you know instead of being like
that doesn't make any sense orale it
that way you know which which sometimes
questions are often really annoyed by
the stupidity of the world and here's a
weird thing about customers they often
have trouble with traffic regulations
this comes up on over and over again
when i talk to questioners they're like
it's totally arbitrary that we're all
supposed to drugs same speed limit like
what is up with that i'm not going to
abide by that law I'm like well good
luck with that but so the arbitrariness
of something like that really bothers
them um now in some questioners now some
questioners are very decisive but some
can almost they will complain of
analysis paralysis they love information
and so they want to have more and more
information they can get very caught up
in that because it's so fulfilling to
them and sometimes they don't like to
make decisions unless they have perfect
information which sometimes you don't
have the luxury of waiting or even
having perfect information available to
you and so if you were a questioner like
that you feel like you're getting you're
draining yourself or other people or
you're managing
unlike that it can be very helpful to
say something like well we need a
decision by friday by friday i have to
have your best judgement we're going to
interview five people but not 15 people
you know to to put a limit on it so that
there isn't this endless spin I mean it
my good friend of mine is a cluster and
she's married to a questioner and she
said you know we needed to get a new
dishwasher and it took two years because
every time we was like well what's the
best dish wonder we're gonna get the
dishwashers we need to get a new
countertop but if you're going to do the
kitchen like should we do the roof and
you know and she's like David and then
finally she's like we're gonna get a new
dishwasher by Friday you know like best
like best offer that we've just got to
act because they work spinning into
analysis paralysis um then obligors so
obligors they readily meet outer but
struggle to me dinner so obligors of the
rock of the world because they are the
ones that will come through on but they
struggle to do things for themselves and
i will say that of all the tendencies
obligors are the ones that are the most
likely to say that they do not like
aspects of their Tennessee because they
get very frustrated by the fact that
they see themselves meeting the
expectations of others but they're
unable to meet the expectations of
themselves and I think often they
misunderstand the dynamic often and
obliged sir might think that what's
going on is I have low self-esteem or I
can't make myself a priority or you know
others are you know like constantly
interfering with my ability to do the
things i want to do but here's the thing
if you are in a blighter or you are
working with an obligor or living with
an obliging which you certainly are
because it's a very large tendency the
answer the secret no way to get an
obligor to meet an inner expectation is
to put an external expectation on it
it's all about accountability when there
is accountability external
accountability the obligors can do
whatever it is this is the answer so for
my friend on the track team if I knew
then what i knew now i would say run
with a friend run with your dog sign up
with a trainer take a class where they
take attendance or if you're some
advisers feel accountable if they pay
for things some don't that's an
important thing to know about yourself
like does that matter if
is very cheap so I bet she would really
care if she paid and she would show up
if she paid find the way to have the
external accountability and I have loved
hearing from obliges about the creative
ways that they have figured out ways to
give themselves external accountability
for their inner expectations okay so two
of my favorite examples one was a woman
who lived by herself and she wanted to
get up get up earlier so you're like
well how would you create external
accountability for getting up earlier if
you're like a little bit yourself so
what she did is she went on to the
social media management platform
HootSuite and she set up a very
embarrassing Facebook post to post every
morning at eight fifteen a.m. unless she
gets up to disable it I talked it to
guys and when they work out they they
swap shoes so if you don't come tomorrow
then I can't work out because you've got
my right so they're all these ways
to build an external accountability once
an obligor realizes that that is what
the necessary pieces here's another is
very striking pattern obligors obligors
will meet meet meet expectations and
then suddenly they will snap and they
will refuse and oblige your rebellion
where they will refuse to do something
now this can be small and symbolic it
can also be explosive and destructive
and this is very important to try not to
allow obligors to get into that place of
deep burn out and resentment because it
can be very destructive so for instance
in the workplace this often comes up
obliges are very valuable team members
often because they are meeting external
expectations and if somebody else asked
them to help out they will but then they
feel exploited and taken advantage of
and by the way they are because who
doesn't a polder requested or a rebel go
to for help go to the obligor and so and
so then they get overloaded and they're
just like I'm out of here and over and
over I've heard from obligors who are
like you know what I I didn't say word I
decided I had enough I walked out the
door and like they wanted to have the
conversation about what does it need
what do we need to offer you to get you
to stay and I want I just had enough so
we always want to be looking for ways to
keep obligors from getting into that
deep burn out or being taken advantage
of and exploited by others like
ourselves I'm so they don't fall into a
pleasure rebellion and then finally
rebels and then we'll go
two questions my favorite part so rebels
resist all expectations outer and inner
like they want to act from freedom and
choice they won't express their
authentic self at all times and if you
are working with a rebel you want to be
very careful that you don't accidentally
trip there their feelings of resistance
and this is very easy to do because you
could do something like hey read this
book you'll love it I can be like no I'm
not gonna read it hey cuz that you're
telling me what to do oh this is so
great you're following the doctor's
orders he can't tell me what to do I'm
in fact I had a friend who had she is a
she has a rebel father so they go to the
doctor and the doctors like mr. so and
so you absolutely have to take your
medication you better follow my orders
because if you don't do this you're
gonna fall into a high-risk group and
blah blah blah blah blah so they go out
on the street on the sidewalk he turns
her and says what do you think should i
take the medicine yeah ah now why would
you bother and he said what you want me
to die and he takes it always making the
choice and so if you're working with a
rebel like say a rebel child or you've
got a real trouble team member it's like
it's things like wow it would really
make everybody's life easier if we could
get this project done by before spring
break that's just information and the
rebel can act on it or not they can
choose a rebel to a you know to say to a
rebel child well you know to get to have
your choice of colleges a person has to
have good sht scores that's this
information act on it with you well
because they will often rise to a
challenge they want to do things often
that are going to make them successful
or loving or consider it but it needs to
come from a place of choice not duty not
obligation not what's polite now we said
you did not what everybody expects you
to do not because I said so because
they're choosing but one but they can do
anything that they choose to do and that
is very powerful so the last thing I
would say and then then we'll have
questions it's just I really do think
that it's worth taking the time to think
about your habits because they are so
pervasive they are so powerful they are
so freeing and when we change our habits
we can change our lives so thank you now
you get a gold star if you ask the first
question because nobody likes to be
first out and I believe you were a rebel
were you a rebel okay so rebels always
want to sit in the front of the back I
don't know what's up with that are you
rebel to see from bag how crazy thought
okay so you use for over 24 times
Candice types be situational like for
example can it be that one with my way
manager oh wait something so the
question isn't dependent on context like
you're one in one context and one on the
other and I really don't think so
because often when people think that
they're a mix really they're not so if
you say something like I'm an upholder
at work but I'm a rebel with myself
that's the definition of an obligor
right I'm meeting external expectations
like it worked but when I'm trying to
get myself to do something I don't do it
so that's actually the sort of the
definition of an obligor or I spoke at a
high school and I talked to a guy who
said well I'm gonna pull like I'm a mix
because when I'm talking to like I have
a teacher that I that I like and I
respect and that teacher gives me
homework I'll do it like a nap holder
but if I don't like the teacher I won't
do it like a rebel and I was like no
that's questioner because the
questioners first question is why am i
listening to you if you don't have my
trust if you don't have I don't have
respect for your authority I'm not going
to do it and so that's very questioner
so I think often we look like a mix
depending on situation but it's actually
the same tendency just showing its face
in a different way because it's a
different circumstance yeah we do
practically measure 25 happiness is to
say this is how happy I want yesterday
yeah so the question is can you quantify
happiness and there's a huge amount of
research and there's all kinds for is it
the master's in applied positive
psychology or anyway it's the mat
program at the University of
Pennsylvania they have like a thousand
quizzes and tests that you can take yeah
there are I find them completely
annoying and I did it once and turned
out a one to ten scale on the seven
unhappiness thank you um but but I I
don't find that myself to be helpful to
constantly
trying to be quantifying but there's
actually there's a huge amount of
research trying to do that yeah load
your advice for are giving up sugar yeah
so after I've I'll tell you a few things
that drive and you can let me know what
works what doesn't so for me yes yeah
really a poor tendency you have a
question or so much ok but so one thing
was I tried to quit cool delay group for
TVs without sugar work it has a lot of
benefits and then you can stick with it
because you'd realize the benefits I
didn't last past the third day he didn't
come right up sir boom I get no sugar at
home yeah that's what really well that's
the strategy of convenience ok you're
not very vogue video it means if I have
something like yeah listing it yeah and
then the other thing we'll just have a
stool leg after work out I can teach
myself in sugar reverse reward no back
back away back away just have three
bites Oh moderation right so this is
what a nutritionist will said you have
three pies just satisfy that little
sweet tooth you sound like an abstainer
my friend you got to go off that thing
all right all together okay well so I'm
a hundred percent of sent you would not
believe what I've seen from like I am
like a low-carbon attic I mean really um
and so it so to me but to me it's so
freeing it is hard for me like I can't
even get my mind around the three bites
but you're very smart to make it
convenient to stick to it so there's 21
strategies one of the most powerful
strategy strategy convenience and its
end and the the corollary which is the
strategy inconvenience so you want to
make a very inconvenient to eat sugar
and very convenient not to so cleaning
out your house is good and then
bright-line rules are often very
effective like I'm not going to have
like my sister's a type type 1 diabetic
and she's a TV writer and I don't mean
you cannot believe the food that they
have around TV writers it's just insane
and so her rule is that it's at work
she's absolutely strict with herself and
then at home she's much more loose but
it's work she's very strict so you could
try that as I say I think that like
having the three bites like try it if it
works for you that's great if it doesn't
work for you tribe staining that's much
easier on one of the things about
cravings is that cravings are more
ignited by possibility they did
fascinating study rockland with
everybody smoke of flight attendants and
what they found is that no matter like
if they were on a three-hour flight or
an eight-hour flight they're craving for
nicotine kicked in like a hat like a
certain amount of time from landing it
wasn't the time in the body free of
nicotine it was the possibility of
having a cigarette so if you're like I
don't eat that then that craving just
diminishes but so the possibility and
then about having I'm going to reward
myself to hook a rewards the strategy
rewards is one of them is complex and I
think misunderstood strategies within
habit change which is how do you deploy
rewards to get yourself to stick to a
habit and there's only one way I think
that it can effectively work the only
reward for a habit that you should give
yourself well the obvious reward is
there's the reward of the habit itself
so one reward is I'm not eating sugar
and so I have all the rewards that flow
from eating sugar but can I give myself
an additional reward the additional
reward is anything that logically flows
from that so like let's say I was doing
a lot of yoga a reward that would be
appropriate would be I'm going to get a
new yoga mat because a person who does a
lot of yoga needs a new yoga mat or I've
decided that I'm going to bring lunch
from home every day I'm going to reward
myself by buying some fancy kitchen
knives because a person who's doing a
lot of cooking needs kitchen knives but
when you get it but so often we reach
for personal rewards which is things
like that actually counteract any
benefit that we would get oh I'm going
to go for runs I'm going to get myself a
beer okay those are things there just
like this and what often happens with
people because the way we are is that
the habit will fall away and you keep
the reward because you're like well and
then I'm in the habit of having a beer
every day when i get home for here like
well no one could expect me to go for
run today because i hurt my foot oh it's
raining so hard but i still get my beer
it's like no yeah you know i mean this
is the thinking and so it's like don't
don't the treats treats treats treats
you can say you know one of my favorite
treats was a guy a friend of mine
history is that when he loves Cinnabon
but you know that's like dangerous to go
there so his reward is that when he is
in the newark airport he gets tough
Cinnabon and the fact is that's okay
because he's not going to go out of his
way to go to the newark airport is to
get a cinema
if he was saying to himself every time I
run I get a Cinnabon that thing could be
fired up seven days a week you know and
so so you won think very carefully vetri
words and and and i will say and I say
this is a total low-carb fanatic and so
take it from what it's worth from my
experience when you give it up
altogether cravings fade it's just all
that noise just goes out of your head is
just over and so for me that works a
little it does not that is not the
strategy that works most successfully
for other people most people do not want
to totally eliminate it and I talk in
the book about like how you can sort of
eliminate it but manage it with things
like anticipated breaks like oh I'm
looking forward to on saturday i'm going
to have or like my friend who went to
montana whose total low carb like me but
when he went to Montana there was a
famous pie place so he decided his rule
was that he could have pie at every meal
he had 21 pieces of pie in a week but he
never had it was with ice cream he never
brought it back to his hotel room he
didn't bring any home with him he had
his pie he loved having his fly was an
important part of the vacation for him
and then he came back to his regular
life and it was over and so he got he
but he anticipated he he figured out how
he wanted to handle that have it in
advance but you want to avoid is when
your chit you know you're invoking that
loophole on the fly oh it's my birthday
oh it's specially the house oh it's
gonna hurt your feelings if I don't
order a birthday cake you know oh yeah I
would not use what no but cheat day no
cheat day is like once every seven days
write to me if for an abstainer that is
not healthy you just become to cut into
this is like it's your anniversary
you're in Paris you know like okay
tonight you know this is your one to
once a year thing cheat day starts to be
well yeah I have my cheat day on
Saturday but then near Z this monday
it's kind of the same thing you know
that 230 get out of that man that
strategy table safeguards there's a hole
there Lupul spotting which is there's 10
categories of loopholes so we were
constantly evoke a you know like the
fake self actualization loophole life's
too short not to eat a brownie you know
but anyway got we got 10 categories with
us you can keep that going all day long
so you want to fight those loopholes
yeah question for you about the four
type so um I listen to your podcast
where you had the four times yeah and
they all called in and let the voicemail
at their mantras yeah everyone to them I
noticed that there were no rebels that
call no no there was an amazing rebel
motto which one was that why it was you
can't make me and neither can I they
know there were several there were
several is there a cause for rebel to be
apathetic like are the is their resource
of where they're like non-voters for
example Oh in that bitter thing I don't
know yeah he's talking about a lazier
ever 00 p Leah that's one of the one of
the very important things to point out
is that this is one very tiny slice it's
very it's very influential and how your
how you move through the world but it's
a very small aspect so like take a rebel
a rebel is going to look very different
if they're considerate if you have a
loving rebel rebel is going to act very
differently from a rebel who doesn't
really care about other people or how
smart you are or how ambitious you are
how creative you are or how anxious you
are all these things come into play and
so there can be this gigantic range and
how it comes now some rebels are
extremely cause driven you know and and
they can be super powerful because they
can break the rules they can break
convention to do what they want and
others know so I think that has more to
do with the other parts of your
personality and how it can come out
because all these tendencies can be very
positive and you know helpful for you in
for society and then there are other
than their ways where it can come out
where it can be less successful you know
more destructive absolutely yeah hi huge
fan and I am a question on a plug for a
podcast oh ok so I'm a folder yeah so
finding this apartment okay so I've all
be beautiful have it yes and the one of
the biggest things I've heard about
parenthood is you just don't know
you don't know if you're gonna get you
know but I also you want to think about
how do i lay habits for continuing
exercise in the yoga yeah so it was
curious what you've heard from your
parents and advice no he's doing may so
you have time to write a book about it
yeah we're kind of a daughter Cassie's
right yeah yeah we'll see this is a very
upholder question because up holders are
very interested in kind of excellent
execution and also in managing
themselves to be able to perform and so
the idea like well maybe you're not
gonna be able to go to the gym for three
months to annap holder that's very
anxiety-provoking slate which is that
when we go through a major transition
whether it's a new baby a new
relationship a new job moving on all our
habits are wiped away and new habits
come in and so what you want to do and
it will probably come easily to you as
an upholder is to really think about
well okay I've got this the baby arrives
everything's changing how do I want to
build in the habits that I want and to
think about it from the beginning
because whatever habits form in the
beginning are very likely to persist
persist you want to start as you would
continue now one of the things that
about a boo baby is the sleep
deprivation your sleep is so disturbed
and so you're sleeping is has to be the
top priority and and so if other things
have to you know you might in your mind
have a set of priorities of like what
are the most important habits that need
to be honored and so not everything
might be able to do right away now I
don't know if you know about the three
month mark which is everything becomes
dramatically easier two or three months
and so you could even say to yourself
okay well I mean have three minutes
which is like the Super newborn stage
and then it's some things I'll worry
about once we get get to that mark
because then things are going to start
getting easier but it is a big
transition and it does affect a lot of
people's habits they wiped away and then
they don't always come back in a good
way so that's very smart to think about
yeah change it because at first I picked
myself to the question Oh Kevin came
with me like you're a rebel ah loo I
mean yes you through it I think for me
it's just like how you a lot of stuff
doc yeah sharpen it be a rebel yeah yeah
but is the clarification that like so
that you find as soon as there's a rule
i find it like ruins yeah okay that's
the difference yeah good sometimes okay
not to get to like getting making it
sound too complex but it does with a lot
of the tendencies like they overlap with
other Tennessee said that you sort of
tip to one way or another so you might
be a rebel who sort of tips to question
her and so it's pretty easy for you to
go along with rule like you're convinced
that it makes sense but your first
impulse is still that push back like I
don't want you to tell me what to do I
don't like that it says no cell phones
on the wall watch people up my cell
phone and start talking on the phone you
know but but but rebels can be super
successful and super high performing if
that's what they want that's a very
rubble way of thinking pretty good
sprinter that's and if you and I work
together it would be important for us to
recognize that we have this difference
because I'm like the one like let's make
a let's make a sheet of all the top five
things we're getting out of that you'd
be like no my god you know that's gonna
drive me crazy you know like that um I I
literally had a rebel back away from me
one time when she was like cuz i said i
said discipline is my freedom issues
like freedom means no rules I was like
yeah whoa we're not talking the same
language yeah and you said people
mention things that they wanted to
achieve and you said I saw habits as
kind of the core thing ya did you have
you found anything that's kind of before
habits like for example i'm thinking of
like big beliefs for example like for
example wife maybe like beliefs that
that makeup habits for example like
maybe a rebel says i want to be a rebel
so this but maybe they believe in
freedom has absolute thing freedom from
themselves and freedom from other people
yeah that is there something before
habits that that explains you know what
you're really about that that's an
interesting question um you know the the
it's an interesting question to of how
much of our beliefs
flow from our nature and how much is our
nature shaped by our beliefs i met my
own mind haven't really decided what I
think about that are my values am I in a
holder because those are the values i
have or do the values make me in a
folder i don't think so so I don't know
that's a very good question it's that's
interesting yeah Joan on hypnosis and
have it making anything I tried that but
the happiest project I tried have
noticed this cuz I thought well this is
gonna be like the easy shortcut right
like I'm just going to hit my ties
myself into perfection I did not find
that it worked and basically the way
that I had tried hypnosis it was like
basically about like what do they call
that it wasn't like a passive thing it
was like I had to sit there and
constantly be mindful II you know
picturing what I was doing like this is
way too much work I mean this is just
like basically focused attention image I
forget the name of it there's a word for
that but and so then I had this
experience and I sort of dropped it so I
haven't I haven't I haven't done any
further research on that I like anything
there's probably people who do it very
well and it's very successful but for me
and it did not work yeah healthy treat
habits Oh healthy treats um yeah like
buying yourself new music and going on
and learning a magic trick going going
for a walk with your dog but ceilings
for some people going for a walk with
their dog be something they would have
to force themselves to do you know I
mean so it all depends on you um huge
craze now adult coloring books right
okay that's a good trait like your
favorite show like maybe you're going to
keep your show and not watch it but keep
it as like a treat so you're like if I
need a little treat I'm gonna watch the
office rerun you know I mean because I
need a little treat and and and so
sometimes you have to hold something
back so that feels like a treat like if
you said yourself I'm only going to have
coffee as a treat then it would start
feeling more like a treat or you could
just have it be part of your everyday I
am super obsessed with perfume and I
have a perfume that I love and I only
like this is what I need a big treat you
know like I'm feeling very sorry for
myself or I'm feeling very anxious not
something I'm like I get to wear that
perfume you know I save it as a treat so
it's really independent but you want to
have a lot of those in your back pocket
one more question okay yeah
a strategy for obligor uh from lighters
to map their external to internal yes
you get healthier habits or what about
for questioners it doesn't seem to work
on it away yeah yeah so for questioners
questioners are their value is reasons
and justifications so when a questioner
is having trouble sticking to a habit
it's usually because we're really deep
down they don't see the value of it um
and this is really important because in
many situations we might want people to
form a habit but they aren't really
convinced and so they're not going to be
compliant so if i said to you well I
need to have that by friday but you know
i don't really need to tell monday
you're not going to give it to me till
friday so if i wanted to get it by
friday i would have to say to you I need
this by friday because i'm going to be
flying on saturday and i want to read it
on the plane okay i can give it to you
by friday if there's a reason or I I had
was that the dentist and the dentist
said you need to brush her teeth for two
minutes and we said are you gonna get
tartar well that sounds like a reason
right but it's not really a reason what
do I care if I have tartar right so she
wasn't really giving me a reason she
needed to say because you're gonna have
tartar and if you have targa Rob well I
don't even know she didn't tell me
what's gonna happen Carter um but I'm at
a boulder right um but so you need to
really and often when when a blood when
what questioners say that they're having
trouble sticking to something if you
press them they will say well I don't
really I don't really believe it like I
had a friend say to me oh I spent all
this money buying all these vitamins and
supplements but I never take them and I
was like well do you think you need to
take them he said no I don't think so so
that's why I didn't take them you know I
don't know why you bought them but
that's why you didn't take them and so
but I was like wow if you were you know
if you were a type 1 diabetic taking
insulin I bet you would take it you know
because that you know you need it and so
always you go to the justifications and
the rationale and for it and that can
mean lots of research because they have
to get to that place of understanding
this is why this is important for me
because once they buy in then they can
