you
Oh
talk of the day is by a gill angle from
Microsoft Israel will be talking about
posted price exchange for display ad
contracts Gill thank you this is joint
work with Moshe tenon holds when we talk
about display advertising we refer to
those banner ads that are shown on on
web pages and more and more within apps
in what we refer to as ads in apps and
the main feature the main power that
they give advertisers is in the ability
to target specific segments of the user
population as it is defined by a large
number of criteria for example
demographic properties of the user
browsing history the current content
that he's watching and and the given
current time for example I'm a target a
campaign to for females from California
who ski and I want it and I want it to
be during the morning hours or another
campaign to males that visited a bank
website and have high income so the
number of criteria is very large it is
in the hundreds at least maybe many
hundreds so the there are two ways today
to sell two main ways to sell
impressions impressionism is that is the
basic good that is traded in the display
idea in the display advertising market
it is a one view of one user of one
advertisement one way is through a spot
market or what's called the Ad Exchange
where which takes place while the user
is browsing while the user is waiting
for the page to load so this is of
course very fast and it is it's then
pretty limited in terms of the
expressiveness of advertisers bidding
the other way is through it is through
what's called reserves or contracts
where we're in an advertiser enter and
the publisher sign a contract for a
specific amount of impressions of for a
specific segment to be delivered within
a specific time frame
and this is today's sold in a very
dispersed manner when sales people love
the publishers talk with the advertiser
and close a deal for for some for some
specific segments or it can be through
an intermediary like Microsoft that that
that that might take some might operate
some some display areas for some other
publishers usually large publishers in
the literature so the focus of this work
is the contract market it's not the spot
market this is important to note and the
literature about the contract we've
identified tomb tomb two main threads
there might be more but what one that
we've identified is his works that look
at the current framework of those
bilateral negotiations between publish
on and advertiser and just try to help
publisher to price their inventories
better based on some kind of demand
prediction and the other thread is
people proposed to to run an auction
where publisher one publisher sells
fixed usually large inventory through if
when through an auction that takes place
very periodically what's missing
especially what's missing in the market
today to our from from from from our
point of view is first of all some kind
of automation the this way that that
publishers salespeople have to contract
each individual advertiser it's kind of
cumbersome and some and when we are
moving more and more towards the world
where publishers there are lots of small
publishers that just someone that
someone just develops a nap and and and
wants to monetize it so there are lots
of publishers and lots of advertisers
and we want to achieve some kind of
economic efficiency over this global
matching between publishers and
advertisers so there
should we take is different than than
than than the previous two what we are
proposing are posted prices which is of
course a very traditional concept but
it's kind of new with with this with
display advertising and what we want to
get is to prices that our market
equilibrium which is another old and
beloved concept so what is market
equilibrium let's say we have a stead of
goods g1 through g10 and we have buyers
on one side and sellers on the other
side and we have prices we have a price
for each good PI 1 through PI 10 and
given those prices each each buyer
maximizes his own utility function so
finds the the bundle the vector of
quantities over the goods which
maximizes his utility under some budget
constraint usually the utility would be
over some subset some small subset of
the goods so the rest would would the
quantity would just be 0 and on on the
other side the sellers this differs
between the specific market models in
some market modules the the sellers have
fixed inventory or what's called
endowment and in some other they have
some production set that tells us what
they can produce given given given
prices but they also have end up with
some vector of quantities over the goods
which represents supply so we can
aggregate or if we aggregate this supply
on one side from all the sellers and and
the demand on the other side from all
the buyers then if we if we if one is
equal the other then this is called the
market equilibrium and we like
equilibrium because it is it provides
some we have the welfare theorem so it's
provides some sense of efficiency over
this global two-sided market and we know
that that the demand of each buyer is
going to be satisfied so every buyer is
going to exhaust this budget so this is
some sense of revenue if you look at the
aggregate amount of money that goes into
the market is also maximized and
it's not really that that everybody is
happy nobody's ever happy but it is it
provides a sense of stability nobody
wants something else given given current
prices so now think about the well in
economics it's usually the case that we
are saying that they are saying we have
this set of goods and the market we have
this invisible hand that will make the
market reach an equilibrium at some
point what emerging in computer science
i think is the idea that that that we
can but if we know happen to know the
utility functions there and the
inventories here we can calculate those
equilibrium prices and if we control
those prices we can just set them such
that it is in in equilibrium so back to
the display market think about an
intermediary like Microsoft or Google
that runs this market and controls the
prices if we knew the those those those
utility functions and we can predict
inventory of of publishers then we can
calculate equilibrium prices and and
then achieve all those all those great
things here so these sounds to me like a
nice idea but it has some some serious
challenges first of all I mentioned
hundreds of criteria and the number of
each impression is a configuration of
all the over all the criteria so the
number of goods that we have in this
market is exponential in the hundreds so
of course we can't make any price for
each possible good in addition so no
buyer now Stella really specifies all
those hundreds of criteria there each
buyer cares about some set so for
example be one here has three campaigns
in one who cares about C D and E and the
other occurs about a and in the third
one occurs about CNA and those are
quantities there and b2 cares about
different attributes altogether or maybe
some overlap and sellers also the
sellers can guarantee only the kind of
impressions that they that they that
they track through their log files so
seller knows that he has these
quantities of a and B and it doesn't
know anything about the rest of the
attributes and so on so so it turns out
that each buyer and seller uses kind of
different language in this market and we
somehow have to bridge that and the
third challenge would be to so in order
to calculate equilibrium prices we need
to know the utility function of
advertisers and this is these are
utility functions over quantities of
goods and there is large number of goods
and and so for those that are familiar
with the expressive auctions terminology
we are talking about utility that is
both multi attribute and combinatorial
and similarly in on the supply side this
is also not easy because suppliers have
log files and we will somehow need to to
translate this even assuming that the
log file is a prediction of of of supply
it will be hard to translate it in into
this supply over our market goods so we
will deal with with the first two
challenges first and then leave the the
other two for later and and this this
this kind of summarizes our approach
let's say and forget for just one moment
about about display advertising let's
let's let's think about this market
model where we have a set of market
goods and we said we we have a set of
different goods on the demand side and
each buyer has utility function over
some subset of these demand goods and we
also have a set of supply goods which
are also different each seller has some
has inventory over some subset of these
of this supply goods but what we do have
is this relation which we call
satisfaction when we connect the supply
go to a market good if the if the supply
good satisfies the market good and and
on the other side it is the opposite we
connect the demand go to a market good
if the market goods
satisfies the the demand good and this
can be a many-to-many relation so back
to the display advertising world if we
have here female from from California
then this is satisfied by good that is
female from California who skis and this
can be another good which is someone
from from California that skis this is
also satisfied by sorry by the same by
the same by the same supply good and if
this is I said someone from California
who ski it is also satisfied by
different supply good which is someone
from California who skis and this
impression happens during the morning
hours and it's the same case on the
other side that we have this
many-to-many relation so this is going
to be our model but before I keep on
talking about that I have to say
something about those market goods how
do we come up with them and it's nothing
in this in the results requires one one
way or another we could take any set of
statements like those that i mentioned
and turn them into the market goods but
one way to make it work probably okay is
by taking by declaring the union of all
the so we can take all the statements
all the demand statements that we get
from advertisers take the union on them
and make that the the set of market
goods so this can be a lot of market
goods but it's still linear in the input
to the market so it's going to be a
manageable number of good so in this
example we have one advertiser that
wants to other ties to high-income
females and another campaign to male
cyclist and then we have a second
advertisers that has these three demand
good you have separate campaign for
cyclist and second and and in the third
campaign that he just cares about the
gender so we can take the union of all
these and make and have these five five
and good five-man good and set them as
they as the as the as the set of market
goods but it's not it's not necessarily
but doesn't it doesn't have to be this
way so what do we need now we need to
first we have this awkward market model
where we have market goods on and we
have the ability function defined over
different goods and inventory defined
over different good with this with this
many-to-many in relation we still need
in order to show that we can even find
prices over the market goods that are in
equilibrium we need to somehow reduce it
into a into some classic market models
where the utility and inventories are
defined on the same goods and and and
after we do that we also need to show
that we can compute this equilibrium in
in polynomial time and to and to do that
we will i will show what's called an
excess demand Oracle so excess demand is
just the difference between this
aggregate supply aggregate demand on one
side and aggregate supply on the other
side and demand and supply can actually
be correspondences doesn't have to be
functions so there can be multiple
bundles that maximize the utility of
over over over of a buyer so in excess
demand Oracle would have to go through
all those options and find the the
excess demand vector that minimizes this
excess demand so in a sense that its
largest coordinate is is is minimal so
we will need this polynomial excess
demand Oracle and for for us to be able
to compute equilibrium in polynomial
time we will also have to assume that
utility functions exhibit what's called
growth substitute that's that limitation
that is be known to be required in order
for for equilibrium computation to be to
be polynomial what it means is that
advertisers cannot have
complementarities between different
kinds of impressions so I will never be
willing to pay
more for two impressions of different
types more than the sum of what I'm
willing to pay for each one separately
and this might not hold because
advertisers may have may have what's
called a minimum reach so if I'm not
advertising to both Michigan and Ohio
then I might as well not advertise at
all but it's probably a reasonable
approximation in this case and then we
def will be able to use previous results
that show that equilibrium under this
specific classic market model that we
will have that equilibrium can be
computed in polynomial time and then the
third thing that will have to do is to
show that we can elicit utility
functions and figure out the inventories
of sellers in order for this tour so so
how does the demand look like here we
have let's say someone has a demand for
cyclists wants to advertise the cyclists
and now we we might have three different
market booths one is Michigan cyclists
and one is high-income cyclist and maybe
we even have a market good that is
called cyclist so these are market goods
that have overlap between them this is
the basic problem that we have here and
each one of them can satisfy that demand
good but we know that the that you get
that the advertiser is utility Maximizer
and we know the set of goods the set of
market goods that satisfy this each
particular demand good in this case g5
through g8 all satisfy this demand good
and by definition of utility
maximization and assuming that the
advertiser is indifferent between all
the market goods that satisfy this
because if I wanted male cyclist rather
than just cyclist then this would have
been a different demand good so assuming
that I target the campaign just just to
cyclist I'm indifferent between all of
this so I will naturally choose that the
cheapest one on ones so maybe there are
there are few market goods that are that
have the same price by six equal equals
x 7 and then we know that the price for
this advertiser
this demand good is by six so this way
we can define price vector over the over
the demand goods and we can just do
utility maximization over the over the
over the demand goods and the output of
this Oracle then would be would be a
demand vector over the demand goods and
we will also maintain this mapping back
to the market goods in this case the
mapping from this good back to the
market goods would be would be g6 and g7
because these are the two utility
maximizing market goods so the the
quantity that is defined here over this
demand good would be mapped to g6 and g7
now on this would be polynomial if the
utility maximization problem is
polynomial and for the utility
elicitation purposes we'll have to make
strong assumption over the utility
functions and other these assumptions it
will also be I will show that this
computation is a polynomial on the
supply side we have a similar problem we
have someone has a supply statement like
high income cyclist for Michigan and
there are three different market goods
here Michigan cyclist and cyclist
and also just cyclist and this is just
an example we could have we might not
have this market good cyclist right it's
not it's not necessarily that we have
some closure here so if on the demand
side the definition of utility
maximization solve this problem of
choosing which which which market good
we take then the analogy on the supply
side would be production so it's not
really the case that anyone produces
anything here but if but if supplier
predicts that will have high income
cyclists from Michigan this means we can
think of it as a production problem in
which you can either produce a Michigan
cyclist a high-income cyclist or or just
a cyclist and because the costs are the
same is the same impression then we will
just take those market goods that
that are satisfied by this demand good
and maximize the and have a maximal
price so let's say x 3 and x 4 x 3
equals x for larger than pi 2 and pi 5
so the price of this of this supply good
would be pi 3 and again we have prices
over the supply good so we can we can
come up with this what we will call a
profit maximizing production plan even
though it's not exactly production and
we don't have any inputs so the output
of this supply vector would be of this
supply Oracle would be a would be a
supply vector over the so it would be
quantities over the supply goods and
this mapping back to the market goods in
this case this is map to g3 and g4 and
this would be polynomial it sounds it's
it sounds like it's obviously polynomial
because we are not doing anything here
but problem is that we need to have this
supply in a very specific form we need
to have if this is a set of impressions
of Michigan cyclist and this is a set of
impressions of male cyclist this says I
have 100,000 of these and 200,000 of
these the the semantics of that is that
we have all together three hundred
thousand impressions otherwise we will
so so even those the statements are
overlapping each one of them refers to
so I know about 105 it that so I have
100 thousand impressions on which I know
that there are cyclists from Michigan
and I have another 200,000 depression
from which I know that they are may say
that there are male cyclist and I just
don't know the state but the set of
impressions are disjoint and this is
required so we don't count the same the
same impression twice so our challenge
to make a polynomial will be to come up
with this disjoint representation from
the log files so I kind of did the
existence and the beginning of the
computation of equilibrium together
because I talked about about those
demand and supply Oracle's but but this
is also what's required for the
existence when what I did would
helps us to show that we can translate
utility functions to utility function
with the same properties over the market
goods and we will assume that when we
when I when when we do a model for the
utility functions and and its end it's
also obvious to show that we have
production set that has some good
properties and we can do some work in
order to make it look like or to reduce
it to talk to a classic Marg a classic
production economy that that that was
proposed by arrow and the bra and they
also show that equilibrium prices always
exist so we have that existence and now
for the for the computation of the
equilibrium what's left to do is to is
to show that we can compute excess
demand and for this we just take the
output of the demand and supply oracle's
what we had there is we had this we had
this demand over the over the demand
goods that were that each each demand
good is mapped to several market goods
between which the advertiser is
indifferent so and similarly with the
supply so what we do here is some search
over those and trying all the all day
all the possible assignments through
this linear program the such that the
difference between the aggregate demand
and aggregate supply is minimized and
this would be polynomial of course we
still have to show that we know the the
the utility function and that the
utility maximization is polynomial like
I said and that the supplies in this
convenient form so now we have previous
results that show that we can that the
show that that the equilibrium prices
can be computed in polynomial time but
we found it useful to also provide a
simple algorithm that does that because
the previous results of code n ot and
others will I on the ellipsoid algorithm
which
known to not always perform well in
practice and also because a simple
tournament like process would work here
this is just starting with very small
very low prices like zero for example
and then at each iteration we just find
a good that has highest excess demand
and increase its price by by some Delta
this is not strongly polynomial but with
this small price range we assume we
think that it's going to work well in
practice now the reason is going to
converge is first of all the formal
definition of growth substitute is that
if we increase the price of one good
then it does not reduce the demand on
another good and the second thing that
we that we know here is that if we
increase the price of one good it will
also not increase the supply on another
good because if anything we're going to
switch the production from from other
goods towards the good whose price
increased so these together and we also
know that equilibrium prices exist then
we can show that if price of the good
exceeds its price in this in this in
this equilibrium vector then we will
never have to increase that same price
again so and and and then the algorithm
is going to converge to this equilibrium
so this kind of finishes this this part
of our equilibrium existence and and
computations but still under the
assumption that we know the utility
function of advertisers and we have this
inventory of suppliers so how do we
elicit the utility functions from from
advertisers these are utility function
that I mentioned are multi attribute and
comunitaria we have utility / quantities
of good so even if we if we did some
kind of we even if we know that someone
is willing to pay 500 for or
willing to pay X for five hundred
thousand impressions of some type how do
we know how much is his he is willing to
pay for 700,000 depressions right and in
addition we don't want to do any bidding
because it's not natural in this kind of
market we have posted prices so all we
want all we can do is observe what
utility what the advertisers are
purchasing we can only observe the
demand vectors of advertisers under
given prices so the idea is that we have
some initial prices pie and we observe
the demand vector D pie and we somehow
need to extrapolate the utility function
out of it and and now use this utility
function in order to calculate the
demand for any other price vector in
order to be able to calculate
equilibrium like we did in the in the
previous slides and it turns out that
this can actually be done with we can
extrapolate utility function from one
observation and they're very strong
assumptions on utility one there are two
examples here one is called the
cobb-douglas utility function and the
cobb-douglas we have we have fixed we
are dividing the budget in a fixed way
between different different kinds of
goods so if we if we if we have utility
over two goods then and under some price
vector we will spend sixty percent of
our budget on one good and forty percent
on the other good then this is going to
be the case for any other price vector
so this is very firm there is no no
substitution between good and the other
extreme is a linear tility function in
which we can substitute anything as long
as we maximize our our utility so there
is no notion of budget allocation
between between good and both seemed too
strong for this market because
advertisers do substitute all the time
between different kinds of goods but on
the other hand they do have also this
sense of allocating allocating budget
force for for specific good
and the truth is probably somewhere in
between so so what we propose is to use
a more general form of utility function
that is called constant elasticity of
substitution where we are it has this
this mathematical form where Roy is
related to elasticity when Roy is is 0
at the limit what we get is the
cobb-douglas utility function and when
Roy's one what we get is the linear
utility function and it and kind of
captures this whole spectrum of constant
elasticity what constant elasticity
means is that we can have any kind of
elasticity any kind of flexibility in
substituting between different kind of
goods when the when the price changes so
the elasticity is a measure of how easy
we will go between from one good to the
other if if say the price goes up of the
of our original good but but but it has
to be the same the same level of the
same elasticity for any pair of goods at
any price so it's still a pretty strong
assumption but it's much more general
than the linear tility function which is
very popular in this literature and the
cobb-douglas utility function is popular
in general in the economics literature
now and if Rho is greater than 0 it also
captures the gross substitute assumption
so it's a it's the other assumption that
we have to make for computational
purposes so it turns out that this much
more general utility function can be
elicited if we just have two
observations rather than one and and I
will show how in a moment of course
under the assumption that the buyer is
using is consistently using the same
utility function and he is always
exhausting his budget and in every in
every demand vector how much time do I
have 20 minutes ok I'll finish much much
much earlier than that ok so
oh so how do we a hypo surprise that's a
big difference five minutes okay that's
a yeah let's start to negotiate on that
some somewhere in between okay so how do
we elicit a constant elasticity of
substitution function we our input here
is a demand vector Q 1 through qm at
some prices pie and we know that we
assume that the advertiser is utility
Maximizer is maximizing his utility
under current prices so we can take
first-order condition and it's well
known that it leads to this condition
that is called tangency condition for
any pair of goods we so we instantiate
this equation for for good one in good
too and then for good twin good three
and so on so what we are getting here
are M minus 1 equations with M unknowns
because the bettas here are our unknowns
and for for a second we are assuming
that we know raw let's let's assume for
something that we know the elasticity of
substitution this constant and but we
also know that the sum of the of the end
I think it's not mentioned in the
previous slide but the sum of those
coefficients because their weights is
equal to 1 so we have M equations with M
unknowns and we can solve it in fact we
don't really have to solve em equations
with M unknowns we we can just cause of
this form of equations we can just start
with some any b1 and and then get the
rest of the beasts from that and then
normalize it such that they sum up sum
up to 1 and now but the problem is that
we don't know raw so we need the second
observation that i mentioned so now we
have another another demand vector over
some other prices by Prime and Phi prime
has to be different from pine at least
one coordinate where the where the where
the utility is not 0 so we can now
divide one equation by the
near that coordinate and in extract row
out of it so this tells us that
theoretically at least we can with two
observation extract this constant
elasticity of substitution function what
in practice will probably be more useful
to do is do because advertisers will not
really use the same utility function
with the same elasticity consistently in
every purchase then we will have to then
we'll probably be better to take many
observations and find the best fit for
row using linear programming so this
this closes this part on own utility and
one more thing he'd also tell with the
with this structure it is also
polynomial to to find the utility
maximizing demand vector that this is
something that we need to do during when
we use the demand Oracle because it is
where it is just the same the difference
is that here the betters were the
unknowns and when we do utility utility
maximization we already know assume that
we know the utility functions which are
the better sand in the enroll the
unknowns are the cues because we need to
find the utility maximizing demand
vector so again we do the same thing we
instantiate a 1 q and instantiate the
rest of them and then normalize it
according to the budget constraint ok so
what's left to talk about is this is the
supply this is the last slide how do we
generate this explicit this joint
representation of supply and what what
what it needs to look like is something
like that because we want to know that
we have hundred fifty thousand
depressions of low income people from
Michigan and then we might have in
addition twenty thousand impressions of
cyclist with high income from Michigan
but then we might also have 200,000
depressions of me of of people from
Michigan that we don't know anything
else about we don't know whether they
are cyclist or whether they have high or
low income and all these numbers are
disjoint so the sum of all the impaired
is the sum of all the numbers in the
leaves and this really remind decision
tree and because we need to to get it to
obtain it from from from from publishers
log files it seems natural that we will
use decision tree algorithm but for that
we need some kind of we need some
decision or in other words we need a
target attribute and actually there is a
very natural target attribute here which
is the price of each impression because
we know that there is no reason for a
supplier to distinguish or to commit two
attributes if it does not mean that it
will increase the price that he gets
from for those in for the photos
impressions so what we can do is take
the log files which we assume adjust
entries of impressions that that the
supplier viewed or had with each one has
all the attributes that the supplier
recorded for that that the publisher
recorded for that for that visit for
that impression and we just label them
with expected price of that type of
impression the expected price can come
from many sources can come from the
current market prices can come from the
spot market or we might also want to do
some exploration in there but we not get
into it and then using a decision tree
algorithm or more accurately because
it's a continuous target attribute it's
a regression tree algorithm it will give
us it will it will give a surprise sorry
it will give us the most compact tree
that that that we want to use for this
for this publisher so to summarize what
we proposed is a posted prices market
for clearing the ad contract it's a
posted prices for cleaning the ad
contract market for the market we have a
compact price structure and and a way to
bridge these different languages that
that advertisers and publishers are
using we show the existence of
equilibrium and that we can calculate it
in polynomial time and on the demand
side
assume relatively expressive form of
utility function which is the constant
elasticity of substitution with growth
substitutes and we show that we can
elicit this kind of utility function
just by observing the purchases of
advertisers and on the supply side we
take the log files and turn them into
market goods if I have another do I have
a minute or I'm done okay so just one
word what I kind of put aside is how
this market works that the dynamics of
this market because we do have a problem
here the when we observe the advertisers
behavior and deduct a utility function
from that they already they are already
doing a purchase so if the if the
current prices are not reflecting this
demand well then we're then we're not
really going to have supply equals
equals demand so we have two options
here either we make it in less
continuous and more periodic so we say
we clear the market once a week and we
are doing the week we are just getting
orders and not and not going ting
anything and then calculating
equilibrium prices based on the utility
that we observed and then we give
advertisers take-it-or-leave-it offer
based on the the utility function that
we assessed for them so they are
expected to take it and so so this is
pretty solid theoretically what we if we
are more adventurous then we can assume
that the that the demand doesn't change
much so so we can set so we can take a
set of prices and based on what we
observed so far and just have this
approximate equilibrium all the time and
update the price each time that we see
that it's got to too far from the that
the debt is supply and demand or are
different than what we had in mind
before then what we have observed before
okay son now
