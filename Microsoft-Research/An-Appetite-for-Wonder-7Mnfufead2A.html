you
so good afternoon and when he's
afternoon because it's a quarter past
dude so it's afternoon and welcome to
this new event of the Microsoft Research
torc series my name is Francesca oh gods
oh I'm researcher at Microsoft Research
and today I'm extremely thrilled I don't
know if this proper English to say
extremely truth but it gives my my state
of mind of introducing Professor Richard
Dawkins well it will commit him at
Microsoft Research so Richard Dawkins is
the most famous living evolutionary
biologist and the most famous had least
according to a fall of the prospectus
magazine done among more than 10,000
subscribers in more than 100 countries
he is considered as the number one word
tinker he's a fellow the new College in
Oxford which if you if you wonder the
new college was new in the 14th century
for not wrong but when that's good
Salado college Andy is a fellow above
the Royal Society and the royal society
of leadership so what he published more
than 11 books in subject on science and
religion and all these books are still
on printer and and I guess awesome on
kindle his most famous book is The
Selfish Gene which was published in
nineteen seventy six and this book
recently has been defined by someone who
likes red shoes which is not me and used
to be available as a as a classical
example of science fiction so I I don't
know if you read if you read the Italian
newspaper but this guy was a was the
Pope emeritus Joseph Ratzinger say you
know not nice thing about a selfish
scene so the nice thing is or at least
what the funny think the coincidence is
that in the very first line or the
selfish gene in the introduction in 1976
addition he says you say this book
should not should be read almost as
though it were science fiction it is
designed to appeal to imagination but is
not science fiction it's science so it
seems that you already asked for 37
years in advance
I have the gift of prophecy yeah
definitely so what this book is it so
please correct me if I'm wrong and just
a computer scientist not a biologist
even if I married one neurologist is
that this book you revolutionize the
evolution theory by showing that natural
selection is a matter genes only doing
what is best for the young survival it's
so please ok brother daughter what is
says sorry survivor in the species let's
do beg your pardon I'm so sorry oh no
you take so I'm Patti when I say they
only think about biology so you cannot
correct if I say something stupid
biology nowadays is a branch of computer
science anyway oh yes everything is
computer science so well anyway it's not
a surprise that Joseph watching I didn't
like them The Selfish Gene because
Richard Dawkins who is also the author
of The God Delusion the bestseller book
and in which he applies the rigorous of
a scientific meter to theology and if
you haven't read the book well you can
imagine the output so today Richard
Dawkins is here to present his last book
the book of memoir and I really enjoyed
reading it in particular discover things
about 20 dozens that didn't I didn't
know so this one really really shocked
me so there is this quote from a john
maynard smith who says while writing the
set vagina Richard Dawkins was
recovering from a severe addiction to
computer programming
I'm so sad it's not joke humor and
Microsoft wheel of computer programming
we you know we are all addicted so what
is this tragic event of you know it's
the recovery the event not the addiction
of course and so I also discovered that
you designed to programming languages
and we love programming languages
particularly my research group for PDP
eight and yeah so something I would like
to know is why the love affair with
computer programming is a pre over
what's happened okay so thank you very
much again for coming and yes my
knowledge my knowledge of programming
languages is now out of the ark height
I'm I'm prehistoric dinosaur of
computing I'm actually quite lucky to
have got here because somebody rebooked
my air ticket to Seattle under the name
of Richard Dawkins you might think
that's perfectly sensible name to book
it under things that is my name however
let me read you the first page of my
memoir glad to know you Clint the
friendly passport controller was not to
know that British people are sometimes
given a family name first followed by
the name their parents wanted them to
use I was always to be Richard just as
my father was always John our first name
of Clinton was something we forgot about
as our parents had intended to me it has
been no more than a niggling irritation
which I would have been happier without
notwithstanding the serendipitous
realization that it gives me the same
initials as Charles Robert Darwin but
alas nobody anticipated the United
States Department of Homeland Security
not content with scanning our shoes and
rationing our toothpaste this Keystone
Cops were the institution decreed that
anyone entering America must travel
under his first name exactly as written
in his passport so I had to forgo my
lifelong identity as Richard and rebrand
myself Clinton are Dawkins when booking
tickets to the States and of course when
filling in those important forms the
ones that require you explicitly to deny
that you're entering the USA in order to
overthrow the Constitution by force of
arms sole purpose of visit was the
British broadcaster Gilbert Harding's
response to that nowadays such levity
will see you banged up this first
chapter is just a bit of fun to
introduce some of my ancestors going
back to the 18th century and I just want
to mention now Clinton George Augustus
Dawkins 1808 271 who was one of few
Dawkins is actually to use the name
Clinton if he inherited any of his
father's ardour that's a reference to
his father who eloped with Augusta the
daughter of General Sir Henry Clinton
who was not mostly responsible for
losing the American War of Independence
general Clinton was so annoyed this
elopement that Henry Dawkins had to
resort to stationing hansom cab at all
four corners of the square where general
Clinton lived only one of which he and
Miss Clinton were in and with the hansom
cabs has they had instructions to drive
off in opposite directions so the
general didn't know which one to pursue
as well as I said if they're some
Clinton George Augustus inherited any of
his father's ardor he nearly lost it in
18-49 during an Austrian bombardment of
Venice where he was the British consul
I have a cannonball in my possession
sitting on a plinth bearing an
inscription on a brass plate I don't
know whose is the authorial voice and I
don't know how reliable it is but for
what it's worth here is my translation
from French then the language of
diplomacy one night when he was in bed a
cannonball penetrated the bed clothes
and passed between his legs but happily
did him no more than superficial damage
this narrow escape of my ancestors vital
parts took place before he was to put
them to use and it is tempting to
attribute my own existence to a stroke
of ballistic luck a few inches closer to
the fork of Shakespeare's radish and but
actually my existence and yours and the
postman's hangs from a far narrower
threat of luck than that we owe it to
the precise timing and placing of
everything that ever happened since the
universe began the incident of the
cannonball is only a dramatic example of
a much more general phenomenon as I put
it before if the second dinosaur to the
left of the tall cycad tree had not
happened to sneeze and thereby failed to
catch the tiny shrew like ancestor of
all the mammals we would none of us be
here we all can regard ourselves as
exquisitely improbable but here in a
triumph of hindsight we r cg a
cannonball Dawkins his son Clinton later
sir Clinton Edward Dawkins 1859 to 1905
was one of many Dawkins's to attend
Bailey Oh College Oxford as I was myself
later to do he was there at the right
time to be immortalized in the Bailey ol
rhymes in the spring term of 1881 seven
undergraduates composed and printed
scurrilous rhymes about personalities of
the college most famous is the verse
that celebrates Bailey olds great master
Benjamin Jowett composed by HC beaching
later Dean of Norwich Cathedral first
come I my name is Joe it there's no
knowledge but I know it I am master of
this college what I don't know isn't
knowledge less witty but intriguing to
me is the rhyme on Clinton Edward
Dawkins positivists ever talk in such an
epic style as Dawkins God is naught and
man is all spell him with a capital free
thinkers were much less common in
Victorian times and I wish I had met
great-great-uncle Clinton and what
should we make of that epic style well I
go on in the book to my own life my own
early childhood in Africa my own early
school days in Africa I was sent away to
boarding school in what was then
Southern Rhodesia now Zimbabwe at the
rather early age of seven it's too early
ready to send a child away to boarding
school I suppose nowadays we would say
and an indication of that is as I record
in the book I used to fantasize that the
matron miss Copplestone known as coppers
to her face I used to fantasize that she
would turn into my mother and since they
both had black curly hair I thought it
wouldn't take too great a miracle to
achieve it and we then I'd only been
there for two terms when the family left
Africa and returned to England because
my father was left in the will of a very
distant cousin the family estate I
suppose you could call it had been in
the family since 17 23 and Henry Dawkins
and so we went to England and I was sent
to another school another boarding
school in England and I'm just going to
read from my first my early school
report from that school
I was an exceptionally untidy and
disorganized little boy in my early
years at Chaffin grove school my first
school reports dwelt insistently on the
theme of ink Headmaster's report he has
produced some good work and well
deserves his prize a very inky little
boy at present which is apt to spoil his
work Latin he has made steady progress
but unfortunately when using ink his
written work becomes very untidy
mathematics he works very well but I'm
not always able to read his work he must
learn that ink is for writing not
washing purposes miss Benson my elderly
French teacher somehow managed to omit
the ink light motif but even her report
had a sting in the tail French plenty of
ability a good pronunciation and a
wonderful facility in escaping work I
then went on to a more advanced school
andale school at the age of 13 where
again it was a boy's boarding school
there were no girls which kind of meant
made for a slightly odd atmosphere not
entirely surprisingly one of my friends
took up with one of the housemaids and
I'll tell that story in a moment hund
rule was where I gave up such religious
belief as I had and actually became
rather rebellious and I and two friends
would sit bolt upright with our arms
folded looking defiant while the rest of
the of the chapel was had bowed heads
like that we were kind of islands of
rebellion in this sea of reverence all
around us because it was an Anglican
school they were all very decent about
it and we never got into trouble about
that but I lately learned from my mother
that my house master mr. Peter Ling did
actually summon my parents for a
heart-to-heart talk over T about my
rebellious behavior in Chapel I knew
nothing of this at the time and my
mother has only just
me of the incident mr. Ling asked my
parents to try to persuade me to change
my ways my father said approximately by
my mother's recollection it is not our
business to control him in that sort of
way that kind of thing is your problem
and I'm afraid I must decline your
request my parents attitude to the whole
affair but it wasn't important mr. Ling
was in his way a decent man a
contemporary and friend of mine in the
same house recently told me the
following nice story he was illicitly up
in a dormitory during the day kissing
one of the housemaids the pair panicked
when they heard a heavy tread on the
stairs and my friend hastily bundled the
young woman up onto a windowsill and
drew the curtains to hide her standing
form mr. Ling came into the room and
must have noticed that only one of the
three windows had the curtains drawn
even worse my friend noticed to his
horror that the girls feet were clearly
visible precluding under the curtain he
firmly believes that mr. Ling must have
realized what was going on but pretended
not to perhaps on boys will be boys
grounds what are you doing up in the
dormitory at this hour just came up to
change my socks sir oh well hurry on
down good call on mr. Ling's part that
boy went on to become probably the most
successful alumnus of his generation the
nighted chief executive officer of one
of the largest international
corporations on in the world and a
generous benefactor of the school in
dying among other things the Peter Ling
fellowship that was sir howard stringer
who went on to become CEO of the sony
corporation the only non japanese to
have held that office I think he's now
chairman of the board
I then went on to Oxford which I think
could fairly be said to be the making of
me I learned there to give up school
ways which I regard as mugging up from
textbooks a lot of facts and to switch
instead to the university way being
educated which i think is ready to be a
scholar and to go into the library and
read original research papers and become
kind of a world authority on a very
narrow subject one subject at a time
assigned me by the one-to-one tutor we
had a one-to-one tutorial system at
Oxford and the tutor would send you into
the library with a reading list from
original research papers it was a very
different kind of education and from
there I went on to do a PhD is called
d.phil at Oxford under Niko Tinbergen a
famous animal behaviorist ethologist and
then went on to be a very junior
assistant professor at Berkeley
California for two years in the late 60s
which was the sort of height of the
drugs and flower power time and
demonstrations against the Vietnam War
and so on there's a little incident
which I'd like to read to you because
it's rather surprising for the flower
power generation a little anecdote of
something that I noticed in berkeley i
was walking along telegraph avenue axis
of Berkeley's beads in sense of
marijuana culture a young man was
walking ahead of me dressed in the
insignia of the flower power generation
every time a young woman passed him
walking in the opposite direction he
would reach out and tweak one of her
breasts far from slapping him or crying
harassment she would simply walk on by
as if nothing had happened and he would
proceed to the next one today I find
this almost impossible to believe but it
is a very secure memory his demeanor did
not appear especially lascivious and his
action was evidently not taken by the
young women as
gesture of a male chauvinist pig it
seemed all of a piece with hip edem with
the laid-back peace and love atmosphere
of 60s San Francisco I'm very glad to
say that things have changed today's
counterparts in age and class of that
young man and the young women he
molested as we should now say would be
among those most strongly outraged
behavior which was then the norm for
that age class and political persuasion
I had never been to America before and I
did find some things bewildering at my
first meeting of the zoology faculty
everyone spoke almost entirely in
numbers who's doing 314 now I'm doing
246 nowadays the english-speaking world
knows that X ology 101 means somewhat
patronizingly or even derisively a
freshman's introduction to x ology but
all that numerology was perplexing to me
when I first arrived and who today
doesn't understand the verb to major but
I recall reading an American campus
novel and getting a little fed up with
all the twittering of sophomores and
juniors and seniors when like a breath
of fresh air an English major came into
the room aha I thought my mind
immediately filled with visions of
riding breeches and mustaches a real
character at last I'm going to end on a
sad note but it's one that means a lot
to me when I was at Oxford and a
graduate student of Niko Tinbergen I'm
as I mentioned before my in a way my
more important mentor was Tim bergens
number two whose name was Michael Cullen
an unsung hero of the science of
mythology and I would like to read to
you part of the eulogy that I composed
for his funeral service in the chapel of
wadham college oxford
he did not publish many papers himself
yet he worked prodigiously hard both in
teaching and research he was probably
the most sought-after tutor in the
entire zoology department the rest of
his time he was always at a hurry and
worked a hugely long day was devoted to
research but seldom his own research
everybody who knew him has the same
story to tell all the obituaries told it
in revealingly similar terms you would
have a problem with your research you
knew exactly where to go for help and
there he would be for you I see the
scene as yesterday the lunchtime
conversation in the crowded little
kitchen the wiry boyish figure in the
red sweater slightly hunched like a
spring wound up with intense
intellectual energy sometimes rocking
back and forth with concentration the
deeply intelligent eyes understanding
what you meant even before the words
came out the back of the envelope to aid
explanation the occasional is skeptical
quizzical tilt of the eyebrows under the
untidy hair then he would have to rush
off he always rushed everywhere perhaps
for a tutorial and he would seize his
biscuit tin bites wire handles and
disappear but next morning the answer to
your problem would arrive in Mike's
small distinctive handwriting two pages
often some algebra diagrams a key
reference to the literature sometimes an
apt verse of his own composition or a
fragment of Latin or classical Greek
always encouragement we were grateful
but not grateful enough if we had
thought about it we would have realized
he must have been working on that
mathematical model of my research all
evening and it isn't only me for whom he
does this everybody in the research
group gets the same treatment and not
just his own students I was officially
Niko Tinbergen student not Mike's Mike
took me on without payment and without
official recognition when my research
became more mathematical than Nico could
handle when the time came for me to
write my thesis it was Mike Cullen who
read it criticized it
helped me polish every line and all this
while he was doing the same thing for
his own official students when we all
should have wondered does he get time
for ordinary family life when does he
get time for his own research no wonder
he so seldom published anything no
wonder he never wrote his long-awaited
book on animal communication in truth he
should have been joint author of just
about every one of the hundreds of
papers that came out of that research
group during that golden period in fact
his name appears on virtually none of
them except in the acknowledgments
section the worldly success of
scientists is judged for promotional
honors by their published papers Mike
did not rate highly on this index but if
he had consented to add his name to his
students publications as readily as
modern supervisors insist on putting
their names on papers to which they
contribute much less Mike would have
been a conventionally successful
scientist lauded with conventional
honors as it is he was a brilliantly
successful scientist in a far deeper and
truer sense and I think we know which
kind of scientists be really admire
Oxford sadly lost him to Australia years
later in Melbourne at a party for me as
visiting lecturer I was standing
probably rather stiffly with a drink in
my hand suddenly the familiar figure
shot into the room in a hurry as ever
the rest of us were in suits but not
this familiar figure the years vanished
away everything was the same though he
must have been well into his sixties by
then he seemed still to be in his 30s
the glow of boyish enthusiasm even the
red sweater next day he drove me to the
coast to see his beloved penguins
stopping on the way to look at giant
Australian earthworms many feet long we
tired the sun with talking not I think
about old times and old friends and
certainly not about ambition grant
getting and papers in nature but about
new science
new ideas it was a perfect day the last
day I saw him we may know other
scientists as intelligent as my column
though not many we may know other
scientists who were as generous in
support though vanishingly few but I
declare we have known nobody who had so
much to give combined with so much
generosity in giving it thank you very
much any questions can we have the
lights up so I can see thank you
hello hear me so this is a question
regarding God and religion and evolution
okay somehow like the common cold we
have not been able to develop resistance
to this crutch kuantan religion and God
so do you think there is somewhat of
benefit of having this crutch of you
know being susceptible to these notions
and is there any hope well my website
sells a t-shirt which says religion
together we can find the cure I think it
is a bit like a virus actually and that
may be the key to understanding where it
comes from I don't think that there
actually is a Darwinian benefit to
religion per se I do think that there's
a Darwinian benefit to various
psychological predispositions which
manifest themselves as religion under
the right cultural conditions and one of
these predispositions I've suggested is
a tendency to obey orders or more
specifically a tendency for the child
brain to believe what its parents tell
it I think it's easy to see that natural
selection in a while state in a wild
animal our ancestors in Africa that were
living a life fraught with danger there
was danger from large carnivores there
was danger from snakes scorpions
precipices cliff edges and so on
crocodiles and so for a child to survive
it probably would have been a good thing
to have been equipped genetically with a
rule of thumb in the brain that said
whatever your parents tell you do it
don't ask questions don't be scientific
and skeptical just do what your parents
say if they say don't pick up a snake
obey them if they say don't bathe in the
river because of the crocodiles obey
them so the child brain then would would
be genetically pre-programmed pre
adapted to believe whatever its parents
told it a bit like a computer
which is built by engineers so that it
will obey implicitly whatever you tell
it to in its machine code that obviously
includes useful programs which is mostly
what it does but it also includes
computer viruses if anybody is
malevolent enough to wish to write one
and as far as the computer is concerned
it obviously doesn't know which
instructions are good and useful
instructions like Microsoft Office and
which ones are malevolent instructions
like pass on this virus of Muller about
it erase this entire hard disk it's just
so the child brain comes into the world
with a rule of thumb believe everything
your parents tell you and that includes
useful information like don't go bathing
in the river limpopo because there are
crocodiles there but it also is
vulnerable to useless and even
time-wasting or even malevolent
information like it's necessary to spend
hours every day on your knees praying to
the east towards necessary to sacrifice
a goat at the time of the full moon or
whatever it might be the child brain has
no way of distinguishing the useful
information from the useless information
and so any traditional information that
happens to spring up like you have to
pray to the full moon or whatever is
going to get passed on just like a
computer virus and so my suggestion
would be that traditional religious
beliefs are like computer viruses their
account of mine virus and maybe that
answers your question I'm not sure
whether it does
professor Dawkins you were a
refreshingly outspoken critic of Pope
Benedict Joseph Ratzinger I suppose I
what criticisms you have for the new
pope in light of his recent interviews
and speeches in which he reached out to
atheists and other others of non
Catholic faith yes I don't know what to
make of it really I mean part of me
fears that we've moved from a wolf in
wolf's clothing to a wolf in sheep's
clothing he does seem to have a in spite
of his nice words his honeyed words he
does seem to have the same beliefs about
things that really matter like like
contraception and so on so I think we
need to bide our time and see whether he
whether he really is as benevolent as
easy as he seemed to be I guess I'm next
thanks for coming today Clinton uh-huh I
I was at one point I was somewhat
interested in joining the Masons just
from a social standpoint and I looked at
their rules and one of the rules was you
had to believe in something and I was
wondering if you had any thoughts on the
idea that regardless of what religion
you are you're okay with somebody if
they believe in something doesn't matter
how crazy it is could be well to name
one Scientology or something like it as
long as it's a religion it's okay versus
nothing I don't understand why that is
well can you can you believe in the
scientific method for example would that
would that count can you believe that
yes I mean that that seems to me to be
something to believe in because it works
I mean there's evidence for it
any belief it's hard to imagine not
believing in anything unless you use the
word belief in a funny way I should have
thought believing in reality believing
that there's a real world believing that
you can investigate the real world by
observation and experiment I would I
think i would probably wish to call that
belief well specifically they said a
higher power which Ohia power I beg your
pardon um no I um I don't have any
hankering after any sort of higher power
not even sure what a higher power would
look like a higher power meaning
something that we don't yet understand
that I can easily believe it i mean i'm
quite short it's highly likely that on
other planets in the universe there are
other life forms and some of them may
very well have developed a technology so
far in advance of us that we have we
ever met them might feel inclined to bow
down and worship them in the same kind
of way as if we were to visit the Middle
Ages in a Boeing 747 and display a
laptop computer we would probably be
worshipped as gods as arthur c clarke
said any sufficiently advanced
technology is indistinguishable from
magic so I think you might well wish to
use the word higher powerful and alien
intelligence that was superhuman but not
supernatural I can't actually quite
imagine what supernatural would look
like so no I don't I wouldn't wish to
join any organization that required me
to believe in anything supernatural I
trust you didn't actually join the
Maysles no thanks thanks a lot
thank you perhaps I'll follow up on this
question because this is a matter that
has had some some local relevance there
seem to be a large number of people who
claim to be religious but very tolerant
but they seem to be tolerant of other
religions but very intolerant to
atheists there seems to be a strong
sense in which atheists are somehow even
the existence is offensive to them one
such person is a recent executive of
king county the county in which we live
who you know made it very clear that he
accepted people of all faiths as long as
you had faith yes and I wonder if you
have some explanation for why there is
this this seat is bizarre isn't it I
mean it's a thing you very often meet
until I think very very recently the Boy
Scouts required you to believe in some
sort of higher pastures thought and and
Little League here yes and to get
charitable recognition to get to get
charitable status both in Britain and in
America to get the tax free state status
of a charity you can do it if you're not
religious but it's a hell of a lot
easier if you're religious it doesn't
matter what religion you are oddly
enough in Britain there was a time when
it had to be a monotheistic religion but
i think the hindus protested and got
them and got that that changed but it
still it's pretty difficult if you if
you don't have some sort of religion i
have two charities which i founded a
booth called Richard Dawkins foundation
for reason and science one in Britain
one in America and the British charity
commissioners this is the organization
that decides whether you get tax-free
charitable status at one point wrote to
me and said please explain it was called
the Richard Dawkins foundation for
reason and science and they said please
explain how science benefits humanity
but if it had been a religion it would
have sailed through and by the way I
spent some time in Washington DC a
couple of weeks ago talking to about a
half a dozen Congress people and they
all told me the same thing which is that
you can get tax-free charitable status
in America if you call yourself Reverend
but there is no policing to see whether
you have any legitimate theological
qualifications so I would invite
everybody in this room to declare
themselves Reverend and get tax-free
status and break the system first of all
thank you for your relentless push for
reason my question is about its kind of
usual to hear these days people claiming
that comment religious but I'm sorry
we're just I'm spiritual thank you so
what's you taking this kind of claim or
being spiritual is that sort of a good
compromise a better option for people or
is that the step in the slippery slope
of defying variety I I think that it can
be a semantic matter I think that quite
a lot of scientists especially who claim
to be religious or others claim that
they are religious if you actually cross
question them to see what they believe
it usually turns out to be something
with you you might be calling spiritual
Einstein for example use the language of
religion a lot Einstein was always
talking about God he said things like
what I really want to know is whether
God had any choice in creating the
universe what he meant by that was is
there only one way for a universe to be
but he put it in God language and he'd
made various other he said I'm a deeply
religious non-believer Carl Sagan used
the poetic language of science
would describe the the poetic feelings
that he had when contemplating the
universe I feel the same way when
contemplating the universe or when
contemplating deep time geological time
when contemplating the complexity of
life the evolution of life you can use
the word spiritual for this feeling of
reverence almost reverence for the deep
mysteries of the universe and science
but don't use it to mean anything
supernatural it's it's used for
reverence for that which we don't yet
understand i think that's perhaps the
way Einstein was using it there's a lot
that we don't understand there are deep
problems in the universe that still
require solution and we can feel
spiritual about it we can feel almost
tearful about it sometimes and i think i
do that but i prefer not to use the word
spiritual because as you said there is a
slippery slope but people may sometimes
mistake what you're saying for religion
in the sense of a personal God which
Einstein himself disavowed most
vigorously thank you so following up on
your inquiry from the British
authorities about how science benefits
humanity how did you respond I'm afraid
I had to take it straight I mean I'm
afraid sorry we're I you I don't who I'm
talking to you I'm afraid I had to UM
when I asked the lawyer who was dealing
with my case I said surely I don't have
to answer this do I and she said yes
we're afraid to do so I give a sort of
conventional speech feel on on how
important sciences for practical uses
for humanity but I'm sure that I would
have added because I feel strongly about
it that it's not just the practical uses
of science that are important but it's
also really similar to what I was just
saying about the the spirituality I mean
the the poetic feeling
that we have when we contemplate the
world has seen through the eyes of
science I think you could make a nice
analogy between well one way putting it
is to talk about thus the space
exploration and you couldn't talk
instead of arthur c clarke or carl sagan
type terms about the outward urge and
the the urge to explore and the spirit
of Columbus and Magellan and and and
Drake and people like that who felt the
urge to explore that we feel about space
that would be one motive for going into
space the other motive would be the
practical one a by-product a spinoff
from the space race was the nonstick
frying pan but we don't justify the
space race because the spin-off was a
nonstick frying pan nor do we justify
music because it's good exercise for the
violinists right arm it's there's
something more to music there's
something more to science than that and
I hope that I and that I conveyed that
to this Philistine in the British
cherishes office thank you
to question one do you believe in luck
second question is why not be agnostic
rather than an deities do I believe in
luck well I read the bit about if the
second dinosaur to the left of the tall
cycad tree hadn't happened to sneeze we
are all gigantically lucky to be here
the the luck that a particular sperm
happened to hit a particular egg in your
parents generation and your grandparents
generation and your great grandparents
generation is simply stupendous we we
none of us have any right to be here yet
with hindsight here we are so yes I
believe in luck but I don't believe that
that you can do it with foresight I
think with hindsight we're lucky but I
don't believe that you can say some
people are luckier than others when they
play roulette or something like that can
roulette wheel is fair then it's it's
random and and you can't say that some
people are luckier than others in my
previous book the magic of reality which
is a children's book I dealt with this
question by pointing out that I used the
example of a cricket perhaps you play
cricket side I don't know sir and you
know that it went when you about to
start a cricket match the two captains
toss for who's going to bat first and
it's it's great advantage to win the
toss and there are some people who
believe that some individuals are better
at winning the toss and so they might
even choose them to be captain of their
team because they're more likely to win
the toss and I used the example of an
Indian captain Dhoni who would who won
the toss I think seven times in a row
and people started to believe that that
he was more likely to win the toss again
because of that other people might
actually use the exact opposite fallacy
and say well he's won the toss so many
times it's somebody else's turn now but
both of course are fallacious and that a
lot of people believe a lot a lot of
gamblers in particular
believe in this particular fallacy about
about luck but luck luck with hindsight
yes by all means talk about luck with
hindsight we are all with hindsight
immensely lucky to be alive and that's a
very good reason for not wasting our
time while we're here oh the other
question was why not be agnostic yes
we're all agnostic really about millions
and millions of things we're agnostic
about Thor and Votan and apollo and zeus
and Wonder Woman and Superman and
leprechauns flying teapots we you know
Bertrand Russell's analogy of the teapot
in its in space you can't disprove it so
technically we're we're agnostic about
the teapot but in practice were a teapot
ists we don't we don't consider our
agnosticism we don't push our
agnosticism to the point of actually
seriously worshiping the teapot or
anything like that although having said
that I was once sent a picture that I
think came from Malaysia of a gigantic
teapot it was a temple in the shape of a
teapot and people were worshiping the
teapot and so I had to be a little bit
careful with I use Bertrand Russell's to
the family so this is could you tell us
a little bit of how computer science is
perceived among biologists I mean this
is in relation to the with the talk was
introduced well when I said that at the
beginning about computer science being
relevant to biology I mean of course
it's relevant in the sense that we use
computers all the time but that wasn't
actually what I meant i mean all
scientists used computers all the time
nowadays that wasn't what I meant what I
meant was that since the Watson and
Crick revolution in molecular biology
which began in 1953 and has been
gathering pace ever since we've
recognized that genetics and the basis
for life itself the machine code of life
it is
just like man-made computers it's not
binary it's quaternary but apart from
that by all modern biology is a branch
of computer science a branch of
information technology the way genes
work and the way genes are if they're
just like long long reels of computer
tape and you can use all the same kinds
of jargon that you use as as computer
scientists and with hindsight I think
it's arguable that Darwinian evolution
would not have been possible in any
other way because the Darwinian
evolution to work you need to have very
high fidelity data processing there must
be there must be just a few mistakes but
not many mistakes very very few mistakes
the sorts of low-level errors that we
that you try to get rid of in computer
science and never can never quite get
rid of them so that's what I meant by
saying that biology is a branch of
computer science but in a more mundane
practical sense we use computers all the
time for processing data for running
simulations which is a very important
aspect of biological research and and so
on
professor talking as a as a parent I
aspire to instill in my children the
love of free thinking and critical
thinking at the same time I'm coming
from a family where there are deeply
religious people there I really want to
avoid their minds to become a
battlefield of sorts and and and then
ended up being the victims do you have
any words of advice how to thread in
that cannot yes I I think the thing to
do is is um don't indoctrinate them in
atheism any more than you would in
doctrine ate them in religion but
encourage them to think critically and
of course you have to tailor that to the
age when they're very young it's
different from when they're when they're
a bit older so I think in particular
children should not be wishing we should
give up the assumption that so many of
us in our society do have the children
automatically are assumed to be of the
same religion as their parents that I
that I think is what is wicked and if
you when you you can raise consciousness
in people about that so that they should
never actually talked about a Catholic
child or an Anglican child or a Muslim
child you raise consciousness of that by
putting to them the possibility of
talking about an existentialist child or
a postmodernist child or a logical
positivist child you'd never dream of
doing that or a Keynesian child or a
monetarist child you've never dream of
doing that and yet so many people in our
society are perfectly happy to talk
about a Muslim child or a Catholic child
it is as absurd to talk about a Catholic
child or a Muslim child as it is to talk
about an existentialist child or a
Kantian child and once you get that once
you once you see the absurdity of that
then you you never do it again and you
pull people up and stop them if they
have you ever hearing about you're
talking about a cab
child or a Muslim child or a Protestant
child so never label a child with the
religion of its parents until the child
is old enough to decide for itself teach
children that religion exists teach
children about the different religions
because that's an important part of the
world in which we live and you can't
understand history without knowing about
the different religions because so many
of the Wars of history for example have
been fought over religion you need to
teach children the Bible because the but
because especially the King James
version of the Bible has fed into so
much of English literature and you can't
take your illusions in literature unless
you're familiar with biblical phrases in
my book The God Delusion I had I think
two whole pages of densely packed print
of well-known sayings and phrases which
most people don't even realize come from
the Bible and and how familiar they are
so I think it's important to teach
children about religion but don't ever
indoctrinate your children in religion
nor nor indoctrinate them in atheism
instead teach them critical thinking so
they can make up their own mind when
they're old enough to do so hi so I saw
the research in artificial intelligence
like self-driving cars or just plain
machines has it influenced basic biology
anyway yes artificial intelligence is I
think a very interesting subject it
seems to not have lived up to the
promise of a few decades ago when I
think people thought that by the year by
now 2013 we would have artificial
intelligence which which really would
pass the Turing test and would be
we might actually be facing the the need
to ask moral questions is it is it
immoral to to to make a computer unhappy
or something of that sort we we seem to
be nowhere near that at the moment I
think as a biologist as a mechanist
biologist I am committed to the view
that there's nothing in the brain which
could not in principle be simulated in
silicon because I don't think there are
any spooks in the world and I think it's
all material and so whatever however the
brain works however the trillions of
neurons in the brain actually work in
principle it should be possible to make
a computer version of that which would
have the same properties so I think it's
of great philosophical interest to to
biologists Thank You professor Dawkins
uh Anna welcome as a typical Chinese
student I had no religion before coming
to a college but after reading The
Selfish Gene II i developed a my
religious thoughts and now i'm a
christian the question is when you can't
win them all
so the question is assume a religion
with a bare minimum principles of a
below one there's a personalized God
with a higher power and the dictates
human to be morally righteous using
parables or metaphors to the God doesn't
dictate or explain anything other than
moral perspective say science history or
chronology so does this religion still
impede science or technology progress or
harm the world in any way well I don't
really understand why you would feel any
need to resort to religion when trying
to frame your morals if that's what
you're suggesting if you're suggesting
that somehow we need religion for a
moral compass I'm surprised that
somebody of a scientific disposition
would would do that really when you look
at the when you look at religions it
doesn't matter which one you take really
but where I happen to be familiar with
the Christian one which is what you're
familiar with and you ask yourself what
would be the sources of morality from
the religion I can think of two one
would be the scriptures and I think I'm
right in saying that no modern moralist
would really wish to take their morals
from christian or jewish scriptures from
that from the Bible or or the Quran for
that matter to be sure you can find
moral verses verses in the Bible perhaps
especially in the New Testament which
you would regard as moral by the
standards of 2013 but you can find a lot
more verses that you would most
certainly would not regard as moral by
the standards of 2013 so when you
cherry-pick when you go through the
Bible and you say yes we'll have that
verse in that verse but we'll leave out
all these horrible verses in Leviticus
and Deuteronomy and numbers and Exodus
and Genesis when you pick and choose
which vs. to accept like the Sermon on
the Mount by what criterion do you pick
and choose them well the answer cannot
be by scriptural criteria so the answer
must be by some other criteria and those
other criteria are the ones which we all
of us in 2013 except as decent citizens
of 2013 anyway now we're those morals
come from mean we're all pretty much
labeled 2013 more or less we but we
don't like sexism we don't like slavery
we don't like racism we're becoming
kinder to non-human animals there are
all sorts of ways in which our morals
are labeled 2013 and it's by those 2013
criteria that we decide which verses in
the Bible or the Quran to accept and
which vs2 to reject so it doesn't seem
to me to make any sense to say that you
need religion in order to get or
certainly not that you need scripture in
order to get your morality the other
possible source of morality might be
more mercenary one of wishing to please
God and not offend him sucking up to God
that might be the motivation for some
people i have actually even met people
who said if i didn't believe in god i
got and murder my neighbor but but i
don't think many of us would wish to
know such a person I think we'd rather
prefer to make friends with people whose
motive for being good is not that they
are sucking up to God or that they are
frightened of a sort of divine spy
camera in the sky that's watching over
everything we do so I'm somewhat baffled
by your being persuaded of the need for
religion by moral considerations
okay do you thank the human society
whenever mature to the point where it
doesn't religion and mother or no what
do you think is the best way to get us
to advance towards that point unless you
can tell them up laughter well I
obviously I hope so and I am moderately
optimistic I think that in well there's
some evidence some statistical evidence
that religion tends to die in those
parts of the world where there is plenty
of Social Welfare plenty of provision
for people so they don't have to fear
poverty destitution ill health and so on
the Scandinavian countries which are the
most irreligious countries in the world
are also the countries in the world that
have the most benevolent social welfare
system the United States is the country
in the Western advanced world which I
suppose has the least it's struggling to
get obamacare through for example which
would be a pretty tame kind of social
welfare by Scandinavian standards and
Gregory Paul whose research I'm citing
has looked not only at across different
countries but also at the different
states within the United States and
finds that the same correlation holds
that those states which are the most
religious are also the states which have
the least social welfare and they're
also the states that have the highest
abortion rates the highest rates of
single parenthood and and and things
like that that you might think that
religious people would disapprove of so
that that's possible one run ground for
optimism that you that the more we move
towards a kind of welfare state
the more religion will die I think the
other grounds for hope come really from
the internet where it's very hard for
dictatorships to prevent people from
getting access to the internet it's very
hard for theocracies like Saudi Arabia
to prevent people from getting access to
the knowledge of the world because of
the internet they try Moore's law is
seeing to it that access to computers
becomes ever cheaper and wider and so
even relatively poor parts of the world
are increasingly becoming linked to the
Internet and so I feel rather happy
making this point in in what are the
leading computer high tech companies in
the world it seems to me that people
like you are doing a good thing in in
spreading computers and the Internet to
all parts of the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
