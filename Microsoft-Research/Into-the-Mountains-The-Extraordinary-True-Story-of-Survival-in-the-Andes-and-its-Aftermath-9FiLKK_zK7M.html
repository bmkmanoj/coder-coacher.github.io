lectures freely available
you
think we'll get started can everyone
hear me at the back okay good so it's
nice to see a full lecture theater
welcome to everyone today we have a very
special guest Pedro el corte as many of
you will know Pedro was one of the 16
survivors of the 1972 Andes disaster one
of the most famous incredible survival
stories in all of history really and
many of you will know the story that was
immortalized in PS Paul reads book alive
which was published in 1974 such was the
interest that it sold 5 million copies
almost off in its first edition and it's
a story of great courage and inspiration
it's an incredible story and if you
haven't read the live I really recommend
you do it so after the trauma of the
Andes and the euphoria of the rescue
72 in the Andes Pedro sort of said about
reconstructing his life and going about
the task of living he moved to Buenos
Aires from across the river from
Montevideo where he finished off his
studies he got a degree in Economic
Sciences at the University of when Cyrus
he then spent a couple of years in the
States where he got an MBA at Stanford
University and then he embarked on a
very successful business career he rose
to senior positions in several companies
in Argentina including CEO of the
largest brewery in Argentina so in
recent years Pedro has started talking
about the Andes after long self-imposed
silence and this week sees the
publication of his book into the
mountains in the UK and it is a
fascinating book there will be copies of
available to buy on your way out I'm
sure if you ask better nicely he'll find
in few and it really is perhaps that
there's several accounts by the
survivors but Pedro's account I think is
is one of the most raw and compelling of
the accounts and it's a very worthwhile
read and some of the skills that he
brought to the survival on the mountain
his capacity to work collaboratively to
work hard in a team he brought to his
business career and and and I think made
a great success of it so I don't want to
take up any more time Pedro please give
a very warm welcome
Pedro
thank you John
let me reduce you to John that will
explain what I'm doing here
two years ago I just published my book
in Spanish in in Argentina which has a
different name it's called the mountains
are still there and I have just
published then I received a call from
one of my friends saying that was a
guide from Cambridge in England that
wanted to see me you know wanted to ask
some questions and I say ok let's let's
meet this guy that wants to to ask some
questions about the and stuff so I met
John you know he was you know Cyrus he
was his second time into the undies he
has been there where the plane had crash
and then he came into bono Cyrus and I
wanted to talk to me as one of of the
survivors and we had a very nice
conversation in one of the most
expensive restaurants in Buenos Aires
which he paid generously and then he
bought two copies off of my book and he
asked me to sign the copies of course I
did and then he said do you want me to
translate your book well that was a
strange offer you know it was the finger
the guy coming from Cambridge which I
didn't know he spoke or not Spanish at
all was going to translate my book or
say okay go ahead and let's see what's
what what's coming you know so a week
later I received a memo with other
proposal with dates and commitments and
then there was a brilliant plan to
translate my book okay go ahead and and
a few days later say okay the first the
first in stone
is due in 30 days I will send you the
first chapter of the book and if you
like it
I will continue with the others so in 30
days I received the first chapter the
book was translated by John Guyver
and I realized that it was a better
production that even the Spanish one you
know the Spanish had some errors had
mistake has some repetitions John not
only has translated my book into a
beautiful English but he had been able
to translate and to transmit all what I
wanted to say even in a best way so he
translated other book and at the same
time I found a publisher who here in the
UK who was willing to publish my book if
I found that translator so I have both
thing as translator and a publisher and
therefore we published the book and then
he came why don't you come to Cambridge
to Microsoft my place my home where I
work and take us and speak about about
your experience there on this and
present your book so here that's what
I'm here and I really think that this
event it's I can apply I can only thank
John of being here that he if without
him him I would have been able to
publish my book and I wouldn't be able
to be here with you so thank you very
much John for your generosity and
cooperation and because of you
this book has is a reality let me talk a
little bit about the end s but before
that I would like to show you a very
small video that would take us to 1972

well I always enjoy showing this small
film because of a few things one is that
there's no fiction you know it's the
real thing that well was said when we
were rescued from the undersea saw that
well news that appear on Don on the
television in in Chile and it shows what
we were saying for the four years ago
and I like to show this type of vintage
film because I realized that what I said
44 years ago is basic what I say now oh
it's my main message my message my main
message is that we were able to escape
from the unders not because of a an act
of God but because we fought and we
worked hard to get out of the unless you
know the it is a miracle or like a
miracle is that we are alive you know we
cannot explain things but I can explain
what happened there in the endless you
know I was able to survive and to live
minute by minute I know what what we had
to do I know what we gone through you
know and and this is a story of hard
work of hard work made by normal people
common people we were just a group of a
bunch of youngsters from from Uruguay
flying to play a rugby match in Chile
and we suddenly find this horrible
scenario where we didn't know where we
were what to do we didn't have any
mountain experience and it's no
experience these notes no wonder why we
didn't know you what to do at all you
know and step by step question by
question
you know answering the things that we
have to answer at that time without too
much forecasting what was going to come
through we were able to construct this
build this enormous survival machine
that it was ourselves and the group and
the body group that we were able to to
build in in the endless let me tell you
two or three things about our experience
first about the accident
don't touch me too much because I don't
I don't remember you know I can't tell
you a couple of things I have images
which are mixed up with all the stories
that I've heard with all the times we
have told the story so I cannot separate
what it is true or what it is my image
you know of course I can speak about the
accident I will tell you a story the
story that I've seen in in many movies
but I have some images which I know that
is all our mind for example I can
remember the face of my my brother
Felipe who was died just along my side
you know that is in not in any movie at
all that has to be my own image and why
I cannot recall everything that happen
well one of the things that happen is
that I was shocked I was blocked you
know I was in a way protected I cannot
recall everything about that moment of
so intense emotions it was behind this
it was the accident you know so after
the accident I started to leave my
second life in the middle of of the
others just in the bottom of the valley
which works the place where the plane
had landed you know that we were we were
45 passengers in that flight we were
flying from Montevideo and Uruguay to
Chile to play a rugby match and so
suddenly I remember that I woke up in
that Valley with a team of my friends
already
yet out of the 45 passenger we were we
were 27 people who were alive some of us
were without main injuries some of them
had some injuries but most of us were
shocked no shock as emotionally shot as
a way of protection or what we had gone
through but in a few moments we started
to adapt to a new environment we started
we have to learn to do to survive minute
I admit what was going on we were
surrounded of dead bodies no our friend
had died do you think that we were able
to morning to mourn them well that was
impossible you know I remember some
faces I remember the bodies but I don't
remember being impressed or what that
scenario was I was just able to stand up
to realize how well I didn't have any
injury and went out of the plane and
when I went down to the plane I realized
we were in the middle of the mountains
and we were covered by snow the big
mountains were all around and there was
a very low crowd that didn't allow us to
see much further and from there from
that instance were 27 guys completely
shocked emotionally well we started to
do the small things that we have to do
to start living again and to start the
legend learning to adapt to the
circumstances that we were experienced
the first thing was to realize that we
were alive you know we started to
realize that we had to eat that we had
to drink water that we have to protect
ourselves from the cold so we started to
answer those basic and vital questions
how we were going to drink water how we
are going to produce the water from the
snow well how we want to feed ourselves
you know we had some chocolate some this
with some some wine how
going to protect from the co so while we
open all the bags and all that stuff and
and distribute it and share all the
clothing that we had available and at
the same time some characters our
personality started to play a more
important role in the group at out those
times I couldn't play a very important
role my level of emotional shock was
quite high I only could react to very
vital impulses just learn it - how to
drink how to drink water to sleep to eat
and to start to really relate myself
with my friends but some of them for
example the captain of the team which he
was without any wound he started to feel
as a responsibility for the group no he
had organized the flight he had to give
us some answers and and he tried to
convey the idea that sooner or later we
were going to be rescue we don't have to
worry we have to keep tight that sooner
or later someone will will come for us
but the day's started to pass away I
remember the first night very cold
horrible but that night we'll go through
the second day the third day and when we
were about a week there nobody had
already came for us we started to have
some second thoughts whether they would
come for us or not I remember that we
have a very small radio in which we can
hear the news about our search and we
knew that they were looking for us but
nothing happened one day there was a
plane that flew on top of us and when
they were flying just over our group the
plane made a movement with their wings
and when the plane made a movement were
the wings we understood that I was a
signer but we understood that what they
were saying is that they has seen us and
that sooner or later the day after today
maybe tomorrow or the day after
morrow they will come and look for us so
there was a big emotion we have been
seen we are going to be rescued and we
made a party in the party we had all our
supplies we are all the chocolate the
cookies the wife everything
so the next day we were going to be
rescue the next day we woke up early we
turn on the radio trying to listen to
the news to start to find out how we're
going to be rescue trying to understand
well what we have to do but what we
heard in that that radio that morning
was completely the opposite
we heard that given the fact that we had
been lost for more than a week in the
middle of the Andes there was no chance
that anyone would would be alive so the
search was cancelled
no was postponed until the weather would
improve enough that in ordered that the
thaw would allow the rest of the plane
to come out and and and someone will
come up for our our bodies so that was
the truth that was what we heard
nobody was was going to come after after
us so that was a very bad knew but about
a knew that at that time at that point
of time we understood us as something
that was societal no the Sinai was that
we couldn't wait to be rescued that if
we were going to survive the understand
to get out of the mountain it was
because of we take the responsibility of
doing what we have to do that we had to
start working hardly in order to get out
of the mountains so we decided to well
study to talk how you are going to get
out we were made going to make an
expedition we were going to improve the
carcass of the plane which was our house
we were going to do many things in order
to stay there for one week more two
weeks three months whatever and
someone will come for us but we had a
problem we had already taken care of all
our supplies we didn't have anything
else to eat and with that ten days we
have been there in the mountain we were
very weak we were hungry but not the
hungry of eating something that you like
and very quickly we will had the hunger
of the weakness you know we have a
hunger that comes from your stomach that
makes you think slower that you move
very with the difficulties that you
think that you are starting to get tired
more and more tired no that was the
hunger that we felt so at that time made
many of us at the same time realized
that if we wanted to get out of the
mountain if we wanted to survive we
needed to feed ourselves from something
and we realized that we had the solution
on hand and was the bodies of our dead
friends the bodies of the dead friends
would be able to give us necessary
energy to survive the endless so one day
without too much discussion we discuss
it between ourselves but because we need
to do it but not because we need to
convince that we had to do it when a
group of us went to one of the bodies
made a cut of a piece of glass and we
start to eat and when we start to eat
the flesh of one of our friends we
realized that we didn't did anything
wrong the only thing that happened was
that we were able to cross a line the
line of death and life so we started to
eat at Lee at the beginning with a big
impression just small parts and then we
started with everything and we get when
we and we got used to live eating the
flesh of her friends that was the energy
that was that was what connected us to
life that was what we needed to survive
that was what we were able to do to keep
us alive
so without source of energy without
possible
we realized that we have to work harder
you know being able to launch an
expedition that was going to be able to
get out of the understand bring help to
the group so we started to work hard
thinking about how we were going to get
out of the Andes starting to select
those who were going to be the
expedition Aires and we were working on
that when we had a ones an avalanche we
I remember that I was sleeping inside of
the plane it was the beginning of of the
night I think I remember that it was
sleeping on the floor I had a hand near
my face when suddenly we heard a brick
snow in the mountains and suddenly tons
of no fall over
fell over the plane and got inside the
plane through the back part that was
open to the mountain and covered
completely the plane and inside the
plane with snow suddenly I was covered
by the snow I couldn't stand up I
couldn't incorporate myself so I tried
to move and at the beginning there's no
is porous so I was able to inspire and
oxygen will come to my lungs and I would
be able to expand my lines in my stomach
and leave a space between my my body and
the snow so I was able to continue
breathing for a while until there's no
freezes and when there's no freezes it
turns into ice and the oxygen what
didn't came through anymore
and when I was left out of oxygen
well I try to fight a little bit more of
my life but it was too too complicated I
started to feel very very tired no and
they started to to fall apart to start
to get asleep very quietly and when I
was almost gone one of my friends was to
take the snow out of my mouth and
suddenly all the oxygen came back into
my lungs and when the oxygen came back
to my lungs
I again felt the strength and the will
to continue fighting for life so few
minutes later another of my friends
grabbed my hand and took me out of the
snow first until my shoulder stern my
waist and finally I was able to to get
out those were the worst date I remember
you know the worst days because I can't
explain you everything that I feel and I
felt not as I said before because of on
the moment of the accident which I'm
protected but I can't recall everything
that happened the day of the avalanche
an avalanche that was very costly
because on their hand eight more of her
friends died that night among those who
had died was my friend Marcelo was the
captain of the team who was so important
at the very beginning who said that we
held hold on that they were going to
come for us but with time he has been
losing his position of authority because
what he was saying didn't mean
everything anything to the others and
among the others who died that that
night was Liliana who was the only woman
that was still alive with us and that
she and she played and she had played a
tremendous role in the first days being
a real mother for most of them of the
smaller children the were with us in the
plane the point is that this tragic
avalanche also helped us a lot because
it provided us with eight more bodies
eight more bodies that were absolutely
significant without those eight more
bodies we would have been able to arrive
to a 70th day of our survival adventure
now after the Avalanche
we have lost her captain we lost
everything we lost the radio we lost the
machines we had to start again now we
were just a couple of guys without an
authority figure we had to figure out
what we had to do to be able to survive
and to eventually get out of the
mountain so different people
start playing different roles no we had
those who have a very big spirituality
well they become our priests and
organize all our prayers every every
evening which was very important for a
group no regardless where they believe
or not in God praying for all of us was
very very important we also had our guys
who were the engineers well they tried
to fix up the radio they tried to fix up
things they try to send signers whatever
they could be good they were important
for the group because they meant that
technically we were also doing things to
get out of the mountain well so the
medical students in America students
well they graduate as a militias as
doctors over there in the mountain they
were able to fix bones and make sutures
and everything you know they really
worked as as doctors over there in the
mountain I was the intellectual you know
it was not very useful to have an
intellect where at that time but I did
my I did what I had to do you know I
tried to understand maps and and to give
some thought to put some thinking in
what we were doing but all that was was
worthless but was really worth is that I
worked as hard as I could I worked as
hard as I could and that was very very
important it was important for me
because it kept me focused on what was
happening it was important for the group
because it was very significant that all
the others work you know that everyone
do what he could do to for him and for
the group and I think in that they
regard all or all the things that we did
were important not not everyone was
behaving well not everyone was a big
leader not everyone knew everything
about the mountain actually we didn't
know nothing about mountains but with
all the decisions that we do with all
the mistakes that we made with all that
just
that we had to make into the group we
hold a misbehaviors that we had within
the group we were able to to adapt
ourselves to what was going on and to
survive day by day making mistakes
making things that were very costly but
allowing the group to adapt and survive
day by day they're over there in the
mountains finally three or more three of
our friends died of other things of
wounds they had received before and at
the end the first day of December Numa
to cut he died he was going to be one of
the expeditionaries because he was a
very strong guy but suddenly he started
to came down and finally he he lost
almost all his weight and died and the
first days of December and that was a
call you know the call that we couldn't
wait more I call that that we have to
respond in some way so the day after
Ganesha parado and Byzantine or three
expeditionary started tremendous a
tremendous adventure they started to
climb the mountain that we had on her
back and they climb that mountain for
three days every day a smaller spot in
the white slope of the mountain they
arrived to the peak and when they got to
the peak what they saw was not the green
valleys of Chile's that they thought
that they were gonna see they saw more
and more mountains and over there
they decided to continue working that
didn't make any sense at all to get to
get back to the plane within you that
again they had failed so they continue
walking and wait they continue walking
they sent back to be sent into the plain
with a news that they had started this
this incredible walk ten days later we
were still in the plane waiting for
enforce for some news and that day I
remember that we turn on the radio and
we were able to listen that two people
two persons
I've been spotted walking in the Indian
days and that they said that they were
coming from the crash from Uruguay and
plane that had crashed 70 days ago for
us that was a first you probably there
were condition piranha we didn't want to
we didn't got very emotional time but in
a few moments we heard the news that
confirmed that kanessa piranha were
those two people walking through the
Andes and that they say that 14 more
guys were waiting risk to be rescued in
the middle of the of the mountains so we
were very happy
imagine finally we were getting to the
end of a trip we were going to get
rescue so we prepared to get rescue so
we shared the money that we had we made
our list of errands that we were going
to do who we were going to call we
prepare also to get back into
civilizations we didn't think at all
that we're going to be any media over
there that we have done anything strange
or anything that 40 years later I would
be in Cambridge talking about it we are
just been surviving we have been trying
to survive day by day and we were
getting to the end of the trip so of
course we were absolutely happy but it
was not an explosion of emotions because
we have not died we had not died for a
minute
we had been alive always every minute no
we couldn't
can we couldn't died for an instant that
was what kept us alive finally towards
midday of December 22nd three
helicopters came around us flew over us
they they threw some packages three
members of the Chilean rescue team came
to us and I remember that I crossed them
I just ran into one of the lis copters
and when I got into one of the copters
AHA came out grabbed me by my pants and
throw me into the ricotta and in Delhi
copter I found
Nando parado who had done they had
undone the way that he had made walking
through the Andes and he guided the
helicopter to where we were and that's
how we we got out the first day we were
six out of the mountain plus kinesin
parado we were eight and I'd more stay
one more day in the in the mountain and
that's the story you know that's the
story of the undies three months later I
went back to school and I put the
mountain in my mouth in my backpack and
lived a normal life without tomato
without any nightmare without too many
things and I think that the best and the
most important thing that I can convey
is the fact that even if you fall in a
mountain you can do a normal life you
can do a normal life means two things
one is the normal capacity of resiliency
the normal capacity of recovering the
enormous capacity of living normal lives
if even after experience very hard
situations but the other side of that
same coin is the fact that we didn't
learn too many things you know I'm not a
guru I'm not a special person I cannot
give lessons of life I just can't really
say that I experienced the unless I am a
normal guy and I'm very happy to hear
today thank you
okay we have quite a lot of time for
questions
let's pass hi you mentioned that you had
maps but do you have any idea where you
were on the maps on what direction you
should move well we have maps but we
were we didn't have any idea where we
were it was impossible we didn't we
didn't know where we were
the pilots before dying had said that we
had crossed the under that we were on
the Chilean side and we had crossed cool
eco which is a city in Chile you know so
we should be on the Chilean side but
where we were in a valley that opened
itself to the east towards an tina and
the mountains were much lower or the
Adhan Tinian side but we thought that we
were in chile we didn't have any
mountain experience so we made sort of
full of ideas where we were well we
didn't have a clue you know and the fact
is that the first expedition went toward
the east down the mountain hoping that
at some point of time the valley will
turn and we'll get takeout to to the
west to chile where we thought that we
were but the fact is that we were under
a tent in 'inside and the right way to
get up to the mountain was exactly that
way that we were seen that we had to
continue down the mountain
you know when ourselves - towards the
east so we didn't we didn't really knew
any other questions have you ever wanted
to unhappy returns to the crash site I'm
sorry have you ever wanted to return to
the site of the crash and have you done
that yeah I went two times I went in
1993 with with 13 of my friends of mine
brothers of the mountain it was a very
nice experience and i was very touchy
and then I went back about three years
ago with my wife that was an
extraordinary trip and what I found
there is that the mountains are still
there and we have been able to to
continue walk you know and as I said
before the mountains are still there is
the name of the Spanish Spanish book the
mountains are still there I am in
Cambridge now you know but happily they
are there which also speaks about the
fragility of the human being know there
are so big so huge so unsensible and
they cannot move but we are much more
fragile and can move it is a beautiful
place full of mystery John has been
there twice and maybe I go once more
there with some of my children or my
grandchildren if you have time when I
first read this assess the story of this
back in the 70s I seem to remember
reading a story that if you'd gone in a
particular direction there was supposed
to be a cabin way which you could have
sheldon's is that true or is that just
newspapers at the time well it's true
you know it's what do I said before that
we should have should have worked
East and that is the way out and today
the way to get the place is through
Argentina so
so that was their way out but the truth
is that we don't know because the the
walk is not an easy one anyway you know
and maybe our expeditions would have
arrived to work a cross of rivers you
know and they could not maybe they could
not cross the river they would stay
there for weeks and and stop over there
we don't know what these are falling to
we were walking through the wrong side
of the river they are falling into
oppressive into a crevasse I don't know
I'm not sure but what is true is that
the way out was through the east were
two or three days of work we there's a
cabin and and a little bit more there's
there is a there are soldiers over there
so this life you know that's the one was
the way out well we did it the wrong way
we did the difficult way and that the
good thing that even if you do it the
wrong way and you try hard you make it
the way you want to go I just add to
that I mean it is very difficult terrain
down on the argentinian side and it is
there's a lot of weight even when you
get out of the Andes it's a very sort of
desert like terrain so there's a good
chance there wouldn't be anyone there
there's a massive River down at the
bottom of the mountain that they would
hurt across so it's certainly by no
means clear that they would have been
rescued if they've gone that way and
I've read the first but alive and
nerado's book and it was photos of
several reunions but there was no no
photos of you did you did you not feel
that you wanted to attend or is it just
just the you weren't in the first life
you know like no in a neuron or in a
nerado's book miracle in ents miracle
yeah a beautiful book it's a beautiful
book I don't know why if there are no
pictures but should be around there was
bitches of 50 15 people I really it said
that you
you want in the photo body nervous
because you weren't there or you just
want one on the photo or whether you
didn't attend really know that you know
but in the book alive I mean in the
picture not pay me in perilous moment in
alive the one that wrote Pierce will
read wrote I am there with the squad
it's also true that in the movie alive I
die let the shot Mike either my car
doesn't get to the end you know so the
authors needed some type of characters
and I didn't problem the actor that
portrayed my role was not good enough so
they decided to kill him
but the truth is that they do a thirty
five years I care less about this I was
too busy working I was very busy
improving my tennis and my golf and
working hard and taking my children to
school and doing whatever I have to do
and I had this thing in my backpack
there in the corner in my room and
sometimes well perhaps writing a book so
I go and see movie I wanted to I went to
see some of my friends speak to to hear
what they say hey what are you speaking
why people are interesting what they say
I didn't really didn't get it you know
when the movie was made I took my
children and we went to Canada they were
were they were filming the movie and I
met my my actor who was going to die in
a few days and but I didn't thought I
had to do anything with that on the
other hand I was working hard you know
and I didn't want to divorce myself
between coming here and expose and open
my heart and telling all the beautiful
things with it and they're not beautiful
things with either youngest and it's an
exposure that you had to be prepared to
take you know when I was CEO of the
company I was not able
to to mix both things you know I just
couldn't do it so I work hard and once I
retired from the company they say what
I'm gonna do one of the things I did was
look back look back and found my
Mountain was fair in the corner and I
start looking into it and one of the
things that I found is that the way I
lived this story that the way I
experienced the way I interpret what
happened to us in the mountain it's
completely different than the way
parabolas or Roberto das or Carlitos das
or whatever you know and each one of us
has a different story to tell you know
all true you know parado stories
wonderful and he portrays himself as a
hero which is you know because he lost
his mother his sister were there he
walked ten days over the Andes and he
really is a very strong personality
that's fine with him he was not mine you
know I just worked hard over there in
the mountains I learned to survive not
only to the mountains but I learned to
survive the group you know I have to
play the dynamics of the group and I can
recall that parado doesn't care about
the dynamic of the group because he will
have a strong character I had to survive
parado too you know so from my point of
view it's a different story
no and I wanted to tell this story the
story of someone who survived 70 days
who worked hard to survive who was
important to the group but I was not a
hero you know I was not the guy to HUD
that have the flag and say hey come come
and follow me I didn't do that you know
I work hard my example my my hard
working was important for a group but
basically I work for me you know and
working for me I was able to work for
the group
nevertheless the way in the role I
played there in the mountain is very
similar to the way I then experienced my
role as a CEO of a company you know I
didn't have all the guys on
back saying let's go this way I was much
more cooperative guy I went with my
people
I stayed there and when you see the
picture of of the good of other group
here if you open the book you will see
there is a group of guys sitting sitting
on my left no it's a group there that
one is Roberto Canessa who's one of the
guys who walked he's a great guy I'm the
one sitting on top of the plane you know
having a overview over overseeing what
was going on being in touch but without
getting sat in in the middle of the
group that wasn't the way I survived the
youngest that was the way that I lived
then after in my corporate and my
business life yeah I should just say I
looked up the act of the played Pedro in
in the life and that was the only film
he yeah she made so so not only was he
killed off in the film but that was his
last one hello the radio you refer to
Torre the radio that you refer to that
you heard up to seven days that giving
up the search was that the planes radio
or was it an independent radio that
someone with batteries or brought along
oh it's a battery radio how do you
conserve the batteries if you were
listening I don't know record yes it's a
it's a miracle it is I don't know yeah
well the fact is that we had this radio
yes at the beginning we were able to to
hear the news then the radio disappeared
in there in the Avalanche we lost it
then it came back with a thaw and when
he came back we were still able to hear
some things so it's amazing it's amazing
do you know have the you know the brand
of the radio
it was a speaker speaker Spica and
speakers speak up very small one huh we
are not sure if it was brown or black
you know the consensus that discussion
whether it was black or brown that it
was a speaker you know that that was the
radio the radio of the airplane gave us
a lot of of headaches because we
intended to fix it up in order to send a
sign now but the radio was on the
cockpit so it was there and the
batteries of the radio were the tail and
the tail was took two kilometers down
down the haedong hill so we made the
excursion there came back we send people
they spent a week over there trying to
connect cables and all that stuff and
finally we were not able to do anything
at all people who understand more about
this say that it was impossible that we
could have made that radio work but we
spent a lot of time trying to make it
work and be inside the dynamics of the
group we our daughter were following the
idea that we had to continue working on
the radio and those that we had the idea
that we had to forget the radio and
start doing something else with a
electronic students or physics students
or engineers were they know it was a
matter of character you know Roberto
Canessa
wanted to fix up the radio he was going
to be one of the guys who was going to
walk but he was scared to death you know
and he almost was trying to find ways to
to say there you know because being in
the in the in the in the carousel of the
of the plane was her home world
we felt relatively say it'll be really
safe over there no it was hard to start
walking into the Noland you know we
didn't know anything at all what goes
going
so he had this Mick feelings you know
and he finally went Orkut he died well
we decided what this was the time to
start them and do other things when we
left them out when they started walking
we were 14 in in the alive in the plane
we have been dying you know two three
days one day they wondered when they
start working no one else died you know
the group in a way felt we were able to
stick to life and when they come to
rescue the 14 that were alive when they
start working we were still and I de
coche and Roy wouldn't last 48 more
hours but the 14 that that we're and I
one base two guys started to work well
we have been living for for that time
since then now alas last year
have you met all night he was is one
other this is the first one of the group
that passed away but he died because he
was 79 the truth nothing to do with a
mountain sorry during your time in the
mountains your called having any
arguments between you and your I'm sorry
during your time in the mountains
without your remember any arguments
between your friends always always yeah
we had a lot of discussions you know we
were not that group of friends I didn't
have anything to discuss not at all we
fought hard among ourselves we fought
for authority positions in the group you
know we were fought to be in the center
of the group you know my fight was to be
taken account within the group if I was
taking account I would be able to sleep
in the best places I was a was going to
be able to fit better you know I would
be able to have more right than other
said that wouldn't fight for themselves
so although things happen in
you know we even have our scapegoat you
know groups like that you need to have
scapegoats in order to expel the
tensions that you create in a group you
know and we have one of them there was
it's my friend poncho who I don't know
why because we all stole food as we
could we all those things that in order
to be ourself at the group decided that
he was going to be the bad guy no and if
you read peaceful read book you will
find that he is in a way the the
scapegoat of of a group and 14 years
later I'm a close friend from poncho and
I laugh at the fact that he has been
designed the scapegoat which is a
tremendous unfairness to him because we
all did whatever we have to do to
survive you know but in a scenario like
that what we needed to have a skateboard
where to - to pinpoint the province of
the group but of course we have fights
you know we did kill each other nothing
like that but when you have people
adapting to us such a situation you you
have tension you know and when you have
tension you have arguments because there
were very few resources and we fought
for survival high someone else the film
producers decided was dead you've spoken
to us very eloquently thank you you've
mentioned resilience and resistance of
human beings you've also mentioned
briefly faith was that something that
was very important to you personally and
as a whole group of faith yes in your
survival yes absolutely
faith in the survival faith that we were
going to get out what that we want to be
that there was a chance that we were to
get out you know we were not sure that
we were going to get out but we knew
that we had the
ability of getting out and we stick to
the possibility and we work hard as if
we were sure to get out so we work as if
we were going to get out although we
knew it we might not get out so that
that's that's important faith that we
were going or that we had the
possibility of getting out we also were
Catholics
most of us some of them didn't believe
in God at that time I believed in God
but we prayed very much every evening we
pray the rosary that was very important
for the group it would give us the
necessary kindness to endure that night
you know it would give us the necessary
calm us to heal our wounds among us you
know and every every day we went to
sleep in quietness and that allowed that
to rest that night and gave us strength
to start the new day with hope that that
might be the last day I didn't think
that we were going to survive because of
an act of God that suddenly I will woke
up in my bed in maan Osiris and II and
realized that there was just at
nightmare I didn't think about that
I only thought that I need God strength
God to give me the necessary strength to
continue fighting for life each day
after each day some of my friend had a
different view some of my friends
believe that we were saved by an act of
God others are a taste and they think
that God didn't have anything to do
there I believe he was with us
thank you very much for your talk um I
was just wondering because you found out
that they were had taken off the search
very early on I was wondering why it was
so long before you went for the decision
of sending a party to walk it out and
were there other things you were trying
other than the the plain radio or
anything else you were hoping out for
well the fact is that it took us the
first days well it took us the first two
weeks or whatever to get used to it we
were to realize well we we're remember
we didn't know anything at all about
mountains no whatever we had many people
wounded we didn't know what to do
no and on the other hand it was just
starting or spring it was still snowing
there was a lot of snow I think that if
we decided to walk out to the mountain
in the first days after the accident it
was just being impossible no my thing is
to work in the mountain in spring with a
lot of snow and the other thing is to
work in in summer with much less no you
can go there in March which is the end
of the summer you cannot go there in any
other period of time of the year because
it is it's not possible so it took time
you know we wouldn't have been able to
do it before although we tried and we
failed you know and the expedition that
went to the tail I went an expedition
for three or four hours uphill and found
the wing of the plane over there taking
banding I came back we will continue
trying failing learning and try another
thing you know and we tried zillions of
things for example things that we didn't
do that we should have done for example
we should have tried to burn one of the
tires of the plane maybe a black smoke
will come out from from the from one of
the wheels and from the tires and
would would seen us but it didn't just
occur us we didn't think about it ah no
nobody is saying hey let's let it burn
this tire we just didn't occur us
ourselves to do it
well people you have been very very
generous and I appreciate being here and
I thank again my friend translator and
co-author of my book john graver
and if someone wants to have a book and
a signature on it I will be more than
willing to do it but again thank you for
coming this is part of my healing
process you know speak about it and
realize that it's fun to do you know the
long things are still in the back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
