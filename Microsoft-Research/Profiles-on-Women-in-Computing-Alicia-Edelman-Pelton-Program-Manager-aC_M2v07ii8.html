in the advanced development team at
Microsoft Research and I'm a program
manager and our group helps to engineer
research projects to help get them to
the outside world in the form of a
product or an individual release burger
managers fill lots of different roles at
Microsoft and the role is really very
different in very different parts of the
company in Microsoft Research we kind of
are the glue between research and
engineering organizations like marketing
and legal and we hope to pull all those
pieces together I originally chose to go
into engineering and I started out in
electrical engineering in school and I
knew I wanted to be an engineer from a
very young age because I knew that I
loved math and I love to solve problems
in especially creative ways for me
solving problems was like doing a puzzle
you know everything was how do all the
pieces break down and how do they fit
back together in the most efficient and
beautiful ways so I knew I want to do
some sort of engineering I started out
in electrical engineering and went
straight through undergraduate and
decided that I really liked to write
code a lot better than I liked hardware
so in my graduate degree I decided to
explore artificial intelligence which
enabled me to write code for two more
ears I found out about program
management at a job fair at Purdue
during my graduate studies and I went up
to the woman at the microsoft booth and
I said so I i really like engineering
and i really love to write code but i
really like people to and and she said
so you know do do you like to see things
as a big picture do you like to interact
different types of people other than
just engineers and I said yeah
absolutely that's exactly the thing I'm
looking for and she said well we have
this role at microsoft and that's what
you do you you don't do coding every day
but it's good to know how to do that and
you've got to know how to interact with
people that write code every day but you
do much more and you have more contact
with the human interaction side with
people and with customers and I have to
say my eyes lit up and I couldn't
believe like they had something that was
exactly what I wanted to do it wasn't
sitting in a room writing code every day
but yet the opportunity to do that when
I wanted to and about a week later I was
on a plane visiting Microsoft and doing
my first interview there Microsoft is is
hugely supportive of educational
opportunities both inside and outside of
Microsoft as well as providing
mentorship opportunities I think those
things that I've taken advantage of have
really helped me grow my career
microsoft also provides additional
opportunities to explore creative and
even artistic endeavors we recently had
a week called a make fast the goal for
the week is to make something and people
come at the beginning of the week and
pitch different ideas and you can join
any team you want and do something that
is similar to what you do on a
day-to-day basis are completely
different and I chose to work with a
team that was looking at how to make
data more accessible to people we have
more and more data available to us every
day and so we picked Twitter data and we
looked at the expression of Twitter data
in food in textile we did crocheted
hyperbolic curves representing different
aspects of Twitter data we also did
abstract paintings we also did a series
of textual artistic interpretations that
included punctuation marks used in
Twitter
data we also did 3d models of the world
that showed the volume of tweets from
different areas of the world and we
actually printed them out on a 3d
printer so we looked at data in a
variety of different ways including many
different elements in the artistic realm
of how people can explore and interpret
data today and the goals of mcfist were
really to bring diverse groups of people
together to explore new ideas and to see
what might be fruitful in the future
when you have the opportunity to explore
things creatively kind of outside the
context of your normal job you know
genius could surface I think one of my
favorite projects at Microsoft was
working on index server 10 and it was
incredibly exciting because it was a new
product we were going out to the whole
world and we did the first World Wide
Web release for a product and you know
how we did it we sent people with CDs
couriered them all over the world
literally people with a suitcase chained
to their hand and then Oh everybody had
to copy them to the servers that were
sitting at her everybody's desk what
excites me is looking back and seeing
where we were and what we thought might
be possible and how we've crossed those
boundaries and i think if i look back to
that project and see how far we've
really come in just i know 17 years I
mean it's really quite spectacular I
mean things that we never thought were
possible are completely simple and easy
and my kids would not even think not to
have them today I always have to be
learning something new
and sometimes that applies directly to
work and I'm learning a new programming
language or I'm learning a new way to
specify things or I'm doing research on
different product methodologies
sometimes I'm learning outside of the
work how to cook or craft or bake or
sing or dance but I know I always have
to be learning and working on something
I'm incredibly passionate about social
justice and what gets me excited these
days is how accessible technology makes
us to social justice issues that used to
be invisible technology makes it
possible for us to experience life in
poverty virtually technology makes it
possible for us to come together to work
on a shared goal to raise money for a
cause or to pass a word about some
particular injustice so I'm very very
excited about the marrying of my work
life technology and you know my life at
home pursuing different social justice
issues and how those can work together
to give people a much more equal footing
in the world today I would advise
anybody in computer science to stay
there and to finish their degree there
are so many opportunities in technology
and computer science coming down the
pike and computer science jobs are going
begging so finish that degree and use
your skills in any way that you can
whether that's your writing an app
writing a phone app building a game
building a website helping out a
non-profit there's a ton of ways that
you can explore your CS skill set today
even while you're still in school and
there's incredible learning beyond just
computer science in a computer science
degree computer science teaches you how
to break pro
comes down and to solve them and to
think of alternate ways to solve
problems so computer science applies
much more than just writing code it
teaches you how to solve big problems
and discrete ways and that can apply to
you know economics to building a
business to growing a movement there are
so many problems in this world that need
to be dissected and looked at for new
and interesting solutions and computer
science really teaches you to think in
that way I think being a woman in the
field of engineering computer science or
science in general and you have to
understand that you won't be in the
majority at least not for now maybe
someday but that is an exciting and
challenging and I think more interesting
position to be in and I have to
understand that many of the people that
I work with don't think in the same way
that that I do in come from a different
perspective and it's really useful to be
able to think from somebody else's
perspective who doesn't have your same
life experience whether they're male or
female or single or married or American
or come from somebody else learning to
think from other people's perspective is
incredibly useful balancing family and
work and other aspects of my life and
the key component of that is having a
capable and willing partner my husband
and I trade-off duties on a real-time
basis we text each other about who's
picking up kids went and who's got
meetings and and the other key component
that is having a very flexible work
environment both my husband and I are
blessed to have very flexible work
environments to be able to come and go
when we need to as long as we get our
jobs done so on days that my husband has
meetings early i'm home with the kids to
get them off to school on days that i
have meetings late he's picking them up
and we are able to multitask by being
connected with technology now to make
that really easy and seamless so we can
you know run home to a school event and
then be you know checking email or doing
whatever type of communications we need
to with work when that event is over and
maybe we go home and work for the rest
of the day but you know having that
flexibility to interweave life and work
is super important and having a partner
to share it with makes it incredibly fun
way to live you don't have to start a
job these days and work straight through
for 30 years and people have the
flexibility and the option to move in
and out of different work situations as
they fit their lives at that time so I
worked full-time for Microsoft for seven
years until I had my second child at
which point I felt it was both best for
Microsoft and my family that I'd be home
for a few years and I took that
opportunity to actually do some
contracting and work some part-time work
and over that five years I got to spend
some great quality time with my young
children and then when my family felt
that it was the right time I was able to
step back into the workforce and
actually come back to Microsoft and do
it in a flexible way that really worked
for my family so I think it's really
important for people when they're
looking at their career to know that it
doesn't have to look the same over there
and tie
lifespan and it can have different
incarnations depending on what else is
going on in your life whether you want
to travel and you want to work abroad
whether you want to be home with family
or you need to take care of an aging
parent there's a lot of flexibility and
opportunities these days to move in and
out of the workforce as your life
demands as I look forward to the next
five or ten years in my career I'm I'm
really excited about being a part of the
evolution of Technology and the fact
that it enables me to keep learning and
as new things arise they inspire me to
explore new areas and new challenges
that I really haven't even thought of
yet today
