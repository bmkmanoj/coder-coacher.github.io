from my advisors advisor Lottie Louis
with someone I very much admired in the
early years of my life I was giving a
talk in some conference and in Bonn I
was a graduate students is two years
before my PhD I had the result that was
really really proud of and indeed was a
very difficult result and lotzie
very gently asked me on the corridor
after that what exactly is the
application that or what exactly is the
reason you're interested in this serum
and that made me start thinking of
having chooses problems in a way that
stayed with me as an early graduate
student and in particular in that
particular paper I did someone suggested
an open question it seemed like an open
question I would know how to solve and I
saw that the solution was tricky and
challenging and it was published in GCT
which is the leading journal of
combinatorial but lots he had a really
good point
it was not clear why you're interested
in this question and in fact I shouldn't
have been interested in this question
and it made me think for the first time
I'm thinking of how you choose the
questions that you you choose to work on
and how you spend your time on our
discussions of you have to choose
questions where you're you have
something to offer where your toolkit
and abilities have something to offer
and that will be appreciated and
rewarded and these were true for this to
this this this particular research area
I was missing the most ingredients item
it wasn't important for the future it
wasn't a really good question and as a
young graduate student I wasn't thinking
about this but it taught me to think
about it let's see this in a really
gentle and friendly kind of way and I
think that stayed with me it's an
important advice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
