you
next up we have Carnegie Mellon
University with it together well
creating shared knowledge hi I'm Jane
and this is Laraine and David we're from
Carnegie Mellon University and we're
here to share a concept called gather
well I like to introduce you to Laura so
Laura was admitted to the hospital for
pneumonia just a few days ago
unfortunately her experience there was
overwhelming she mainly worked with dr.
Lee but she also came in contact with a
number of other medical professionals
her husband Nathan tries to visit as
often as he can but he also has to take
care of their baby at their home on top
of managing communications with her
doctors and her family she also has a
ton of information given to her from
test results to home care instructions
so Laura is you know having to deal with
all this and it's a really overwhelming
ready but imagine if oh yeah so um yeah
she's not alone it's really not uncommon
to have this experience and in our early
research stages we came across one
patient who talked we talked with and
she had 18 different medical care
providers in just one hospital stay
another patient told us about how she
had a surgeon and a physical therapist
give her conflict information and she
left just not knowing what to do and
this is not an uncommon experience in
the midst of all this you can imagine
how much more difficult it might be if
Laura was deaf and she's not alone in
this in one study forty-one percent of
deaf patients left their health
appointment feeling confused about their
medical appointment and this is a really
critical moment when they leave because
if they are not understanding their
treatment their illness then it can
really lead to readmissions
unnecessarily and possibles want to
prevent readmissions because of
exponential costs so we wanted to learn
more about health
care and the field of communication in
order to do so we first interviewed 26
individuals from patients to nurses and
social workers academic researchers as
well as designers in the field of
healthcare we also conducted workshops
where such as role playing and card
sorting we observe nurses and social
workers in the hospitals and we also did
usability tests through experience
prototyping and rapid concept testing in
two senior living communities and a
medical centers Innovation Center so
this is a photo from one of the
experience prototyping sessions where we
had a participant pretend to be a deaf
patient interacting with a doctor and we
had real-time transcription happening
and here's a clip from that session you
have any questions about what an easy
litter is this really great seat on my
wall
my family doctor was telling me I might
have to go on a CA inhibitors but that's
all be sending never to explain it okay
so if you could explain a little further
that'd be great yeah so so what this
experience prototyping really taught us
as well as some of the other research is
that a lot of the interactions we want
are possible today but what we want to
do is think about how we can push this
idea further and think about the future
so we decided to sign an ecosystem of
multiple technologies that can really
create the seamless experience and now
Laraine will talk more about our key
interactions and insights so hello okay
after spending much time okay after
spending much time going through our
research meeting and interviewing with
these people we consolidated I research
into three key insights so one of them
is that discharge information is often
very cryptic and lengthy because it is a
process that involves many procedures
and conversations and discharge papers
that aim to consolidate all of this into
a single piece of paper or several pages
of paper may not ensure that the
patients are ready to leave the hospital
so in response to that gather well
summarizes and captures each
conversation that happens and with
tagging and visualization so that
instead of having to sift through pages
of paper you can easily extract key
information very quickly and secondly we
learn that medical interaction is a
group experience that involves many many
stakeholders and they have to be on the
same page so in response to that gather
all also offers remote virtual
conversation where stakeholders can join
medical conversations anytime regardless
of location and lastly we learn that
hearing disabilities create major
communication barriers communicating
medical information delivering them and
receiving them we when we were talking
to a deaf interviewing she revealed us
that deaf patient often times at
hospital they're very very reliant on in
hospital translators with very limited
in
dependence so in response to that gather
all offers real-time a live translation
and transcription of American sign
language so that they have to they can
be independent and dependent on human
assistance and also we service offers
both translation and transcription in
ASL and text american sign language
because it revealed us we through
research we learn that deaf community
the members of it sometimes may prefer
one or the other as ASL is considered a
separate language from english so here
is a video that demonstrates concept
so we're really excited about what this
combination of technologies can provide
it's not just a simple translation
service but a combination of multiple
technologies so for a conversation
between a patient and the doctor we're
using augmented reality glasses to give
that live translation for caregivers in
this case the husband can also join the
conversation through a remote access and
then also all all of the stakeholders
can be involved through the
transcription and the summary
capabilities so they can review those
conversations at a later time and we're
also it's also interesting because this
technology can also span across a
spectrum of other types of people not
just those in the deaf community for
example somebody who has temporarily
disabled like say somebody is waking up
for anesthesia they could use this
especially the transcription abilities
to review the conversations that happen
also somebody that may be situationally
disabled like somebody in a foreign
country could use this for the live
trace live translation capabilities as
well as the remote access because they
could invite their doctor at home to
join the conversation and then beyond
that just really any patient can use
this this technology to kind of bring
everyone to the table and be on the same
page on the patient's journey to
wellness thank
Thank You CMU who would like to start oh
great job guys also saw this on Monday
so it's come a long way and you've done
a great job answering some of the
questions and clarifying some of the
points that you've obviously done a
great deal of work on a big fan of the
you know sort of the transcribing
collecting and presenting back to
patients you know what is the course
recommended course of action the next
steps how to get to your next
appointment follow-ups all of the kind
of cryptic stuff that and and and even
just service that did that part alone
would be you know a huge step forward
for a lot of people because I'm sure
we're all disabled to some degree
cognitively by post illness just trying
to sort of remember what what the course
of actions are I I feel like this may be
a project that sort of suffers from like
one too many ideas a little bit and they
augmented reality translation layer
where the caregiver is essentially
there's a supe super imposition on her
doing an animation of the actual sign
language so she prefers sign language
than just the text in this scenario I
feel like what it was that probably will
happen at some point in the future
that's a i think a probably a fairly
distant moment and i'm not sure the sort
of lift is worth the benefit right now
and there's sort of some issues there
around what if she was gesturing in an
something important gesture Lee and how
would the sign language interpret that
that was not you know something that
didn't need to sort of take over or sort
of crush if you know what I mean so I
had some questions around that aspect of
it but overall I think it's a very very
commendable effort would have a wide
variety of potential beneficiaries so
congratulations I wish I could be a
little bit more helpful i mean i think
you know from the from the aesthetic
here is you know this is obviously very
useful
you know my I love the clean design I
mean it feels like a special purpose
sort of skype in design and so that's
really really attractive and and
seemingly very functional I mean I think
to your points you know there is
probably quite a bit of complexity in
there you wouldn't really know exactly
how well this works unless you were kind
of in the dynamic and so I'm kind of
lacking that perspective but you know
elegant from from your presentation so
congrats seems like a lot of hard work
yeah very nice um I didn't agree i think
with rob i mean i think it's really nice
but maybe you a bit overly complicated
and maybe taking like one part of that
would have been you know easier to both
express the idea in a short time but
also kind of easy to engage us your
audience i think in kind of really was
going on in that AR video i was like
completely confused um i think also but
you do have this a really great idea
here about you know the importance
nobody understands no one can remember
anything the doctor said as soon as i go
outside the door it's a well-known
phenomenon that it's completely like no
matter how much you know that's why they
say take a friend and take notes and you
both SAT there completely befuddled and
then leave and have no idea what they
said so you know there's that importance
of conveying that information there's a
you know the being both therefore not
actually being in a foreign country
being in your own country and speaking
of other languages is can be a huge
barrier if you have to wait around in
pain till someone comes who can explain
in a language you can understand what's
going on is terribly traumatic for
people so you know so I think that would
be brilliant so i think really focusing
on what's cool there is that really
actually and how do you explain stuff to
people and so that they can remember i
think that's really powerful and well
worth exploring more
we have time for one question from the
audience no questions okay so thank you
so much CMU each year microsoft research
