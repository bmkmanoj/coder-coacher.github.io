tool that we built that makes it
dramatically easier for all kinds of
people to take data and models and make
predictions about things that really
matter like food or fire here's a fire
model showing predictions for fire
frequency across the United States for
the next 20 years in general we know how
to make those kinds of predictions we
need to take data and models and combine
them together with Bayesian analysis to
make predictions but the technical
challenges involved in that pipeline are
so severe that it's difficult even for
the experts to do that stuff and most
people can't even get started with it at
all and so I'm just gonna open our
prototype everything runs in the browser
what I'm going to do is use this
application to build a model that
predicts the yield of wheat as a
function of the climate so I'm going to
import the file and we see that it has
latitude longitude and then the yield of
wheat we're going to make a chart so we
can see how the yield of wheat varies
across the world and now I'm going to
supplement that file with the climate
information that we need so I'm going to
use our fetch climate service which is
baked into the application and just that
quickly I could go and get the
temperature I didn't have to supply it
myself it was supplied by the tool I can
go and get precipitation as well and
immediately then we can have this table
with the yield of wheat the temperature
in the precip we can go and make a chart
which shows how the yield of wheat
depends on the temperature and precip so
the next step is to build a model of the
relationship between the yield of wheat
and the temperature and precip and fit
that model now the model predicts the
yield of wheat and I'm going to add a
dependency of the yield of wheat on air
temperature I'm going to also add a
dependency on precipitation and I don't
ever think I need now to go and fit that
model to the data which is what's
happening here with a fully
state-of-the-art Bayesian analysis MCMC
parameter estimation as we call it and
this is now estimated the parameters in
the model like for instance the optimum
air temperature of wheat and it's
telling us that the optimum air
temperature is about 12 degrees and
here's my predictions which I'm going to
again view on the map it's a very
flexible graphical system we can look at
all sorts of different aspects of the
data here
and this particular view shows the model
predictions then across the world
including the uncertainty so we could
put all of those various charts in there
and we can see whether our model looks
like the real world and it does seem to
have done quite well now if I want to
share this whole analysis with someone
else I just hit a single click up here
and I've just saved a file that I could
share with you you could open it and
retrace everything I've done modify
anything and extend off it to build ever
more sophisticated models so we're just
a few clicks of the mouse we've been
able to take that model and the
accompanying parameters and make it
available via the cloud in our fetch
climate to service you can see that here
we can go forward then and look at some
projected possible wheat yields under a
climate change scenario and those same
predictions are actually available on a
phone but I hope I've been able to show
you is that we can make it dramatically
easier for people to go from big data to
models to predictions about things that
really matter and that then gives us the
ability hopefully to make much better
decisions about how we look after the
planet on which we all ultimately depend
