you
hi I'm Catherine Lowe I'm from the UC
Irvine the department of informatics and
I study collective action towards common
goals or social good across and beyond
major social media sites and when I say
major social media sites I'm talking
about like Facebook and Twitter and in
part because I study read it a lot of
the time and a lot of people actually
dismissed reddit as not being like a
serious social media medium and so I
also work with intel on their diversity
and technology initiatives specifically
on games and I moderate a bunch of
subreddits and so the subreddit that's
kind of most relevant in the situation
is one called girl gamers it's a
subreddit where a bunch of women come to
talk about games and everything and in
fact actually I want to preface and say
if you don't know what reddit is it's an
entertainment social networking in news
website we're registered community
members can submit content like text
posts or direct links making it like an
online bulletin board system it
aggregates news and things like that and
this is what a the front page looks like
it's what your typical reddit experience
looks like and this is what girl gamers
the specific subreddit because right it
has its own sub-communities called
subreddits and so this started a few
years ago I started I think six years
ago in part because i went on reddit and
i said oh hey like are there any good
forums for women to talk about games and
they said how dare you like oh that's
that's disgusting like oh you think you
like you're doing verse segregation like
that's awful so of course I made an even
worse decision and made a subreddit for
girl gamers um and so um we it's kind of
relevant or girl gamers is kind of
relevant for harassment because women
are harassed online as we sort of seen
very clearly and especially in the game
space because of a phenomenon called
gamergate and what also makes being on
reddit having a community on reddit
a problem is because gamergate used read
it as a staging ground on a subreddit
called kotaku in action and so because
red is a very porous as a community it's
very easy to go from sub right to
subreddit we often faced sort of
brigades like so people would flood our
own separate it we'd we'd face thousands
and thousands of people coming to our
subreddit saying like Oh lots of awful
things sort of in line with what you've
seen the previous presentations and so
like how would we deal with this as
moderators like when gamergate happened
we would actually be we had a team of
moderators around the clock to sort of
there and available and then when
something happened we would actually
have to sort of call in the troops and
say like okay there's thousands of
people have Pope like people posting so
we have to have all of us there removing
posts and it actually was largely opaque
to the users the community members what
was going on and so reddit I think
because it wasn't necessarily a place of
productive critical scrutiny necessarily
for a while like people either would
write off right it is not being a
serious social media or they would sort
of say like oh well there's no hope for
it so you know maybe we don't even need
to put in these sort of moderating tools
for harassment because of that the
moderators of our subreddit we had to
come up with our own sort of ad hoc ways
of dealing with harassment so this is a
one strange one that we did in fact I
kind of want you to see it in its full
glory basically what happened here what
happened here is um wait oh yeah no but
um yeah what happened here is that if
somebody would link to a post on our
subreddit then everybody could go flood
and like say like dude horrible
harassing things like say a lot of awful
comments so one of our moderators coded
a system where it just made complete
nonsense and so everybody who would co
click on that link to go harass our
community would see this and there's
nothing they could do
um and oops so Oh is there a way for ya
so um oh wait though right here yeah um
does it go up yeah so this is actually
what it looks like it's actually
animated and very very difficult to use
and we've actually been commended by
other communities for having a great
system of deterring harasser zimbra
gators and this there's nothing like
this on reddit as a formal tool in fact
there are some ways we prefer that
because people haven't sort of gamed
ways to get around it yet that much oh
yeah so back to that um and so then
what's interesting though is that well
gay brigate was an awful thing and like
this really significant amount of
harassment was really terrible the
issues that ended up being most salient
to me we're actually these longer-term
problems which is fighting an accessible
and safe way for women to find people to
play video games with beyond their
immediate social circles so gay brigade
was sort of had moments of crisis and
affected us in very significant ways but
we found out our problem was here
because how can you find people to play
video games with without unwanted
attention without harassment in a way
that is scalable and didn't require
excessive labor from the moderators and
so this is a really difficult problem
when we tried a lot of different things
and so like you can see up here uh first
we have that you tried to separate
itself people would post I want a gaming
buddy and theoretically everybody would
reply to that post saying hey I want a
game with you it'll be great it turns
out that um because it's very easy to
make a reddit account you can make a
random account post and say hey I want a
game with you and then you can harass
that person and there's no way we can
find out about it and it's actually not
very public because you can private
message
so we thought okay let's go somewhere
else we had an IRC channel for girl
gamers and so it's like at least we're
all in the moment there but then we had
the obstacles of like well you always
have to have moderators like standing by
it's not necessarily very scalable like
text goes by very quickly we use a
Facebook page people didn't engage with
the page very well so we used to
Facebook group and what we did in that
case was we only allowed
self-identifying women to join the
facebook group because that was sort of
our easy solution and the problem with
that though was not only did it take
incredible labor from the moderators it
was also not trans inclusive like for
people who wanted to compartmentalize
and didn't want to link up their gaming
identities or their reddit identities
with their Facebook account they
couldn't join this group um then we had
a steam group steam is a gaming platform
whether you have on Lincoln you used for
gaming that was similarly hard to
regulate because it's very easy to make
an account and it's hard to account for
harassing private messages and all that
so finally we have a recent system which
is discord and it's like a slack channel
but with a voice chat and it's been
working all right we don't know if it's
scalable yet is very new and so it turns
out we didn't just abandon each one of
these we continued using every single
one of these systems and it's it's
really difficult to keep track of
involve there's a team of like five
moderators and it's very difficult to
get people to volunteer labor to
maintain these kinds of websites and
nobody's going to pay you to do this so
that's what we're doing right now and
that's sort of our ad hoc solution and
actually what's really unsatisfying is
that despite hundreds and hundreds of
women managing to find communities and
gaming partners like without harassment
through this system there are hundreds
more who ended up trying to use this
safely and then getting harassed getting
awful messages from people and it being
escapable to the point that it was very
traumatic for a lot of our community
members and so it it feels a little
helpless but at the same time we found
that our subreddit community had a lot
of value for people in the sense that
these are three posts that happened in
the past week somebody said I'm looking
for some support guidance IDK gentlemen
welcome advice and like you see like it
got voted up a bit and like there's a 56
comments of support there then somebody
said it's impossible to play
counter-strike as a girl like because
you get harassed it happens way too
often but if you mention it in the main
reddit community for counter-strike you
get downvoted and harassed a lot and
then there is a very very popular post
on women harassing each other in the
community and so it turns out that this
formalized space was really really
valuable for people and I think while we
often want to design sort of
all-encompassing tools that will prevent
harassment from happening in the first
place there's I think a lot of value in
formal spaces for venting social
emotional support and for sharing and
developing strategies to combat
harassment because harassment always
sort of evolves people find ways to sort
of game the systems as they exist and
they also find ways to harass people
across communities that aren't Facebook
and Twitter things that are reddit these
smaller communities like I don't know
even on slack on IRC and and I guess on
Steam and there there's so many
platforms and a lot of the heuristics
and solutions that we come up with don't
apply universally across all of these
different platforms and so this is a
great post that's a good example it's
somebody said do you stream and they
talked about um like I just tried
streaming on Twitch twitches a video
streaming service where you you play
games and you stream it out to an
audience and they said that they got
like harassed a lot and they're feeling
pretty discouraged and ask for tips
people flooded in and
have a ton of tips like very personal
and and this is what they said at the
end they said you guys have restored my
faith in humanity I'm definitely going
to try my head at streaming again with
your advice and they like went back to
streaming there is no support system on
twitch or like anything for a woman who
stream on Twitch who faced a lot of
harassment there's no place until a
couple of them go to sub the subreddit
and find it and it's a completely
different platform so we've managed to
have some successes but like i said
before like there are a lot of obstacles
and so part of it is the invisibility of
those who are harassed those who get
these private messages don't actually
talk about them or tell the moderators
about them so we have to like go digging
to find out about it and they were
wildly varying and occasionally mutually
exclusive or seemingly mutually
exclusive needs like tsunami versus
safety and so we actually see i
attempted to get feedback in this
community and so we had these very very
different experiences one is like oh
I've only had good experiences and then
somebody said a lot of creepy guys on
here which you know happens when you're
on reddit so what are the design
implications this is a little bit of
speculative and this is sort of what I
think of given my experiences with girl
gamers at participatory design I think
is really great in the sense that as
researchers and designers we don't
necessarily have a lot of time to delve
into these communities so we can trust
the community members and give them a
agency in the design process beyond just
interviewing them and also participating
in their communities enabling flexible
heuristics and ad-hoc solutions as you
could see we had a lot of ad hoc
solutions that ended up being really
really helpful and understanding that
it's an assemblage of systems often for
people to deal with online harassment in
addition to the all-encompassing
solutions that we use on major social
media and finally I think it's really
important to understand people's lives
across online spaces they don't simply
exist in these discrete paint spaces of
Twitter and Facebook they have lives
across all of them yeah and so then
we're going to have a breakout session
got session about design processes of
methods</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
