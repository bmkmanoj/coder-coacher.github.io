the midst of a revolution and it's a
revolution caused by the fact that we're
getting a huge deluge of data from all
sorts of things from satellite service
sensor networks supercomputers the Large
Hadron Collider switched on last year
and probably will switch on again the
summer we hope all right we'll deliver
petabytes on the right you see an image
from the worldwide telescope it's the
playa de superposed with the moon and
all these things visualization tools
data management tools data mining tools
later cleansing tools are becoming
really important for scientists to do
their work and what we need to do with
this huge amount of data that's coming
in is go from data to information to
knowledge and so semantics semantics
computing is going to be an important
enabler and computing is going to be
underpinning almost everything we do in
health care energy and educational and
social progress and what we're really
focused on our partnerships between
academia but also with industry like
ourselves and other partners like we
have a partnership with intel on
multi-core computing and with
governments and research funding
agencies around the world in the fields
of computer science education and the
scientific disciplines so
interoperability choice openness are
clearly key elements to engage with the
research community and what we hope we
can do is embody that in what we do what
we're trying to do is help scientists
spend more time on their research than
on the IT issues and with the data
volumes that are coming in now
scientists do require more of data
management and support for their data
analysis so we believe we can provide
that and I'll give you a couple of
examples so what we have to announce
today is to release as one is of project
Trident which is a scientific workflow
workbench and the other is dry add and
dry add link which is a tool for
distributing data and computation to
systems of a thousand clusters of a
thousand computers and doing it in a
higher level
easier to configure and the new jobs
those scientific workflow workbench was
in fact a sort of example that bill
talked about in 2005 and the idea is to
make it easier for scientists to ingest
and make sense of their data and to
enable them to ask questions of their
data in a way that would have previously
taken them a lot of effort and time to
organize and put together it's a
visually programming the workflows you
can annotate you can pass them around
you can create libraries it has
provenance capture supported
automatically it can automatically
schedule them on high-performance
computers it can store the data locally
or up in the cloud and install tolerance
so this is we believe a tool that
scientists will find extremely helpful
it's built on windows workflow and can
link to sequel server windows HP HBC or
data storage and computation in the
cloud the last example is is dry add
link and a dryad on high-performance
cook compute clusters for academic
research so if you have a job which has
lots of data which is many copies of the
same program but with different data or
dry and enables you to do is to
distribute that easily and and gives you
a higher level layer at which to do the
programming it implements that on
windows clusters we hope at some point
to move to as your but at the moment
what we're releasing is a windows
cluster solution and there's
installation guide programming examples
installer management tools and so on so
we think this is exciting and we hope
that you will find this useful for
supporting your research collaboration
and community is really what it's about
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
