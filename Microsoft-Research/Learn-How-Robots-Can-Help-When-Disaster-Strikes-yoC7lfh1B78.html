robots to help people well really
interested here is human robot
interaction with search and rescue how
do people use a robot that's really far
away from them and how do they get the
information about what that robot sees
and how do they understand what's around
that robot so the dream controller
project what stood out for us was the
amazing combination of other surface
computer together with robotics in a
rescue situation during Hurricane
Katrina we had an apartment complex that
otherwise would not have been searched
and so we were able to set the robots up
and run it through a building and search
that building in a way that wouldn't
have been able to then done otherwise
certainly rescuers now go into very
difficult situations but wouldn't be
much better than the robot in there
because if the robots destroyed well
it's just a robot it's not a person and
what the user does they walk up to the
microsoft surface and they place their
hand just very naturally down on the
surface our algorithm then goes through
and figures out each of their fingers
and then actually pizza joint stick up
underneath their hand and then just like
you control an Xbox controller you
controlling look on one hand and then
drive on the other hand and then so you
move the robot through the world just
like you would a character in a video
game what I really love about the
collaboration with Holly and Mark is
that they've done a very interesting
mashup of two of our most exciting
technologies the microsoft surface and
the microsoft robotics developer studio
and to use those together in this
compelling application domain of rescue
robotics and do some really compelling
natural user interface research that's a
great combination so by using the
surface with our robots we think that
people will be able to control robots
more effectively they'll get information
faster and let's be able to save lives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
