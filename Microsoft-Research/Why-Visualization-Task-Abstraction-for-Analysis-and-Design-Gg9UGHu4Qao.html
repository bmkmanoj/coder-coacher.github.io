you
it is my great pleasure to introduce
Matt primer he is finishing of his PhD
in the in focus group at the University
of British Columbia in Canada so Matt is
one of the very few students of tomorrow
mantener hoon Italian I jokingly call
the clean of infovis and matt has done
an impressive instead of work for the
design and evaluation of visualizing
systems and techniques in several
application domains such as data
journalism and energy conservation and
we were very lucky to have him as an
intern last summer and many of you
already chatted with him so without
further ado here is our speaker of the
day ok thank you ok so thank you for
having me uh it's good to see many of
you again I look forward to meeting
those of you I don't already know today
I'll tell you a bit about my research
the title might have changed and when
the abstract went out but I'll tell you
about a few of my projects today so as
an outline for my talk I'll begin by
telling you a bit about myself in my
background I'll talk about the breadth
of my visualization projects that I
worked on I'll follow up with some depth
in which I'll discuss some of the
projects I work done in their
contributions in detail and I'll finish
with some future research goals and
interests and why I think MSR is the
place to conduct this visualization
research so by now some of you might
have read my brief bio but in any case
now I get to elaborate on Who I am my
background and some of the experience
that I bring so I self-identify as a
visualization design and user experience
researcher a role in which I aim to
understand why and how people are using
visualization tools and techniques and
better ways to design these and improve
these experiences so I'll begin I
telling you a bit about my academic
background I would describe as being
multidisciplinary I started with an
undergraduate degree in cognitive
science from Queens University in
Kingston Ontario Canada and this is
where I initially became interested in
human-computer interaction research I
also got my start here as an
undergraduate research assistant in this
case it was in a lab that investigated
the potential
of exercise video games or active games
i looked at the interactions between
exercise intensity and the ability to
perform fun yet challenging cognitive
tasks the same time similar to those
you'd find in non active video games
also during this period developed a
software tool kit to allow people with
different input peripherals like
different models of exercise bicycles or
different models of heart rate monitors
to play games together play the same
active game and this isn't a future play
paper back in 2010 I'm not going to
speak about this work today but just the
reason that I bring it up is just to
illustrate some of the breadth of my
experience and familiarity with
different areas of HCI research so prior
to turning my attention to visualization
my Master's work it was in
human-computer interaction and it was
also done in the University British
Columbia this was some experimental work
this is on task switching and
interruptions and their impact on older
adults and younger adults performance on
computer-based tasks of varying
cognitive demand and this is work that I
done with my advisor at the time Joanna
magrunner II as well as Claudia yakowa
from the UBC Faculty of Medicine so like
my undergrad research I'm not going to
speak about this work today but if
you're curious you can definitely talk
to me about this offline or we have a
Kai 2012 paper about this ok so my PhD
as function mentioned focused and
information visualization my
dissertation shares the same title as
this talk so why visualization tasks
abstraction for analysis and design it's
currently being reviewed by my
examination committee I'll be defending
it at some point late march or early
april but you can read it now if you
want at this URL so it documents for
visualization research projects that
i've been working on over the past five
years along with my advisor tomorrow
monster and over this time i've also
benefited from the contributions and
perspectives of my committee members
joanna magrunner ii from human computer
interaction and also ron r n sync from
psychology focuses and vision science
research so want to emphasize that all
my degrees were affiliated with computer
science or computing departments but
also during this time i had the
flexibility with these cognitive science
and HCI programs to take courses that
side of this field and do courses in
psychology and seen perception
psychology of reading a few other
interesting courses in visual display
design as well as courses and linguistic
statistics research methods
so I've also spent some time working in
industry and an industry research here
so has function already mentioned I was
an intern here last summer working with
function Natalie and a postdoc Benjamin
Bach I worked on a design space and
prototype tool for interactive
storytelling with timelines actually
you're seeing work here on these slides
already had produced these timelines
that you see on these slides using this
environment we currently have a journal
paper about this work in preparation
I'll speak more about this project later
in the talk when I go deep into this
project and I also spend some time
talking about ideas and where I want to
take this work next so in 2013 before
this I was awarded the graduate research
internship award from my tax which is a
Canadian research funding agency and
this was to collaborate with a company
called pulse energy anna software
company based out of Vancouver who sends
in the meantime been acquired by the
American company enter knock and for
several months i embedded myself at this
company working alongside some of their
client services team their software
developers and even some of their
clients across North America and the UK
to design a visualization tool for
organizational energy analysis and
management so I presented this work at I
Triple E infovis conference last fall
and you'll hear more about this as I go
into this project in detail in this talk
as well so finally before I start a grad
school I spent 16 months interning with
emc this is where I did a mix of user
experience research user interface
design front-end development and this is
on a content management application this
was intended for use in the automotive
industry this is my first real
opportunity to apply what I learned in
my undergrad hsci curriculum to a real
product and because of the length of
this internship I was able to see the
product that I worked on deployed to
clients during this time which is really
cool so in the last part of this
autobiographical section of this talk I
just want to summarize the reasons why I
came to be a visualization researcher
why I was attracted to this area well
first I was initially attracted this
research because at the end of my
undergrad program this was combining the
topics that I found most interesting in
my cognitive science curriculum visual
perception HCI data mining and while
these topics drew me in what hooked me
was the opportunity to develop and
improve upon methods so I believed five
years ago and I still do
that visualization design and evaluation
requires proposed it presents some
unique challenges and requires some
unique solutions and creative solutions
so finally I'm a visualization
researcher because well visualization
itself it's a young field and still
maturing and growing and this especially
over the past decade and especially
since i started my graduate program the
visualization practitioner community has
grown considerably which includes those
working in data journalism and
storytelling those working in the
business intelligence domain those using
visualization tools and techniques for
discovery in various scientific domains
so all this points to growing literacy
and demand for visualization techniques
tools and artifacts and it's possible
through visualization research to
support this growth and in fact a large
and diverse population of adopters so
now they know me a little bit better I
want to give just an overview of the
breadth of some of the research that
I've done before I go deep into a couple
of these projects so I thought I'd
briefly preface this summary with an
argument for well why do we need
visualization research so visualization
my perspective it's not a singular thing
it's not a noun it's and I feel that
this quote from visualization
practitioner and artist jer thorp it
captures this mentality that that by
thinking about visualization is a
process instead of an outcome we arm
ourselves with an incredibly powerful
thinking tool so for many people
visualization may be synonymous with the
artifact with an image a chart or an
interactive graphic or a particular tool
to me visualization is this process that
can be studied and broken down to
components and these components include
understanding the data that's to be
visualized understanding the tasks of
the people who will be using the
visualization tool artifact or technique
as well as the surrounding context in
which these techniques take place use
tastic please and given this combination
of data and tasks selecting and
assessing appropriate visual encoding
and interaction design choices so
visualization research exists because
the parts of this process are seldom
straightforward especially when we're
confronted with complex tasks and
complex data so while the emphasis in my
dissertation as we saw on the title is
certainly on understanding the tasks
that people use visualization for my
research certainly touches on all parts
of this process so over the past five
years I've also had the opportunity
be involved in various forms of
visualization research at least
according to the types of papers that
appear regularly in visualization
research venues so I'm perhaps most
well-known within the visualization
research community for a framework for
visualization task analysis so this is a
framework that I used to guide the
design and evaluation aspects of my
other dissertation projects and I'll
discuss this as one of my selected
projects in a few moments in detail my
work that did here in collaboration with
MSR which pertains to interactive
storytelling with timelines that in my
view constitutes a more technique driven
research exploring a design space of a
certain technique I have two projects
that would constitute problem driven or
design studies is called in the
visualization community work I want to
which we design for a specific
application domain and problem so ones
in the journalism domain and another in
energy management and I'll speak about
the energy management project in detail
and finally it also had an opportunity
to collaborate on a system development
project which we built an authoring tool
called timeline curator for extracting
and presenting timelines from
unstructured text which was at passed
last year so another theme that cross
cuts all of my visualization research
pertains to methodology and in
particular qualitative evaluation
methods so what I was especially
interested in at the outset of my PhD
and continue to be now is how we
evaluate visualization out in the wild
setting people using visualization
techniques and tools in non laboratory
real-world contexts so as a result most
of a most my work pertains to and can
includes qualitative evaluation is very
central and a lot of my work so two of
my dissertation projects including the
energy management design study that
you'll hear about it involves formative
or pre design evaluation the focus of
these evaluations is understanding why
and how current work flows or processes
are performed so as to inform future
visualization design so this includes
examining what are the current domain
conventions that are happening what are
the problems and constraints and
workarounds that our people are doing
get their jobs done when the tools fail
and often this involves interviews
analyzing the artifacts that people are
using and task analysis so along with
Sheila carbondale and Melanie Torre
function and I actually wrote a paper
about these methods at believe a couple
years ago so I'm also very much
interested in studying the adoption of
visualization techniques and tools so
once something is deployed or
disseminated I want to know who the
early adopters are and whether they're
using the tool or technique for the same
reason that was envisioned by its
designers or where that was appropriated
for some other purpose so evaluating
visualization adoption and appropriation
it's exceedingly rare in the
visualization research literature there
was a 2012 survey by Heidi lamb and
colleagues about visualization
evaluation they surveyed something like
over 800 papers and only five of those
they found it commented at all on
whether the tool or technique was
adopted by its intended user base so
with respect to my own research we have
a paper from 2014 that documents the
adoption of a deployed document
visualization collection tool and this
was done by five self-initiated
investigative journalists we didn't ask
them to adopt a tool they took it up of
their own volition just about hearing
about it and none of them had
contributed to the preceding phases of
design and to understand these cases of
adoption I relied upon interviews that
boat that involved both retrospective
recall of their analysis process and
reenactment of their investigative
process asking them to walk me through
their process I would take screen
capture recordings analyze their
interaction logs from their use of the
system perform a task analysis of to
compare these case studies against each
other but also to our preconceived
notions of what the task we thought the
tool is support in this case we
ultimately found that some of the
journalists were using the tool for a
task that we do not initially foresee
and subsequent deployments of this tool
includes an explicit support for this
initially unforeseen task so altogether
here the challenges of evaluating
visualization techniques and the tools
it provided me with an opportunity to
develop my qualitative research skills
prior to this I've been doing mostly
quantitative work in my masters in my
undergrad research so this involve
taking research methods courses and
learning about different theoretical
perspectives and methodologies from the
sociology anthropology and educational
psychology traditions so now I've told
you about how my work across cuts
different types of papers in the visit
community as well as how evaluation
plays a large role in my work this
diagram presents another perspective
it's how I illustrate my expertise
and which pertains to task analysis or
visualization I've applied my approach
to task analysis in both visualization
design and evaluation focused projects
spanning different data types as well as
projects spanning different discovery
and presentation like tasks you'll hear
about some of these today so I don't
have time to speak about all these
projects in detail but of course if you
want to speak one-on-one with me
afterward go into all these projects in
much more detail but I'll speak about
these first three on the list yeah i'll
point it into detail about our task
typology first and then follow with our
energy management design study work and
then finally i'll finish off with a
timeline project that I was working on
here last summer and continue to be now
ok so our 2013 infovis paper it's called
a multi-level typology of abstract
visualization tasks so this is a
framework paper that proposes a way to
classify visualization tasks in a data
type or domain agnostic or abstract way
this is the first paper published out of
my PhD work and it served as a framework
for guiding my other projects the design
and evaluation components and if some of
the material helpers in the next few
slides seems a little bit familiar it's
because this task typology was also
later used in my advisor to Mar monsters
2014 book visualization analysis and
design which you spoke about here i
believe around the same time last year
anyway so why do we need a typology of
abstract visualization task why do we
need to classify abstract visualization
tasks so my answer is that the space of
possible visualization design choices
it's very very large and while some
visualization design choices may be
straightforward for instances where we
have simple data or simple
straightforward tasks it's often the
case that we are dealing with complex
death tasks complex sequences of tasks
and complex data so imagine that every
one of these points in this diagram
represents a design choice there might
be a particular visual encoding
technique it might be an interaction
technique there might be some
combination of visual encodings or
interactions so an abstract
understanding of tasks allows us to
operationalize this visualization design
process and navigate
this design space more effectively for
any combination of data and tasks there
may be a few good design choices there
may be some suboptimal alternatives that
might work in some circumstances but not
others and there's certainly many poor
choices that are incompatible with
either the data of the task or both so
if I can only speak about tasks in the
context of a single domain so say for
instance in energy management I'm
speaking about energy consumption data I
might be missing out on viable design
choices initially intended to address
similar tasks or data types from another
domain say for instance financial
portfolios for instance so both of these
domains likely involve the abstract task
of identifying extreme values or
outliers in quantitative time series
data so I should be considering
techniques to address this task
irrespective of what domain they were
initially proposed in so what we set up
to do in this project was to introduce a
vocabulary for describing tasks
abstractly to promote this
cross-pollination of visualization
design choices across these domains and
enable communication between
visualization practitioners designers
and people in these domains my personal
motivation for doing this project was
that I was just in need of an analysis
framework to make sense of the data that
had been collecting in these very
specific domains relating to why and how
people were using visualization tools or
techniques and I wanted to communicate
these findings back to the visualization
research community in such a way that
they would generalize to other
application domains other than the ones
that haven't we studying so another
motivation for this work is that there
was a need for consensus there's an
abundance of related work in this area
of just characterizing tasks goals
processes activities interactions these
are in the visualization literature the
HCI literature visual analytics
cartography but they tend to vary in a
number of ways the first is that these
prior classifications of tasks and all
these things they vary in terms of the
level of abstraction so some of these
are very specific at low level interface
events like clicking pointing dragging
while others are quite high level sense
making information foraging integration
of insights and meanwhile there's
another way to look at this space so
that some of these prior classifications
of tasks they're very domain-specific or
their specific to certain data
types like test economies pertaining to
graph visualization or tree
visualization and many of these prior
classifications are a temporal they're
just a list of tasks some of them impose
a hierarchical task decomposition others
more of a sequential form of thinking so
in this project what we try to do is the
attempted to unify dozens of prior
classification frameworks and their
theoretical foundations to connect the
low level with the high level to develop
this common lexicon or vocabulary for
describing visualization tasks and task
sequences so that researchers and
practitioners could use that to
communicate so our typology of
visualization tasks it's organized it's
organized around three questions and the
first of these questions is well why do
people visualize data so ultimately
people visualize data in order to
consume or produce information related
to a domain specific goal or interest
with regards to consuming information a
person may have the goal of discovering
phenomena within their data which may be
part of an audience to which some
phenomena is being presented to or she
may be indulging a casual interest in
data with no other preconceived
objective aside from enjoyment with
regards to producing information so one
emphasize that visualizing data it's an
it's an interpretive act many
visualization tools and techniques can
and should provide the means to produce
these interpretations of the data may be
in the form of annotations on the
visualization jewel encoding or recorded
stories or workflows in other cases the
goal might be to explicitly derive new
data or interpret a based on these
interpretations like deriving ordinal
ranks from quantitative values or
driving a set of synthetic dimensions
from the use of dimensionality reduction
techniques so in addition to this
distinction between consume and produce
we distinguish the ways between how
people search for visualized elements as
well as how people query the data
individual in a visualization artifact
and this allows us to specify why people
visualize data at multiple levels a
person may locate and identify a
visualized element as part of a
discovery task or presenter may ask
their audience to compare multiple items
so our approach also involves
characterizing how a task is supported
by a visual encoding interaction or a
view coordination technique these may be
specific techniques or they may we can
use abstract terms here as well to
describe things like filtering
navigating selecting or arranging items
and finally our approach involves
describing the input and output of a
task and I'll together this why what how
structure it allows us to chain these
past descriptions together into
sequences of interdependent tasks where
the output of one task serves as the
input to a subsequent task so it's all
seems very of jacket me to get an
example now from one of our other papers
here this is Anna present an example of
a task sequence from our typology but
it's based on a task sequence that we
presented in our 2014 belief paper where
we interviewed people who visualize
dimensionally reduce data so in this one
case a person who had high dimensional
data used a dimensionality reduction
technique to derive a two-dimensional
projection of their data and this serve
as the input to a subsequent discovery
task in which the person explored and
identified clusters in his data and he
visually encoded this as an interactive
scatterplot that he could navigate and
select data points and finally he
recorded his interpretation of these
clusters and categories in his data by
annotating selected sets of data points
with categorical labels which were then
encoded as color on the points so I've
used this task typology throughout the
other projects in my dissertation and
I've used it to describe the use of
existing visualization techniques and
tools out in the wild to evaluate a
novel visualization tool and to inform
some visualization design choices and
I'm going to speak about that in the
next project next section of my talk so
our psychology has also been very well
received and adopted by the
visualization research community so at
last check it's been sighted over for 65
x coordinate go cool scholar making it
one of the most cited papers from info
visit when T 13 onwards and I took a
look at all the papers that cite it and
what people are doing with it which is
pretty interesting this typology has
informed the novel data type task text
on amis that people have used this
vocabulary describe what people do with
no dling
rafts or cardiograms as well as domain
specific task text on me is using this
vocabulary now to describe things that
are happening in bioinformatics or
malware analysis and now we have a
common vocabulary which to use that so
if people have also use it to
communicate the procedures of
experimental studies and finally it's
been used to contextualise the
capabilities of some novel visualization
tools and techniques just what are these
tools for well how they might generalize
across different domains so after
developing this task typology in 2013 my
next goal was to apply it in a design
project where I would choose the visual
encoding interaction and view
coordination techniques to address tasks
related to a concrete domain problem and
this is what I worked on for the better
part of the next year or so in the
domain of energy management so the first
step in this project it was for me to
understand the problems that people were
facing in this domain which well with
the following given a portfolio of
buildings for example you have a
university campus you have a hotel or
restaurant chain or a city's municipal
buildings the energy manager or analysts
person they have to do several things
they have to determine which buildings
in their portfolio require energy
conservation measures like installing
new windows or lighting or insulation in
these buildings and then they have to
assess the performance of these
buildings in that portfolio of following
the implementation of an energy
conservation measure and then they have
to find and diagnose anomalous things
that are happening in their data like
spikes or other forms of erratic or
inconsistent behavior in these energy
portfolios so these very concrete domain
goals they were identified as part of
this work domain analysis that I had
done or I learned the vocabulary of this
domain I interviewed the stakeholders
involved which included not only our
collaborators at the software company
but also their clients who are located
at organizations across North America
including a few large universities and
our collaborators had an existing and
energy management software tool that
they had already deployed and that some
of these clients were already using so I
was trying to understand why how and
when this tool was being used and what's
sure
Cummings were when it broke down and why
when people would do their own ad hoc
analysis so our climate is existing tool
it was fairly limited it relied upon
groups bar charts and superimposed line
charts like these here for understanding
comparing patterns and energy
consumption and demand amongst an
organization's many buildings so as you
see in this simple diagram the choices
choices were okay but they didn't scale
very well if you wanted to compare more
than a handful of buildings these group
bar charts and line charts maybe I had a
small handful but certainly less than
ten before it gets unable difficult to
tell one from another our collaborators
wanted to address cases where you had
dozens or hundreds of buildings in other
in other words these choices they were
okay for some selective sets of drilling
down into a small subset of buildings in
the portfolio but certainly not for
large overview cases and it was also
very difficult to navigate between
visualizations in this tool which is the
problem so based on the domain problems
that we identified and in further
consultation with our collaborators and
their clients and by looking at their
existing tool I then applied this task
typology of ours to identify what
abstractly these tasks were and what
sequences might they occur so first I
realize that the energy analysts need to
discover some course phenomenon their
time series data which an analyst has to
be able to look up a portfolio or a
group of buildings and summarize
aggregate energy performance over a long
period of time so next the analysts
should be able to drill down to discover
some fine grained phenomena typically in
a smaller subset of buildings and over a
shorter span of time be able to locate
and compare phenomena between buildings
as well as within buildings comparing
one building one year to the same
building the st. next year or the next
week to see what had changed and finally
the analyst should be able to identify
the contribution of energy consumption
of one item relative to its parent so
charge from a single building to its
group or from a group to the entire
portfolio and as you note there's
typically these are done in a some
sequence or another sometimes
starts with drill down sometimes it
starts with the overview and we notice
that some people need to do be flexible
to move between these tasks so given the
type of data that our collaborators had
along with a set of tasks that they want
to perform so I then was able to expand
this design space by considering
possible visual encoding interaction and
view coordination design choices that
were appropriate for summarizing
comparing and identifying phenomena in
multiple concurrent time series data
irrespective of what domains these tools
and techniques were originally applied
in so some of these choices they were
discarded as they either they didn't
scale to the portfolio sizes that we
were considering or they violated some
convention in the energy domain which is
another interesting topic I'll return to
at the end of this talk with some ideas
for future work or they were a mismatch
for the task that we were trying to
address so to test out these alternative
design choices my design space
exploration involve the development of
what I call data sketches so are
minimally Viable yet functional
interactive prototypes containing real
and representative data in this case
taking real data from client building
portfolios and working with it so I
developed a sandbox environment for
rapidly testing out visual encoding
design choices and view coordination
design choices so at first glance it
might seem that what you're seeing here
this is the sandbox environment that I
built it might seem like it's a high
fidelity prototype of a tool that the
energy managers will eventually use this
is not the case this is an interactive
environment for me to use as a designer
to test out different ideas this data
sketch and sandbox prototyping approach
it involves foregoing some traditional
HDI prototyping approaches like paper
prototyping it discourages the use of
things like toy data or template data
the goal of this approach is about
encoding and interacting with real and
representative data as soon as possible
in the design process so this is one of
the first things that you do in this
project so I use this sandbox
environment to conduct to chauffeured
demos with collaborators and
stakeholders to better understand task
sequences and by a chauffeured demo I
mean piloting my sandbox environment in
response to enduring interviews with
these people asking them what they what
do they want to see and where do they
want to go next from this view of
data and this was a means to gather
feedback on these different visual
encoding interaction and view
coordination design choices and I would
do I was a record these show for demos
with screen capture and I would
transcribe what they would say you know
this would help me not only to identify
what visual encodings interactions were
appropriate but also how to coordinate
these multiple visual encodings or
interactions within an interface like
such as how you would just oppose
multiple visual encodings in a single
display or you would sequence them in a
series of displays for drill-down cases
and this is reflected in this one a
flowchart example with some commentary
that I've sanitized hear from our
collaborators so ultimately through this
process of iterating on visualizations
sandbox visual encoding design and show
for demos with a series of claw of our
collaborators and their clients some of
them who weren't persija participating
in preceding phases of design they
joined later to get new perspectives I
ultimately identified a small set of
matches between visual encoding
interaction and view coordination design
choices and the tasks that we were
addressing so the value of our research
was in documenting these trade-offs
between about a dozen different
alternative design choices and why our
final solution was as effective so
here's the series of screenshots from
our collaborators then adopted a number
of our visualization design choices and
implemented them into the production
version of their tool starting with the
left we have a series of coordinated
summary box plots and a matrix based
encoding for multiple buildings that you
can scroll and see high-level trends
over course periods of time I'll speak
up with this design later in the talk as
well about some ideas for future work
here and then being able to drill down
to then look at small multiple or
faceted bar and line charts for this
drill down task looking at a smaller
subset of buildings in the portfolio
over short periods of time and finally
on the the right we have stacked bar and
area charts for this roll-up task which
allows the person to identify
contributions from one building to its a
parent group or from a group to the
entire portfolio of energy consumption
over time and as well the ability to
directly transition from one task to
another quickly because the preceding
tool that clatters had was
be difficult to navigate between one
visual encoding to another so our paper
about this is it's beneficial to the
visualization committee not only because
it presents evidence for why these
design choices work for these tasks but
because we describe the data and tasks
abstractly these design choices my very
well generalize to other domains
involving the comparison a multiple time
series data rub sense it's like what a
really high level task for these folks
are would it be something like
troubleshooting would it be something
like long-term planning is Sydney both
so sometimes they're trying to figure
out was there an anomaly and a building
so was there a spike was her an outage
and what caused it that might be one
case that's when you would look at the
this drill down case to go into a
shorter period of time and a maybe a
smaller set of buildings to look at
these anomalies but at the higher level
it could be about planning so it could
be a boat I just implemented an energy
conservation measure I just installed
new windows in this building honesty
over a long period of time did this have
any effect did my energy consumption go
down yeah so our paper actually goes
into a lot more detail about our
methodology the impact of domain
convention and the topic of familiarity
with or literacy with different visual
encodings so some of these especially
the one on the left here which I'll
return to a bit later they never seen
this visual encoding before and this
topic that I'm very much interested in
and I want to I'll continue this
discussion later so the last project
that I want to speak about in detail
today it's not one that appears in my
dissertation but it's one that was
largely done here at MSR as an
internship project last year and its
continuing now so my motivation for
doing this project was that in my
preceding projects including the energy
management design study they were all
about discovery tasks analysis tasks
this one was an opportunity to turn my
attention to another another kind of
task this was about presentation and
storytelling and that while both the
energy management design study and this
project involves time-oriented data the
former involved quantitative time series
data very large quantity of time series
data while this project involved smaller
curated data sets of interval event
timeline data
data you might associate with
biographies or historical summaries in
addition I was excited by the prospect
here that techniques that I could
develop in this space might be a
interest and could be adopted eventually
by journalists especially because we see
a lot of timeline stories appearing in
news media especially when bringing
someone up to speed on a current event
so I like to motivate this project is by
showing this classic 1765 information
graphic drawn by Joseph Priestley and
what he's done here he's visually
encoded the live spans of several dozen
notable statesmen and men of learning
and he sent this along the x-axis just
indicating when they lived and he's
offset them in the Y direction to just
to avoid occlusion so that you can write
their labels and you can see when people
lived and when people were alive at the
same time so this form of visual
encoding for timelines it's become the
dominant way that people present
timeline data for the past two and a
half centuries but it's certainly not
the only way to show this form of data
so in this project we surveyed about
over 250 instances of tools techniques
or artifacts that visually encode
timeline data so beginning with this
leftmost column some of these were
handcrafted information graphics that
appeared centuries ago and others more
recent information graphics that you
find online or in new sites and these
ten be done using illustration software
is opposed being hand-drawn although
there's some interactive examples of
timeline infographic CC online we also
looked at interactive timeline
visualization tools intended for
discovery tasks there's a lot quite a
few of these including some work done
here third one that a lot of this this
work has been done in the domain of
electronic health records and they're
typically with larger data sets you're
trying to find patterns in so not for
presentation tasks so much but more for
discovery and analysis and finally the
last couple columns there we encountered
a
set of interactive timeline
visualization authoring tools this is
again for presentation there's a we
found about a dozen of these and some of
them are quite popular there's one
called timeline j/s this is one of the
top actually the one on the bottom here
timely and these are tools that are
especially popular amongst journalists
they just allow a person to upload a
spreadsheet of dates and descriptions
for these events and the tool output a
basic interactive timeline that the
viewer can page through or select an
event but they all kind of look the same
when we considered this corpus of
timelines as a whole make sure found
there's quite a bit of variety a very
rich variety of highly expressive and
aesthetically pleasing design choices
amongst the historical timeline
information graphics as well as the
modern information graphics but none of
these in coatings including circular
spiral or even arbitrary shape timelines
this is by mark twain actually these
representations of time none of them had
made their way into modern intra
interactive visualization storytelling
tools and we were wondering why do they
all assume this chronological form of
Priestley's timeline they all look like
this so we wondered why is this why it
when is a linear chronological visual
encoding appropriate and when are other
timeline encodings the right choice and
what if you have a story that isn't well
suited by one particular type of visual
encoding for timelines what do you have
more points to make that don't suit that
mold so based on this extensive survey
that we did we developed and proposed
this design space for timelines and
there's three dimensions of this design
space the first of which along the top
is the representation or the shape of
the timeline from linear grid arbitrary
spiral grids might be a calendar
timeline the second dimension scale it
corresponds to how events are mapped to
positions along the timeline and finally
its layout whether the timeline is just
a single timeline whether there are
multiple timelines side by side that
you're meant to compare between or
whether a timeline is segmented at
meaningful boundaries like days or years
sometimes you might want to separate one
timeline for
one year and look at the time like the
next year with segments shown separately
but if you do the math here there's 100
possible combinations of representations
scale and layout this doesn't mean that
they're 100 viable timeline designs when
we looked at our survey data we only had
existence proofs for a subset of these
combinations somewhere between 20 and 30
combinations here and even among the
subset there were designs that asked the
viewer to make some very difficult
perceptual judgments that we deemed to
be pretty ineffective for making good
judgments so the way to constrain this
large design space was actually to
enumerate the tasks that mapped these
combinations of representations scale
and layout so we ultimately were able to
identify 20 viable combinations of
representation scale and layo that
mapped to meaningful tasks that the
viewer is supposed to perform or
possible story points that map for those
tasks so these are just three examples
they're 17 more that we described in our
our paper of examples of story points
that vary either in terms of
representation scale or layout so for
instance on the Left we have a single
linear chronological timeline this might
be effective if the task of the audience
is to identify the chronology or
duration of events in the middle a
radial chronological timeline that's
segmented at meaningful temporal
cyclical boundaries like days or years
cycles this might be effective if your
audience is intended to compare the
periodicity of events across these
segments so naturally occurring weather
events is one example here like
comparing the periodicity of tornadoes
or hurricanes over multiple years or
days and then on the left we have
example multiple linear time lines with
a sequential scale and sequential scale
we remove all the chronology or duration
of that we just keep the sequence of
events in their order this might be
effective for comparing the number of
events that appear in these timelines so
to then verify that these 20 meaningful
combinations of representations scale
and layout actually work I built an
environment that allowed me to test all
of them I built this interactive sandbox
environment though that may test these
combinations and I loaded it with 28
representative timeline data sets and
many of these data sets were actually
based on or inspired by existing
timeline infographics that we'd found in
our survey so here's a gallery of
timelines that we generated with this
sandbox environment with one timeline
presented as an example for each of our
recommended or meaningful combinations
of representation scale or layout
there's 20 of them it actually continues
down and we also present here you'll see
some commentary about what the narrative
point or what the task with the the
audience the viewer is expected to
perform with these examples of these
timelines when the next question here is
well what if you have a to tell a story
that asks the viewer to perform more
than one type of one of these tasks or
if you want to exclude parts of your
timeline to focus on a specific interval
in your data a subset of the events you
wanted to highlight things so one option
would be to present a static slideshow
of static timeline images but that has a
limitation that your context isn't
maintained from one story point to the
next you can't allow the viewer to
interact with your timeline data and
explore some of the events so for this
reason we explore the possibilities for
animated transitions between points in
this design space for changes of
representation scale and layout so
here's an example of a representation
transition from linear to radial so
representation transitions a
representation of radial timelines here
they have the aesthetic advantage of a
square aspect ratio but their drawback
is that you're making arc length
comparisons as opposed to comparisons of
length along a rectilinear axis so
there's strengths and drawbacks all of
these combinations I feel curious what
the timeline data being shown here is
actually just my biographical data
colored according to categories like
academic professional and athletic
achievements some of it you already saw
so here's an example of a scale
transition this is another type of
transition that just changes in this
case from a chronological scale to a log
time scale the data shown here is the
life spans of notable philosophers
spending thousands of years and they're
colored by world region so we have all
the Greeks over here and all the German
in purple at the end and when you shift
to a log scale here I could it be
emphasizing more of the recent people on
this timeline data set finally this is
an example of a layout transition from a
single timeline to multiple timelines
which we have events from each category
of events and these correspond to the
colors here that their move to their own
dedicated timeline the data shown here
is the set of Mary is because there's
somehow or representative of the kinds
of timelines that actually system yes
why did you pick this so this that this
data set was in a timeline infographic
that I saw recently and similarly the
Philosopher's data set was countered one
in my survey and also it was similar
enough to the Joseph Priestley example
in that before of biographical timelines
of man who lived when they're fairly
common those type of biographical who
live wind up timelines this is the set
of armed conflicts that America has
engaged in since independence colored by
world region and the data gets split
into multiple timelines where each world
region gets its own little time line so
the culmination of this work yeah we're
tracking a mccain hottest one state to
the next so you can see when some event
moved to another form of representation
or scale of timeline worse this is true
we have nested yet we like it's the next
step of this is if I ask talking to
users and I'll speak about where I want
to think this work necks and that
includes actually showing these to
people and getting a feedback on them I
mean how do you really toward that like
every hair and George to on yeah 11
polyarchy started yeah and we actually
refer to this work for constraining the
space of anime transitions because we
don't want to do any transition from one
state to another we actually constrain
it to just these types only altering one
dimension at a time so they're less
jarring so just changing representation
are just changing scale and if you
combine that with selective highlighting
when you can dim out some of the events
and you're in your timeline you can
actually follow just a small set of
these events if you
emphasized them so that's one additional
storytelling thing that you need another
ingredient that you need to add to this
to make it work and that's what we did
here that's what you're seeing in this
little timeline story it was a
culmination of all of this putting the
dimensions of our design space together
the 20 recommended meaningful designs
and over these two dozen real datasets
here's an example of selective
highlighting so if you're just going to
selectively highlight a few of them
they're easier to track we can't really
track that many objects when they're in
transition so in order to actually tell
a story we added some you see some
captions along the top we have selective
highlighting and filtering categorical
legends of course are helpful for
determining which is which by the way
the data of this date this data set is
the daily creative routines of creative
highly creative beetle people like we
had Dickens and Darwin this again is
based on an existing timeline
infographic that I've seen several of
these have had presented this in static
form but and one of them I encountered
was in these radial chronological
diagrams another one was in a linear
format as well and they have their own
advantages they afford different tasks
we actually presented sevens that we
produced using this environment seven
stories like this we recorded little
data videos with timeline datasets like
this here's an example of a transition
from chronological to sequential so
before you're able to see on a 24 hour
clock what people were doing at any time
of the day now this is about counting
the variety of events in their day how
people change their in this case what
their what they were working on what
they were doing during the day either a
creative task or sleeping or eating just
the number of s the number of unique
events this is a sequential skill just
it just keeps the sequence but not the
chronology anymore of course it's not as
ideal as looking at it like this this
linear linear representation it affords
the comparison of how many unique events
to greater extent and here's an example
of selective highlighting where you can
compare in this case it was Darwin and
I think haruki murakami I think there's
actually one final transition in this
video where I transition back to a
chronological scale yeah and using this
representation now you can look at
synchronicities so what people were
doing at the same time in a day and
actually one of the timeline
infographics of this is based on assumes
this form or as another time like
infographic has the radial
representation with little images of the
people inside so what I'd like to spend
just the the rest of this my time here
talking today just about what my vision
for the future my visualization research
and i'll be speaking about some my
short-term and longer term research
interests and goals so starting with
this project and this addresses
Danielle's comment the next step of this
projects to get feedback from people on
this design space and on our sandbox
environment ideally by speaking to
people who do storytelling people who
work in journalism working digital
humanities law other domains that have
timeline like data ideally with by
populating data apothic lee in the
sandbox with data is personally relevant
to them asking them to provide their own
data except that's what i have done in
previous previous projects and i want to
do that here and working with them to
produce stories that are relevant to
them and this process will then inform
the design development of some more of a
web-based storytelling authoring tool
rather than the sandbox environment that
i've already built so i believe that
it's feasible to collect this feedback
and develop this authoring environment
and deploy it ideally within the time
frame of a postdoc here now one of the
important research questions in this
future work pertains to how we should
evaluate visualization authoring tools
like this what are the right metrics to
use and what are the methods that we
should do to evaluate authoring
environments for storytelling what are
the goals of them and as part of this
evaluation Dealey would hope to analyze
some cases down the road of whether this
tool is ultimately adopted and who
adopts it and what are they using it for
now another short term research goal and
this goes back to the energy management
to design study for a moment it's to
better understand the interaction
between famila persons familiarity with
the visual encoding and some patterns of
view coordination or in coordination
between multiple visual encodings in a
single display and this would be
experimental work motivated from as I
said the findings from that energy
management design study so one of our
designs I showed a few slides ago and
now I reproduce a version of it here
similar to this that our collaborators
ultimately adopted into their tool was
this juxtaposition and interactive
coordination between a tabular encoding
of aggregate time series values and
summary box plots for the same time
series period so this design was
actually very well received by our
collaborators and they put a version of
this into their their tool despite the
fact that neither these visual encodings
had ever been used before in that domain
and when they were shown in isolation
they weren't particularly well received
something about putting them together
and interactively coordinating them made
it work and made it appropriate for
their task so I want to study this
phenomenon and more greater detail and
more of a controlled laboratory setting
to find out when we have pairings of
visual encodings or one is more familiar
than another to the person or when both
are totally unfamiliar and seeing where
these these pairings make sense and when
they work in when do they fall short
another factor to consider in this
experiment will be the degree of
interactive coordination between these
pairings is it enough just to show two
static and coatings next to each other
or is there some unidirectional
coordination between the two like here
where I'm brushing over one encoding and
it's affecting the other or is
bi-directional encoding important and we
want to test this with different
pairings of visual encodings so another
long-term research goal one which I'm
already committed to in the design of
timeline based stories is just how to
understand and how to create without and
evaluate visual stories whether this be
the data video format like I showed a
few moments ago or some semi interactive
story something that's triggered by
steppers or scrolling but something that
allows the viewer to stop and pause and
explore a little bit locally in the
story before progress
with a narrative and related to this
goal is hello how do we define and
measure as if the story is engaging or
not what is engagement when it comes to
visual storytelling and as I mentioned
with the the timeline storytelling
project how to evaluate storytelling
authoring environment is and it's
another thread in this space that won't
stop with just the timeline authoring
tool and along with function Natalie and
Steven actually be attending the dog
stool seminar on data-driven
storytelling next week where I hope to
discuss these questions in more detail
hopefully initiates a new collaborations
in the space and see where it goes so in
the long term I'd also like to continue
to conduct a visualization research
motivated by problems and use cases in
data journalism and a digital humanities
so education history law policy analysis
so these their domains there's been a
notable increase over the past decade in
the adoption of visualization techniques
particularly for visual storytelling so
over the past year I've become involved
with the hacks hackers data journalism
community in Vancouver and I hope they
participate in this and similar other
computer assisted reporting communities
in the future wherever I am so I also
happen what happens behind the scenes in
these domains before the story is told
how are people in journalism or other
digital my knees domains doing their
analysis using visualization techniques
or tools to perform these investigations
or wrangle their data and then motivated
by this I'm particularly interested in
visualizing document or text based data
and this is inspired with this document
visualization tool overview that I
studied in the field study several years
ago now you need a unique challenge for
data analysis and many of these domains
is that the goal is seldom to discover
an objective truth in the data but it's
really just about promoting and
recording multiple interpretations of
possible phenomena the tools and
techniques that we build have to reflect
this more interpretive approach to
analysis rather than sort of a sense
making or discovery based approach where
there is a ground truth something is
motivated by more like intelligence or
law enforcement okay so to conclude I
just want indicate why I think MSR is
the best place to conduct this
visualization research and in particular
the visualization research that I want
to work on in the near term
so first I'm contain keen to continue
this ongoing positive working
relationship working with some leading
people in the areas of visual
storytelling so addition to bonk shin
and Natalie there's there Stephens work
on presenting an animating data with
sand ants which I saw him demo here last
summer and there's of course curtis's
history of developing rich interactive
story based media sure there's just a
wealth of experience here in this space
that I love to learn from another
attractive aspect of MSR is that it's
its aims are not domain-specific
Microsoft products and are not exclusive
to work settings there's our single
domains like business intelligence and I
feel like Microsoft and MSR by extension
has the ability to affect the future of
not only how people work but how people
conduct research how they create how
they play all the ways that people
consume or produce information and I
feel that visualization research
spanning many different application
domains data types and tasks just the
Surefire to continue this
cross-pollination of visualization
research design and design choices
across these domains and finally I'm
drawn to potential for multidisciplinary
collaborations so this could means the
more problem driven visualization design
study type work motivate by application
domain problems like visual analytics
collaborations with statisticians
machine learning researchers here
whether there's great opportunity for
visualization to help people learn how
these machine learning and ethical
methods work I know that there's some
work like model tracker here that are in
this space another possible colorations
collaborations could include work on
document to text visualization with
natural language processing and
computational linguistics researchers
and finally I'm interested in a and
promoting individual health and
well-being this started with as you
remember from the beginning of this talk
I masters research motivated by the
development of a self-administered
cognitive health assessment test my
undergrad research is all about using
technology to promote and enable
physical activity Oh didn't speak would
I want to actually return to within the
space of visualization and considering
the recent popularity of self tracking
the quantified self movement or
innovations in wearable technology
believe that there's great opportunities
now to promote both cognitive and
physical health
I think would be I great to explore the
ways much I could collaborate with
groups hear any of this area and other
areas relate to personal data
visualization I feel like MSR was design
around fostering these multidisciplinary
collaborations and I I look forward to
hearing your ideas about projects that
we could work on together so with that
thank you very much for your attention
and thanks to these people giving
feedback on the slides look forward to
hearing from you and meeting with you in
person thanks couple of your research
project system sort of developed in the
sandbox where you have you know lots of
different varieties experimentals now
the difference between a sort of paper
prototyping is that that's a lot more
work you know paper 45 you do this uh
the difference between this in high
fidelity this is meant primarily as a
chauffeured tourist you said or is it it
it's more a tool for you to visualize it
as opposed to someone else yes yes the
divergence stage of design rather than
the convergent face so it's about
developing and justice way too quickly
try out different designs really early
on in the design but making sure you
have real data in there yeah relation at
least as well yes that's like the
limitation of I still do a little bit of
sketching the beginning but often it's
just like napkin sketching him before
you actually get into needing to really
put the real data into it and see if it
works so the existing sandbox nici
projects i built my own in both these
projects the in the first project energy
management there was some data wrangling
packages that my collaborators had
already built that helped get the data
into it which was nice and they've done
all this work and are then I had to
build this sandbox environment over top
of it and I was using a tool called
shiny made by our studio which have
found very helpful for quickly getting
an interface together and trying out
different visual encoding options and
once you're in the our ecosystem there's
so many our packages for for visual
encoding and data that you can just
hook up into this shiny web-based
interface yeah the other one was in d3
i'm gonna ask further on that where does
it's all is a blank HTML page today and
and it's a sandbox again besides you
know you've got an SVG tag and you've
written a little dated and forth bought
food at CSP what makes his head box i
think that having the interaction being
able to choose between different visual
encodings within the interface having
that pose interactive controls therefore
not only changing the vigil encoding but
also changing the subset of the data
being able to filter it's very helpful
have that it within the interface
without having to go back into the
source code especially during a live
show for demo i want to be able to
quickly change the which data is being
shown highlight parts of the data
aggregate having that done interactively
is very helpful which part is sandbox
infrastructure in which part is you go
find the you go private you built five
visualizations in advance didn't bother
making interfaces easy to use because
you be the only person then you know
click through the five which is cool i
mean i'm fully in favor that they're
trying to figure out what i'm trying to
formalize in my mind what sandbox is
where there's a stage in my design
process reading the sandbox notion it's
probably after that that phase where you
developed a few standalone interactive
prototypes but particularly in my case
where i want to understand what the task
sequence is understand how we can
quickly go between them i find that it's
important to be able to do that
interactively because in some of the
design choices that are in the sandbox
do end up continuing and being adopted
by our collaborators so it's helpful to
have that already envisioned especially
with the the second project the timeline
budget there is ok that first phase
where you develop bunch of stand-alone
ideas but having the ability to filter
and aggregate and and highlight very
important maintain state between your
yesterday
over here the additional know what this
filter does that look like in this
representation canal after that here you
guys SN box is a data management system
and estate management system plus the
ability to jump down this content
leontina ya neck or so the early work on
the past apology as you mentioned it's
influenced a lot of different areas of
influence and part of that was was the
goal to try to bring this unification
yes um was there whether people that
have adopted that surprise June or that
sort of word expected yeah and tell me I
tell you about the weirdest example the
master's thesis at it was the universe
University in Germany on human plant
interaction so it was a it was a mfa
thesis about when do you design and grow
plants in a particular fashion to in
response to data very weird very
confusing but he used the vocabulary of
our typology to describe when a certain
as a design would be useful for a
particular goal to translate some some
findings in the plants and how they were
grown that was the weirdest one but
people have been using it in a lot of
things that we did expect which was nice
so in a design study in a particular
domain might not be very useful to just
talk about this very specific domain
tasks but now those finding is there can
be communicated using this vocabulary
and we've seen a few instances of that
at least one in bioinformatics if you're
different domain as i mentioned malware
analysis was another domain that people
have used to our vocabulary for so most
of the time it's been in these cases
where we did expect how it would be used
what i have liked is that people have
been still continuing to tax on oh my
tasks in very specific data types or
domains but they're now using our
vocabulary so as this translation to
happen a little bit more easily now the
papers not that old but how within
infamous community remain community how
well adopted you think it's
has been even in sort of a last year for
CFO is it still well yes a few people
are using it or recent growing adoption
yeah these are the songs as fast
yourself quite a few people citing it
and actually building off of it or as
saying this is our new tool and
according to the task typology of Bremer
munnar this is now the tasks that are
tool supports and we use this vocab late
and some people actually adopting some
of our little diagrams that we have to
just add mimicking the visual style of
it too which is really amusing yeah yes
Lima OH first question have you found
that any quick it's broken down in any
way based on people using it or he had
to iterate on it exchange things people
Chinese yeah we have Dunn's a little bit
of iteration on it in our belief paper
the next year we did sort of do a little
bit of rearrangement based on what we
thought made more sense especially run
though these produce tasks and there's
been a few instances where some people
have said we couldn't really fit our
tasks into this mold particularly on
like the visual analytics side because
there's a whole bunch of other other
tasks that are involved in that process
that may not really fit this visualize a
student centric task typology so there
was a paper by Mike Michael settle Meyer
and that group out of Vienna on a visual
parameter space analysis and I actually
admitted in their paper we tried to fit
their task to this typology but things
like sensitivity analysis and a couple
of their other tasks in this paper they
couldn't really find the right terms to
fit it which i think is fine it is it's
probably appropriate in some case has
been all cases and especially these more
visualization centric projects and they
may work better than you're looking at
visual analytics or things where
