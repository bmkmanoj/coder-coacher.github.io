you
good morning and thank you so much
everybody for coming in early it's my
great pleasure to today welcome my apey
pitch to microsoft research for our
Visiting Artist talk this is something
that studio 99 a group kind of a
grassroots route but at microsoft
research of artistically minded folks
has has started and we're trying to
attract both the local and international
artists and try to get them here to to
basically start the dialogue and within
the community about art and the role of
art within technology and the role of
art within microsoft it's a little bit
broader topic but it's my great pleasure
today to to welcome Mya I've known Maya
for several years now we share the same
country of origin so to say but she's
she's a great emerging artist in the
digital media domain here in Seattle her
background is she is she studied at ITP
in at NYU and then also it she's a
recent doctor graduate from the X arts
program here at u-dub one of the great
things that she works in a lot of
installations large room scale things
with lighting and kind of changing the
nature of space but one of the things
that's really interesting to me about it
is that she has this great track record
of attracting collaborators from
different disciplines and working across
disciplines which is which is a think
something that we're we're looking
forward to in the past you worked with
dancers and choreographers and and
technologies like me she actually seek
me out for some of the projects so it's
really been a fun collaboration so
without further ado this is my bed
future
so as heroin says I'm an artist and I
work on an intersection of art
technology and science and I will be
telling you about my practice and the
research that I have been doing in the
last 12 years I think that most of it
can be summed up under the title
transforming the poetic experience of
space true light so i will talk more
what it means and show some examples
from other artists that inspired me and
from my own work and i would say that my
work is focused on changing the
perception of space in functional art
and therefore the subjects of my work
have been perception space and art and
the to change perception i have been
studying sensation experience and
phenomenology and to create spatial
situations i have been practicing
designing spaces fabricating different
materials structures manipulating
materials and integrating lighting and
audio-visual systems inside of those
spaces when the core is always artistic
and in my work the core has been the
sublime and it's hard to define it and
critical history has proven that the
sublime cannot precisely we put into
words but i would think that for that
reason it's actually important to try to
figure the meaning of it and i will talk
host a little bit more about that just
to touch upon the meaning of artistic
value of the of the works that i'm
interested in so i will give you a
moment to read a quote by Immanuel Kant
Emmanuel can't recognize the sublime is
intangible that it is something to be
found in a formless object and the
experience of the sublime is necessary
to experience it is necessary to go
beyond reason and to employ sensibility
and imagination so it's a combination of
Reason sensibility and imagination and
for him it's not an object it's a state
of mind we must enter and that's what
enables us to experience it and we
experience it when our imagination fails
to conceive the greatness of events
solely by means a reason but compensates
for this failure with pleasurable
sensation that can be manifested through
synthesis of virtue of reason
imagination and Sensibility in other
words for pro can't this would be the
sublime it cannot be defined but it can
be experienced and since it is a noble
but can be experienced I think it's
profoundly valuable to find ways to
experience it and my interest is in in
finding those ways so one of the first
artists exploring the phenomenological
experience of the sublime was english
romantic landscape painter joseph
mallord william turner and this is one
of his most notable painting the
snowstorm steamboat o harbor's mouth
making signals in shallow water and it
betrays a ship in a distress of the
English coast with a high degree of
abstraction monochromatic palette a
symmetrical composition and it documents
the storm and the ship in the storm by
but really it doesn't use realistic
techniques to just illustrate what
happened but it conveys by creating the
sensation of how it must have felt to be
in that storm or to be watching it from
from close distance and and so I think
the painting doesn't only inform us
about what happened to the steamboat at
the harbor's mouth but it also
physically Mercer signal
and for that reason it's beautiful but
it's also terrifying and it's a visual
experience and I think it creates an
example of the subliming painting
because it provides the Gateway to that
type of experience and I also believe
that the art has a power to inspire both
Alvin terror and that has a power to
engage senses and provide this immediate
experience i will give you moments to
read the quotes it was fast okay i will
read it for you my perception sorry i
won't go back
my perception is not a sum of visual
tactile and now to audible Givens I
perceive in a total way with my whole
being I grasped by unique structure of
the thing a unique way of being which
speaks to all my senses at once and I
would say this also sums the success of
innovative contemporary artworks that
many times do experimental manipulations
of senses true visitor spaces is
experienced both cognitively and
emotionally so their innovative use of
materials engages sight hearing touch
smell emotion memory imagination and
therefore it can transform spaces and
that it is situated in so this is one
example and it's James Terrell's project
Wolfsburg project and he's just one of
the contemporary artists who has
followed the lead of richard wagner's
azam khan's work or the total work of
art that in 1849 intentionally included
all the senses into a total experience
so they try to do art that immerses the
body from all different sides and for
last 50 years i would say that art has
been marked by meaningful meaningful
treatment inclusion of space and also
trying to find access to multiple
sensory experiences of of the artwork
and this example uses ganzfeld and it's
a technique that actually stands for
perceptual deprivation and it's a
phenomenon of perception caused by
exposure to unstructured the uniform
stimulated field so here a haul of
construction divided into two
interconnecting chambers it's it's a
viewing space is left entirely empty and
it slowly flooded with light and that
changes colors and the way the color
changes it creates an experience of the
space changing form with and this is the
the fact that the light has to transform
the space and the experience of being in
that space i would say that such
multi-sensory spatial art positions the
body in the center and the experience is
triggered phenomenologically and so the
possibility of the subliming that I
thought previously about is more direct
and a good example is dis caravaggio's
amazingly visual painting it is a
representation of st. Thomas reaching
out his hand to touch the Christ it
visually portrays a story that informs
us about the event but it is so visceral
that receive with our eyes the image of
touch that translates into the haptic
experience on our own flash when I look
at the painting I feel this spoke in my
own body so I think that's the value of
it the experience and I'm interested in
the same effect but creating situations
in space that not only stimulate vision
but also other senses and provoke this
more immediate experience so to do that
as I said I have been studying
perception and five basic sensory
systems visual acoustic taste smell
orienting and the haptic system which
collaborate with each other for us to
experience things but they also
collaborate with emotion and imagination
and this is where our artist has a lot
of playroom and from the range of
phenomenologically powerful tools to
create the experience I think the
potential for lighting stained stands
out and my focus has been on studying
theoretical and practical examples that
leto is discovering interpreting and
developing no body of knowledge for
enhancing the multi-sensory spatial
experience
bye-bye use of lighting in order to
transform the poetic sensation of the
space my my approach focuses on the use
of lighting materials that engage
perception emotion memory and
imagination and the subject of my
research are historical and contemporary
references the demonstrate this
transformation and some of them I just
showed you my technical approach
combines both traditional and
experimental principles of lighting
design spatial design fabrication
audio-visual systems and algorithmic
composition and my interest is really to
exploit technological advancements that
confuse perception of senses and add to
the phenomenological experience of the
artistic intentions so really to work
with whatever is out there that can help
reach and impact meaningfully people
when they enter space and create a
poetic experience for them this would be
one of my first works that deals with
what I just talked about and it's
outside in an interactive light
installation that was created in 2004 so
I attempted to transform the atmosphere
of this utterly shattered pedestrian
tunnel it's in New York City's subway on
190 first Street of station of the
number one train and it's utterly
shattered and quite horrible things
happen there it's very long tunnel but
somehow people get robbed even when
people other people are passing and
there's rape and it's it's pretty
negative space and I was interested how
to transform the experience of it a
little bit just for a moment and point
to the contrast of of that space with
with the rest of the environment
and I use artificial light to simulate a
striking natural effect of light
emanating from the sky so I created
false cracks on the ceiling too and then
had artificial light coming true to
simulate this effect of so-called God's
light and lights were programmed to
imitate the color and intensity of the
daylight outside the tunnel so when it
was very let's say Seattle like whether
the light inside would be bluish white
asian when it was very sunny it would be
bright yellow red and so on this project
is called as it is cracking and it is an
interactive light and video installation
of the wall that cracks in real time so
as the wall cracks leiden video peer
through the cracks to simulate the
change of daylight and that is also
happening outside so the slowly changing
light changes from being frightful
frightful to pleasurable and the
daunting cracks on the wall happen start
to crack and crack fully over the course
of eight hours light and moving image
appears with the cracks and simulate the
serene nature of and daylight that is
outside but this change is interrupted
by sudden and startling experience of
lightning so this is what a moment where
room completely gets washed out with
about white light and then it turns into
this this form and really it happens in
response to people's presence in the
room so throughout the course of time
the light imitates the outside light but
then there is a change when there's a
recognition of people inside of the
space so the opening into the outside
environment reveals the experience of
calm and slow
changes in the outside environment it
suddenly turns into a stormy event and
then goes back into combing space yeah I
know for this one oh yeah but there
could be yeah there is potential for
that yeah it would be it has a potential
to be more sensory impactful with audio
too but at this edition there was no
audio yeah I I was exploring how to how
to change the sensation from something
for me that feels of like into something
that feels terrifying and how to do this
in the course of time and I did this
with light and video in this case so
it's a fake wall that is built a front
of the real wall and it's actually made
of plastic which is then covered with a
with a very very dry paint with some
other chemicals they put inside at the
cracks over time so when you have almost
to dry paint it always cracks right so
it's kind of the same effect and because
it's transparent it's showing really
when it starts to crack a little bit it
starts to show what's happening behind
and this project gotta to award slight
art awards Richard Kelly and children
lidar toward and it also was a base for
other projects that followed that I'll
talk a little bit about in this project
I worked with a choreographer also on
cracking the wall but here we did
something mechanical and it is a project
called the eyes of the skin and that I
did in collaboration with professor
Jennifer salke who is a professor at the
University of Washington science
department and it's a dance about
twisted nature of tenderness and
sensitivity so tenderness is the finest
tendency to express warm compassionate
affectionate feelings but it also stands
for pain and discomfort and I was
interested in this dichotomy and told it
a wall that cracks is both showing this
fragility and viewing that she was
dealing with in Spain in her dance and
it was done with mechanical solution
that Craig the wall open and also then
we worked on responding with light to
whatever happen in the space in terms of
the narrative and dancers movement in
the space the light to change this is a
different project continuation of the
eyes of the skin number one but this is
the eyes of the skin number two actually
and it's really continued experiment
with different technologies and
collaborating with lighting engineers
computer engineers more dancers to
create more powerful solution for the
previous one that I just talked to you
about and we were commissioned by Henry
art gallery to install it across their
three floor museum so this piece was
yeah it was install he came into the
Henry art gallery and then on every
floor there were there were pieces of
walls that would either similar simulate
cracks or that in the big strong gallery
there was a large wall that provided the
backdrop to the main drag the dance and
that had the was covered with another
fake wall with dancers and ripped apart
to open it to kind of peek into the
cracks and in collaboration with her I
worked on video mapping system that then
provided video so look into the
what happens inside of those cracks I'll
show you a little bit about this so once
they open the wall they would you would
see an image and once they would close
the wall image would no longer be there
could we please have the lights down a
little bit thank you
so the space yeah another outcome of
service and my collaboration was this
interactive video installation shadow
converted which was exhibited last year
in this building in studio 99 and it was
an experiment that examined the shadow
is a place defined by an absence of
light so this interactive piece creates
an inverted the experience where shadows
are illuminated and series of portals
into an inverted image or imaginary
world so what is the light in the real
world it is dark in the shadow and vice
versa and by moving through a light the
person shadow uncovers glimpses of the
world beyond searching the unknown and
without ever being to see it all being
able to see it all so really it was
using shadows moving shadows as a map to
display video of natural realms and
there are beautiful moments of people
touching each other shadows and then
those videos fusing into one and yeah it
came out of the talks that her when I
had about creating an experience with
video and also light and it was I would
say a quick quick experiment which just
showed that there is a lot of potential
in terms of creatively applying
technology large-scale spatial
installations that I show you are pretty
much demanding in terms of resources I
also do some small-scale work object
work but they're also on the subject of
space so this is a light installation
called skies it's a seven foot tall and
40 inches wide installation made of
seven modules
and these are seven boxes stacked on top
of each other and in each box there are
dynamic dynamic lights that are
individually programmed to present
change of them daylight from sunset to
sunrise and so the sky and it's seven
modules are constantly changing to to
have the sense of ever-changing
environment that's around us
my study of transforming the political
experience of space has been reflected
also in my PhD exhibit horizon is an
imaginary line and this is a the latest
big installation work that I ident and i
will i will talk to you about it in more
detail just to kind of show what's my
process and then i will also show you
example so how what was the outcome it
was a it was utilizing experimental
light and electric acoustic compositions
to transform the experience of jones
playhouse theatre and the attempt was to
create a transforming into poetic
experience of nature so as I said the
main medium is light and the
transformation of the immaterial
sensation of light by projecting
animation of simple geometric patterns
and references to nature into material
experience of the constructed landscape
said Korea I created light sculptures by
means of reappropriation cinematic
technologies and in that way holds a
lineage that traces back to the abstract
paintings of artists like Mark Rothko
and before him Turner that I talked
about the where the perception on
landscape is treated as a very vehicle
for the sublime and really the idea was
to use light as a tool that then reaches
people on not only visually but also you
can almost feel it by the sense of touch
and the way I was working with it was
reappropriation technologies that are
already out there and yeah utilizing
high power projectors and programming
haze to interact with it created the
sensation of almost physical light
so the piece occupied the stage of Jones
playhouse theatre which is located at
the University of Washington and it is a
one-story brick building with a small
partial basement totaling around 13,000
gross quest square feet and sitting for
210 people in ancient greek amphitheatre
style so it's a pretty large semi
circular theater space surrounded by
terrorists city and at the beginning of
the piece the doors of the playhouse
theatre opened to visitors to enter
directly the stage where the
installation was taking space and
visitors were encouraged to explore the
entire stage and the installation in
their own choosing so it was completely
painted with supersaturated concentrated
velour black paint and the entire
seating was covered in black too so
there was absolutely no source of light
and people coming inside were pretty
much disoriented because they there was
no reference there was absolutely no
light even people who work there could
not feel their way around and it was a
very interesting sensation the total
absolute darkness and once the visitors
dark-adapted their intention was grabbed
by tiniest amounts of light that was
composed to cover the stage of the
theater in a very minimal way and to
direct the case of viewers I'm going to
talk a little bit about technology
behind this so this is what I utilized
to create the experimental lighting
solution and also electro-acoustic
installation and here is how it was laid
out so when you came in it seemed just
like a very open-ended space completely
bare bones but there was a pretty
elaborate installation of pieces across
and my research concentrated on digital
projection as
the lighting source and the interaction
with folk in the air that created the
sensation of like being palpable so the
experience of projection can be
manipulated by positions of the
projectors and each of Panasonic
projectors was positioned on one side of
the theater and together they produced
one connected separate image by emitting
horizontal beams of light and that so
the position of projectors was
completely affecting how the light was
experienced the direction of it but then
I also was using to moving rotating
projectors that were by changing their
position they were also changing the
direction of light and there are two one
was a position about the center of the
stage and the other and the San top
center of the audience terrace and both
of those were the very program to move
their yolks during the piece and and
then I worked on we appropriated image
into the sensation of line so when you
came in you could see some image on the
ground but almost nobody paid attention
to it because it was so prevailing the
sensation of light and that's that's
what the image was designed to do to
create a sensation online this is just a
quick image of how the technology was
connected so I was repro creating all
the technology for this type of thing
and then I had to repro Priya way it was
it was coming together and I think I can
skip actually talking details about this
unless you're interested
so I utilized them to hazers and a fog
machine during the peace and the haze is
present and maintained throughout the
piece and then the fog was introduced in
key moments of the piece so it was a
very much intentional when it came and
where exactly it came so it was
localized but there was also with haze
and fog and there's a very i dinnae the
nature of it is that is very
ever-changing so it cannot be completely
controllable so that was also taken into
consideration fabrication of fog and
haze that is usually known as a weather
phenomenon is used to imply really a
natural realm and to create more of
sensational of the atmosphere and it
provokes in that way the stronger
connection with nature and this has been
done from antiquity and there has been
fascination with it with the optical
phenomenon that held the fundamental
role in both inspiring and examining
premises about the physical world so the
veteran employed in science atmospheric
optics astronomy art art history color
theory mythology military and this is
what interests me is how this one thing
that we all know and experience weather
and nature from this let's say just
little corner from the position of fog
and haze is experienced and first it
fascinates many different disciplines
and how they treat it so entire
civilizations have been actually ruined
and this some prospered based on their
ability to to to predict and adapt to
the climate change so that also has a
connection to do what I am trying to
imply here i am going to i'm going to
show some other works of art that used
fog as they're too
and in my work I I I do have a research
of everything related to what I'm doing
and try to learn from that and here you
can see works by freaking akaya Diller
Scofidio tetsuo condo kurt henschel gear
oliver eliassen and all of them use fog
in their work and they treat it as a
sculptural medium that is a in a subtle
collaboration with water atmosphere air
currents and time itself experiential
and formally nature this fog sculptures
spatialized light shadows and adult at
sometimes also an image and borrowing
various forms of mediums and integrate
integrating them into the space of the
artwork is I think where there is a
potency for this poetic experience of
space so I try to do a step up from that
and mostly I did this by repurposing us
video film and animation to shape the
light so really the content of
projection was crucial in shaping the
kinetic behavior of of light and
experience of it so these are the layers
of animation using the piece so this is
how the animation looks at the beginning
added morphs into different shapes and
it progresses so the shape form and
progression of the projection generates
the fluidity of light that is being
sculpted into space and after a series
of experiments with many different
projections I concluded that utilizing
simple geometric forms slowly
transforming in time are the most
effective in creating almost fields of
light that one can enter into and be
into almost a shell of light so that
then I advance into more complex shapes
which were then implying natural forms
which also has to do a lot with
things found in nature and that is a
simple geometric forms feature that
which then evolved into more complex so
this is how those images that I showed
you in animation for milk looked in
space when they were projected so the
animations are created by use of the
adobe after effects editing software and
manipulated in real time by HIPAA tiser
media server so it's a tool used mostly
in theater and entertainment and but not
in the way I was using it so it was
interesting to see how to how to utilize
this in my purposes and really it
provided me access to creating animating
and composing an abstract animation
through keyframing time remapping
animation dynamic effects color
correction computer-based sliding 3d
camera construction adjusting the angle
old it in real time and and all
animations are produced in a layered and
nonlinear editing environment then are
then imported into the HIPAA tizer to
have eight real-time layers that were
manipulated in real time so this is
again a look of stills from the
animation and complex compositing of
abstract moving imagery interacts with
haze and fog and results into dynamic
environment of light could we have some
lights down please so following image is
a screenshot from the animation and then
these are like how the light fell this
is when you were inside of the light
that was the this is looking outside and
almost having a sensation you can touch
it
it's very hard to document most of these
works it's something that needs to be
experienced and it's also it's even
harder to do a video that's why I'm kind
of opting for images but more than
anything I hope to install this piece
again and hopefully you can experience
it for yourself so the aesthetic of
simple shapes bold colors and dynamic
geometry has a heritage in also color
field painting and abstract
expressionism and they combine this anti
figurative aesthetic of the European
abstract styles such as futurism Bauhaus
synthetic cubism with the emotional
potency of German Expressionism so this
is a point very technology and art meet
and where we appropriated technology go
can can be applied in terms of artistic
value
so in previous quote I cannot explain
why I was opting for simple shapes so it
wasn't just a good solution for for my
experience of projection but also it had
a meaning in this work and this is a
first again a screenshot from the
animation and then next to it on on the
right you have an image of how this
image felt in space so the work looked
further to approach this uses a moving
image into an experience of spatial
light by creating the nonlinear
composition of light and sound that
could be experienced in space as an
extension of space that's ever-changing
so really this simple shapes were
becoming more and more complex or in 20
minutes and the this this is done in
yeah in the images you saw previously so
experimenting with the light beams
coming out to the projector 7 playing
videos deals with cinema and vidhi art
and by this age cinema has developed
complex relationship with contemporary
visual and media arts and it is often
used outside in its own context and
placed into the territory of art where
in some cases becomes almost
unrecognizable and these are just
examples of some other artists
reappropriation cinematic technologies
so viewers are turning to participants
and in turn their passive experience is
transformed into visually immersive
experience and such such works really
explored the notions of time memory and
transition from material to material
this is a composition of light image and
sound that I did for for the piece and
as I said it starts both sound and and
image light start with abstract forms
and morph into organic recognizable
elements of nature only to be processed
again and filtered to its abstract parts
and really it's a nonlinear dramatic arc
of the piece that can be felt seeing
hurt smelled and touched and it leads
towards the disc our discovery of the
natural environment these are just some
pictures that show the process and I
will follow by showing you images of
more nature like environment in the
piece
so much like the light experience of the
horizon sounds were also derived from
the cinematic 3 appropriation and this
is a moment where those dos abstract
shapes are becoming evoking the sense of
rain and I work in this the sense of
sunshine and this is all happening in
time it's moving it's becoming faster
and it's changing pace there are some
people here who experienced it so you
can say how it felt it's hard to take a
picture or a video once again but the
same was done with the coos
electro-acoustic composition which was
using amba sonic meaning a 3d sound
system and you could hear different
sounds at different parts of the space
and again it was kind of following the
the notion of oral cinema or Lumia
cinema meaning we appropriated cinematic
technology for this experience so it is
a multi-sensory experience and it really
tries to balance the interaction of the
body and and the space with light color
image and sound and the space of
Playhouse Jones theatre is transformed
into environment we defy without defined
boundaries that provokes heightened
perception awakeness awareness of this
undefined space and one's own presence
in the space
you
moving beams of light who are both
physical and thermal both figurative and
abstract both still and dynamic and
phenomenal experience of light sound was
nearly impossible to capture as they
change based on the state of the fog and
viewers position in the space so it was
almost it was completely impossible to
capture everything at once and one had
to move around the space and would
experience different things and actually
every single time the piece was shown it
also was different because of the earth
different air flow the fog would behave
differently and you cannot really
recreate your movement so that was
interesting too and each visitor created
a silhouette in space that also
contributed to the experience of the
space and and total experience and as
they move their figures at times blog
the haze and blog the fog and block the
image also which provides them with an
opportunity to interact with the
environment and make immediate influence
on it and to play the play of light
across the space really is transformed
by the play of visitors in the space
and my plan is to keep on transforming
and expanding this piece into an
interactive perceptual hyperspace that I
have in mind that I would like to call
that I'm calling now we're all made of
light and really I would like to achieve
the goal of creating even more impactful
experience of of nature in a build space
and I'm now exploring all possible ways
to do that my so I'm really interested
in the more compelling experience and
whatever tool can facilitate that and I
believe there is a lot of opportunities
in studying light is basic indispensable
necessary substance substance of the
universe which is visible and invisible
energy that travels through space and
enables but also defines life I also
think it's a potent metaphor and in my
further work I would like to explore it
for both being a physical and symbolic
and to explore those properties to
change the experience of space so
currently I am looking into
possibilities for expanding the work by
incorporating projection that captures
live visitors in space so really what
would happen would would be employing
video mapping mechanism which looks into
the space to see to capture visitors and
then projectors the visitors back their
silhouettes and really to create the
space of light in the shape of their
silhouette so when one person is walking
to have an outline of a flight around
them and then morph that that that
outline into different shapes and maybe
different visitors there are many
different different possibilities but
is that each visitors will create a
light space by just being present in the
space and as they move across the space
the light will be extruded in the shape
of them and leaving light trails of your
presence across the space at specific
times these volumetric light shapes will
be composed to to like morph until
whatever will be appropriate for this
piece but I'm really interested to morph
into a person that may be opposite or
maybe was there previously and the goal
is to really experiment with technology
to advance how people experience space
their presence in space how they deal
with their environment and to offer a
variety of perspectives of our nature
our origins and our our world another
possibility that i'm contemplating about
is working with scientists to utilize
recent groundbreaking breaking discovery
of using ultrasound to levitate small
particles around mid air in order to
move particles of haze and more flight
sculptures so using acoustic levitation
to move move haze and then in that way
kind of intentionally shape the kinetic
light sculptures these are some other
possibilities i'm also contemplating
about but everything is everything is
now a possibility whatever can help
create more compelling experience and
I'm for that reason I'm very excited to
be here because this is the place of for
those opportunities and I would love to
talk more with you and here if you have
any ideas of how how we could make this
happen
let me know if you have any questions or
if I can go back and show any of the
work again how you're talking about the
piece you did in the theater mm-hmm see
and you said that it was done in real
time so were you sitting with the
soundboard essentially like affecting
things or was it on like a time sequence
it was composed precomposed but then
there were four eight eight layers of
animations which were then also
manipulated real time so it could run by
itself but then it also was a modified
based on what was happening in space not
not always sometimes there was no need
but sometimes it was interesting too
because there are four projectors and
they were all kind of taking certain
parts of space at different moments so
there is a possibility to kind of
localize different areas of space using
this real-time mechanism you know where
it comes together in feeder that way
because often we think of the artistic
experience is something that's created
and then put out to the world and then
just you know repeat it you know
we're in this case you're having a
dynamic experience kind of like that
dialogue we're speaking about earlier
that real life like yeah yeah yeah so
for your work that involves lightning
the relation of light you up in eq
close it off outside that you don't have
to I just for this this her to be yeah
successful yeah James Turrell has an
issue to yeah that stressful than you
have to oh this was a huge huge and our
you know it's a big theater and even
though theaters are made to be dark
there is still you know exit signs
little flashlights some reflective
surfaces the chairs are have a little
bit of chrome that catches light so all
of that had to go so it it was
challenging to cover that and you know
it just took a lot of effort but it was
worth it because it's so interesting to
be in a space there is no light and then
to control the light that comes in so
for me it wasn't it was worth it yeah
for it for this for this piece how did
you ever get people Trump exit signs and
all sorts of lightness space s stairs
university of washington sagene recorded
and okay i'll tell you later
so it's your partnership ongoing
research group right now is it a formal
partnership or is it a or is it more of
a yes it I wouldn't say it's formal I
hope there is a possibility for making
it formal but yeah I have been very much
engaged with working with technology and
we appropriating technology for the
purpose of art and her voice is also
interested in in in creating technology
that can be used in artistic purposes so
it has been informal kind of I mean we
came together for I think the first time
we worked with for the big Henry exhibit
and it kind of came together pretty fast
other plans for any other exhibitions or
getting them on campus here right now
yeah the office stuff yes they were the
microsoft park flexion birmingham
gallery space so you know it might be
interesting right currently we have a
fairly isolated space thing it is
something like that yes absolutely
you got finger fur and that the tunnel
you see me uh-huh there's a me you Blake
went there when it was before he got
started and kind of got a feel for it
and feel for ambience the
mood of people going through it yeah and
then afterwards did you notice any
difference can people see many different
going through
unfortunately it was a very short
installation almost a couple of hours
because of security reasons it had to it
couldn't stay there longer but so the
people who were there were a lot of
people who knew is going to happen and
then there are also people who just were
passing by and absolutely there was
reactions to it because it was an
unexpected moment and if they did
transform the entire experience it's a
very long tunnel and then seeing
something in the middle of it is kind of
builds up anticipation and then passing
through it was was compelling yeah you
mentioned simulating mm-hmm and some
trees if your precious involved
redirecting or manipulating
yeah I'm interested in that but in for
this project actually i had i started
with measuring the quality of outside
light and then I was trying to translate
those values into the light that is a
that is experienced in the space and
then I discovered that it's almost
better to create a little bit more i
would say theatrical interpretation of
the outside light the outside light when
it's very sunny is not really yellow but
it was very effective for me to use this
type of light to simulate the warmest of
the outside light so it was but I would
like to use daylight if that's the
question I would really like to work the
daylight and I I have been working on
some proposals for I can talk a little
bit about that but using heliostats to
harvest sunlight and also then directed
to special objects that I have been
caught coating with different optical
materials so they diffract light so that
would be one example
right there are no other questions thank
your speaker one more will be around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
