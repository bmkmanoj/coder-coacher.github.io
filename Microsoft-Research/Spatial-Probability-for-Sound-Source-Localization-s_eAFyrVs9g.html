you
so good afternoon everyone thanks for
coming for this talk it is the final
talk of the beach the internal on clay
who is a PhD student in university Flynn
noise his advisor is professor douglas
jones and the topic of his internship is
special probability for thousands
localization and without further ado
long cute on the floor thank you hello
everyone my name is lamella and my
presentations were going to be a prob
with the project that I and I've on this
over the last three months so the title
i have south of globalization so what is
south of globalization and it's a
problem that given the microphone array
and that's multiple potentially multiple
styles in their environments you trying
to figure out where the cells always
coming from so usually a microphone
array have the x axis defined to be
pointing towards oaks and then the y
axis is the 90 degree from it and the
angle theta is the divider to be the
direction from the cell jokes with
respect to the x axis but one thing to
notice is this is not entirely my
projects in my project is not about
Sasha localizations it's about spatial
probability so what is special
probability and the special Probie that
probability project that we it has to
come to main goal the first thing is to
replace a point decisions about the
direction of arrival or do I with a
belief or distributions about a
potential do I so the idea is to
generalize the south of localization
problems but in additions having this
belief or distributions can also have
additional application in like spatial
filtering for example and the second row
of our projects we want a single angle
ramps that going to be used applicable
for
multiple microphone array so we can
either have a linear for element
connects our circular ilm an omni
directional microphone or circular I
element cardioid microphone and these
are the actual objects and their image
in in here so the idea is we want to
have a single angle ramps not going to
do all these microphones alright
basically so that's the goal and the
challenge we want an anagram that is
fast enough so we can't afford to spend
too much computational times just trying
to figure out the do either direction of
our eyeball because there's many things
that going to go after it so we want
this to be extremely fast the second
challenge the start the data set is
going to be collecting drew environments
which is what by that i mean like none
anechoic chamber so you're going to have
reflection reverberations all this guy
in the data set up we going to evaluate
the algorithms and they also be recorded
at different snr so these are the main
challenge yeah the example the night
former you just show are all relatively
close to each other does the algorithm
also work on the microphone array it's
just like placed around the room around
the room insula means that maybe there's
my phone like at the at the light in
front of the monitor maybe there is a
two microphone at back of the room so
technically when you say microphones
everywhere in distance in PBS compact
okay tight places close together to set
the distance in mechanically tight
together because to micro pulse you have
no emotional problems in cock
synchronization knowing the distance in
precision of the remittance and
something etc so those are out of scope
side yeah that's still very good
questions no we didn't look at that we
only look at totally spaced microphone
and I forget to mention but there's also
a front-to-back microphone in the data
set but we don't have the sample of that
device here
so they are all highly back together so
what are the angular already have
developed so far I'm going to go to all
these of them right now and the most
common one is probably the generalized
cost correlations with face face normal
light place normalizations GCC fan and
it's basically this is the main equation
that define design rhythms so why is the
observations from microphone k YK is
observation from microphone k y eres
observation from microphone now um and
you just take them and correlate them by
some delay in frequency domain and
normalize by the magnitude so you take
out the magnitude of the medical
information now completely and that's
going to give you some GCC measure over
the delay for a particular pair now if
your microphone array has more than two
pair you're going to have to con some
way to combine all the pants together
and one way to do is you use the
steering vector information to estimate
that theoretical delay for a hypothesis
have hypothesized angle theta and then
plug that into this function and that's
it what is doing here and then someone
overall repair in a normalized so I
talked about probability spatial
probability but for now let's just stick
with a function a log likelihood
functions over the spatial angle theta
and I will show later how to convert
from this log likelihood function into a
special probability properly but for now
please stick with this for own
algorithms we're going to defy some dope
likelihood functions like this the next
most way of knowin ghulam is probably in
music and essentially it's um this idea
about having a noon space that is
octagonal to assist noise by the signal
subspace orthogonal to the noise of sway
and the subway are derived from the data
correlation matrix
known here ry and us is the signal subs
by a please later correlation matrix ry
one thing from the literature is that I
learn is that you can do a much better
job if you're you focusing on free time
frequency beans that have bring one they
tagged I wear this later correlation
matrix have rang one so that yo you us
your signal dimension is dimension one
and given no of that and these are i er
denote the steering vector for frequency
Omega and special angle theta and you
can compute and this defy this
expression divided a log likelihood
function for the music algorithms and we
use this this reference number four here
to efficiently check whether this matrix
has rang one rather than doing a full
flow SVD which is way to complicate and
then the next angular ms the common know
where no valid angle rooms and again the
loculi little function is defined by
this expression where IRS steering
vector at frequency Omega special angle
theta otherwise the data correlation
matrix same thing for MPD are you just
have an additional matrix inversions
step which can be highly unstable but
there are numerical tricks to get around
this and you invert that and that defy
the log likelihood functions one thing I
learned from two is that to improve the
performance of all these algorithms for
circular directional microphone array
you want to like draw away face data
from the back of a microphone with
respect to L and the hypothesized
incoming angle and thus the reference
number four here and that is part of the
implementation that I have for those
space lion grams they actually help
improve these algorithms quite
significantly well but the
the way no algorithms but what we have
here in Microsoft is we have an idea why
tangrams which is instantaneous instant
10 years of direction of arrival but i
will just go i won do i for i do i and
this view the problem of the UI
estimation they'll have happen every
hypothesis testing so what are the
hypothesis the hypotheses are the
possible direction of arrival DOA is the
no x theta I over here I go from 1 30
and then instead of using the steering
vector directly what we compare is that
they are different in the face between
the steering vector voice frequency and
a special angle and before that we pick
one one steering vectors as a reference
so this is the phase difference between
KN singh element k on microphone k and
microphone 1 and this is going to be the
mean divided the mean of the model the
theoretical expected face difference for
the signal but then we have the data the
data term in the data term is the same
thing the phase difference between
general k + channel 1 and you have this
so i'll call this the other small delta
the data base difference and this is
capital Delta's the theoretical phase
difference so you take that the
data-driven face different and you
compute some distant or theoretical
phase difference and for now just ignore
the modular operations but not register
euclidean distance between the
theoretical and the data-driven terms
with some normalization stuff can be
it's not very important for this term
but the important thing is there is a
mode operation here at first and I will
go into detail later why is this matter
in this case
that you have this operation here and
these divided the loculi little
functions for theta I for this data
driven terms you do that for all other
angle and you have a 0 hypothesis to
test so so far i defy all these slop
likelihood functions how to convert them
into our actual probability one way is
to just normalize them normally but if
you do the sub Mac normalizations then
you have an additional degree of freedom
Sigma here that allows you to adjust
your confident about you allow you to
try out between your confidence about
having a picky sharp Alicia Bower a
pig's for coming from these directions
allow you to help lie arm let's pick a
pic but like arm let allow you to see
all the silo potential side of if you
have like arm last Sigma then potential
Shylock may get suppress and it will
completely disappear you won't be able
to see them but you will get are very
sharply pics in the reverse if you had
Sigma set to small value so and this is
how we can perform block likelihood
functions to actual probability for the
foremost or angular mess so one thing
that by trying different angle ramps for
the first two months is that a one thing
I've learned is that i do is much faster
extremely fast compared to the angle or
the other algorithms and that's just
satisfy one of the foot challenge that
we have is that we want an algorithm to
be really fast so i think i think that
is easier to put in more things that is
already faster than then take outing
that are slow but already work so i
choose to improve on i do a two and so
now that the first step in to improving
this i do I one is a second versions I
do I to so that I'm gonna have a clear
separation between
signal detection and do I estimations by
decoupling this term so this is the term
that we want to compute eventually the
property of laser signal are
specifically speech coming from this
angle theta at a certain frequency Omega
just assume um and that can be decouple
into a thumbs up assuming that
everything is speech then just find the
directions of arrival fighter do I pet
angle and then let's leave that the
determinations between speech with the
reflection or reverberations for the
second terms assuming that signal coming
from a reflex ignore is going to have
lower magnitude receive magnitude than
the actual direct path signal and this
term is going to be computed by the VAD
that is already pack up the audio msn
audio processing pipeline and then I
only have to focus on this tub just to
compute this term and and this is make
the problem easier because now I assume
everything is signal where there is a
reflection or reverberation from
different directions I'm safe because i
know there's another time not going to
wait out the reflections so given up i'm
going to focus on this term and i'm
going to improve on i do 81 i'm going to
still do look at this problem is a
hypothesis testing problem going to come
up with a bunch of likelihood model for
well a likelihood model for for each
incoming angle theta and it's very
similar to the idea why that I just
present so you're going to have a
data-driven face and magnitude
difference so we want to add magnitude
because the intuitions that I one have
is that for directional microphone like
the like the carry on like this one you
should be able to learn from the
magnitude and so rather than just the
face you shouldn't be copying the face
so that's why we have these additional
terms the magnitude
difference so the reason for the lock is
there is no particular reason for the
lock on the run that's just going to
make this theoretical spy that we show
later symmetric around zero so long so
when the two these two live we code and
then they just kind of cancer out it's
just nicer so I'm going to denote here
on the capital Delta is going to be
again the theoretical both face and
magnitude difference so subscript P D
know Faison subscript amino magnitude
the same thing here for the data-driven
terms and here's the HR / normalizations
the reason is like going to be so the
motivation is going to be support by the
result and if you put any time here the
result going to be works so and I am
there's no modulation operations when
and I will get to that in a few you know
one or two slide so it's just a
Euclidean distance between the
theoretical and your data treatments
face a magnitude difference so you might
answer I why why why do I propose that a
simple models like this so simple why
the thing is that I it is going to work
so this is one example of a theoretical
facing magnitude difference so this axis
and the vector in this is with the for
the first for being a phase difference
theoretical phase difference the lighter
one from five to eight and magnitude
difference in the lock domain so you see
usually like theoretical leaders be some
amplitude magnitude variations between
different angle so these are the
potential angle and this is the Delta
the theoretical realize that at one
particular frequencies 1000 huh just a
simple for you to visualize a spy and so
now we have a data terms that going to
be a vector the same line vector
you're going to mesh them this factor
across these dimensions to every single
possible theoretical line and the one
that have the highest lowest distant
going to win yeah so so now it's time
the additional improvement that I
proposed over i do 81 so in ideal way
you do you remember that stuff the
modulation 2pi that going to bring the
two closer before you actually do the
distant calculations and the reason for
that is because if you flip it that the
actual data to even phase difference is
very noisy this is like this the
theoretical one when you unwrap is just
a straight line beautiful straight die
so this is very noisy so what if you
unwrap this sometime because of the
noise it can go like these are like this
so when you do that modulations you
actually pull this point closer to the
candidate angle and and then you
calculate that this done and that turn
out to be like extremely powerful for
like when you do plus and minus 90
degree so 100 an ID on go yeah but the
issue is like we've got still whole
we're electric still whole four plus and
minus 180 or 360 degree when now for
every so the first one is the same
that's why you professor phone is still
from minus PI to PI that doesn't
increase but now the dango that you want
to resolve the ball so this is one
simple theoretical phase difference when
you do a 360 degree so they are both
Crowley's face much more than this so I
hear high frequencies you have much more
resolution different between different
angle coming angle so one of the trick
that I tries to
do unwrapping face partially so I don't
do one phone and wrapping across
frequency or frequency point but you
pick some some concern some something
that you're going to act i optimize it
gotta keep it going to need to be
optimized but you just pick some number
and then you unwrap along up to that
frequency only and then you restart
every time the idea is to avoid
accumulate error that's going to throw
up is this data-driven face and this
might might look we're first but this is
what makes everything make my demo I
guess so now to the evaluation partial
so that's the 22 trick that I use one is
the partial unwrapping fight the audio
is the incorporation of the magnitude
and let's see how light whether it is to
click gonna happen or hurt before going
to evaluations i have to go to the data
set that we have and this is like
enormous thank you that product team
that had provided me with this data so i
have data from a linear 411 connect
array have data from circular I element
directional microphone same thing for
I'll a moment omni direction how many
directions and also data from front to
back to element microphone and here's
the setup that i will show how the data
was rico so you have a typo in the
middle of the room with them when
microphone array on the table you have
four loudspeaker on four corner to
trying to create sarao emulate surround
knows you have a movable sounds oaks not
going to play the speech the actual
signal that's going to be movable and to
create different angle and this is
recorded na na Nana quick rooms at
different nessuna so it is related it's
not synthesized synthesized data so
given this data we're going to run
through some processing pipeline and
this is the processing pipeline that I
use this is part of the audio msn audio
processing pipeline where I make use of
the aec acoustic
cancellations clock this is my main blog
that's going to split out what what this
is my main projects the goal is to put
spit out this even if coming signal but
I have acoustic echo cancer this 3 run
is coming from reference signals coming
from the speaker Phi are going to be
used for this block I also make use of
the boy activity detector for the
doubter chains the previous site of this
CID and the reason is that the addition
of thumb that I am rewriting on to
suppress reverberations reflections yeah
so the evaluation criteria that I have
our absolute angle area where you just
take the tech what I compute some
overall frequency just too I marginalize
now the noise in the frequency domain so
this term it's going to be depending on
the data and the hypothesis one only and
i'll pick the maximum angle and that
going to be compared gains in absolute
distance against the theoretical one the
next one that i have is the true what i
call to probability mass so because i
compute this probability so after I sub
mobile frequency again just like a last
time I can I can take the amount master
phone within epsilon plus minus epsilon
up a grouchy wango and that's going to
be my criteria the last one I want to
show is the execution time normal I
execution time because the execution
time is computed matlab so it doesn't
make sense to shoulder the actual number
so i'm just going to show the normalized
versions to compare the run time between
algorithms so here the first set of
results this is the first criteria
absolute angle error and these are the
difference algorithms that we have so
the violet going to be ideal way the
blue is I do a to the science is GCC fan
Green is valid orange this music and
then yellow is MPD
the y-axis is angora absolute angle
error AIE so there's not much we can see
from this but besides the fact that I do
I to overall four configurations overall
snr actually do not very bad like quite
close to MPD are quite close to ballot
to better than music so let's practice
our further to see what else can we see
so let's practice in 24 for craps home
so the first one up here is for the key
neck this guy over here linear for Lemon
array I know there's a lot of
information but let's just focus on one
at a time that's just this buffer and
then we go to the open so for this one
you see between the algorithms like I'll
you ate two were pretty close i do it
one and the angle is pretty good like
less than 15 degree i believe yeah and
pretty much everyone's perform well at
least on this data set and this is irish
overall snr so yeah so that's not much
nothing surprised about that i guess now
now if we go to a element
omnidirectional you see that I this is
the i do I to significantly improve i do
81 and this is the face no issue that i
talk about so when you do the modulation
to pour the noisy point far away closer
and then compute a distance you can the
wrong angle can also do the same thing
so not only the two ango can pull the
pipe closer but the wrong angle can also
point so you're going to see like this
high arrow is because you have the look
sometimes you get the correct angle but
the other times you get the one that has
very far away and I wish Oh Irish
overall different data session recording
sessions then you get high error um
this phase unwrapping things partial
face and wrapping things have produced
an error from idy 22 here and one thing
to I I so sanity check is that GCC fat
going to be like going to be dropping
these configurations just because it's
meant to be done there's no this guy
have no significant magnitude difference
so GCC fat going to try them on this now
if we go to the circular a cardioid
they're like directional microphone
you're going to see the first things I
so sanity check is DCC fat gonna fail
miserably because it's deliberate throw
out the magnitude difference not even
mad with absolute magnitude both
absolute magnitude and magnitude
difference so MPD are invalid and what
cap like very good because they they
have the data correlation matrix that
keep the signal give the signal power
music actually throw away when you do
the sub Spidey compositions actually
doesn't use the diagonal elements so it
works but not too bad and here the
hypothesis that we have earlier is that
um incorporating magnitude would help so
this kind of proof that that hypothesis
is true because if it didn't then we
would perform pretty like x beta is GCC
fat or something if they're different in
magnitude didn't have so I fight is to
figure quite telling because they show
first is that the face and wrapping
actually help compared to I deal with
one and the second thing is
incorporating the magnitude difference
actually have compared to ccc fan for
this further front to back we were
hoping that by incorporating magnitude
because they are the two elements are
very close together we were hoping that
incorporating magnitude will have and
they actually did but not very
significant and all met up pretty much
perform fully on this device
configurations
now let's let's break down further into
like different national to see if the
stories to home and so different SNL
like higher lower the the x-axis r SN on
the y-axis again iie absolute angle
error so you see here I at highest and
now this is pretty much perfect everyone
would love please the worst case just 15
degree error and the stories to whole
like pretty much everyone to perform
around the same level for only again um
so GCC fat is some pie pan but because
again i do is not this is a DK i would i
do i won produce quite high error but
this is because this just random chance
went when you do the 250 it's actually
pick out some of the signal in the right
angle but because it's also picking all
the things i do I to fix that problem
and same here GCC arm fat hi um error
incorporate magnitude difference help um
this Cara help a little bit so I can
yeah is your estimation output like 36
degree or is your 218 yeah that's an
excellent question so for this one for
the linear connect I assume that like
nobody gonna stand behind a connect and
talk so I do the night 180 degree the
front for another one the evaluations
for 360 so I assume that this absolute
angle arrow is an every job multiple
fidelity sessions yeah what does
marriage 90-degree arrow means um yeah
that's that's a very 12 arm so pretty
much all of ice going to produce a
router it doesn't mean that the error is
ski over to certain angle or something
so that they are pretty much around the
same
thing that's certain bias toward zero
because if you know nothing then I do
eight to ten to produce 0f haggar white
because
yeah just because they the zero sorry
it's time to put my ass the word and
whatever angle that is have zero phase
magnitude difference but other than that
the arrow is pretty much uniform yeah
does that answer your questions it's not
a deviation its minute they're right so
thank you if it's like if it was like
the range of like 0 to 180 then mean of
90-degree need is like a problem you
know very distributed but it's 36
degrees oh I need to think about what it
means about like the average 90 so yeah
so when you have like let me get to the
park when you have light the actual
block with their show pictures when you
have 360 yeah so now let's look at the
just 46 on the front back which has the
largest Elvis so what's up country point
pointing called the barrack and well
sub-grantee pointing to the frogs in the
distance is couple of millimeters not
much phase difference plus the
microphone a there is no way to tell are
you on the left or on the right side the
best we can hope is we can distinguish
the P states from back inside I see but
that's 90 degree that exchange that yes
there is no way to go more precise than
that okay yeah I guess I'm such as I
want to censor my place your questions
yeah thank you for that so now we look
at something different so picking the
max cap light um shady I mean not shady
but like let's not capture everything so
what what about the TPM like to
probability mass so again let's just
look at the aggregate air arm to protein
mask first and in this case hanger is
better so it's the reverse of
out of work case the colors for the
angular must do the same sohag is better
seems like GCC fed do pretty well over
all right and like everything else just
kara so these two do pretty well too but
I'm surprised because this is the
federal way to face difference and that
the magnitude difference the magnitude
informations and was about to do high
solar yeah go ahead sorry is this saying
that that prefers keep your
distributions that they school yeah I
was about to go to a break now and it
would be with pbc head okay okay yes
just a conclusion Bartlett will slide
the steerage punch power right music and
then PB are they going to use the data
covariance matrix music seems to be
linked consider being more than and you
gather to awesome your previous examples
right well is that so um so me I yeah so
music also throw away the magnitude
informations you by done because this
when you do the eigenvalue decomposition
still Nikita the eigenvector that
corresponding to the strongest again
value so when I'm and went like the
whole definition up Oh
the definition of music is like um you
do this because you hope that the signal
the signal sub spy and the noises I
gonna be orthogonal it doesn't carry any
lie arm informations about it doesn't
try to compute a signal power lie in pd
a-- so it treat reflection reverberation
the same a signal so and n reflections
can be very far away from there to the
to direct path signal you buy them so
this actually compute the signal power
the angle that has the mode signal power
and that also imply that light that
direct pack gonna be white stronger than
the refractory reverberations so sorry
maybe I missed something so these
examples you presented with hunt that
had a strong source included class
reflections in the result you you should
yeah the day doesn't have everything the
real data okay would you have reflection
reverberation here global agency now it
yep design it for localization of
sources using containers which can swell
less noise well better much ink of the
channels were less reverberation and
actually it was quite well in acoustics
if you are one meter away that's fine
hello development environment fine from
the moment you have more evaporation of
Lois's g-spot
well then unless it's considered put the
ultimate sound source localization
algorithms well yeah we can talk apply
about this but I believe that not now I
come to believe that this so you divide
one over that term in music and you
expect that time to be 0 and then
produce a very sharp X but that's that's
a big theoretical we should go to
infinity but it doesn't mean anything
like but it doesn't mean like this is
signal power this is how strong a signal
it's just me nervous yeah yeah and I
said something I learned is that I
actually very important when you do
localizations because you don't want to
localize reverberation and reflections
yeah so if you break down the error then
what you see is that um so these are
percentage the how much probability
master phone into the right reasons
we've been epsilon up a crowd to angle
and that epsilon in my case is d5 to be
five degree pretty much everyone doing
pretty good about the same thing here up
here 25 14 of the mass phone into the
right reason Rick region on Irish
overall answer now so GCC fed as um as
you know produce very shopping when it
actually made the assumption on the
model actually fit there the reality
then that's why it produces a very high
put a lot of mass into the right reason
and the streets the reason why on Irish
you see take out in the previous slide
this guy not so we're for directional
microphone here one dollar cow formatted
signal and signal method to signal power
is going to be tried we do pretty cool
in here but because this guy actually
account for magnitude so it's everyone
is poor this guy is this poor
it's out yeah back to the slides you
show the overall like average arrow and
what these four types for very moment
yeah maybe one more slice yeah sorry
so do a two as a average angle arrow of
light 10 degrees but it's yeah cardio
cardio right and if we go to that true
then go probability there's only four
percent falling within five degrees
right that means this as a very narrow
right hand yeah exactly so this is the
deficiency up I am I do a to this up is
not very like picky but remember about a
sub sub sub max tricks that I mentioned
earlier when when when you normalize you
can actually try out for how much you
want the pics to be sharp and how how
you want whether you want to see the
other side side arm directions so i can
actually go back so i believe if you
optimize for this angle you can put you
can make a DOA to put more mass into
just like this just change this free
degree of freedom to put my amassing i
just didn't put much effort into like
trying to make it show yeah yeah thanks
that's that's a very good catch though I
almost forget to mention that yeah and
if you break it down further across snr
then there's the stories to still remain
true you see this guy drive this is not
very good this does not put a lot of
massing at the right place but overall I
the two hypotheses that we want to test
is incorporating magnitude does help and
yeah this this is not not good in you so
now let's go to execution times this is
the one of the most important thing I've
been driving me to develop this simple
model that suppose we walk away from a
lot of configurations so this is again
there's a very big pictures you see
music cause a lot up due to the
eigenvalue decomposition the maître
conversions quite consumed choir lung
normalize this is um so the y axis is
normal I normalized execution time own
name that's how I call so maximum going
to be one everything is going to be less
than 1 so I do I to does increase some
computational times but not too much
still less than the other meta if we
break it down into the number of channel
so these two microphone have the same
number of channels so computational cost
would be the same so I group them
together this have for element you have
to channel two elements so pretty much
the things through hole except this is
the mystic in the evaluation that I had
and I bank cash this so this is also
included initialization time and for the
two element there's not much like online
computations but because we ship all
share the fixed initialization time so
this is why they are pretty much the
same but I guess it will be useful to
see that light anyway is not messing
there's some initialization time costs
associated tattoo but if you something
like refine my channel have no channel
require more processing online then
overall the initializations I'm going to
be marginalized now and you're going to
see the performance internal name or
execution time so again I go ahead so
two four and eight channels will be nice
to see normalize that lets say we want
to be eight channels in to see those
Hawkins's function of the number of
channels all the nice know how this
kayla is this linear with the number of
channels on quadratic right oh yeah
built up or fourth order yep yeah I
should have them done that's a very good
point is so um again to let their i have
no proof in my presentations but i have
a demo video not gonna both gonna try to
back up my use of a simple model
try to replace the proof so we have we
did a lifetime or the other day yeah
Canelo two days maybe of 2050 so this is
angle incoming angle so for for the key
necklaces from minus the ninety to
ninety this is a long frequency this is
me I've on gonna show up some point
around here go to here and then go here
so so me talking is 45 degree pretty
much around here then you you should
expect to see something pop up when I
one start talking and then it's moving
to move around here and then go to hear
what one left of the video is right on
the tenth trip the video yeah yeah um so
yeah this is sly outings between the
upper video in slo-mo video so yeah so
look for the yellow pics when when I
went around the time I one start talking
so that would make it easier my name is
Lola and I with my mentor i vant a chef
here for you through thirsty thirsty
thirsty numerical system testing room to
throw our projects which are amazing
work LOL a sister state impunity for my
name is Ahmed and our you
think there's time i watch generally we
need to bursting there's any more about
project special for immunity yep so the
connect probably you have already seen
it so it's not very surprising let's see
the next one okay well walk from behind
he named to the front of kidney I didn't
see it going over like 90 degree hello
today's August it's a 4-3 2015 my name
is ugly and I will find that I am here
for you conclude the stinkers
interesting ability to sleep thirsty
want to close our project special Roman
is equal killer invades your first
christian unity for my name is Lana and
I will you create restrictor stable
earth shattering we need the bursting to
see more about project special
probability do you get an indication I
didn't see in the in the video but yeah
we can we can talk about it offline what
I was anticipating is that when given
thoughts behind the inside reflection
maybe maybe it was like recognize at 45
degree or a minus 45 degree but when
even moves to the side of connecting
should be like minus 90 degree but we
didn't c minus 90 degree going up run
all houses you're really even have the
linear array if you have the linear
array of organizational microphones 10
degrees in this direction should be seen
as 10 degrees here I but those
microphones are highly directional so my
guess is that once I go back the
intensity of playing voice you sold all
that you can but we cannot see it is
messy than latex you know what's awesome
sauce we were listening to me nana level
what what microphone was listening to
what would we listening to you oh the
lounger is there from the come from oh
so nothing to be connected to an awesome
oh yeah um yeah I'll get that get back
to that question for you destined to
become so now he's tell me so cool
a'ight LMAO me hello my name is Tomlin
and today's august 15 chagas 18 2015 I'm
good my mentor I bought a share to
google more power project special
probability hello while three others
think they stink want to treat it 2000
PP 1 2 3 2's my name is Emily and it
might want to treat their stomata shapes
the spoon want to demo our test your
ability okay i'm 22 years to sell the
resource my name is Larry dressed
resonating i'm going to three system it
will swing swing so if you didn't catch
that um I think that's the slide
mishmash like the pic star before you
start talking um you want to play that
again yeah would you like you need to
play that again a knowledge that okay
and finally for this hello today's
August 18 2015 my name is Lumley MK with
my mentor I want a chef to do a demo out
spending a simple interesting allowed to
today's able to traders ingliston equal
to three my name is lumpley indistinct I
think 103 mi still interesting we are
needed to do in a southeastern
especially okay what would reduce the
listing the day in August when you click
a stickler see ya nothing like yeah I'm
at likely thanks first um I one cuz I
he's been very helpful with I Hispanic
vice and everything he's been having me
a lot I came in without much light audio
experience but I he wasn't work than I
just point out things like when I have a
problem I come to him in this five
second he solve it I pretty much time
with a cost that was amazing and I'm
like like um thanks everyone in our
groups for the cool chat about audios
and none audio stuff too yeah so
everyone in our group is really great
and also like huge thanks to you guy
product teams that was a provide me the
data provide me in size about how to be
about the data it's like Jesse's Ambani
a sec just been wonderful so thank you
guys and I put everyone in here in the
product team I hope I didn't miss anyone
also like the whole Microsoft reaches
and Microsoft in general community is a
wonderful community with the right
summer for me yeah okay you missed one
yeah first assignment for you into the
ship and pay for it Christian's
colleagues yeah questions me Tom so yeah
all right I said one question about the
GCC fat I'm sure how well it did on the
eight element on me but it didn't do
well on the cardioid uh-huh there should
be just as much phase information
both of those right and if they were
ideal cardioid elements so I was curious
why you thought the GCC fat did so poor
I'm the circular hard way yeah that's
actually any good questions um in the
back of the back across your face is so
unstable there you see if you have a
perfect conjured shape yes there is no
face lips but you have the money on
going down 20 30 DB and one top of
doesn't know it's the face of the noises
other thing is right performs there his
active the paper from key persons here
in Microsoft Research working on the
mountable device images able to two
phases first just referring to see where
is the microphone and then he groped of
the wiper false which are facing with
the back to the sound source and
bullying the precision jumps so the back
again plus if it goes in clips to her
even slightly supercar do it for the
angle of the back the fray the face is
flipped 180 degrees which makes it
easier more calm so do you may expect
some more frequency ranges when you have
off trains flipped 180 degrees and it's
not cannot be bothered perfectly dr.
flips the activity pattern calls from
some currently to come to a foreign
country and in backward so unless you
use measure of directivity buttons yeah
so yeah thnkx five ankara um so remember
i mentioned about this up this actually
this reference this up this paper here
actually talk about how you should throw
white face for directional microphone
and i did that for all this method but i
didn't do that for the TCC fan so you
check for good face respond first before
you admit it I didn't do
for TCC fan so suffice coming from the
back microphones horrible so that the
light with general we see some
interesting kind it's a lot of frequency
access so i just wonder we you carefully
to the probability of s do you take into
account any frequency dependence a
factor instead of whoever Ginsu the for
the frequency axis right so the
smoothing along frequency axis is only
for evaluations right they are put is to
two-dimensional things that is over
angle and frequency yeah um there's no
attainment trying to smooth out in the
frequency domain because I would treat
that ice post processing and I just
focus on that single frame evaluation
thing you can alway do some capitalized
smoothing post-processing later yeah
your head okies so another question
because I missed something so the state
vector in all your algorithms was coming
from model are a you didn't have actual
measurements of your devices your true
aries so you did not have a measured
steering back to that you could probably
improve their performance by the lot you
just sent approximately 80 need extra
microphones were able idea calculate
microphones according to the
specification which may have been a bit
far from reality so the in their data
that the diagram Jessie and vanished
ship to me this information about the
inertness XY coordinate this location of
the microphone so the model is more than
just circular a 10-1 choose geometry
under the final yes yeah yeah sure it's
an amazing diffusion it's not something
so january sure it's not so generic
that's a separate I I just met as a
school like for shop I know exactly how
come on what is the distance between
the microphone here today oh yeah yeah
but but I think for each others body
they're scattering body that will change
by the notes with the direction up
Varitek original punish the sensors they
are all assume that I know can be
microphones and they are definitely not
yeah I wanted that one did a clinical
partner changes with the right way see
ya so especially these ah moves I know
that an accurate description of the
state vector will make a big difference
so they are quite sensitive deviations
of the stealing vector we having to the
modern right the subspace methods have a
beautiful jungle yeah at least from a
product standpoint we often can't rely
on having those models steering vectors
so it's good to see how the I do a two
by including magnitude was so much more
robust 20 students this was nice to see
ya i can talk a lot more about thing
that I tried like more complicated model
that I try I mean that's gonna take a
lot of time but turn now in the end
something simple the simplest things
work robust because you just make no
assumptions about everything in the
rework my seems to be very chaotic in
this case the slide with the angle error
in degrees ok this one so guys in this
particular case Pollock is in enormously
inform the most impatient he has to
produce angle for every single frame
regardless of the magnitude of the human
speech and regardless of the noise this
is why those numbers are relatively high
in the actual subs or vocalizer when the
moment we take is probably can see that
there is not any HP which is throw away
the frame they can goes to clustering so
our some sauce vocalizer is 3 45 degrees
precision standard deviation so it is
enough reliable to point the beam to the
we have the sound source but obviously
if you feed this whole selection and
clustering engine with a better p of
delta will have better results after
that so this is why the angles looks
enormously high i'm pretty sure if you
run this tomorrow some socializer now
those numbers you'll cross quite
acceptable quite acceptable levels yeah
and the quantization levels five degree
so this is to take away so 10 degree air
on my south side with quantization for
computational purpose and thank you for
that explanation to you know you can do
post processing to blue please yeah
further any more questions so let's take
