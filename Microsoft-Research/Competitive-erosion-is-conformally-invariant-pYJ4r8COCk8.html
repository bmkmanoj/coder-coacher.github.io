you
right good afternoon we're happy to have
Shendu ganguly tell us about competitive
erosion thank you all so yeah so I'll be
talking about something called
competitive erosion which is a competing
particle system on crafts and the tab
will be based on joint work with the
Lana Louisville and Jim and Saleh yeah
okay so all right so suppose the model
so so justify it's just like I said it's
a it's a competing particle system so
you have two kinds of particles and you
have some interaction and so to define
the process you need some underlying
data so what do you need so you need to
find it graph G I like it does not have
to be finite so you need some graph G
save with vertex set V and E and that's
at E and and you need to probability
measures mu1 and mu2 on the set of
vertices so so you have a graph you have
two measures mu1 and mu2 on the set of
vertices and you need an integer K
between one and so suppose the graph as
size n then you need an integer between
1 and say n minus 1 so you have a graph
you have two measures any of a number K
and informally this process will be a
Markov chain on all K subsets of the
vortexes so you have this crap V you
have this number K so you look at all
subsets of V of size K and formally this
process is going to be a Markov chain of
this state space so so to define this so
I need to define how to get st st was my
process so i need to define how to get
st plus 1 from st it's like this is what
we are going to do for the rest of the
task so think of all the vertices as
having the two colors red and blue and
so k was my size of st so think of st
being the set of blue vertices so there
k vertices are going to be blue and the
rest of them are going to be red and so
stuff to define how to get st plus 1
from st so what I do is so sta size K so
what I do is I add one point which is XT
and i subtract one point which is YT I
will define what those are ok so yeah so
so so first have to add one point XD so
i have this two measures mu1 and mu2 so
so what I do is I start a random walk on
the graph with initial starting
distribution you want and then I wait
till it hits this complement of st so
sts Ice King I start my random walk and
look at the first side which is now red
which it hits and that I include in my
set st so st union xt is now says set of
size k plus 1 and now like subtract of
one more element to get the right size
so i have this other measure that i can
still work with which is mewtwo so i
start a random book with initial
distribution mewtwo and and like wait
till it hits the existing set of size k
plus one or the blue vertices and then
in the first side that it hits i remove
it so i have ki added one point it
became k plus 1 and then i removed
another point so i'm back to the set of
size K and so this was introduced by Jim
in around two thousand three and so come
back to some of the motivations later so
so the example so there were an example
which will make this definition clear ok
so so here is a very basic graph of size
six and and k is three so so all the
blue vertices are the set st and now in
this example mu1 and mu2 which were my
starting distributions are just point
masses at these two points so think of
this as mu 2 and think of this as mu 1
so first I started I number from mu 1 so
it does some random box a pix this edge
so it's already hitting st compliment in
the first step so I make this blue so 3
became four and then i have to like
start one more random book from here
suppose it picked this edge say still on
the red cluster and then in the next
step it hits the blue side so this will
turn red and said one step i became a
went from this configuration to this
configuration so the number of blue
points remain the same but they moved
around a bit so is the definition clear
of the process ok good so so this was a
very general example and now we will
sort of see an example of a graph which
will really care about during this talk
and so this is a
a disk of radius 30 and every vertex is
colored independently red and blue with
probability of one third and soul number
of breads is two-thirds fraction of the
total body says so every vertex is
colored blue or red with probability one
third and two third independently I mean
so there's some shading if you say yes
or yes it's some pixel and and mime you
one and you two are for this example
just a point not pull on the South Pole
so my blue random but we'll start from
so think of this as in the complex plane
and if this is the unit disk it will
start from minus I and the red random
but we'll start from I ok so let's see
how this looks so see there is some the
blue vertices are getting him
accumulating at the blue source and the
red ones are getting accumulating with
the red source and run for some time so
let me go ahead ok so yeah so so you see
that they have come close to each other
and and ok of course there's some
particles the here which is still yet
typical or dread but now they're done
and so you have this like two different
regions of blue and red and then this is
boundary or interface between them and
it's sort of like not very deviating
like it's very it's roughly smooth of
course the size is just 30 so you can
make it more and more then it will see
even smoother pictures so the interface
is not very fluctuating and and also you
see what the shape of the interface it
is like right so you can already guess
what this looks like there are some
fluctuations but roughly is not a
straight line roughly looks like an
orthogonal circular arc right it might
be clear might not be but
okay so good so so this was the general
example then we saw the example on the
disk and now some background and
motivation so so there is some
similarities with a very very basic
fundamental growth model which is known
as the internal DLA where they are just
there is just one particle involved so
so you have you have a graph and you
just try to see how a set of particles
sort of grow with time so you just have
this one version so so I T is your
cluster at time T and to get I T plus 1
from I tu so you have just so you now
have just one distribution you want you
start a random up with distribution mu 1
and you wait till it exists the cluster
IT you have one more point that you add
to your side so so I time deepti the
size of the cluster is exactly so you
keep growing by one at every time step
ok and so this was first proposed by I
think me keenan Dacian around 86 as a
model for several chemical processes
like a George all right thanks
electropolishing corrosion and yeah and
and and later like so there's a notion
of addition of sets which was invented
by darkness and fulton and this turned
out to be a special case of that and
this was done around 91 okay so this is
like a one particle version of that so
and popularly this is done on the square
lattice 0 and mu 1 you should think of
in this example as being the drachma the
origin so I'm going to always start my
particular the origin and and look at
what happens on the square lattice so
the first particle stays at the origin
because there was nothing there so the
cluster at time 1 is just the origin
then I start one more random box suppose
it picks this edge so you have these two
points at time to you keep doing this
you have size 3 and size for so
something like this so at time T you
will have exactly two vertices on the
lattice that you are occupying ok so so
there's one more
okay so this is an ideal a cluster
growing on the square lattice and this
will run for this is about like three
thousand particles so you see that it's
a roughly isotropic so it's almost
circular and there is some still not
circular yet but like if you run this
for long enough it will be and and and
and the boundary is something that has
some fluctuations but not much ok so
it's roughly growing like a ball okay so
so some comments about this process is
so so like like I said so ideal at time
T is exactly of size T so if your graph
is finite then and up sighs and then I
deal is not interesting anymore after
time n so it's usually studied on
infinite crafts and questions that
people ask her about what the synthetic
cluster shape is like and once you
understand that well then you can ask
find our questions about what the
boundary is what are the fluctuations
yeah so you can ask what the cluster is
weather is like a ball and what the
boundaries once you understand the first
question whereas erosion makes sense on
a finite graph for all the times and
it's the mark of tune so you can ask bit
all the way see questions about Markov
chains are still relevant in this
setting so you can ask what its
equilibrium measure is like what is the
mixing time etcetera okay so some some
references to what has been known about
ideal is so the first rigorous proof of
the fact that this actually looks like a
ball in some sense was by lala Bramson
in Griffith around 92 and they showed
that if a cluster has size n then the
right radius you look at is are such
that pi r square is n because you want
to conserve area and they showed that
the ball is within our 1 minus up to
multiplicative factor of 1 plus minus
epsilon the ball is going to be within
that cluster with high probability but
then subsequent improvements were made
like first by lover himself and then two
groups one including Lana's car
individualism and the rather come there
was another competing group and and
eventually so there is now very very
precise
yeah he said Scott there may be more
than once Carly yeah right salon 11
Scott shuffle and David garrison in one
group the other group was a cylinder da
and and now they sort of really
understand what the even not just order
of the fluctuations but what the scaling
limit is so this very precise
understanding of this process and and
and this another setting which is even
more relevant to the case that we are
talking about is when you have ideal a
but like there are now multiple
particles so you have you still have
saved the internet craft so you have
infinite room but there are still
particles of various kinds which are
trying to occupy your spot so so for
example like suppose so the idea that I
was starting my particles only from the
origin but now you can say pick two
points a minus one and one and they say
alternately like emmett weight and blue
particles from them they was not try to
kill each other once they meet if a red
mitsuba then it will keep walking till
it finds an empty side she was all
dressed up when you find an empty side
and so here is a picture of what that
ideally with two source look like so the
center of the disk are the sources and
um it this particles and the color sort
of represent the points that the
particles came from so you have this two
sources so the purple and the green are
the places where the particles only from
the center of the disk occupied and in
the intersection and the outside you
will have particles from both colors so
there is some yeah I'm like so there are
some rules about I'm like so the
particles are exchangeable so once both
particles land here you can choose which
one you want to like make work again
make them work again so so the red and
the sky blue portion are regions where
you will have particles from both
sources coming so here you can some
potential these are the two regions that
he will have you can have particles from
both sources occupying while Cheers
because so there so if you omit the end
particles from here and particles from
here they will so you can first make
them work they will like work like
independent ideally so they will have
this two balls so the overlap of the
sites will be exacting the intersection
and then you can choose which one you
want to like make them walk again
because this has typically will have now
two particles right
watch what's the difference being light
blue well no no so there is no diff
numbers there is no difference in the
sense that if you run ideally
independently they were forced out so
depending on what time you occupy the
sides okay yes generating the to source
cluster in certain quarters first to
make the one source cluster then you
make another one source buster and then
you take care of your laps yeah so
depending on what time you occupy the
side this will yeah but but potentially
because the particles are exchangeable
you can like just does not matter which
particle is occupying which side okay so
this is still on the infant graph and
give to sources and now we will sort of
switch back to erosion and and so we
define diversion on Gino press but now
we will further a shove the tail we will
talk about very special crafts which is
sort of approximations of smooth domains
so like the disc you discretize you then
and I will define what smooth means in
order doc and at this one I should also
remark that we studied this process on a
on a similar but different setting with
gman liners of the tuck the main result
of this step will be joined with you
well but this is different but we let
the setting which set is the same
process and that was joined with Lanigan
gym as well ok so what is the setting so
so think of a smooth domain by smooth I
will mean something which I will state
precisely and and look at the
discretization of the domain using some
very fine mesh so say one over n z2 in
so think of this as being embedded in
the complex plane and look at the
intersection with 1 over n c2 and look
at the part of the graph inside it by
which I mean all the edges that are
completely inside it so all the points
which are in the interior of the domain
and the adjacent induced by them and the
and the class of domain that you will
work with will have analytic boundaries
which means they have local parses
expansions and equivalently like the
Riemann mapping theorem guarantees that
these domains will have maps going to
the disc because these are simply
connected domain Zen and in and in fact
the boundary will be so smooth that the
maps sort of will have electric
extensions across the boundary and and
for the moment at least so the setting
will be still like you the sources will
be like still point masses on the
boundary so you have a domain take two
points X 1 and X
the boundary there will be roughly your
sources and the graph will be the
intersection of this with a fine mesh of
course it's still like little informal
because this points need not be lattice
points and the grid not lie in the graph
but like roughly this is gonna be the
setting extend to an open set that
contains yeah so yeah so you have this
domain you and the desty so there are
open says you won and Devon containing
you and these other the confirm you want
to give unrestricted okay good so all
rights in summary if the setup is the
graph is you n which is you intersection
1 over n c2 and so now I have to give a
number K right so far erosion I needed a
graph I needed two measures and I need
in the number K which was a set of size
of the blue blue cluster so this is
going to be a constant fraction of the
number of vertices so I fixed an alpha
between 0 and half and and number of
blue vertices will be alpha times the
size of the graph so that's going to be
the setting and again like it said me
one a mutual roughly like this direct
measures but they still need not be
lattice point so okay so the basic
question is how does the blue region
look once you run this chain for long
enough stand with your sources x1 and x2
so so on the disk we saw that the blue
what is a set of accumulating is the
blue source and similar to the red
vertices and there was some interface
and the limiting interface like it was
roughly like an optimal circular arc and
and the basic question is what is the
truth functional domains so so what
happens for general domains and so there
is some connection to this process the
reflected Brownian motion which I will
make like more precise later but like
and it's sort of well known that
conformably reflected Brownian motion is
conformal invariance so and here we were
talking about affected one emotion with
normal reflection and so this led to the
conjecture by gene which is that
understanding the process in the dis
sort of surfaces that if you want to
understand that what the process looks
like on a general domain I me like so
the final picture should be just
image of the final picture on the disk
under some map now one common that I
want to make here is remember that the
blue was like a fraction of the total
region and conformal maps do not
preserve area so it is so why don't you
make precise what this means so but
roughly a picture like this should be
true was the conjecture and and the goal
of this truck is to show that this is
true so are there any questions about
the because there is yes so we will see
what we will see what we prove and then
yeah so so so the flux so the interface
is a because of honest even prove that
there is an interface I'm like so right
so your question is whether the
properties of the interface also carries
over right so first one has to prove
that there is an interface so that is
not provable at this point so if we
don't know how to prove that I mean I
said we don't know how to prove that
yeah yeah yeah that exactly a picture
like this is true that there is an so
everything you do and everything and so
there is a particular interface and that
carries over the initial state could be
just like a checkerboard wind blew and
there's no well-defined interface all
right you have to show that over time
you move toward something where there
does appear to be anything you say
necklace and you saying is this time in
the top or the yeah no savia you seem so
we will see what exactly the main result
is and then it will so we'll see what
exactly the main result is and what it
exactly confirms and then we will see
this is no work to the jar and sure is
going right okay so so the modified
settings also so throat till now we were
talking about these two sources which
are points on the boundary but but like
there will be some convergence issues if
we will sort of take the message go to
zero and so so it will be technically
convenient and so the main result will
be sort of in this setting where instead
of having point masses the the two
random Vox mu1 and mu2 will be sort of
uniform measures on small disk so you
have this points x1 and x2 you want it
we wanted to start random work from
1 and x 2 but but for technical settings
like we will take to disk of radius at
delta your x1 and x2 + mu 1 and mu T
will be uniform measures on all lattice
points in hoods this so fix a small
delta take two disks and look at all
that responds inside them and the random
up we'll start uniformly from those same
clothes and also it just yeah so this
yeah so this is a smooth domain so you
can fix a small delta and then you can
choose for any delta small enough you
can choose discs which are say a
distance delta x 2 from the boundary and
has also radius a delta x 4 or something
okay so so instead of starting from
points we will start from this small yes
and then the main result will sort of
involve sending the message to 0 the
size of the messages were followed by
sending delta 20 so that we empirically
sort of recovered this point sources
okay so we need some notation so so you
have the disk unit disk with this two
points I n minus I and you have this
journal domain with arbitrary points x1
and x2 on the boundary so so the remand
mapping theorem guarantees that there
are exists conformal maps going from the
disk to this domain so that I is sent to
X 2 and minus i sent to X 1 and Phi and
I are going to be inverses of each other
and just what mentioning that there is
no unique search appear so because map
is uniquely determined oh if I specify
the values at three points so here i am
just specifying the values at two points
and so this is actually a family of such
maps so I'll just choose something
arbitrarily n yeah ok so and and so now
so so for the disks i had this article
circular arc and they sort of have this
sort of equation so they turn out to be
level set of this function log z minus I
over c plus I so every or thermal
circular which is symmetric with respect
to minus AI ni will be the set of Z
inside the disks as that this is equal
to beta for some beta on the real line
and now I want to define a corresponding
thing for a general domain you so I just
transfer by the conformal map so serve
this disk
this is the ortho circular corresponding
to beta I call this region D beta and
may just look at the composition with
respect to file so which will give me
corresponding region son on the general
to menu and and note that this
parameterization of beta depends on this
conformal map so this was what the value
of this function on the geodesic on this
curve is and however were interested in
area right so we started with Alfred
fraction of the idea being blue so you
want to sort of find the beta which
gives you alpha fraction of the area so
so this we call u alpha is you betta for
the value of beta which has fraction
alpha of the area as beta goes from
minus infinity to infinity you covered
the whole region so you can find such a
beta and like I said so this area is not
preserved so V of D alpha is not
necessarily you alpha of course for a
particular value of alpha can choose
your fee to be such that this is true
but there's not all simultaneously for
all alpha yeah so this is going to be my
you alpha so I pick my beta so that the
fraction is Alfred ok and I need my last
notation so I'm interested about the set
of blue vertices I I want to pass from
the set of vertices to the region so I
look at union of all boxes around the
blue points so I have this set of blue
points on my graph I look at all boxes
of size 1 over n which is centered at
this points and and this is the
statement of the main result which says
that so you have to set u alpha you have
the set of blue vertices you look at the
region version of that because the
symmetric difference and take its area
and and the expectation of that under
the stretchy measure of the stain sort
of will go to 0 if you send the mesh
size 20 followed by delta going 2-0 see
if this blue region here take the box
version which is a region on the plane
take the symmetric and you have this
region you alpha which we just defined
take the symmetric difference look at
his expectation and then that goes to 0
if you send n to infinity followed by
delta 20
however there is some technical
requirement so we sort of need n to go
along powers of 2 to infinity and and
this is because some of the proofs here
rely heavily on the fact that random
work on this graphs UN converter
affecting Brownian motion on the domain
you and and and the results that are
known in the literature uses a fact that
that thought of convergence is true only
if any static power of two of course a
person is spoken to the co-authors of
time related to the authors of this
paper and they and they sort of believe
that is true for the entire sequence and
but but the result that appeared in the
literature uses his assumption that n is
like 2 to the K so in words roughly if
the sources are small enough which means
Delta is very small then if the message
goes to 0 then the as stationarity the
blue region looks like the set u alpha
in the sense of symmetric difference so
the area of the symmetric difference is
small so that's roughly the statement
will be resolved so is this clear what
those what the theorem is proving okay
so so a remark here which might not be a
purely clear is that this chain has a
well-defined stationary measured so it's
not a reducible but still there is one
recurrent class so you can still well
define the stationary measure and also
because it is a finite system even that
equilibrium most of the time it will
look like that there is an interface and
the interface is sort of like this image
of the circular arc which is the
geodesic there will be a positive
fraction of time where it will look
something very weird so I mean like it
does not have to look like this always
because it is a finite system so this
has positive probability of happening so
it will sort of happen like a positive
fraction of times even though x berry
small probability ok all right so these
are some of the initial comments and and
so now let's see why one can expect this
to be true why you can expect the
interface to be like a geodesic so if
there was an interface then it should
have some stability property that so red
random walk would start from the top and
like it will stop benefits of loop side
and similarly a blue random
start from the bottom and so if this
interface has to stay in place for every
point roughly the the push from both
sides should cancel each other out right
so and and the push is nothing but the
harmonic measure starting a random up
from here right so you start a random up
from here you look at the chance that it
hits this point and that should sort of
agree from both sides this is one of the
properties that you I mean like if there
was some interface it should have a
property like this and ok so now first
we have to sort of find a candidate
which has this property so ok so so here
is where the conformal invariant
affecting brand emotion comes into play
so so so it will do not the geodesics
will have this property and a way to see
this is so you can think of Brownian
motion on the half plane ok so think of
reflected Mountain motion on the half
plane which is very easy to define and
and just by symmetry you can look at the
semicircles and the semicircles will
have this property that the harmonic
measure from dulce the suppose you start
running motion from the origin and look
at dating distribution of a semicircle
that will be uniform just by rotational
symmetry and similarly if you start
Brownian motion say from infinity
whatever that means from far away it was
also sort of hit the outside harmonic
measure will also be sort of uniform
right so for the half plane is very easy
to see just by symmetry and then because
path properties are Brownian motion
don't change in the conformal maps and
an images of semi circles if you take
the half into the disk the images of the
semicircle will exactly be this
geodesics and so it so so this fact that
is easy to show on on the half plane we
will sort of imply that even on the disk
the right curves which has this property
will be this geodesics it should be
perpendicular here yet yeah this is a
hand-drawn picture so yeah ok so so
geodesics have this property that
harmonic measures sort of cancel each
other out from both sides ok so this is
one can yet for the interface and now
you have some self correcting things so
if you have some other interface which
is not like a geodesic then you can
argue that the part which is below this
geodesic this blue curve say will have
net harmonic measure pushing it up so
the harmonic motion from the bottom will
actually exceed the home
measure from the top because this sort
of are equal on this geodesic so you can
argue that here they will sort of be
more from the bottom so there will burn
it up for pushing this part of the curve
and similarly net downward push on this
part of the core of all right so so if
you didn't have the Jurassic to start
with this sort of heuristic tells you
that you will sort of eventually sort of
push yourself to vertiginous it right so
those are some of the right candidates
now again like I said so interface the
notion of interface is not I'm Alexis
does not exist for all configurations
right so only if all the Blues are like
near the source of the blue source and
if all the red points are near the red
source they know you can sort of expect
to define an interface for example like
in a in a configuration like this so
even in this even in each source you
will have like both red and blue
particles so you can you can still
define an interface maybe but like it's
not like it will separate the two
sources right so if you have a small
disk here a part of it is read a part of
it is due and similarly the other side
so you will not have an interface which
sort of separates the two sources it was
sort of like it can cut through the
middle of a source right so so sort of
not take this approach directly but like
slightly different which sort of tries
to quantify this idea so that would sort
of involves something called the green
function which I will define in a bit
all right so here's one more sort of
heuristic in the same direction which is
ok so I will define what greens function
is in a moment but like let's just go
with this so it's well known that ok so
you have this graph here I'm still
working with the setting that there is
an interface even though I said that the
whole problem of making this formal was
because there was no interface right and
so you have this to you have this graph
and you're there are two regions say the
blue and the red and you can define
something called a green function on the
whole graph and on the two graphs in
individually so you can look at the blue
part can look at the green red part so
the two green function that you can
define and it will turn out that the
laplacian whatever so I will not so this
is like an informal thing she turns out
that the laplacian of the green function
here is the harmonic measure at this
point and similarly for the red one is
harmonic measures at this point and we
said that this interface should have the
property the harmonic measures should
cancel each other out
so so you will have some some condition
like this that so green the blue green
function which is a red green function
should have whiplash in zero need on the
boundary and of course they are also
harmonic in the blue part in the red
part individually except for the sources
so ignore the sources for the moment so
even so what you end up with this
difference of the green function is sort
of harmonic everywhere except these two
sources and and and the actual green
function on the whole graph also
satisfies the same property that is also
harmonic everywhere except the two
sources so the so this difference of
green function has the same laplacian
condition as this green function so you
have this so this is the green function
the whole graph this is the difference
of the green function they have the same
laplacian condition which means that the
difference is the harmonic function and
harmonic function on bonded graphs are
constant so these two so these are same
up to a constant which means and and I
notice that okay so I did not mention
this but like this to greens function
are also sort of vanishing so the blue
greens function sort of vanishes on the
red region and the red green function
sort of vanishes on the blue region so
so on the interface both of them are
sort of like 0 so you have this GN this
function is roughly like 0 on the
interface so Jean is roughly like a
constant on the interface and and the
blue region was one side of the
interface it's a reasonable to believe
that the set of blue sites is all points
where GN x is bigger than some constant
so Jane was constant on the interface on
one side it was bigger than the constant
on the other side if you're smaller than
the constant so roughly the blue region
should be occupying a level set of the
greens function ok good so so so these
are two heuristics sort of involving the
harmonic measure but this one uses
screen function and the fact that
derivatives of the green function are
like the harmonic measure near the
boundary ok good so this sort of gives
you an idea of what the blue region is
so it's a level set of a certain
function ok so all right so so now we
will state a quantitative version of the
main result which will imply this so we
have this result we said expectation of
some area was going to 0 if I took this
limb
and now we'll have a quantity version of
that result so needs some notation so
okay so look at all configurations which
is almost like what we want it to look
like so so there are only a few blue
particles in this region where if we
want it to be all red right so and this
and this quantifier is so you only allow
at most epsilon n square vertices of
this type which is in this region you
have for compliments and as blue color
or is in you alpha and has red color so
so at most epsilon n square particles
are colored opposite to what this should
be so they are separated from the
geodesic and an has the wrong color
because they are falling in the wrong
region okay so okay good and so for any
such configuration the blue region and
you alpha the symmetric difference is
that most has a day at most epsilon
because there are just epsilon n square
particles on the other side okay so if I
show that the measure of this set is
large then I am done right because I
want to show that the expectation of the
area goes to 0 and probability
expectation of the expedition of the
area goes to 0 it suffices you show that
this thing goes to 0 in probability area
of the symmetric difference goes to 0 in
Row okay so so this is the formal
statement so okay you can forget the
quantifiers so take a small Delta and
large n depending on epsilon then this
measure of this set Omega epsilon is 1
minus E power some some constant times n
square okay so so i have this epsilon
fixed then I for a small Delta N and
large enough the station measure of this
set is 1 minus exponentially small in n
square actually and then this article
impacts because this is epsilon this
arbitrary i will send epsilon 20 okay so
proving this surfaces okay so okay so so
the key tool used in the proof is
identification of a certain function so
so this is the this will have these two
properties that I want to show that
Omega epsilon is large
that is what i want to show so i
identify a function w on the space of
colorings which has which is maximized
in omega epsilon and when it's outside
Omega epsilon it sort of increases on
average so you have the safe space of
all colorings you have to set Omega
epsilon that you want to show has large
measure I identify a function which is
maximized inside that said and whenever
it's outside it sort of increases on
average which is what this means so if
you start from something which is
outside of mega epsilon then in one step
the value of the function increases and
this implies that they should imply that
you no matter where you start from you
should hit the set Omega epsilon quickly
because the maximum is inside this set
and you cannot continue increasing
forever which you will do if you are
outside you set for all times okay and
and to motivate the construction of this
w recall that the heuristic that i
discussed says that the blue region is
roughly GNX bigger than k for some k so
all the blue particles should be in this
region GNX because then k for some k
right which means okay which then sort
of gives you a natural can yet for this
what deals w should be on the space of
colorings okay so okay before doing that
I will define formally what I will like
semi-formal evod greens function is so
its harmonic everybody except blue and
red sources we have this two-disc is
harmonic everywhere else and the
laplacian is sort of born and minus one
on these two sources i am suppressing
some constant so i actually do not want
1 and minus 1 i want it to be something
else but up t constant this will be the
function and there are formula is you
sort of so XD say the random work on the
graph and then you basically look at the
time that a random box pens in one
source minus the time it spends on the
other source now this interval goes from
0 to infinity so individually these two
integrals are infinite because both of
them have positive measures so random
vogel spending time in both of them but
the difference is sort of integral
because this to discard the same area so
what I'm saying is that you look at the
expected local time in once or
minus the local came in the other source
and that will have this properties so
the green function that I defined in I
was talking about in the heuristic is
going to be dysfunction and then the
heuristic said that the blue region was
roughly a level set of this function
okay so which means that a natural
candidate for W should be this function
that is some GN to be some GN overall
the blue side so you have some coloring
you have some function on the graph and
then you look at the sum of GN overall
the blue sides so so so I said that the
W should have this two properties the W
sort of maximizing Omega epsilon and
that it increases on average when you're
studying outside so these are the two
things that I actually like consider is
the main body of the work so it's a
these are not these are technically
challenging things to prove sorry yeah
because so I defined my set I so you owe
Meghan epsilon was defined in terms of u
alpha right and you alpha was defined in
terms of this log function right and
here i have a discrete greens function
so you have to show some convergence
okay so so like I said so you have to
show something like this is true that
roughly G n if n is large enough then
roughly it looks like this function okay
so okay so okay so it will all right so
so do you remember what size was so you
have this domain's d and you and cyber
Sam average went from you too d and and
this was exactly this bigger than beta
was exactly the region you betta and if
GN is okay so and the proof sort of
users the fact that random work on this
graph you n converges to reflecting
button motion on you and you have to
sort of use the fact that reflecting
Brownian motion has some nice
differential properties so it it is a
solution of a well-known PD with some
neumann boundary condition so I mean
like so you use the fact that deflecting
Brownian motion satisfy some PD and the
fact that the random walk hit Colonel
convergence is affecting button motion
hit kernel and this sort of convergence
uses like the things that we use are
actually very recent results about local
convergence so the fact that random of
convergys abandon motion is not very old
so it's pretty new and the fact in this
reflected setting yeah so if you have a
domain and do random upon that I that it
will converge to reflecting Brownian
motion no no no random ha converge
asleep and emotion could be Claire it
depends on what your timeline for
classical is for my intuition back I
mean of course conjecture yeah by
proving thing is yeah obviously Tommy's
yes but in special cases here for
example on the half-plane it's easy to
show okay and so there's a very recent
paper which sort of proves quantitative
pounds for this convergence so they show
local CLT estimates of this convergence
and this is what one can use to show
that this discreet green function which
was used which was defined in terms of
the random walk actually converges to
this continuum function on the whole
domain and then you again use the fact
that this hit cannot afford Brownian
motion
is a solution to some pte okay so what
does that imply so so we have this w
coloring which was summation of GN x
over the blue ho teachers you said that
Gen X is roughly like this function so
which means that this region was roughly
the region where this function was less
than beta and this function is bigger
than beta and gene is now like this
function so GN bigger than beta and Jane
less than beta roughly the same regions
right so this region you alpha was
defined in terms of this function being
bigger than some beta but now i show
that GN x is also roughly like that same
function so u alpha is roughly the
region but GN is PK tan beta and so to
maximize w you want to pack in all your
blue vertices in this region something w
i am summing GN about the blue vertices
i want to maximize it this is the place
where Jane is bigger than beta it has
asthma fraction of the whole area so I
should matter I should put in all my
loop vertices in this region to make the
blue maximum okay which means that the
maxima indeed lies in the set Omega
epsilon because you cannot allow too
many blue vertices in this region for it
to maximum ready okay so this was the
first claim that this sort of is Maximus
in omega epsilon I still have to show
this positive grift condition that if
you're outside then you increase on
average ok so this set of users and
energy argument so look at this graph
look at this blue region on this side
look at the red region on this side so
now you have three graphs one is the
whole graph one of these two colored
graphs and so now look at the effective
resistance we shall define in the moment
for this whole graph and this to other
graph so you have this three effective
resistances for these three graphs and
turns out i'll define shortly about this
effective resistance is it turns out
that this difference is exactly the
effective resistance of the whole graph
minus is some of the effective
resistance of these two small graphs so
you have this blue recue sorry
okay I mean it's not because ok so the
interface is not like a line so you have
these two regions of the red hit yeah so
it is not not exact right so there is
some error small error here but like
roughly and the smaller is polynomial is
Molly name is 1 over N to the Sun beta
or something but roughly this is true ok
ok so let me ok so let me define what
effective resistance is in this setting
so so you so these are not point sources
you have this too small disks and you
start your and never from the disk and
you stop it till you hit em ok so you
have these two small sources which are
not points and effective residence of
the whole graph in this setting is the
energy of the unit current from the blue
search of the red source such that the
current through each starting point is 1
over the total number of sides so
roughly you have some current flow going
from the blue source of the red cells
that will give you some energy on the
whole graph and effective business the
whole graph is that energy and similarly
for the blue and the red regions the
energy of the unit current from the blue
source to the interface will be your
resistance for the blue part and
simulate the red part so you have these
three graphs one of them you have this
two sources so its end unit current from
one source to the other source compute
its energy for the other two you have a
source and an interface so send a unit
current from the source of the interface
compute its energy and and thumb sense
principle sort of says that if you look
at a graph look at any flows then the
energy of the flow which is energy the
minimum energy of a flow would be only
when the flow is a current itself so so
current sort of minimize energy among
all flows and and so then you can see
why this thing should be non-negative at
least because if you take the flow which
is on the whole graph going from one
source to the other source and restrict
it to the blue part in the red part they
will give you honest flows on them which
has the same divergence as this current
flow so they have strictly more energy
I'm like they have at least as much
energy as this one's so RF should be at
least as big as the sum of this tube
because
restricted to blue is bigger than this
RFS to read is bigger than this and
these are sort of disjoint sets and but
then you can actually prove some
quantitative lower bound if you started
from something which was away from so if
you had this initial thing that there
were at least epsilon n squared vertices
on the wrong region then you can
actually prove all quantitative lower
bound this is not just not negative but
is bigger than some constant a depending
on epsilon so if you start from Omega
epsilon compliment you will have some
positive drift which is lower bounded by
a function of epsilon ok why these are
disjoint grabs so yes so look at the
energy of the flow from going from here
to here and I look at the sum of these
two which is the same as shorting this
curve so I should think of this as one
point right so what is the what is the
sum the sum is the effective rigid
energy of the current going from here to
here if you glue all these points along
the boundary was right it serious you
can anything serious and because this
but but so and an evil it's the same
potential alone or shooting in action no
no it is it now this is some this is
some arbitrary interface so if this was
the same potential then this would be 0
but the fact that you are starting from
Omega epsilon outside of my epsilon
tells you that this interface is not of
the same potential so you actually make
some quantitative gain which is this a
epsilon okay and so now so I ok so i
will quickly say how this thing's will
imply the result that you wanted to
prove so did okay so you have this
function w which increases on average
when you're outside and the maximum is
inside this atomic epsilon so this
should imply that hitting time of that
set should be small so the first result
is that the hitting dem of Omega epsilon
no matter where you start from is going
to be like order n square so its bigger
being bigger
CN square is exponential has
exponentially small probability so
suppose this is your state stress of all
colorings and Omega epsilon is small set
inside you start from anywhere in order
n square time you hit the set Omega
epsilon right so this is so this is just
in words what I just said but to show
that the station measure this is close
to 1 you also to prove that once you
enter this set you do not escape quickly
so this is the next step which is that
once you reach so you first hit Omega
epsilon then you carry on and hit
something smaller Omega epsilon Prime
and van Syrian Omega epsilon prime then
it will actually take exponential time
to get outside Omega epsilon okay so
these are just submitting a conservation
pounds so the function of W of Sigma T
as T ron's is a submartingale and so you
have consideration bonds that will sort
of imply this and this is the same that
you same argument that you have for a
biased random walk okay so now we have
to relate so we have the sitting time
results and then we have to translate
that to stationary measured okay so and
so this is not very hard so station you
measure is the amount of time that you
spend asymptotically in a set all right
so you start from anywhere and you look
at and you want to measure the station
but you want to measure the station
measure has said and you look at the
proportion of time that depends in that
set and the hitting term results show
that no matter where you start from in
order n square time we will hit the set
omega epsilon and will stay there for an
exponentially long time right so you
typically spend on the order n square
time outside Omega epsilon power in time
interval of exponentially large length
so this tells you that something like
this is true that the mass of Omega
option is bigger than 1 minus some this
is exactly the proportion that you spend
outside okay so so the proof of the
continued result is complete which then
implies the main result just because
just by sending epsilon 2 0 ok so now
quickly wrap up just by making some
final comments that the main result was
in terms of this area of the symmetric
difference rate and in the picture in
the simulation we saw that exactly they
had like no red particles in this region
you alpha so there was some interface
but they were absolutely no red
particles in this region so so in joint
work with line 11 yuval and Jim
we managed to prove this result in a
slightly similar setting but like which
was which had a simpler geometry so the
setting was we studied this process on
the cylinder you have the cylinder and
now the sources are the top and the
bottom so the random box traps uniformly
from the top the red random work on the
blue random box a student from the
bottom and then we could actually show
that under equilibrium so this is and
because of symmetry in one coordinate
this should be the interface because
there is nothing going on in the other
coordinate so so the blue should say if
the Blues we're like alpha fraction then
the right height should be alpha if this
height is 1 and then we could show that
if you look at the region which is
outside alpha plus minus epsilon then
with high probability there would be no
blue particles in this region above
alpha plus epsilon and there will be no
red particles in this region alpha minus
epsilon but we crucially use the fact
that some things were very very
precisely known on this geometry which
is not true for Joan domains so yeah so
we we use the fact that idea was very
well understood on cylinder so first we
prove the similar statement for the
cylinder that there would be some dust
particles but like very small and then
we use some precise estimates to show
that those will be wiped up very quickly
ok so a relevant question is the setting
would be to prove such a theorem for
this general context so have any junk
domain and show that so that even a
picture like this is that is true even
in this setting and once you do that
then the next question would be to
understand the interface better like
people did for ideally so once they show
that this was roughly like a ball what
was the interface going to be like and
because you have forces from both sides
it's believable that the fluctuation
should be even smaller than what happens
for ideally so for idea we know that
this the fluctuations of the boundaries
like logarithmic so it should be even at
most that much and then you can ask the
question in high dimensions for general
domains and the correct condition would
be again the screen function intuition
which says that the level the separating
hyper surface should be still a level
set of the green of a suitable dipole
potential function on this region and
then you can ask a question so so this
step we're working with two measures
which were separated from each other but
then you can ask the other extreme which
is what happens if both the blue and the
red random box traps from the same
source
and now suppose you have the infinite
lattice so you have z2 but the model is
you alternately release red and blue
particle from the origin and they will
keep walking till it finds the site
which is either empty or of the opposite
color so blue walk can hit a red guy or
an empty side in either case it will
turn it into blue so it will treat white
and red as particles of opposite color
and it turns out that even if even
though you have like release like 10 to
the 10 particles only like a few
thousand sites which have been occupied
so most of the most of the activity
would be like red trying to eat a blue
blue 22 bread so you will really like
fill up this empty sides but nothing is
conjectured in the setting what is a
picture like okay so this is one and the
and then you can ask the question about
what happens if you have multiple colors
so this is a simulation where you have
like three colors each of mass one-third
and the sources are the roots of unity
and then you run it and this is what it
looks like but but if you did not start
from the setting where every color was
equal and you have sir so remember that
in the in the talk we had these two
sources we took a conformal Mac so those
map to the so two sources on one domain
would map to solana other domain and
then we had this one more degree of
freedom which said that you could map
this region D alpha to actually you
alpha using but here once you fix these
three sources on two different domains
you have no control on what the areas
are going to be like so you don't
exactly know but their conformally
invariant picture is sort of true here
and what exactly is there what exactly
is it truth in the setting because i
think i'll stop here thanks this is the
ideal a the fraction fluctuations of our
ethnic honda it's just you're bounding
largest fluctuations or it is there any
understanding of wanted images with log
scale yeah so it's very well known and
so you should probably ask Lana because
he was one of them yeah so in two
dimensions so the the largest
fluctuation is
logarithmic but typically you think
they're like square root of log and
there's a limit which is a close
relative of gas injury-filled that's not
yeah I mean you can always try to
strengthen the results you know it's
known for certain class of test
functions yes yes so you get the answers
you get you're getting Gaussian
fulfilled it's not quite as if we feel
some origin is special well it's the
origin is a special point so it we
called it augmented gas but it's very
very close together in two ways that can
give you know normalization right is
right no normalization concentrations
themselves are tight at any point it
started only the maximum gives you the
law ought two dimensions if it's long in
where you get me so there is a result or
efficient I think this might be
different to be in gas if you feel that
I've melted Gaussian be filled so you
see you had a question in higher
dimensions is fixed direction yes I on
this time this or something I might long
if you have the versus being single for
the suits right so so so first of all
the green function order is more rights
if so a point will so if you start
random book from a point it will be hit
like more than like roughly like login
times so if you stick your random walk
starting from point and kill it on the
other point but and so and this
convergence result is not how because
Brownian motion does not hit this point
so we could not make that work that if
you take this discrete in function and
then what will be the limiting behavior
of that how to show the directory
converges to something like this log z
minus I oversee closer what one approach
could be just without bypassing all this
Brownian motion convergent so you can
start with this function log z minus I
over Z plus I'll which you know is
harmonic and has a singularity son has
Nyman boundary condition on the
continuum and like restricted to the
ladders so it's not going to be exactly
harmonic so it's going to have some
error and then you can show that even
with so I had this weight function which
was I was summing this GNX over blue
sides right so instead of summing GNX or
process you can take this extra
continual district
should continue a harmonic function and
then just some that over blue sides and
show that that works so i have this
function g ni show that GN convergence
is some function laws of something over
a lot of love of something over
something right but you can start with
this love of something over something
directly instead of having the
description function then it will not be
exactly harmonic you will have some
errors and then but just show that you
will still have this positive drift
condition even in that case but still
rotary of course yeah so this will be a
robust way because this sort of
convergence of random dr. bronn motion
is only known for square that is right
so this is still increasing oh yeah of
course yeah yeah yeah yeah but like
right sure no there's what I mentioned
some of the motivation behind I was 13
2003 which was I was very interested in
border routers and what they might be
good for I was trying to come up with
probabilistic questions for which this
kind of new randomization would give a
close match uh I in fact this is an
example of that so you can do this kind
of competitive erosion in the randomized
sense uh-huh and if you do it the right
way you get the same interfaces being
level system functions conjecture by
right but you've been just doing what
works instead of random look so we have
to do something another thing I always
forget I could look it up in my notes
and find out which is like there's two
obvious candidates for how to do rodo
box depending upon whether the red
particles and blue particles use the
same rotors or machines and one of them
gives you the interface you expect Oh
Dada one doesn't create macroscopic
disturbances of the interfaces I never
understood it in a camera for which one
was which but if anyone's interested in
Spanish I would imagine the independent
rotor box would sort of give you if you
use two different set of rotors for the
to box in probably should we make the
random up closely right and it's not
clear I guess we'll give you Oh opposite
the reg it spin roars backwards from the
booze I never tried that
so I guess the same direction but it
basically one of them you could
definitely see those a kind of a
eschewing a clockwise skewing the
interface where there is oh you still
have pictures I can dig them up I think
so that right so you're nice to prove
especially as there are several natural
versions and only some of them work yeah
the other thing I'll mention is that I
did an experiment with three colors
using the kind of the same thing you get
in your last slide but where the sort of
lopsided not symmetrical and there still
appears to be a meeting point where the
angles are 120 degrees which is a sort
of a natural than we but how did you
arrange to keep the math equal did did
you so one of the mass was a deep all
the areas for unequal no but how did you
arrange to keep it unequal so what was
that ruled so you what with the rule
each time did you I've learned the rules
you just cyclically alternate but rather
that we should be equal like the month
sorry that should equal eyes the mouth
if you introduce a red particle and then
a blue particle in a yellow particle
because each time it captures something
of another color suppose the Reds are in
the minority mmm then when so so when
they're thoroughly robo however now yes
it's the particle that just not capture
ah yeah that's right so it meant to
stills from yellow they ran low gets to
go next and what yellow still is true
I'm very sure that was it yeah that's
the way to keep it six yeah otherwise
this truth anyway the pictures are part
of a mathematica notebook so we can see
what the code does but i'm pretty sure
that we just went through the same
realization
it's a new thing yeah let's thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
