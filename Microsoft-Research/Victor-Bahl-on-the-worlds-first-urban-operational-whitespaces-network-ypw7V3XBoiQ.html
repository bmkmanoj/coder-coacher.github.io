something that I've been working for
about 11 years
it's a lot I actually realized that when
I was putting these presentation
together and I'm you know you have to
wonder I've actually done a lot of other
things as well but I still feel as
passionate about it as when I first was
exposed to this topic so hopefully at
the end you will see why so what I want
to talk about a little bit here is some
ground truths right we all know and I
could you've probably seen a lot of
surveys you've seen from different
reports that the wireless usage is just
going up tremendously and then also the
amount of data that the users are
consuming is going up tremendously as
more and more of the smartphone's
proliferate tablets Wi-Fi LTE ubiquitous
connectivity it's just going up now in
our labs we have a whole lot of
applications and things that we are
building and as I look at them you know
the demand the requirement for for
bandwidth is just going to go up with
all these applications and although the
the mass public hasn't seen those but I
have and I know they are very addictive
because once you get used to it you want
them everywhere it's not going to be
enough to do them in destin desktop as
well
now when you say you know you hear
people talk about LTE it's great you get
lots of bandwidth there no no problems
but the latency is the killer
you either latency is pretty large and I
don't know how they will solve or this
in the cellular domain will solve the
latency problem so generally what is
happening is that more and more demand
for connectivity but but if you sort of
project further you sort of see that
this is a problem because not only do we
need to connect people but we also need
to get them
that they they must care about and not
not the current generation so if you
look at spectrum which is what is needed
for wireless connectivity and you look
across the world people have taken the
spectrum which is a very important
national resource and partition didn't
allocated it to four different uses you
see the SDC chart for the for the united
states and then you see for other
countries and this is true for country
after country it's the same sort of
thing
you take the spectrum any allocated now
so what can we do given that we need
spectrum what can we do well we can
fatten the pipes that means find some
additional spectrum but as I've already
shown you a lot most of it is allocated
so where the heck do you find it the
other thing is you extracted a juice out
of it that means more bits per Hertz now
we know that we are actually doing quite
well already on that regard
I mean turbo code for example gets you
pretty much to the limit of what you can
get from from a certain amount of Hertz
and Shannon theory tells us how much we
can actually get and the really key
there is thermal noise and you can't
there's nothing you can do beyond that I
mean that's just physics so you can't
really extract more out of that so
another idea is to change do more
spacial reuse so if you're familiar with
wireless networking you know you make
the cell size smaller and as you make
the cell size smaller you can increase
the capacity of course that comes with
some management headaches and you know
do a lot of the sort of handoffs you
have to manage and you to sort of have a
lot more equipment out there etc etc but
that is the direction that a lot of the
cellular folks have been taking which is
the small cell or previously called
femtocells in fact both and then another
idea is to sort of say well there's a
whole lot of spectrum let's and it's
some of it is not being used and if if
company a owns it why doesn't it sell it
or lease it out to somebody else them is
you create secondary markets out of it
and a final idea could be that you
promote what is called dynamic spectrum
access and that's where most of my talk
is going to be about so these are sort
of the the framework within which you
can work given that the demand is going
up and what you need alright so I said I
started this in 2011 and it's true in
2003 I had my first exposure to the
complexity around a wireless in spectrum
and I've actually been doing wireless
research for a while before I got to
that point but I never really thought
about it from a global perspective a
national perspective true everyone wants
more of it that was clear then I mean
the question at the time was well even
if you get it what's the right thing to
do should we sell it and and make it
licensed or we just provide unlicensed
and they were good arguments on both
sides people you know even to this day
argue about that lot they talk talk
about Wi-Fi and see how successful it is
and then somebody will come to talk
about the cellular guys and how
successful they have been and so their
pros and cons to all this I also got
exposed to this gentleman exposed to his
work at that time I don't know how many
of you know about him it's okay if you
don't because even the people in the
know who have been working in this field
for a long long time don't know but
which is surprising but he is a Nobel
laureate and he was the first person to
sort of talk about the allocation
strategies for for spectrum and he made
it a point to say how bad FCC and other
regulatory bodies had had gone out and
how they had given this out a national
resource so it was a really good piece
of work of course and during that time
Stanford University organized this
little this event where I really wanted
to go there were all these people there
I don't know some of you may not know
them but they're considered the thought
leaders in this space and they are a
mixture of lawyers a mix of policy
advocates the mix of engineers and you
know researchers and all kinds and I
wanted to be there
and
if you want to be in a place like that
you should bring something to the table
so what I did at that time is I actually
wrote this paper and I presented it and
to the workshop and they wanted to know
what I meant so the idea that I was well
people should have good spectrum
etiquette being do the right thing you
know that sort of thing so they want to
hear but it was very clear that that's
not the way a world works I mean you
know one person has the etiquette
doesn't have the other person doesn't
have there's no enforcement going on it
doesn't really work but that's ok it
made me think very hard about what does
it even mean to have a spectrum
etiquette and it got me a seat on the
table now this was also the time when
people started to sort of talk about
dynamic spectrum access and the idea was
sort of gaining heat but and people
think this may be the way out so what is
dynamic spectrum access so if you sort
of look at the left I guess
my right your left graph what it says is
that this this is a small experiment
that an internal mine did to see that
you know as you look at the spectrum
across the world you soar across the
region you sort of see holes in it that
it's not it's not being used and so the
question then is that if there are holes
in this pressure has not been used and I
really need it why don't I use it ok so
then the question is well you can't
really use it because somebody else owns
it so there's a primary user for it
so then people say well ok so what if we
could come up with a technology which
would sense a primary user and if the
primaries is not there it'll use it
that's the green green client there and
at the moment the primary user shows up
it just moves to the next place that is
available so theoretically conceptually
it makes it is very pleasing and so can
we actually build a technology like that
that became the thing so then if you
really think if you're if you try to
fantasize and that tells you why it's
been 11 years that I've been working and
I suspect I'll continue working on
something like this for a long time you
would say that the way the FCC has
partitioned the spectrum is all wrong it
should all be dynamic
and then you should allow some people to
be primary users and some can be
secondary okay in that case then you
would have the technology to say when
the primary user wants to use a spectrum
for wireless communication that's you
know that user gets the priority if not
then the secondary user can use it and
if you could build it then you would
have no spectrum problem you would have
no wireless communication problem from
that perspective you could build all
kinds of technologies and you will be
golden for a long long time pretty much
this is the best you could ever do but
of course this is not going to happen at
least I persist that not in my lifetime
but it's good food for thought it's good
intellectual exercise to do now during
this time another interesting event was
happening in in 1996 Congress had set
the transition of digital TV to analog
I'm sorry analog TV to digital TV and
the rule of thumb generally is that as
you move that you use three times less
or you use one third the bandwidth that
you would have used for analog this
leaves one third bandwidth so now all
the places where broadcast TV existed
that was going to become empty a lot of
this the spectrum was going to become
empty so that was really exciting and of
course everybody said I want that ok so
then these white spaces are the gaps so
what I want you to do is this is just a
slice of the spectrum and if you so look
at that focus on the yellows and the
Reds so when these things free are going
to be freed and actually have been freed
because this was in 2009 the red one was
sold off to AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon and the
telcos and the yellow one was left open
for potential unlicensed use now this
was amazing spectrum from because if you
think about Wi-Fi it's and works at 2.4
gigahertz or it works in five gigahertz
but this one was close to 700 500 800
around that area and the propagation
properties of radio waves on those
frequencies is much much better right
they disco much much farther they can
penetrate through walls they get
I mean think of it if you want to think
of think of the TV I mean for for those
of you who saw TV with antennas you know
that can pick up signals even when the
base station is very very far away so
this was great spectrum so that long
range and if it was unlicensed and deep
penetration so as a reality check
we actually did some experiments as well
and here's a little thing that I did
many many years ago this is the redness
Redman campus and the white thing there
white lines show the shuttle moving
around with a receiver and on your left
side is the graph which shows signal
strength the idea of showing the signal
strength is that when the
signal-to-noise ratio is over a certain
limit the receiver is able to decode it
okay so this tells me by measuring the
signal strength I can say up to what
point I can decode and have connectivity
and what we discovered with an optimal
radios radio receivers and also would
not going at the highest power level
that is now allowed we could get pretty
far pretty good range okay so you can
get like about 1.6 kilometers a 1-mile
okay easily not not not too bad so then
if you do the math again you say that
all of Redmond campus which is pretty
large Microsoft the entire campus could
be covered by four or five base stations
and you would have complete connectivity
no matter where you went inside the
building outside the building everywhere
and that was cool
the other thing is there a set of
experiments we did was about penetration
which I talked about and of course we
found that I don't know if you have
houses and places where like for example
the way my house is constructed at some
points I don't get Wi-Fi coverage at all
and so something like white spaces or
UHF will provide coverage everywhere in
the house so you can do more multimedia
more interesting things inside the house
too so then the question the technical
question is how do we know that the
spectrum is available for us to use
right because that's the that's the
whole thing about dynamic spectrum
access you sense that if it's free you
use it if it's not you for the primary
user you go away well you set the
channel
I said this I said that but it turned
out that even after many many years of
work we could not do it all the time
100% accurate
now imagine that if your primary user
was paid for it and I have a sensing a
sensing device which kind of does it
most of the time but every once in a
while it screws up and it does not able
to detect it properly and I start
transmitting and you have to suffer the
consequence of that you're not gonna
like that so you can't put technology in
the field which is not hundred-percent
robust so while advocates of sensing
including me to some extent who were
very very excited about it
we were not ready really the technology
was just not there yet ok so is there
another way to do this
well we wrote this paper a while ago
this paper was actually didn't have the
fact and the answer is that there is
there is another way and that is if some
authoritative source tells me that
there's spectrum empty spectrum and I
can I can rely on that source then great
then am I so problem is so I don't have
a sense it I just got that information
and it's accurate because I got it from
a source that I trust so that is what is
called the white space database ok that
you may have heard an espresso all over
the place so there are devices in this
particular case when devices will only
use the channels that the white space
database says is available to them ok
the second rule you would say is that
devices will go regularly to check if
that channel is still available because
it's not like you go there at some point
and and you use it and you have it
forever you don't because those like I
said there's a primary channels and it
can be used by there so you have to go
regularly and check it now as a database
provider you have to make sure that
everything you're saying is legit it has
to be accurate and you cannot screw up
with the primary users and then you can
also say well this is a very powerful
means now because now I can pretty much
control what channels a client uses
because even if a channel is free and
it's used by somebody and that's a
problem has become a primary zernow then
I just block it ok so it's a very
powerful centralized thing so this is
sort of pictorially what
said you've got the FCC database which
knows about who's using what in what
spectrum and so all that database stuff
goes into what these companies now that
you've heard about which to write vice
base spectrum and metric databases they
provide and then all the clients are the
base stations that operate will go and
consult these Weitz's white space
database get the answer and then based
on the channel that is available they
will connect okay so we also of course
we were a big advocate of this and this
was doing with time when none of the
rules are made so we built this thing we
built a database and what I show you is
an old version of a database that we
built okay so for historical isn't this
is a good picture or lures are better so
what you're seeing here is on your right
sides are reds and yellows on the
channels the red says those Sharon's are
not available the yellows or white say
these channels are available okay and
then down there that you can't really
see very well other details are much
much more heavier details about who's
using what channel we're with how much
power and and we're all you know what is
the propagation property etc etcetera
you can click on those things and get a
lot more detail that's not the most
important thing and we are actually
pretty proud of what we build
I believe I haven't checked the latest
in the greatest databases that are out
there but I believe that ours is still
one of the best was the best at the time
we produced it and still is and the
reason I say that make that assertion is
primarily because of this right graph
here so what we did is we took obviously
we took all the database entries from
from the FCC then we took all these
terrain models from that NASA had and
other places had into that we applied
some very sophisticated propagation
modeling shown by these equations on top
doesn't really matter
and then we then checked whether what we
were predicting and what we were
predicting was that if you if the
channel was occupied in a particular
place so if there's a base station in
location a up to how far is that area
not usable and you can only do that
through propagation modeling right
I mean in other words how would you know
up to what point this is valid and it's
not valid and that's why you needed all
the sophistication you needed the
terrain model because radio waves
propagate differently you needed a much
more sophisticated propagation model to
sort of give you the ground truth and
what you see on the left top is thousand
places where we stood in turn turns went
and measured the data and compared it to
what the theory was predicting and we
found it to be great and what the graph
here the on your left bottom is showing
is a serious cumulative distribution
function which essentially means it the
way to think about it is that right is
bad
sorry left is bad and right is good and
so the left part the green is when you
just as you free space loss as a
simplest propagation model and then on
the rightmost you see the blue line
which is the more interesting models of
behavior used with the terrain and it
says that you're not if you use
something simple like free space you're
gonna lose a lot of space where you
could have operated your wireless
devices and and it's no good so you
really want something that is as
accurate as possible and we had that
okay
so now the other question is and some of
you in the know would say that hey but
are they enough channels available to us
and the answer is yes they are this is
at least this is done a while ago but
nevertheless you see that these are the
number of channels and then if you do
just some arbitrary but reasonable bits
per second per Hertz calculation you get
how much bandwidth is available to you
if all this thing works really well and
this is for some of the suburban places
and some towns like Bellevue and Redmond
but also you see New York and LA is not
here but you start to see that they
don't have as manager and for various
reasons so there's an argument there
that perhaps in leave very dead setting
this may or may not be as useful as it
may be in the rest of the country all
right then we we built the whole thing
right so we were going to we were trying
to convince at the time the FCC to make
this happen and that's why I use the
word term first we
because this was the first institution
of Wi-Fi wireless whitespace network
anywhere in the world so what we built
is we built a built a wide space network
we put some antennas on building 112
which is here and then we took a shuttle
campus shuttle that takes people around
and in there we put a white space device
and the idea was as the shuttle moves
around people who send the shuttle would
connect to our device through Wi-Fi
and that device would then connect to
white spaces into the building and then
to coordinate so as the shuttle moved
around they had full connectivity and
they didn't have to pay any price to
cell towers and it was huge bandwidth
low latency it was like being connected
to Wi-Fi right and you can do everything
that you did
see and this was a really successful
experiment for us so I'm going to show
you a little bit of video what I've said
to make it concrete so let's play this
video please with the ongoing transition
from analog to digital TV more and more
spectrum is opening up adaptive radio
technologies allowed networks to have
the advantages of inexpensive Wi-Fi and
the long range of cellular these
technologies can help us use that
spectrum by dynamically finding and
using the white spaces between
frequencies used by existing
broadcasters and wireless microphones
this allows more users to coexist on the
spectrum Microsoft researchers have been
exploring this challenge for many years
and have created a network that finds
and uses these white spaces this
technology uses your location and
information from nearby transmitters to
determine what frequencies are available
then dynamically moves to the
frequencies for use in those white
spaces technology like this can offer
low cost connectivity for underserved
communities schools or hospitals by
ensuring that this spectrum is available
for unlicensed use around the war
government policymakers can help
innovators find even more uses for this
bandwidth and preserve the economic and
social value of this important resource
okay
so this sort of reads really some of the
things that I said this is an old video
and show you another one which is you
later
so then the FCC Chairman of the time
visited us it was it was a Saturday he
came with his chief of staff and we
showed him the whole thing I I
personally gave him gave a two-hour talk
to him in a small conference room just
with the four or five of us and he had
lots and lots of questions and you know
interesting good questions but and we
showed him how everything worked and how
the inter fans wouldn't mean it would it
would not interfere with incumbents and
all the other stuff now I believe
actually that that discussion was
monumental in terms of turning his mind
because while everybody was talking
about this stuff nobody really built it
up nobody had actually proved that this
thing works and here it was you know for
the taking and everybody could see that
thing works and so then the FCC a month
later a freak came there was a unanimous
there was a vote and unanimously they
approved that what they wanted to open
up the spectrum for unlicensed use which
is what we were going after so there was
a big big success for us and he had
parties not good stuff to to say that we
had reached our objective now so what
did we achieve right so if you sort of
look at this graph on the horizontal
axis is range okay on the vertical axis
is speed and if I took a sort of course
view of things and sort of draw some
drew some pictures this is what we had
in the unlicensed space this is where we
were operating now because of this in
this sort of accomplishment we had
achieved this right we had a lot we
didn't have as much banner potentially
because of the way the
you know the frequencies arranged it's
like you had Chinese in six megahertz
etc but you had lot middle range and so
now you can start to think what can I do
with this thing now that I have it is it
a really super Wi-Fi I mean is it really
can I achieve everything that Wi-Fi
achieve plus more because now I have
this range and good properly so there
was a whole lot of business
opportunities here right one is create a
whole campus network which is what the
subject of this little talk is right now
this is in Microsoft for example you of
course have connectivity here in the
buildings but as you go Breen buildings
you will have full connectivity and then
you can think about city wide if you
remember people tried that with my Wi-Fi
meshes and we tried it as well but now
there was a reason the the the
penetration was not that good but now
you can achieve that what about really
big giant hotspots
right somebody puts it up and you can
connect from you know kilometer away or
kilometer 1.6 kilometer or what a mile
away or something what about the idea
that Walmart's of the world or Sam's or
uncle whatever
Costco's that are put up these big
giants base stations on top and then
everybody around them have connectivity
and and you can start to see free things
coming around everything
Wireless multimedia I mean there are
lots and lots of these things that
expect a few which was which I thought
would talk about the different things
that is able to do now this was so
successful for us that that a lot of
regulators from all over the world
visited us to see this thing in working
and they had a lot of questions with us
because they too were obviously
suffering from the same issues that the
u.s. is but they were just a little bit
behind and so we showed this to a lot of
them and started to have influence and
they're thinking of how they're going to
think about their national resources the
spectrum we also got a couple of PhD
thesis out of it as some of the students
who work with us now or since then we
have done a lot more
I haven't actually put slides in to sort
of talk about all the different things
we have done but really there are trials
going on all over the world
okay these are deployments and trials
going on all over the world this is a
little picture that sure where they are
going on and the two significant ones of
these that I do want to
spend 30 seconds on each is one in
Cambridge lissa that I was one of the
biggest trial that we did this was in
the United Kingdom and we were able to
work with a lot of vendors both hardware
and and database provider etcetera and
this was a nice setting because it was
both rural and urban and we had many
many of the real-world practical issues
that we had to that had to be solved
were solved in this trial and this was
also very successful trial now I what I
didn't emphasize much earlier was that
one of the driving reasons for doing a
lot of this stuff was actual rural
connectivity this was about people who
couldn't afford to pay money but they
still needed connectivity Microsoft has
been a big believer in this we have
spent lots and lots of money and lots of
lots of our cycles working on the
Digital Inclusion programs that we had
here in the past so so it was just not
it was to us it was the normal thing to
do which was to think about places that
don't have connectivity so we have an
initiative called for Africa you can go
to the web page and the website and look
check it out and in there there are
multiple trials that have been running
by our technology policy group here
which is very very vocal and very very
sort of aggressively moving in the world
in this direction and so we did a pilot
in Kenya and for various reasons in the
government and Kenya was very happy but
I want you to excel read this quote that
I picked up and this game completely
unexpected expectedly this is and I'll
just give you five seconds or 10 seconds
we'll just read it
so this is some people you know we just
I mean here we just assumed that you
know got you is a birthright and for
their large parts of the world which
actually don't have it at all and the
telcos are not willing to go there
because that's a lot of money for them
to spend and they're not gonna get
anything back but now you have a
technology that actually does not
require that much money to spend and yet
provides connectivity so this whole
thing about digital inclusion they still
divide etcetera is all about information
divide if you don't have enough
information you're not going to make
great great decisions and if you don't
make great decisions here it cannot be
able to improve your economic standing
in the community and so this court here
talks about the student who who suddenly
here is eyes lit up but it's his world
lit up because now he was actually able
to experience some of the things you
know experience so this was a really
good thing and of course for some of us
who work in this field it was very very
satisfying to see that so now in terms
of current status there's you know from
a policy perspective in the United
States we have is that is the leader in
all of this stuff and we've done a whole
lot of work the UK is not so far behind
and then there's a whole lot of
countries that I've listed here that you
know where the policies in on various
stages and the regulatory policy in
terms of deciding how they want to
approach this whether they should do
with databases or not in terms of
standardization which is really
important as well you know the right
things are happening the I Triple E is
pretty heavily engaged they actually
have a standard I think that they
published recently and standardization
is key I don't know how many of you have
been working in Wireless for a long time
but but I have and for example Wi-Fi I
came in 1989 I was using that in 1989
but it was until 1997 when the standards
were passed and then people started to
get mass products out there that it
really took off so it took a long time
then I don't expect it'll take as much
time in white spaces but sterilization
was the way to get everybody's laptop
have this or everybody's notebook
have it everybody smartphone have it and
this is progressing so as I look at this
thing I see the same set of progression
and so that gives me optimism that we
are going to get there as well and other
there are other bodies - Wi-Fi Alliance
which looks at certification and
interoperability there is the IETF which
talks about the standards between the
client and the databases and they are
all writing it and then the European
standards and the US administration now
if you look at database certification
there were there are several companies
which have now been certified by the FCC
to to have the database and to be able
to provide a database services today for
example you can buy a certified device
and you can go with a certified database
and install this thing without any
requirement from FCC
on your campus you can do that today
okay so you can have white space network
on your campus for all your employees
today because of all the rules and all
the progress so similarly there have
been many devices that have been
certified of course you know as they
build a good senator the FCC and then
the substance e says yep this is
compliant with all our rules and this is
what we expect so you can now go and
sell it you get the FCC sticker and you
buy it so that is happening a whole lot
of companies are doing that and you can
just check that out nothing so here is
another video this is actually a little
bit of a repeat of that video of what I
showed you but it's a little bit more
emotional I think and it makes a point
and I'll show you the point so let's
roll this one please
what if you could better educate
children living in a remote village who
lack access to specialized instruction
what if you could manage traffic so
gridlock doesn't stop your city during
rush hour what if you could provide
state-of-the-art high-tech medical care
to people living in remote communities
what if governments could use technology
to better deploy city services such as
garbage removal and reduce costs in the
process what if a boy who dreams of
playing in the Premier League but
finally stream is favorite teams games
if you look for the answers you won't
find them in what's out there but you
might buy them and what's not there it's
called white space and it's a renewable
natural resource found in unused radio
frequencies these unused white space
frequencies can be used to increase
available bandwidth improving the
quality of broadband connectivity and
lots of these unused frequencies are
located between TV channels signals set
out on these unused TV frequencies
travel far and penetrate trees walls and
other solid objects inexpensively
extending the reach of Wi-Fi and other
wireless broadband technologies
currently limited to using higher
frequencies what can TV white spaces
enable
you can manage traffic in your city
minute-to-minute adapting the
infrastructure to accommodate conditions
you can more efficiently deliver public
services
you can have medical resources be
available for preventive care by
reducing the cost of broadband
connectivity a school can now become
part of the global village the only
thing stopping this from happening is
the lack of favorable consistent
regulations allowing whitespace
technology to be deployed on an
unlicensed or licensed exempt basis
people and the devices they use will
finally be better connected by tapping
into the TV white space available in
your country
so the reason I wanted to show this
video if not rest of the previous one
was because this had a little bit more
on the different scenarios and of course
the biggest point of this video which is
which we use is to put pressure on
regulators around the world to come up
with regulation that is in harmony with
each other because if you're building
product it's really hard if people all
agree on it but they come up with
different rules everywhere then you get
screwed because you can't I mean if you
can really build it we live in one world
and we use the same product everywhere
we want to get to that point and so this
was a sort of a you know to appeal and
of course there's there's a technical
reason behind all this stuff but I
wanted a socio that's kind of where we
are struggling now is to get make
believers out of the rest of the world
and many many other countries are coming
along but that's where we are
so in general where we headed logically
it sort of makes sense right there was
an R&amp;amp;D effort which we worked on quite a
bit we proved we we built a prototype
then we sort talked to regulators they
sort of move forward with the regulation
they've done their thing and now we're
doing it all across the world there are
some commercial pilots which I showed
you around that some pallets I'm showing
you that I showed you and there are
other companies which also have their
own pilots and then eventually get to
the customer deployment so so everything
is progressing as planned everything is
and so one of the reasons why we decided
to give a talk here was just sort of as
you think about your companies and the
places that you work in you must start
thinking and incorporating some of these
ideas into this because because you know
the the train is moving and it's moving
pretty good at this point
so now very quickly I'll end with this
thing called the project Istanbul which
is so historically I wanted to say that
after we had achieved what from I'm say
we now is an MSR we had achieved this
objective of of getting the FCC to to do
the right thing you know we kind of
moved on we started doing other things
as well and so a couple years passed and
we actually did not make any progress
because we were doing other projects and
looking at other things too
but two years later for some reason
either came back and looked at this
again as to what had happened in the
past and we sort of decided that there
was still some hard technical problems
that we needed to solve okay and in fact
I was quite bitten from my earlier days
when I was also pushing wireless mesh
where we had gone there and done a lot
of work and then the world actually
picked it up and there was a lot of VC
funding etc but we hadn't yet solved all
the technical issues and I think that
caused the problem so we wanted to go
back and you wanted to build what I
called is the researchers playground
right here on campus but it would have
to be a production class network not
another 20 network so the objective of
Rajic Istanbul was to build a
campus-wide white space network that was
on all the time right 24/7 365 na na and
that users were using all the time so
the things we decided was let's do
physical security in put cameras in
places because it's a big campus and
people move around at night to make sure
that we can get these live feeds and we
can't do it or LTE it's too much
bandwidth and we can't really do it over
Wi-Fi because these are the areas that
that we're not going to be there so
let's use white spaces that was a good
example of using white spaces we also
have this idea of digital displays and
we are also playing with small cells and
sort of wanted to see how can we create
a backhaul network another objective for
us was that we were going to do
everything in software everything would
be Microsoft homegrown so hardware
software everything so we have in an MSR
Beijing we have a some world-class
researchers who have done some amazing
work with suffered find radios but at
the time they had been focusing on Wi-Fi
and they actually build the first
software-defined radio which
interoperate with commercial Wi-Fi so
working with them we decided that we
wanted to move this into white spaces
and we did but it wouldn't be fun if it
was just our so we also looked at some
of the other universities and rice has
another software-defined radio of
framework called warp and we also have
them use a commercial one which is
certified to see we can interoperate
with all this stuff so this is this
picture didn't come out very well it's
kind
but what we did is we remember it's
totally earlier that our thought was
that four or five base stations could
cover the entire campus so we have
installed four base stations in four
different buildings on campus and the
idea is now that once installed you can
have mobile units moving around that can
connect to them which could be this end
you can have all these hard-to-reach
places
have units that are connected to to
these base stations and then offer Wi-Fi
coverage there so long as we have Scylla
Wi-Fi and we don't see at half the
downloads for white spaces in terms of
the Sora so I already mentioned this
this is a pretty picture showing that
you had the Safa radio and then we had
to change the front end of it to operate
at the lower frequency bands because as
I said they had originally done this for
Wi-Fi so we created that that's an
antenna sitting there that's these on
the top is the actual Sora board now
this is pretty large and that's okay
this is research we want flexibility and
because of the requirement of that
flexibility we don't necessarily need at
this point care so much about form
factors but there is no fundamental
reason why it can be as small as what
you have today with Wi-Fi right so don't
let these pictures bother you from that
perspective the second one is the rice
board which is the warp port which is
which we are using and into operating
and the third is the adapter board that
I talked about which is the commercial
board this is also pretty large at this
point and then I mean we you know we
didn't hire anybody I said like as
students you know there's a little
picture of going in installing an
antenna you see a little box there with
the Soraa board in there and then you
see a building which is building 99
which is my building which is where I
work in the corner of that is where the
antennas are and here again some more
pictures again of clay was a fifth year
PhD student at Rice installing all this
stuff and those there's a lot of
antennas there so there's no reason to
be worried about so many antennas we are
just testing a whole lot of things with
all this different antennas we want to
do my more we want a directionality and
all that great stuff so it's a little
overkill for real use but we wanted that
flexibility here's a poll top receiver
this is in a soccer if you have a
commons area where it is a soccer field
and
placed a receiver there on the on your
left top is the bottom of that is a
little camera there which is pointing
towards the soccer field and then on the
on your left bottom is a receiver with
the solar panel so we actually have and
building 92 receiver which is completely
charged by solar energy and there's no
there's no even electric electricity
there so this is like the most the most
beautiful thing you can have with no
wires no nothing it just works and
provides connectivity here's a little
picture of a client's little box right
now and you know it's mobile it's got a
battery in it you can move it around and
connects once again like I said this is
so much bigger than it needs to be right
now here's a little demo we did a while
ago which is you see the Box sitting
there there's an antenna and we out in
the in the corner is this are some of
the researchers you know when you know
this is sort of the highlight of that
and they're they're standing in and they
are connected to to this thing and at
that time we needed this large fuel
thing to power it because we didn't have
the battery so I'm gonna switch to a
live live shot
so what you have here is this is not
very interesting but oh there's some
people good the problem is when I see
that it's like nothing in there it's so
boring but during the lunch time people
play soccer and we will move around and
that's kind of cool but what you see
here is exactly that whole top receiver
that I showed you with with a camera
underneath and it's pointing to the
soccer field and you're seeing live
stream video stream from that soccer
field right here to all our white spaces
so no wires no nothing it's working so
go to the next slide please all right so
that's then and then we move to the next
so I just leave you with one bit of
research I sort of said that all this
research should be done I told you what
we've built together but I'll tell you
the research so you know this is not
unlike Wi-Fi Wi-Fi gets very popular and
then you get you know a high density of
it it's it's called the property
the tragedy of the Commons so what if it
happens in the white spaces right so now
if you sort of deploy this and you know
this kind of coverage you get and then
if other people build these little
whitespace networks around there it's
gonna cause interference so what happens
you're big into big white space now it's
actually a good problem to have but not
a it's not a problem which will sort of
stop the movement but it's it's
intellectually interesting problem to
have so what we've been working on is
instead of a beam parents that are that
look like that we do beam parents that
look like this and we believe we can do
that we can do directionality very tight
directionality with multiple antennas
and that's the kind of thing we're
working on and so now if you have this
and you do it in real time and you adapt
very quickly you should not have the
problems that Wi-Fi is having in fact
we're doing this because this is really
really fun for us but also a lot of the
techniques that we are building here are
applicable to all the other wireless
technologies as well okay so that's
pretty much it in summary I would say
that the white space technology is
actually real it's real we've shown it
to their CV and we're doing it now as
you showed your demo and it all works
now there are many scenarios I did not
focus too much on that because everybody
has their own favorite scenario that
they really care about suddenly really
makes sense just showed you some and
show the video on it there is optimi do
feel very optimistic that we can get to
the point where lots of countries come
up with regulations which are very
similar to the United States and then
that'll just make the life easier I
showed you that and the standardization
process is going pretty good both from I
Triple E perspective IETF in a Wi-Fi
Alliance etc plus device manufacturers
are building it we have we've heard the
chip manufacturers are building ships
Asics are coming and then this continues
to be an active area for research but
not of the kind which will make it a
bottleneck for for adoption this is the
sort of thing that researchers have done
with Wi-Fi Wi-Fi has been very
successful and yet you continue to see
innovations through all this alphabet
soup Wi-Fi that you have that keep
coming because of all
research that's happening so that's it
