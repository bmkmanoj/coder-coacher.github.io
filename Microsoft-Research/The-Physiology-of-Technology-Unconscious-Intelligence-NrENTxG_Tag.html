hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
dancing then you don't need to chase the
greatest weapon that we have against
stress is our ability to choose 10
anymore who chooses one God over and
others there any one of our species I
thought that society
okay this is very important so what
other things that I'm just saying now
since 2007 is the physiology of
Technology and grew out of work that I
was doing in detention and people kept
wanting lead over right I coined the
phrase continuous partial attention
people kept wanted you to tell about how
we got our attention back and I
discovered that there was a physiology
to attention and that all these
directions that were related to make
this list
every way to approach it through the
mind wasn't ultimately going to be very
effective because there was a physiology
retention and I know
seven that I had wasn't breathing i wish
i was reading I was breath holding and I
proceeded to do a lot of research at my
dining room table using heart rate
variability devices in 2007 when
subjects you didn't have to sign
anything because it was my dining room
tells heart rate variability basic
physiological measures for shifted
completely into a firefly for
up-regulated sympathetic nervous system
state when people were in front of the
screen screen apnea or specifically
doing email or texting email happy and I
came up with these phrases email at
part of what happens is that you're
sitting and you gradually are more and
more like this and you can't get an
optimal graph but the other thing that
happens and neuroscientist
is that went anticipation there's an
inhale and you inhale when you're doing
emails that have you noticed you never
exhale exhale if someone comes to your
door inhale before you open the door
hello but as a computer doesn't happen
and so as I continued to study this I
realized that there was I started
starting to look around was there a holy
grail of kind of grief who would do this
and I discovered that the people who
could do this were professional athletes
trained to breathe train for performance
professional musicians dancers all these
people were trained to breathe
meditators could not consistent
this people who do yoga go ahead I were
talking about this last night people who
do the yogic have a good yoga practice
even a trial practice couldn't
necessarily consistently do this and I
started interviewing musicians and I
learned as I was interviewing these
musicians that a beginning musician
merges with an instrument
playing the violin her Justine beginning
island
they're like what's mean what's the
instrument how do I Stan how do I
breathe and over time as they become
more experienced they learn to separate
themselves from an instrument and they
don't merge with it most of us merge
with our phones birds with our computers
as we work on them and these devices are
ripe all prosthetics of mind and the
exciting possibility for us and I
realized from my little pony that we're
always very optimistic about what's
possible in us the computers need to
become prosthetics of being good in the
same way that for musicians their
instruments become a prosthetic of
emotional expression because they stay
emotionally a body and that's how you
get all of this back there are multiple
things that happen when you're not
breathing your nitric oxide now it's in
relation to co2 and oxygen is thrown off
and when you have that situation micro
got five
hormone it leads to obesity depression
inflammation that's what they're finding
with people who come for a filter in
that way you go into a product fighter
play state so even though you may not be
in that state all day long when you do
it cumulatively over time research for
me I name says cumulative recoleta
cumulative shallow breathing leads to
this chronically stressed state what
other things breathing also does is it
massages your organs with that inhale
and exhale when you're really breathing
you can feel that when you swim or when
you walk and you're moving you can feel
that so so breathing is important but
the other thing that turns out to be
relieving for
is what's happening what's it
and your esteemed paper the New York
Times has come out with a couple of
interesting articles
to sing and one of the things does not
come up in these articles and that I
think is absolutely not a bell is there
when you're sitting this is the major
lift got here highly sister has
something like that these are major
areas of lymph circulation here we do
cardio exercise which is all about our
circulatory
system and our circulatory system has a
pump the heart but our lymph system has
no pump the pump for our lip system
Ashley calves really contribute if you
talk to David Blaine I told they'll tell
you that when he does a magic trick for
hours on him and has to be still he is
needing to be moving his heels so the
things that help with limp our walk Stan
calf stretch Qigong diaphragmatic breath
I call all of this conscious community
how can we become more conscious so that
we can become unconscious so that
computers become a prosthetic of being
digital devices technologies because
between and since you're cutting me off
I can't do this stuff
Oh
there's a post I'm going buying that
just what I want playing and I wrote but
what other things I encourage you to do
while you're here with all these amazing
interesting people is turn to the person
next to you or behind or whatever and
ask them to tell you how they played as
a child and how they play today right
about is I have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
