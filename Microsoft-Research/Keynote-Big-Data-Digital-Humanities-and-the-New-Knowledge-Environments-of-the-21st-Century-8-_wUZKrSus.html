hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in

academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
I hello good afternoon my name is
Claudia pianist and like to thank you
the organization for the honor of being
the host of Professor Chad gaffe-filled
with the speaker of this session
professor Chad socially constructed
himself as historian as I as able to put
himself and but his he got his PhD from
the University of Toronto and then he
went on to become and still is a
professor of the University of Ottawa
his current home leaf he is the the
president of the social science and
Humanities Research Council of Canada
where he helps funding research in
Canada and our parts in this air in this
very important area of humanities a very
interesting point about his research is
that he is so can I call early adopter
of computer methods to look into
historical change but i think i will
leave professor chad to talk more about
himself to show us a lot of the
interesting stuff has been doing two
layers thank you thank you thank you
obrigado thank you very much it's great
to be here and I want to give a special
thanks to Professor Claudio who's so
kind and the organizers for inviting me
it's as you may know it's a great honor
to be chosen asked to be the closing
speaker at an event because the
organizers when they think about this
they obviously the decision is they have
faith in you that you'll be able to say
something new and original and will
actually reward the people for staying
for this now obviously from the point of
view of the speaker this is very scary
and I think the last two days I've just
really enjoyed and I've learned so much
and it's made me even more scared but I
hope to contribute a bit and reward your
patience and incoming and perhaps even
have time for a bit of discussion
because I'm going to come at this topic
from a slightly different perspective
and you'll see lots of overlap and it's
great to see Tony hey and was great to
attend his opening animal and hopefully
the end in the in the beginning will
actually connect in interesting ways and
perhaps along the way you'll see why
I've found this event just so
interesting and exciting and inspiring
kind of two points I'd like to make in
terms of why I think this is so
important is one I was mentioned
Prosecco do you mentioned that then I'm
an astorian and and usually you know
when when historians talk about changing
times and so on our role generally
speaking we're the ones that get up and
say wait a minute now that's not new
we've seen that before right i mean and
we're always the ones are very cautious
about that we really emphasize and we
look the roots of things and so on but
i'm basically convinced that we are
living in a true paradigm shifting
period and whether we think about it as
a fourth or whatever we think about it i
think the argument is that really since
the 16th century the
print revolution the paradigm shift that
were undergoing now is truly fundamental
and as we'll see it's based I think on
new ways of thinking about ourselves
about others and so on and I want to
emphasize that today the second part of
this is the research council that I look
after and and our focus is on people
that are basic or our basic focus is on
human thought and behavior and anything
well gee that's something that we've
always thought about in a lot of
different ways but I think something's
different in terms of in terms of all
that and that's how we think about what
we're doing and basically our focus now
is to think about our funding program
giving out fellowships to graduate
students professors and research
partners in terms of research grants and
so on in terms of kind of three kinds of
activities one we're focused on
developing talent the kind of people
that are really needed across sectors
today in the world insight really
advancing our understanding of human
thought and behavior in the past and
present with a view toward building
stronger communities and then those kind
of connections across campus in terms of
the campus and the larger community in
terms of Canada and the world and so on
those kind of horizontal connections and
we're doing all that these days in terms
of partnerships we we think about
ourselves is in an expression you'll
undoubtedly seen a lot and hurt a lot
and I certainly like a lot is that
t-shaped the notion of having two
specificity but doing it in an
interconnected ways so so but what's
different what's different about our era
because you'd say that's been that was
true the 19th century 20th century
what's different well I think what's
different now and it really contests
this notion that you hear a lot that
we're Linnet technol technology-driven
age rather or art or kind of perspective
is that it's really about new thinking
new behavior that are being enabled
accelerated and then influenced and
iterative
raised by digital technologies so our
emphasis is not on human beings being
changed by technologies as more as
what's interesting is that us as humans
as society's choosing these technologies
to help us do new and interesting things
new ways of thinking about each other so
what's what's different and this is my
favorite cartoon I think at the heart of
our era is a new attention to human
beings and he was a wait a minute
professor Chad we've always been
interested in human beings think all the
way back Confucius plate whoever you
want to think about we've always been
interested in human beings and I i'm
going to say not so much not so much my
example today because we're we're all in
the world of education at some level is
to say let's think about schools so
starting back i like these pictures of
the 19th century because that's the
century when countries around the world
develop mass schooling and we developed
a system where we put the kids in rows
and so on and they will where'd they get
that idea well at the time you know how
do you organize a lot of people it was
the military model well they kind of put
them in rows that was good or or the new
factories his own put people in Roseau
they put the kids in rows so that was
good and we basically did that and that
kept that way they all through the 19th
20th century all sat in a little roll
like that and it's kind of humbling when
you think about that because the thing
that we didn't ask along the way was how
do children learn and it's turned out as
you know we've started to look at this
in the last couple decades pretty
seriously and it turns out that this is
a really crazy way to organize education
and that in fact whatever we learned in
schools it turns out is sort of despite
that fact and a and it's interesting a
lot of research shows that even today I
have about 18 minutes to effectively
communicate with you because you sitting
there listening to me it's about 18
minutes and then you start to think
about well what's for dinner
and did I remember to do that and you
start to wander because the human brain
so we're going to test that today sorry
but we know that this is not good no mo
every prophetess right they've looked up
and they've seen this hopefully you know
you haven't seen that but anyway but the
punch line is we're now realizing that
when we think about learning about
schools and so on then really we and I
think this is part of us taking
seriously a different approach my
argument today is that you can look
across the sector's at this and in here
we're going to sue's walk across the
sector's and so now if you want to be a
successful business if you want to be a
successful organization you got to
fundamentally rethink what you're doing
comparison to I would argue previous
centuries back and let's walk through it
let's look at the private sector all of
a sudden now businesses for the first
time or becoming customer focused in the
marketplace they will really they
weren't focus on customers before
actually not most businesses take the
20th century people think about that
what did you do a business thought they
got a great idea they got a great
product and then how did they will get a
great advertising company and will tell
you convince you this is you want to buy
this and then if it didn't work very
well we'd fire the advertiser and get a
new company though we may go bankrupt
that I would be the end of that and as
we know most businesses fail the new
approach now is actually to really focus
on customers what do they want and so on
and this is really really important but
the same thing is across in the service
industries all of a sudden down user or
user orientation who are the users what
do they want how they use in its own
collaboration with partners all of a
sudden now workplaces employing powered
workplaces in the past we didn't worry
about that if you're employed you got a
job you sit down do what I tell you to
do no no now we realize you want a
productive workplace you want to power
it innovative workplace you actually
have to empower employees listen to them
actually know what's going on same with
politics all of a sudden now you this is
why polling is so important on and on
citizen engagement politicians all know
it's a very different way it's not
lecturing to people it's actually
engaging them schools for the first time
it's not about the push the broadcast
the teacher it's about actually oriented
toward toward the students even in
health I mean it's a big revolution out
patient oriented help who is it about
before and I think it so it's a very
very interesting thing we've gone from
the emphasis on the teachers on the
bosses on the doctors on and on to all
of a sudden becoming people focused and
of course this is all the same thing
because it's the same person it's it's
one person who's a customer is the
partner employee on and on it's it's a
human being and we don't live our lives
in compartmental ways and it makes it
really really interesting so into this
all mix of course is a very different
notion sent out nearly every company is
getting more and more data about
customer sales interactions that's what
it's interested it's what it learns
about and of course the problem is how
do we really take advantage of this how
do we really adopt this new paradigm and
that's where things like all of a sudden
artificial intelligence platforms on and
on this has become a big focus but it's
not just about companies we could take
those words out talk about schools same
thing students on on and on learning
engagement trying to learn about the
hospitals all of a sudden patients
intervention outcomes a very very
different approach government citizens
user needs desires service standards on
and on and it's all of this that I think
is really at the heart these deep
conceptual changes all of a sudden are
making the availability and the interest
the data tsunami which and its really
interested in the metaphors that are
always used about this I mean it's a
tsunami a good thing right and then you
know you know is I woke like and it's
it's interesting we like words metaphors
and so on I it's interesting right we
roll into this and it's like tsunami to
deluge it's like whoa and we're all
trying to figure out how to handle that
but of course we also understand that
it's really at the heart of our
prospects in creating a new world a new
society that's really oriented around
people understandings of people because
at the end of the day that's how we're
going to build build successful
societies what do you think about this
and I usually IBM definition I think
about big
data is characterized it's often said by
the four V's volume velocity variety of
rasa tea but what I want to argue today
is that the the real interest why we
have all those magazine covers on and on
is because big data now is increasingly
about people human thought in baby and
that is the reason why we're so focused
on this and we think it's so interesting
across the sector's so just look at
these four dimensions thinking about
volume sure there's lots of data growing
volume and so on but what's interesting
is things like the 12 terabytes of
tweets created each day in every company
that successful now is paying a lot of
attention to this in terms of how
they're being talked about and there are
lots of examples about all that in terms
of velocity you know the whole issue yes
that's different but what's really
happening is terms of all those trade
events all those transactions that are
going on and so on right and in terms of
that velocity and keeping up with that
whether it's thinking about fraud or
thinking about all kinds of other
aspects variety this is really
interesting because we have structured
unstructured data tech sensors
audio/video clickstream block files more
and more in whether it's surveillance
cameras or whether all the other kinds
of issues related to things like
customer satisfaction and so on that
that is the reason why this is also
important on campus across campus across
the sector's it's really raining in the
same way in terms of this veracity in
terms of the trust and how can you
interpret the data how can you
understand about it in terms of the
different kinds of sources and how do
you think through all that and that's
why all companies institutions schools
everywhere is really focus on this now
is such a complex issue what I like to
emphasize in all this in terms of why
our conversations are so important is
because the first thing we have to
realize is that people are not particles
will why not well because people are
unique individuals we're unique
interestingly and to its context it's
about the context within which we r
right and so on so that makes it really
really interesting on the other side of
this and this is why I think this
conference as many of these
conversations are absolutely crucial is
because all they data analytic side we
have a lot to share there's a huge
amount of overlap and interest and how
we can think about all that is is really
really important well a phrase that got
introduced yesterday and at our
conference here thanks to Claudia and
others this whole notion of digital
humanities and so you can think about
that in terms of basically using the
newest digital technologies to answer
traditional questions and the humanities
you know did shakespeare write the plays
what's the genetic code of culture for
example who painted this how would you
read a million books how would you
analyze that and so on and that's
certainly certainly very very important
and there are lots of examples going on
now in terms of culture plaques cultural
complexity and digital humanities and
thinking about topics can connected by
native relationships seeing as complex
networks kind of images and so on they
were familiar in other sorts of fields
you can think about projects like this
one that worried about the growth of
large-scale data sets that in which
trying to interrelate those and and
looks across data sets and how do we how
do we think about that which is so
important this one the structural
analysis of large amounts of music
information for example and adding that
into the mix and how can we think about
all that but or for example forensic Lee
looking looking back in terms of all
kinds of interesting approaches to
understanding humans in in other kinds
of contexts what I find one thing that's
so interesting in terms of that shared
is a conference on it was entitled
shared horizons data biomedicine and the
digital humanities so interesting this
was in the US and it was funded by the
National Institutes for health and a
National Endowment for the Humanities
and here the issue is what are the
intersections between biomedicine and
humanities scholarship and I think
that's so interesting and so important
and epistemological II for all of us
there's another example the US National
Library of Medicine
for example combining with a National
Endowment for Humanities to cooperate on
initiatives of common interest right so
so fields coming together in really
interesting new ways I'll give you some
just some basic examples this you can
have fun google has what they call our
Ngram reader and you can look through
published sources back through time this
graph goes from 1840 and you can plug in
words to see when they pop up and this
is kind of fun here are two words one is
nationalized and one is privatized and
you can see for example the blue line is
nationalized neck goes down and all of a
sudden who would privatize pops up and
that's really really interesting well
this one's good you can look for the
word Canada it's kind of fun back in the
18th century the suburbs you can see the
you can see the war between France and
England that that led to Canada being
succeeded to to the to Great Britain and
then Canada get your own and over the
while it goes up I know what's happening
at the end there that's a little
disturbing but anyway you think we think
that shouldn't be going down but anyway
we won't worry about that right now is
also interesting we played around with
in Canada different cities you may know
in Canada for a long time Montreal was
the was the most important city and
that's the red one here and then by
around the Second World War what happens
you see Toronto grows and and so you can
ritsu so that's the sort of a worries
and you can do this with any words you
like you can have fun playing around
with this this all started in the 1960s
1970s this is a publication from 1977
computing in the humanities when people
started to think about this by in the
1970s there was a Canadian Committee on
on history in computing 1986 the text
folks got in their digital humanities
the birth of of that gets going I'm
going to jump forward to this report
from OECD that just came out in February
that I encourage you to read because
this links back and Tony hey emphasize
this it is start because now the focus
is not simply on on researchers using
these new approaches to
to analyze kind of classic questions
that have are from the disciplines but
rather this says that this is so
fundamental to understanding and
responding it effectively and
efficiently to global challenges so the
notion now in terms of really coming to
grips with the kinds of challenges that
characterize the 21st century that
really this is this is at the heart of
it and so it talks about the notion of
the the new forms of data collection and
so on commercial transactions on and on
and the potential payoff for
international and multidisciplinary
collaboration to address these
challenges is increasing rapidly so now
the importance of this is not just for
us on campus but rather our ability to
help make a better world a better future
to really come to grips successfully
with the challenges of the 21st century
this the group that did that chair Vice
Chair what's interesting Brazil had a
representative on that group candidate
as well and a number of other countries
and i encourage you to have a look at
that one of their first recommendations
and that we've been certainly taken
seriously is the notion of the funding
councils that have traditionally had
kind of geographic political definitions
that now we really must collaborate in
order to really push this forward and to
understand the opportunities of
limitations offered by the new forms
data to address important research areas
and that's one of the keys certainly at
our research council we've taken this
seriously soon after I started we
brought together an effort called the
International form of funding agencies
we had a founding meeting and in Ottawa
with representatives from from a variety
of countries in different parts of the
world and so on we built on this
initiatives such as digging into data
that will talk a bit about and now our
new objective and and were so hopeful
and and and keen on working with with
you here in Brazil with a PES here and
in in Sao Paulo professor claudia was
was with us in paris
working through the proposal we'd like
to create a transatlantic platform they
would bring together Canada u.s. Mexico
Brazil going all the way down the
Americas but also crossing into Europe
and to really to really start to harness
and it exploit the possibilities of our
age and our focus is going to be on this
digital pilot project and that's one of
the reasons that that I came here this
week and I'm so interested and in the
kind of conversation we've been having
the paradigm shift goes far and and I
think Steve Jobs emphasized this in
terms of the new world that's emerging
here now in which were understanding
that the magic as he said the results
that make our heart sing has to do with
this new integration between what was
usually considered on one side and the
other side but now in fact that magic is
is in terms of the integration what's
interesting is our students are picking
this up this is a survey of
undergraduate students in Canadian
universities and the question was where
would you really like to work after you
finish your undergraduate degree and the
two companies that were most mentioned
across all fields were Google and Apple
really interesting what I found most
interesting is the students that most
would like to work at Google and Apple
after they finish or in the social
sciences and Humanities really
interesting and so that this paradigm
shift is being picked up by the digital
natives they understand the connections
and they are part of this will they get
jobs well here's one example the vice
president at Google in fact says yes
that this was a couple years ago of the
six thousand people that they were going
to hire four to five thousand are going
to be from the humanities or liberal
arts and we see that looking at work
forces a it's really interesting one way
I like to think about that is is in
terms of a digital triangle yes we have
the digital technologies but on the
other side of that is digital content
and I mean that in a robust way metadata
on and on
really important and then what I like to
call digital literacies the use how we
use all this and that's what it's really
framing our era and I think it's an
equilateral triangle I think they're
they're all equally important and I
think they're all connected and the
magic as it were comes from that notion
of that integrated frame now there's
lots to draw upon and I think why our
disciplines or or or have something to
contribute an interesting way because
when you think about it managing content
thinking about data getting that getting
that organized and so on is classic
there's a picture of me when I was in
high school I had a job what they called
a page and that was trying to make sure
that everything was on the right spot in
the library because as you know in
libraries things are classified by topic
and you got to make sure it's together
and we were always told if you miss file
d mazal throw it out you had to be and
the right and we used to read it and it
is really interesting but that wasn't
the only way to organize things this is
is is the way archives were organized
one of the words have heard a lot of
this conference is pro Bono's and that's
basically a focus on who created
documents why they created and so on and
that's how archives are organized if you
go into an archive you don't you don't
get all the books on this topic here all
the documents on that top of year and so
on everything is organized in terms of
that person who created or the
organization that created and so on so
very different ways well in an analog
world you had to make those decisions
you had to put it somewhere you couldn't
put it to both places you had to put it
somewhere well we said you know in the
1970s early 80s we said you know what
maybe there's a new it integrate that
and those sort of divisions don't make
sense in the in the digital age I went
to teach at the University of Victoria
and Vancouver Island very beautiful spot
a very interesting history and so on we
said how about we build something that
would allow us to get access to all the
information and whether it's a book
whether it's an archival manuscript
whatever it is in terms of the history
of Vancouver Island and we built the
first what we called at the time an
automated archivist it was the first
sequel structured query language
application in which we brought together
we connected all the different kinds of
material
l so someone could find out about the
history of Vancouver Island the same
kind of approach got pushed forward if
we jump into the year 2000 and at our
research council a report came to the
conclusion that that the new information
technologies yes they're having an
impact on humanities teaching and
research but the opportunity is for
scholars teachers students to become
informed partners and innovators so
we're not just using software we don't
want services but rather we want to
become co-creators we want to build
together we want to integrate we want to
learn from each other and this is the
new the new partnership the new kind of
approach and so so that the the
concluding near the benefit fully
researchers must not only be able to be
aware of technological developments but
also me it's be directly involved in
them and that's the new world that we're
trying to foster and it's a very
different it's a very different kind of
world so what's the focus we built
something called image text sound and
technology program and this is very
debate event it and it had a huge impact
and the focus was in terms of
interpreting analyzing new digital media
multimedia text based computing
technologies and so on and in really
bringing together theorists
experimentalist technologies different
disciplines to share nurture ideas
methods audio-visual tech specs
technologies and so on and to facilitate
the creation of national international
networks and partnerships and so on so
some of the topics identified at that
time like trying to get in publishing
web programming textual analysis imaging
a lot of the topics that we've talked
about here my own window on this and
certainly one of the strong traditions
was to look at certain kinds of
historical documents and create
databases out of them this is a one of
the most popular ones used around the
world a census an enumeration of census
of these goes back historically in the
case of Canada to the 17th century and
basically the government's went around
and kept track of people ask them
questions age sex gender and so on
family household on and on well one
approach could say well you
just take you know what was said on
these forms and treat that as your data
and analyze that but our approach was to
say wait a minute let's think about that
how was this data actually collected and
so we we started to study how the people
who went around to fill in those forms
City and households and so on how will
they trained because we really felt that
that this was really key to that and
then we analyzed the actual process of
having these forms filled in and what
was that about how the questions
understood what were the different
contacts on and on and that led to
documents that led to documents written
in like this and then we said well and
then would happen to those documents and
we they were brought in and people were
counted and tabulated and so on will we
ought to understand all that process and
then of course the technology change in
the 1950s they brought in the new sense
cards and usual pencil to fill in and so
on we said well what difference does
that make and and we wanted to try to
understand that and then we said well
that had implications in terms of how
the counting was done and and and so on
some of the early machines and then we
said well yeah but and let's think about
that in terms of different places and so
we we G load it everything we wanted
because everyone's not the same and so
on well we built a whole big set of
inter inter related databases partnering
with IBM using db2 in which we had yes
we have the census data what was written
down on all those forms and so on but we
also had what we call contextual data
all the all kinds of evidence about how
that whole process was undertaken the
enumeration the processing and so on we
had how was talked about in the
newspapers at the time I was how it was
talked about in the public all the
political debates that went around which
questions were asked them not and so on
and then all the processing that
involved in that a really interesting
complex thing is you can imagine a huge
project 15 million canadian dollars so
30 30 million riaz something like that
big effort over over a number of years
involving all kinds of different groups
these to go to projects take a lot of
money
as you can see IBM was our partner as I
mentioned but but many other many other
folks involved out of that came in and
the analysis has gone on I teamed up
with with some folks interested in
machine learning and so on spread out
this data analyze it in different ways
you know using the training on and on
really really interesting so so what are
some of the lessons about all this from
our perspective working this through I
want to argue that in terms of thinking
about data data are not neutral they're
not objective in creating data humans
make choices decisions all along the way
what data to collect how to collect it
how to categorize the results how to
interpret a tribute meaning relevance on
and on and categories i I've seen a lot
for example here on on visualization
huge choices you're making in terms of
how you how you how you think about that
and presented so data do not speak for
themselves the facts do not speak for
themselves and said turning data into
insight depends upon human
interpretation and and this is I think a
really key human decisions are embedded
in software and the algorithms and so on
and and when the data concerns people
and this is I think a really really key
point for all of us when data concerns
people all these decisions all those
human decisions that we make necessarily
reflect theories assumptions about human
thought and behavior so they either can
be implicit you cannot worry about them
or they can be explicit and we think at
least that there's we really need to
think these things through make them
explicit because they have huge
implications for what comes out and
since humans are diverse remember unique
individuals and specific contacts
household community societies cultures
are diverse and I think that's one of
the really interesting things in the new
world for societies like Canada smaller
societies for example we worry sometimes
it will get ignored or erased because a
lot of the algorithms and so are there
going to be built in it they don't
affect us and I would also say it's one
of the issues related to language one of
the concerns are often is that english
language ends up dominating
a lot and we know that can be complex
big emphasis has been on genomics and so
on and and the notion of how a human
experience and so on is sort of
determined at the get-go and there's
lots of talk in terms of personalized
medicine and and and so on what we like
to think about is that it's more complex
yes there's that on the one side but on
the other side there's culture there's
social there's technological change and
so on and all of that I think can be fed
into some notion of big data and that's
our challenge in terms of trying to
understand that interaction that
complexity and so on in terms of human
thought and behavior there's lots of big
data available now in various low levels
this is in the US the international
public use microdata 480 million person
records and each record has several
dozen variables and variables can range
from 2 to 3 say two values up to
thousands so it's spreading that out is
pretty interesting I mentioned are
digging into Data challenge where we've
joined with other countries to to try to
think about how can we really how can we
really start to analyze this this this
corpus and and the complexity of it and
there are lots of good examples of the
kinds of projects that are being funded
all kinds of different things new tools
being developed new kinds of
epistemology being developed and here's
some reading that in case any of that's
interested in terms of things like
culture omics and and where that's all
going in the OECD report there's also a
nice slide that that tries to bring
together the new forms of data in terms
of whether it's government transactions
you know everything from property tax
records population records health
records on and on to commercial ones the
stores RVs accounts customer accounts
all those sorts of things internet usage
social media the networks the traffic in
terms of the sensors on and on and I
think that shows the potential how big
is all this how important is all this
will nature how to argue an article you
may have seen
in terms of talking about the humanities
and and then cultural databases and it's
it listed of course the whole dhryn the
Hadron Collider in terms of the kind of
petabytes that that's putting out the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey the GenBank and
so on but it's point was that the
computer storage space required to
support projects in the digital
humanities now is nurse and now starting
to rival that of the big science
projects and they had a couple of the
mentioned the engrams of Google and in
just the string of letters in this
corpus of five million books is a
thousand times longer than the human
genome or a year of speech for example
all the conversations broadcast news and
on and on or even archives like the
California show archives that is just
videotapes of interviews the Holocaust
survivors and so on and and they're just
apply this all on and on it's not just
changing businesses i think our campuses
or schools are fundamentally changing
we're redefining what we mean by
education moving from a teaching content
kind of an old-school transmission of
knowledge approach to one where it's
focused on learning content and
competencies well we like to call
developing talent very different
approach student engagement approach
research we've gone from thinking we can
advance knowledge and understanding by
simply specialization you study this i
study this we're going to add it up it's
all good to what i like to think about
and it's often talked about is this
research t where we yes we have to study
and we have to specialize but we have to
connect it we have to contextualise it
why because at the end of the day it's
intimately in a related connected
interactive nonlinear on and on and in
terms of innovation how do we make a
better world it can't be just better
technology it has to be people-centred
innovation and it's a word that you see
more and more or our profs changing i
mentioned our students were changing our
profs changing and this will we did a
survey a couple years ago we asked props
you said how do you think about yourself
how do you think about your research on
the one side we said you know extremely
introduce one
married to exclusively disciplinary how
would you characterize your research and
we were astonished it's 2008 we are
astonished by the results in fact it's
now become not cool to describe yourself
as exclusively disciplinary fascinating
and this is across the social sciences
and humanities and the third one there's
history which is always good to focus on
and in fact the most dominant one was
quite interdisciplinary almost 40% but
extremely to introduce minor extremely
and this is anonymous there's no reason
to fib and so on self characterization
but I think it's an interesting time
this has big implications for granting
councils we used to have three that
we're pretty siloed frankly one that
dealt with the people social science
humanities one natural science
engineering one biomedical research
pretty independent our approach now is
is we're over overlapping we're
integrating we're interrelating in in
really interesting interesting ways all
of this means we're much more work in
teams this is my the team that the core
team that created the Canadian century
research infrastructure project and it's
also international we did that in
cooperation with groups in other
countries and so on it's really
international I'm going to close with
some key observations about what are
they called digital scholarship it's
interesting the phrase data scientist I
think it's going to have a hard time
because people like me we can never
think about ourselves as the data
scientists so I don't know we got to
develop a 21st century vocabulary for
example new ways of bringing together
being inclusive in this world why
because I think we're being connected in
in in in in joining together to learn
about all aspects of the past and
present and to use such learning to help
make a better future and this is
interesting we research data now we're
also learning data as well as innovation
data and that's really important cutting
across all fields of inquiry is data
become the coin of the 21st century
realm and I think that's really
interesting from studies of colliding
particles to research on human thought
and behavior I think it's really really
interesting and data are now understood
in terms of numbers where
it's images sounds and indeed digital
representation of all human thought a
nonhuman action and it's really
interesting I think we've had some false
dichotomies you know the people that
really like words and the people that
really like numbers and remember and
like it's with great seven or eight is a
big divide people did really like
counting people that were like reading
and so on but at the end of the day
words and numbers are semiotic Lee the
same thing there are all representations
and and I think those are a lot of false
divides that are not are not interesting
the sole notion of use reuse and
repurposing of data something that the
great presentation this morning what was
emphasized and I think that's really
interesting and I think there's also
distinctions of blurring between
creators and users and so on and data as
was emphasized and I like these idea the
software release in terms of a dynamic
rather than fixed state and this notion
of multiple and iterative and engagement
obviously there are many issues that our
conference hasn't talked about that are
so important in terms of privacy
confidentiality ethical barriers on and
on illegal it's a really interesting we
need to work all together to try to try
to figure that out one of the things
that I'm pretty convinced of is in terms
of our triangle for example i think the
digital technology is now far more
advanced and i think those other sides
of the triangle really need focus and
and help in terms of really making it
equilateral and i think it's also
interesting in terms of the connectivity
and so on the importance of massive data
we really need to think about that in
lots of interesting ways and one thing
that was emphasized by one of our
speakers was this need for skilled and
sophisticated people can work
effectively in a digital environment
including technologies content
literacies the whole the whole triangle
and also new ways of thinking about how
we're going to bring this together
moving from a kind of old-school cookie
cutter approach to standardization to
new ways of thinking about this in terms
of both an solutions to problems of
preservation interoperability metadata
day delivery so user interfaces and so
on and in all this we need coordination
rather than control and those vertically
integrated hierarchies are gone and we
need to think about this in
neways is unevenness I think is is
really obvious in the preservation
infrastructure topic that came up this
morning I think we I think we have were
naive about this i mean it's urgent that
we really think about that in terms of
sustaining digital scholarship similarly
and this was in the session i was just
in a little while ago this notion of
moving from an emphasis on data
ownership to a provision of data
services the the example for the Latin
American Columbia for example where
libraries they used to Holden lend books
and so on and now it's all about access
to publications and so on and I think a
lot of this is is you know different
business models need to be worked out in
terms of in terms of all this the other
thing that's interesting is it was a
book early on the death of distance now
in the New World in fact that's not true
and that's been alluded to a few times
at our conference in fact in terms of
massive data and so on location is
important the other thing that's
interesting is face-to-face interaction
it's interesting and the magic is
combining eat contact with face-to-face
and we're learning more about that in
terms of the importance of regional
clusters and so on and certainly we have
a good example here all of this means
though that we have a lot of work to do
in terms of our policies practices and
so on to really build this robust and
sustainable ecosystem for an ant digital
scholarship because I don't think a lot
of our old old is really going to work
this week there is the Canada 30
conference you may remember Brazil had
their first Brazil 30 conference last
year that was modeled on this and we
welcomed quite a few dozen Brazilians to
the one last year this is going on at
our research council yesterday we were
we organized as part of that the Big
Data workshop and on that on that panel
we had Pat Horgan the VP at IBM canada
Ted Hewitt who's you may know is
executive vice president and our
research council but also Brazilian
'used and I know he's very well known
here and worked with many of you profit
from information science one of our
researchers is VP
research at a university and Tom Jenkins
who's executive chairman chief strategy
officer open tax which is Canada's
largest software company i also want to
also want to say how important Microsoft
is to us in many of these partnerships
here's one example Neil Randall's
project with working with many
collaborators and and he's working with
Microsoft in terms of games and player
immersion and trying to understand how
the increase in the immersive games are
really are really part of our society
and why is that and how to engage in
motivate players and have a rich gaming
experience and that's a really
interesting interesting project i want
to invite you all to continue the
conversation that we've had here if you
can come to montreal october 13th to
15th the world social science forum
entitled social transformations in the
digital age already we know
representatives from 58 countries
there's a rich program I think the draft
programs on the web now I encourage you
to to check it out you'd like to get
involved let us know and we'd be happy
to pursue that I want to close with some
optimism so think about it a little over
100 years ago you know Albert Einstein's
got some paper out pen pencil and he's
doing some thought experiment see he's
thinking things through cutting some new
ideas and so on well we got serious
about that during the course of the 20th
century and we said hmm let's check this
out and there was a lot of work went on
billions and billions of dollars got
spent and you know what we learned a lot
and similarly you know for years way
back novelist back there's been the
dream of going into outer space we
dreamed that and and this is from the
early 1950s well we got serious about
that and my hope is that when our
descendants look back on us and they say
well you know what you realize that if
you're going to build a successful
society going to build a better world
you're going to have to take seriously
the challenge of understanding people
and and rethink
how you organize in society are you
organizing businesses schools on and on
what you mean about all that and did you
take advantage of that and do all you
could to make sure that the 21st century
worked out as well as I think it might
and I think that's the challenge for all
of us thank you so much
we have some time for questions question
you didn't mention in your sweeping talk
about education Luke's all right and
it's interesting to me that the word
MOOC was coined in reference to a course
given at the University of Manitoba
actually I wonder what your view was
about where the MOOCs are going to
change education for real such a such a
great question and I think there are two
scenarios so massive open online course
and I appreciate the the recognition
that in fact this was a Canadian
expression and it was first used in in a
paper that we call the knowledge
synthesis paper that was done for us
related to our attempt to understand
changes that were happening on campus
and the title was given and there in
there some really pioneering work so
what what in one version the bad version
is that of a well-known successful prof
who's very effective in front of say
hundreds of students is basically put
online and made freely available to
anybody such that if you're interested
in a course in in physics or history or
whatever that's being given by a great
prof at Harvard or USB or wherever that
you could watch and this was really seen
as then well why would i pay a lot of
money to go to Cambridge if I could
benefit all that here the problem with
that of course is is that and there's a
lot of research on that is that you can
watch one of these lectures
and you can find it inspiring you can
find a motivating you could find it
enjoyable but if you're sitting there
passively watching this you will simply
not learn much and there's just a world
of research on this so if those sort of
broadcast MOOCs that in other words ones
that basically take old school teacher
centered pedagogy and put it online I'm
going to say and in many university
presidents are thinking about this how
to commoditize this how to how to make
the numbers add up better how can I do
this and we know for example that most
of those courses have huge dropout rates
and in fact there's really little
evidence in terms of learning outcomes
there any and it's been very
disappointing there's a newer version
that's really trying to run with this
and this is an engagement model this is
not just taking the old school and
putting it online and letting the great
prof be the theatrical performer and
communicator and so on this is really
understanding that we have to engage the
learner it's actively seeking to make
students participants in their own
learning and it's focused much more on
competencies and so on early days early
days but i think that approach has huge
promise and could revolutionize
education because clearly education
needs revolutionising because that old
model whether it's in a classroom or
whether it's online is simply we can do
better so I'm very excited about some of
the new engagement models but they have
to be student-centered and they have to
invite active participation what we call
the construction of your own learning
because that's what's going to have the
enduring either content retention or
better competencies let me take this
leader ask one question to the audience
especially to the students here who has
taken one of this online massive online
course from beginning to end beginning
to end another question probably the
last one yeah how many of you started
and did not finish yeah more hands are
you my student there's lots of research
on this now people are interested to be
happy to share on this there are lots of
studies coming out now so I think we
have time for one more question so
thanks very much for a very interesting
ah part of it that really caught my
attention was the part where you were
discussing capturing the context around
the canadian census and it resonated for
me because it made me think a little bit
about a problem that's been keeping me
up at night I'm hoping you'll have some
practical guidance oh no I'm really
scared so and it's totally unfair so if
you have no response to this that's fine
ok so I'm a tool maker and I made tools
for people to analyze data and whenever
I make a tool I like to provide sort of
guardrails to keep people from going too
far wrong with what they're doing right
so the part that keeps me up at night is
the problem of data interpretation so
when the data first enters the system I
really don't know much about it and
can't really help people interpret what
it means so I'm wondering especially in
light of this capturing context and so
on I mean is there anything i can do
practically as a tool maker to help with
the data interpretation problem i
believe strongly and let me use the T
shape again I think the whole notion of
you know the tool the the the service
being provided and there was somewhere
along in our conference it was a scary
notion of the black box
put the data in you don't know what
happens but someone comes out and says
yeah those are significant results you
look I think it's got to be t-shaped so
if I think you and I are going to
collaborate let's say and you're going
to have your specialty I'm going to have
my specialty but we're going to connect
and I think it requires us to know
enough about each other and our issues
and so on to have them and I would say
as a result of that we're going to
become co-creators co interpreters
because I think as I was suggesting that
embedded in what that tool you're going
to use his interpretation you've made a
million decisions there and I think it's
it was a false model that said just give
me the hammer and I'll hit it and you
know and I think we need that t-shape
and I think it's going to be a very
different kind of relationship I think
it's going to have huge implications for
our educational system for example the
whole notion of collaboration and so on
and I think we have a lot of work to do
because i think if we don't I think
there's a lot of reason for for all of
us not staying up at night because I
think there's so much hidden and it's
not transparent that it could lead us
and all kinds of unfortunate directions
and I and I appreciate your sensitivity
to it and I think it's a huge challenge
for our era I was just told by the
organizer that I think we can still keep
going so if there are more questions
please I think there's one oh I'm you
tell me what time yeah the more I mean
I've loved the last two days because
I've learned so much so the more I can
learn right now I'll be forever grateful
because as I said you know I'm just
convinced that we're going to have a
rich collaboration but the more we get
to know each other and understand each
other I think it the better so yes so my
question is concerned in the scene you
talking about we want to know what the
individual is sinking okay
so this is probably one thing that these
social networks are trying to figure out
because they want to shape the content
to each individual personalized
everything yeah but on the other hand
when they select the things i see they
select this the people i see what's
happening they are shaping the way i
relate with people so how these
algorithms these things will influence
our social relationship with other
people such an interesting question and
and so complex because yes you know we
talked about you know customized
shopping and and personalized learning
and personalized medicine and everything
but as your your question is implying
we're social means or individual
identities intimately linked to others
right we operate in and as you say these
social networks so I think one of the
one of the I mean I think one of the
interesting paradox is about big data is
that you know the data is up here but
the pursuit and the interest is you know
what the data mining people talk about
is golden nuggets right trying to
understand an individual in a context of
a social network and now not just one
social network but but as I said you
know in my in in those balloons you know
the you for example in terms of your
community of other researchers you in
terms of the neighbors you live next to
you in terms of the community on lines
that you the visit and so on right so
how can we situate the individual and
connect it in terms of these multiple
layers of networks and how do we analyze
that and I think it's you know the sense
of identity the sense of community now
is become so interesting in terms of you
know used to be you know in the census
time they thought about groups in terms
of okay you were there was you
and then there was household members and
then there was you know your community
and then maybe your stayed and so on in
these you know layers of up but now we
know it's not like that these networks
you're talking about or zigzagging in
all kinds of interesting ways right so
that's why I think a lot of the of the
epistemological conversations now are
going across why I'm interested in for
example the bioinformatics as in terms
of the humanities because it's the same
kind of challenge trying to wrap your
head around because we know like it
started you know the DNA was like okay
we can isolate this gene and then that
will stop this and it was thought about
kind of a linear way and now we know no
it's it's it's in so it's not right
social networks but maybe you know maybe
maybe the genomics is you know and so
how do we think about that so I think
we're just on the edge of a really
exciting interesting time in which our
whole research methods or whole and
analytic frameworks and so on are going
to get a lot more sophisticated and I
think we'll look back on some of what we
did in in the analog era as truly naive
such a great question though but I know
it's really late so I'm happy to to
continue the conversation informally
please please you know contact us and we
look forward to really building on these
conversations and encanto Agra merci Ã
