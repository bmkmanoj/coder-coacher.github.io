you
hello and welcome we're going to get
started so Lily Chang a distinguished
engineer and director of fuse and our
unofficial chief social officers going
to be introducing at lambda shaving her
and before we get started I just wanted
to mention that this work that londa is
going to be presenting is really
applicable to all of the stuff that we
do as well so as she's talking you
should be thinking about how it applies
to your own work and she's very excited
to hear the connections that you make as
you listen so if you have time
afterwards before running off for
Memorial Day weekend please stick around
and come up and share it with her so
that she can hear ways that you see this
applying to yourself Thanks thanks Jamie
alright so for those of you who don't
know infuse we focus a lot on social
interaction and design and I think one
of the main things that you do in the
design group is you go talk to the
people that you're designing for is a
first step and I think a lot of Lana's
work really embodies that and helps us
think more of systems and different ways
that we could even expand that practice
of talking to diverse people as you
begin to design your projects especially
women so for a little background Lana is
at Stanford and she is directing the
gendered innovation and science medicine
engineering environment project and I
think you have over 60 different
collaborators is a really amazing
project and I'm sure we'll hear a little
bit more about that she's really one of
the foremost international experts on
gender &amp;amp; Science and Technology and I
think a topic that is all is really a
focus of our so very excited for this
and there's a couple different ways that
I think we can think about women in our
workforce one is just how do we get more
women to participate in science and
technology and you know what is the
really the role of gender and culture
and science and then also for the
projects and work that we do how can we
make sure we really are designing for
women as an audience and I think when
you look a lot of our Microsoft
products they sometimes reflect a less
diverse audience than we think and I
think this becomes especially true as we
start thinking of less platform oriented
projects but maybe things that you wear
and devices and social software
obviously deals with community and
things like that so Wanda has an amazing
you know a set of things she's done
she's addressed the United Nations on
this topic she's won numerous prizes and
awards there's um including the
guggenheim fellowship and the alexander
von humboldt research prize so very cool
stuff and obviously also has written a
lot of books on this topic so thank you
so much for coming and definitely look
forward to hearing the talk and again if
people want to kind of have smaller
group participation at the end and
really brainstorm and share some of the
projects that you're doing in ways that
we might do better with diversity I
think having some small group
conversations after the talk would
really be great so just stick around
thank you and welcome great well thank
you very much I've had a good time so
far went out to dinner with some of your
wonderful people I know a lot about
universities and I know a lot about
funding agencies and I don't know much
about industry and when I go somewhere I
always like to take something home with
me so please do stick around I'd like to
see if what I say has any resonance with
you and how it might apply to your work
so please do let me know so today I'd
like to explore with you gendered
innovations the operative question here
is how do we harness the creative power
of gender analysis to discover new
things I'm about research and
integrating gender analysis into
research design so your series here is
about enhancing gender and ethnic
diversity it's remarkably important to
have diversity in teams but is the
crucial thing to have diverse bodies in
the room or is it that everybody should
learn how to design for diverse
audiences so that's one thing that we
can think about so first a little bit of
background governments and universities
have taken three strategic approaches to
gender equality over the past several
decades the first is fix the numbers of
women this means focusing on creasing
women's numbers participating in science
and engineering and in your series
marie-claude way this approach how do
you increase the number of women in
computer science the second is fixing
the institution's this promotes gender
equality in careers through structuring
change in research organization and Jane
margules discussed changes in these
areas and the third is fixed the
knowledge or gendered innovations this
stimulates excellence in science and
technology by integrating sex and gender
analysis into research today we focus on
this third strategic approach it's the
newest and hottest area so maybe you
haven't heard about it so much yet and I
think the most important for the future
of science engineering and innovation
and this is what gendered innovations is
all about a lot of this is most
developed in biomedical in the
biomedical field so I'm going to talk
about that a little bit and then segue
over two things which are important to
your core business so we know that doing
research wrong can cost lives and money
this is especially evident in in
medicine but I think for industry as
well if you have a product that fails
once you've launched it then that's
going to cost you money so for example
10 drugs were withdrawn from the US
market between 1997 and 2008 of these
drugs posed greater risk for women not
only do these drugs cost billions of
dollars forbes magazine puts the price
tag at five billion dollars for a new
drug because they factor in all the
failed drug candidates but when a drug
fails it can cause death and humor human
suffering so we can't afford to get it
wrong doing research right say
lives and money in the 1990s we had the
large governmental research project the
women's health initiative you've
probably heard of and one of the basic
studies that they did was hormone
therapy should women after menopause
replace their hormones should they take
a you know a lot of hormone therapy and
we've just done in and out so the answer
is no you shouldn't it causes breast
cancer and other things so we there's
just been an analysis of this study and
for every dollar spent in the study a
hundred and forty dollars were returned
in diseases you know that didn't happen
so there's no health care costs for that
and we save lots of lives there were 76
thousand fewer cases of cardiovascular
disease 126,000 fewer breast cancers 145
more quality-adjusted years while most
of the results are positive there was
the downside of more osco osteoporotic
fractures when you lose your estrogen
your bones become more fragile but we
can use lifestyle changes for that
exercise the right kind of diet can in
fact help you keep your bone it's
crucially important to get the research
right and this is the goal of the
gendered innovations project this
project develops state-of-the-art
methods of sex and gender analysis and
I'm going to talk about that a little
bit today and we also provide 25
examples or case studies to illustrate
you know real live examples of how
adding the sex analysis or the gender
component to what you're doing gets you
something better so today I want to
introduce the methodological resources
that are on this peer-reviewed website
gendered innovations developed over the
past five or six years through
interactive interdisciplinary workshops
we had workshops of about 15 people all
across Europe the US and now we're into
South Korea and these were really
fabulous for every technical field that
we took and i'll be talking about some
of these we
had the experts from that field plus the
gender experts and you know there were
conversations that had never happened
before it was very exciting for me
personally and then we met in beautiful
places like Berlin and Paris and you
know it was really fun so again the
question is how can we harness the
creative power of sex and gender
analysis for discovery I'd like to
present to you some of the outcomes I'm
first going to take an example from
medicine and then I'll come closer to
your core business and these are some of
the aha moments we had from our
workshops so my first example comes from
cells and tissues and I want to look
specifically at stem cell therapy let's
go back to a moment to why those 10
drugs were withdrawn from the market as
I said it costs a lot of money these
days to develop a drug so there are many
reasons why drugs fail and fail more
often for women but one reason is that
research is still most often done in
males whether it's humans animals or
cells and tissues we have some good data
on this this study was done in 2011 by
some of our colleagues at Berkeley and
it shows the sex of the animal used in
the research in these particular areas
they took the run of the journal for a
year and they found that mostly male
animals were used in all of these fields
for basic research the two fields that
have more females are reproduction and
immunology but what I'm interested in is
this area here I guess it turned out
purple this is where the sex of the cell
and I mean the sex of the animal is not
reported and this is data wasted to
research you might as well throw the
money out the window because you can't
do any meta-analysis it's just something
people have failed to get some of the
basic data that you know this study was
done also for cells and tissues down at
Mayo Clinic also in 2011 and here you
see only grey area the cells of
but the sex of the cells is almost never
reported and again this is research
money wasted now let's look at stem
cells and now I want to take you to our
website and you're welcome to use the
website in any way you want it's all
public information and free we have our
methods in buckets here the methods are
if you haven't had this kind of
information in your curriculum if you
weren't taught how to do sex or gender
analysis you can these provide questions
that you can put to your materials then
we have our case studies in buckets here
science health and medicine engineering
and where it's just where computer
science would be and environment so
first I'm going to go to stem cells and
tell you a little bit about this case
study okay good why might the sex of the
cell be relevant research shows that
there are sex differences in the therapy
therapeutic capacity of stem cells this
slide shows very simply stem cells taken
from muscle tissue and shows that the
female cells are more active than the
male cells so you can see this kind of
different regenerative capacity yet very
few researchers consider the sex of the
cell we have a world-class stem cell
researcher at Stanford who works on
Parkinson's disease and she was doing
some research using all female stem
cells this is an arbitrary decision on
her part I talked to her it's quite
unconscious she just thought okay I'll
use those but it means that in the
discovery phase she won't see anything
unique to the male stem cell so
opportunity missed nor will she and her
team detect any important differences in
the function between male and female
cells so again opportunity missed not
considering the sex of the cell can lead
to failed research in international
research team in Norway and Australia
working with stem cells in mice and they
very correctly used both sexes in the
mice they had male mice and female mice
but again they used all female stem
cells again the unconscious arbitrary
decision and the result was that their
male mice died and they didn't know why
and they thought well they put it on the
shelf they didn't know how to go on they
thought oh postdoc probably made a
mistake you know when in doubt you blame
your postdoc so eventually through a
gendered innovation project in Norway
the team realized that they should
consider also the steps sex of the stem
cell not only of the animal with the sex
of the stem cell and they found that for
their project male to male worked well
so and female stem cell to female animal
but you have to consider all of the
possible combinations before you rule
them out and you'll be interested to
know that the same is true for organ
transplant if you hope you never do need
a heart but if you do you better find
out what the studies say about which sex
combination works well and then for
heart transplants it becomes a little
bit complicated because we know that it
is sex matching that is the thing that
works best but women donate more organs
so your surgeon may not be able to
choose the ideal organ for you so we
have a sex issue here and we have a
gender issue that interact in that
particular example now even for the stem
cells the so the method I was talking
about here is analyzing sex you see that
the fourth down but you have to consider
also factors intersecting intersecting
with sex and gender when you're doing
this if you look around the room here
all women aren't the same in the room
and all men aren't the same so we have
to consider differences within those
groups if we're doing that so for humans
are all kinds of differences that are
important and even in these stem cells
we have to look at
we have to look at the environment that
they're in we have to look at the
hormonal environment immunological
issues and you have to look at the type
of the stem cell and the disease being
treated so you can't just analyze sex or
just analyze gender you have to look at
these intersecting issues and that's
what our methods try to get at ok now
I'm going to come to my second example
and I'm going to come closer to home for
you and I'm going to look at an example
from computer science and specifically
machine translation so natural language
processing and let me start with a
little story a couple of years ago I was
in Spain and there are a lot of
newspaper articles about me I don't read
Spanish so when I got home I zoomed it
through google translate and I was
shocked that there is a masculine
default in both google translate and
sistren which is the big European system
so lon do shaving her he thought he
wrote occasionally you know it it's
considered so how can such a cool
company as Google make such a
fundamental error my agency was wiped
out I mean I worked very hard to get
where I'm going and you know I just
thought this is ridiculous so Google
Translate defaults to the masculine
pronoun because he said so here comes
our gender analysis because he said is
more commonly found on the web than she
said and here's the interesting part we
know from n-gram also a Google product
you know down where I live you can't
live without google but you can pretend
I didn't say that so we know from n-gram
that he said the ratio of he said she
said peaked in 1968 at four to one and
then declined by two thousand two two to
one so what else happened in this period
where we had big social change there's
the women's movement the NSF starts
increasing budget to increase the number
of women in engineer
ring right we have all kinds of changes
presidents are using inclusive language
television commentators are using
inclusive language everybody is losing
inclusive language so but the machine is
defaulting to the masculine pronoun when
it's doing translation so with one
algorithm Google wiped out 40 years of
very hard-fought cultural and social
change and they didn't mean to so we
invited Google to a workshop one of
these fun workshops we have and we also
invited a natural language processor
from Stanford and they listened for
about 20 minutes and they got it and
they said oh we can fix that I mean
Google was appalled right they had no
idea its unconscious bias again they
just hadn't checked for that so fixing
is great but constantly retrofitting for
women is not the best road forward I had
to ask myself how is it that those
google engineers got out of Stanford
where a lot of them are educated without
knowing the basics of gender stuff so we
teach a lot of gender courses at
Stanford I teach a course on gendered
innovations a little bit like what I'm
telling you right now but it's an
elective and kids have to opt for it and
I think what we need to do I want to
work now with the new dean of
engineering to fix the engineering
curriculum the computer science
curriculum and I was discussing at lunch
how we might incorporate some of the
basics about gender issues right into
the core curriculum so that people will
get out and won't won't make these silly
mistakes now why does machine translate
default to the masculine pronoun the
machine gets a score of 68 percent if it
chooses the male pronoun so it gets a
higher score than if it did not and
another issue is that the translation
program can't understand context so even
though londa is the 1540 third most
popular woman's name in the United
States the machine
can't connect that fact which it can
very well know to the rest of the
content in in the paragraph of the
sentence so this masculine default has
then some unintended long-term
consequences if we keep adding
translations to the web that just
defaulted to he you're going to be
creating the future right and the
machine will even more often choose he
in any of its translations so we're
building a future we're reinforcing
gender inequality when we don't intend
to so I think that we are much smarter
than that now I don't have to pick on
Google there are other companies with
unconscious gender bias and it means
that these unconscious assumptions it
means that we're not developing the very
best product that we could for the
greatest number of people so Apple
released its health app in September and
if you have an iPhone which I do it
downloads it automatically for you you
can't miss apples health app and the
health app tracks everything it tracks
your steps it tracks your blood alcohol
content it tracks your intake of sodium
and magnesium and you know your
heartbeat and blood pressure and
everything so what doesn't it track the
menstrual cycle now there are and when
you see the release of the product the
videos of the release it's like oh we
track everything so there are lots of
reasons why women might want to track
their menstrual cycles so again this
product can be fixed there are lots of
apps that in fact you track the
menstrual cycle and it can be added but
couldn't we consider gender from the
outset what radically new things could
we conceive and now so now the gendered
innovations project is launching a
series of tech roundtables so I'm going
to be inviting maybe people like you
from Microsoft Research to come and join
up I'd like to understand how you think
about gender in your products in your
design and you know learn more about
what's going on there so we we hope to
be launching some of these in the fall
we have a partner in
the White House Office of Science and
Technology Policy she's going to do them
on the East Coast I'm going to do them
on the west coast and then we think
we'll have a if we get good stuff we'll
have a gender summit that kind of
summarizes some of these things and
excites people about it now I'm going to
go for a final example because I want to
hear from you as well and this is
assistive technology and I think I put
that for the elderly and believe me the
robots are coming world population will
age dramatically by 2050 and you can see
that it's a problem especially for
Europe it's a problem for the u.s. it's
a problem for Japan and some of the
Asian countries as well large elderly
populations will place a growing strain
on human caregivers and our health and
social systems so this case study
explores markets of assistive
technologies for the elderly and looks
at the value added of considering both
sex and gender when designing these
technologies so what we want our designs
that will look at sex differences
between men and women so we want people
to underlay today's that elderly people
would require in these technologies so
women for example tend to live longer
but they usually have more debilitating
disease and men for example tend to lose
their hearing earlier sometimes these
are occupational issues they've worked
with loud construction objects or
something like that so we not only look
need to look at the physical needs of
this population but also at the gender
related social needs and how that should
fit into the technology we said that
there are different gendered patterns
between men and women men and women tend
to have different partnering patterns
when they're elderly women very much
live more often alone than men do and
then then in when women have different
experience and household management as
you know that because maybe the men
haven't taken care of home so much and
they lose their partner they have
different receptivity to technology and
for instance elderly women tend to live
alone more often so our engineering
checklists here and our terms and our
methods encourage researchers to analyze
how sex and gender interact in
individual men and women so that they
can design the most effective and
marketable assistive technologies
designers want their products to be
useful and appealing to both men and
women so gender issues become more
important as we as the assistive
technologies become more personalized
and this is so I could I should have
better pictures of the robots this is
the one that the European Union was used
using the companionable robot and we
were talking we had a workshop with
roboticists and they all claimed that
they had no gender in their robots but
then the guys who developed this told me
that they spontaneously started calling
the robot Hector not only do they
conceive it as male but as a gladiator
right so poor Hector here so there are a
lot of robots that are developing and
one is a robotic nurse named Cody that
can bathe people now bathing is a very
intimate relationship between human and
machine and so designers will really
want to make sure that both men and
women of different social backgrounds
are comfortable with these machines as
we move forward another assistive robot
is herb the home exploring robot Butler
who can fetch household items for you
herb can fetch you a cup of tea he can
remind you to take your medicines or
even clean up the kitchen now if there's
a robot that can clean up the kitchen
I'm ordering it right away as these
robots enter our lives we humans will
gender them do you see I've changed the
direction now we gender things studies
of machine voices that is to say
synthetic voices machine-generated
voices show that human listeners tend to
gender machine voices that is to say we
interpret them as the voice of a man or
a woman even when the designer intended
that voice to be neutral this is the
work of the late cliff Nass really
interesting work so so Apple's Siri the
original iphone voice is interesting in
this regard as a party game I used to
ask Siri why she's a woman when she was
only a woman and one of her responses
was I was not assigned a gender implying
that it's not apples fault that you the
listener ascribed gender to her that's
your problem and as soon as we humans
interpret a voice as masculine or
feminine we tend to apply all of our
cultural stereotypes to that machine
right so we have this we really want to
understand the world in terms of gender
and that's one of the things that we do
so here we need to come back again to
this method that I talked about earlier
and that is analyzing factors
intersecting with sex and gender so when
we're talking about designing assistive
technology for the elderly and looking
at men or women we have to say which men
or witch women we have to think about
differences in ethnicity differences in
ages differences in physical ability
that sort of thing so that we can in
fact do a better job for a larger group
of people so for example Siri can't
understand my friends French accent at
all and my Jamaican friend can't get any
kind of voice that would match his you
know so there are many factors that we
need to consider considering sex and
gender when designing new assistive
technologies will be one important
factor to ensure that products are
successful with all users and on our
website we now have about 25 examples
you can click
to any of them and see them and I
encourage you to go look at them we
always have an abstract so you can learn
a lot in a little bit of time we have
then our full case study which is not
very long and I also made a popular
version for journalists because so many
people were calling and that's called in
a nutshell you can read that as well so
designing sex and gender analysis into
research and innovation is one crucial
component contributing to world-class
science and engineering now I want to
end with just a little bit of attention
to policy policy is one driver of
innovation and I know it's not so
important for you in companies because
you don't respond to those funding
things but it's important for you to
know the pressure that is on your
colleagues in other sectors so very so
we incorporated all of the policies that
we know for granting agencies granting
agencies can ask applicants to explain
how sex and gender is relevant to their
proposed research as a requirement for
funding and this is something this is
where it gets really interesting in
December 2013 the European Commission
which is the NSF NIH and neh for Europe
developed its next funding framework for
the next six or seven years and they
identified a hundred and thirty seven
areas of Science and Technology where
they will be looking for sex and gender
in the proposal so if you don't say how
it works you're not likely to get a high
score for your funding so these fields
include computer hardware and
architecture nanotechnology oceanography
Geoscience organic chemistry Aeronautics
Space medicine biodiversity you know it
goes on and on it's not they they
haven't included things like theoretical
physics where we don't know how gender
works in those projects so it's really
just areas where they have evidence
already that this would be a value-added
proposition
then since 2010 the Canadian Institutes
of Health Research have asked for sex
and gender in their proposals and
they're currently giving teeth to this
policy so far they just ask that you
include it but now they're looking to
make it ten percent of the grade for any
proposal the bill and melinda gates
foundation since 2008 has asked for
gender as a requirement for funding in
development work the foundation and
what's so great about their program is
that the program officers will help the
researcher if the researcher doesn't
have background in this area to
understand how they should do the work
and now the National Institutes the US
National Institutes of Health this is
what's coming this is the big one and
there's a lot of activity and excitement
about this in in fall 2014 the US NIH
announced that it would be crying sex
analysis in preclinical research so
that's in cells tissues and animals as
you probably know since 1993 we've had a
law a federal law that women and
underrepresented minorities must be
included in clinical trials and that has
always been a problem because you're
going to do the research on human women
but you haven't done it on mice and rats
earlier you haven't included the females
there so what kind of scientific
research is that it doesn't seem very
safe and then so that's policy at the
beginning of the research process to the
granting agencies encourage researchers
to include sex and gender analysis and
then also at the end of the research and
I'd be interested to know if any of your
journals are beginning to ask for this
but journals are now requiring that sex
and gender be included in the research
or it's not excellent research and so
the reviewers would have a problem with
it so I'm very interested to find out
what industry can do products and
systems that incorporate the smartest
aspects of gender can open new markets
prod
that meet the needs the complex needs of
diverse user groups enhance global
competitiveness and sustainability so
I'll be watching to see what Microsoft
does you can be a leader and I'll watch
for the fireworks to the north thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
