you
next up we have NYU Shanghai with you
can share for your school if you want
with adapt tool helping amputees use
tools directly without a prosthetic hand
as an intermediary step
hello we're the NYU Shanghai T and this
is our product adaptil I'm kilala
Burroughs from Washington DC in the
United States my name is my name is
Selena and I'm from two measly Russia my
name is Fred Wu I'm from Shanghai China
my name is watcher I'm from Beijing
China so this is Ella project adaptil
and that will help amputees to use tools
directly without using a prosthetic hand
as an intermediate step so our school is
located in China and in China the total
population of amputees is even bigger
than the total population of netherlands
in the biggest yes netherlands hi and
the biggest problem those impurities are
facing is seventy-three percent
unemployment rate because because most
of the jobs and careers rely heavily on
holding the tools so we had a chance to
interview an amputee who lost both of
his arms in the firework accident his
name is mr. Koo and he works in China
disabled persons Federation so mr. Koo
confirmed that such unemployment problem
does exist and he also showed us how he
comes up this creative ways on using the
tools in his daily life so in the next
three videos you would see him coming
his hair and also draw her Oh your
tongue India that's what tomato nose to
talk what does not oppose use it order
to the jacala
so the way he does it now he has this
wristband and he specs the hairbrush
inside however this process takes time
in connection is also really loose so
sometimes the hairbrush even falls down
and the way he draws now he is using
both of his arms and his drawings are
beautiful and as mr. cool notices that
the really one really important thing
that both of his toes the pencil and the
hairbrush like now is stability
stability is really important and thus
you may notice mr. Koo now he is not
using a prosthetic hand when you lose
your arm the obvious solution would be
to get a new one however in our research
we found out we found out that this
solution doesn't always work I'm young
to you more when you're watching share
that kids that tell you what what is
your tents that you want to each other
and the girls ni up here what so mr.
cool things and it's better not to use a
hand at all them to have a bad version
of it unfortunately most of the
prosthetic hands now they are not really
efficient they are not really reliable
and they're also quite expensive because
the conventional idea of designing a
prosthetic arm hot hand is designed
something that will look like a human
hand huh but in our research we found
out that in our daily life most of the
time we use our hand for holding the
tools and using them so we fold why just
don't we skip the grip right so in our
research we found that there's some
people already doing so so this man
actually I attached the chainsaw
directly to his arm with a ball joint we
love this idea but we also want to be
able to use multiple tools so we have we
looked at Aimee Mullins who has 12 peers
of prosthetic legs and we won't uses
this idea of interchangeable legs to
design a new prosthetic arm so here is
adapt to combining direct at
watching and interchangeability and it
worked like this you just wear it and so
how can this vein yeah right so how can
this thing helps mr. cool so in English
ah walking his garden trying to operate
a spade and he uses two arms and it is
super complicated but adapt to well make
everything so easy so we adapt to you
just put a tool into this to socket and
you click a button and the two as fasten
and this is how it works we designed
this mechanism so with adapt to like
work like this just one arm is enough
for effective operation with more
complex tools and more complex jobs you
need to be able to do more than just
hold the object that you're using
in this video we saw mr. Koo operating a
water hose and while most people are
able to just clench their fists and
order to operate it for mr. coop became
quite a complex affair where he had to
use both of his arms if we where he had
to use both of his arms but you can
imagine that if mr. Koo is trying to use
something a little more dangerous such
as a screwdriver or drill you wouldn't
really want to do such a thing because
it could be quite dangerous so with the
use of adapt tool where we plan on using
multiple sensors specifically
myoelectric sensors we're able to give
amputees or control them they've ever
had before my electric sensors read the
electrical signals that your muscles
give off when you contract them and
through adapt tool we plan on allowing
them to plant to map out specific
contractions to the actions that the
tool is taking in this video we see
someone who has used a pretty basic
prototype of my electric controller to
operate and turn on and turn off a drill
and if we apply this idea to mr. ku and
his garden hose then you can imagine
instead of having to use to arms to
operate he would instead be able to
simply clenched his fists and aim the
water out wherever he needs to water
okay just in case that an amputee wants
to implement even more complicated tools
you may need a configuration so we
decided to add a touch string on to
adapter but we're not very sure if it is
factor for an amputee to use touchscreen
until we see this lady boy chanel you
saw was a mop boy I see it's little no I
went search it nah you know it sounds it
don't know the shower i'm not sure need
somebody ambos oh my gosh it's okay so
here we can see mr. ku is using his cell
phone with which has a touch screen it
tells me that an amputee is it's
possible for an amputee to use
touchscreen so on the touchscreen of a
top true
sorry all right I'm sorry you can adjust
the settings of a specific tool for
example in the case of water hose you
can adjust the water pressure by just
moving the button on the touch screen
and the last thing I want to mention
about the adapt or is the sleeve just
sort of steve is the part where the
amputee puts his arm to adapt or it's
very close to a normal pathetic sleep
but we want to make it more comfortable
so we use a special material called
memory foam which can adjust its form to
the arm so something right here between
the arm and the adapter so the the
amputee won't feel any pressure even he
was adaptable for a long time and we
also have supported bands around the
shoulder so which to make sure that the
adapter won't fall out even even lift
towards heavy with all the talk of the
technical we don't want to lose sight of
the most important part of our project
the user so we asked mr. Koo what he
thought about it app to do it John don't
see my car is here appellant with
Collier you what your car from here for
later that you watch out watching us
initially logo you deposit mr. Carter da
ya da certo she knew below so you got
you said you the tourniquet on Shapiro's
are zombie even to the corner because
the three sorry Yasha to the logical
part time soon are now offering your
toes you funny she said papayaprincess
Parrikar cuddle not alone won't Allah
hey you know that's good chuckles
audience oh yeah hola thank you for
your time
are you shanghai who would like to go
first I see a hand not at all um so that
was a really fascinating really great
project and um I think actually we all
really need a round of applause for mr.
ku cuz what a brilliant kind of research
participant he was so good um you know I
think that was the one of the like huge
strengths of your of your project was
that you had this really interesting
person and you went into such detail
that you really saw and understood what
he was trying to do and so you know that
you came out with this kind of output of
basically your arm becoming you know
sort of more like a drill and drill bits
and that whole kind of idea of kind of
you know taking the hand out was was
really a really great kind of step
forward i really like that sort of
almost like kind of kept at the end
reminding me of those multi colored pens
you get you know the green bit pokes out
and changing the colors i thought that
was really really lovely and that you
know also the technical thought through
with things like using my electricity
and how would I control it and what what
you know what are you trying to do so I
thought it was really impressive and I'm
really interesting and kind of trying to
solve a very fascinating problem like
for one very specific person but you
could see great you know the equivalent
of Holland was going to be the
Netherlands was going to be doing it so
that's great well done all right so you
guys have seen inspector gadget it's a
mate it mean this is the kind of thing
that you see and you sort of go this
doesn't exist already I can't believe it
doesn't exist already so for you guys to
come up with it is you know both all the
criteria you want to look for right it's
um it just feels right and so it seems
like a thing in the world that will make
a lot of lives better so congrats that's
that's really really that's the whole
goal right
great work yeah I echo both those
sentiments I think mr. Koo is just the
most amazing find and i think i love how
when you encountered him you i don't
know the full genesis of the story but
like I think you went from designing a
tool for a single amputee to one that
would work for a double amputee which is
you know helping upping the challenge
even more for yourself and again this is
why doesn't this exists is sort of like
this puzzling question and it's
definitely something that needs to exist
it sort of feels you know empowering and
so many different and diverse scenarios
for so many people so great job great
concept really simple concept super
challenging execution would love to see
more prototyping you know and and
something to evaluate for mr. ku and get
some iteration going in that design but
the concept itself super strong so great
great user research so well done
any questions from the audience you
could have sold everybody in the
audience one of those it was
unbelievable I was I just I was reaching
for my wallet it was so good I totally
agree no questions okay thank you so
much guys each year microsoft research
