just wanted to mention the posters there
is on work related to noise and noise
sensitivity work started by our debt so
for those of you who are more
interesting that they might want to have
a look and now our next speaker is russ
lyon who will give a whiteboard thanks
Christian so I'm told that I have five
minutes then is scheduled hopefully I'll
end on time I'm talking about hyperfine
i graph limits work of our dead this is
one of his last topics although Omer
this morning introduced what it was
about although he was mainly concerned
with the particular case and Oded last
solo paper was called hyperfine and
graphs graph limits and that's what I
want to talk about the notion of this
convergence discrete limits in graphs is
I believe do to be TYIN or dead although
it was discovered independently by some
others shortly afterwards so let me just
remind you briefly what it is here's
just one example we might have the
square lattice as a limit graph now
these graphs are actually have to be
routed although for this graph it
doesn't matter which vertex you take as
root and this would be a limit of for
example big square portions finite
graphs of the square lattice where you
take a uniformly chosen route and you
look at the neighborhoods of that route
and you see that your what you'll see is
exactly the neighborhoods here unless
you're close to the boundary but very
few vertices are close to the boundary
you also get the same limit if you took
a square graphs on the tour's a finer
and finer grit now by contrast if you
take a regular tree and you take a big
portion of that and take a uniform route
you will not get as a limit the rooted
tree because most vertices are near the
boundary opposite to this case and
things look very different there on the
other hand if you take a random regular
graph or expand their graphs graphs with
large girth and take a random route you
will get in
limit a rooted regular tree now the
limit will not necessarily be a fixed
graph it can be a random graph with a
root ok and I'm going to give a general
theorem of dads but if you have not
familiar with this concept you probably
just want to think about the case where
you have a fixed graph now and I'm also
going to assume that all the degrees
everywhere are bounded by some number M
now the question that oded looked at in
this paper is when is the limit graph or
limit measure concentrated on small
graphs like this as opposed to big
graphs like the tree in other words a
minha bowl vs not amenable now it turns
out that actually another word for mina
bowl in this context is hyper finite
which is decades old and before i get
into the definitions that we just
mentioned that the result which is a
fairly abstract result that are dead
proved in this paper although it's quite
interesting was actually used by him eat
I anisotropy era in a paper where they
applied a slightly more quantitative
version of the result to what's called
property testing in computer science I
won't go into that but actually had a
fairly concrete application so it turns
out that the key notion was invented by
gabor ellic about a sequence of graphs
or more generally a family but for us
the sequence will be enough so he
defined the family or sequence and these
are finite graphs
which we're thinking of is what we're
interested in taking a limit of so the
family itself is called hyper finite so
they're already finite so what does it
mean to be hyper find it there's some
sort of uniformity about how they're put
together you can break them up into
finite pieces in uniform way so in other
words for all epsilon greater than 0
there's just a finite k and now is the
uniformly at n de Graaff GN is K epsilon
pi pure finite and what does that mean
there exists a set of edges s in GN just
if I delete those edges that take them
away then I'll get all components of
size at most K but I haven't deleted
very much so in other words the number
of edges and actually we're normalizing
by the number of vertices of G and is
less than epsilon so I'm not deleting
very much and all the connected
components which I'm calling clusters of
G minus s have at most K vertices
okay now it's not so clear that's
somewhat complicated definition you know
what graphs are hyper finite well
actually one example that you can give
is the family of planar graphs planar
finite graphs are the whole family is
hyper finite there's a theorem computer
science called the planar separator
theorem which tells you this and in fact
the property testing paper that i
mentioned the the primary example is
clarity testing planarity but they
mention of other properties as well yes
no that's the uniformity ok what you
know what is what's not an epsilon for
each epsilon is the small epsilon you
get a bigger k you're going to have to
take now right so we are interested in
taking limits of such things now it's
easy to see that if we take a limit of a
hyper finite sequence if the limit
exists randomly limit exists then the
limiting measure or graph also inherits
a similar property in other words
remember we're taking GN and a uniform
route and s is sitting somewhere there's
a fixed s I fix that plan fix a and
there's a fixed s that witnesses that's
ok now taking uniform route I get a
random routed graph with this deleted or
marked edge set s somewhere right and it
breaks up my random rooted graph which
is the same graph GN into random pieces
now if I take a limit of this you know
what I see locally is how the limit is
defined right now
if GN has a limit that doesn't mean the
GN with s also has a limit but I could
take a subsequence that will still have
a limit point a limit and then I'll see
a random s inside my random rated graph
it won't be very much of the graph
because what is this statement mean this
says if I take a random vertex the
chance that is near s is small also
Oliver all the clusters have size at
most K that's certainly preserved in
limit k is fixed so what I'll get in the
limit is also some random deletion of a
small number of edges small density
ridges are leaving only components the
size of most K now so what a dead did is
formalize that notion and prove that we
has a characterization those are exactly
the limits of hyper finite sequences in
other words any such thing is a limit of
hyper finite sequences with the Congress
so let me say what the deads definition
is so I have a measure mew probability
measure unrooted graphs and the
definition will be similar to like this
of what an agent to define is K epsilon
hyperfine act and then it's called
hyperfine I do for all epsilon there is
this a case such as its k epsilon i ever
finite now even if mu is just a fixed
graph with a fixer root the ass might
not be fixed I still will that s to be
random yes
she injects in this definition here yeah
it's uniform and n is it fits all the
same epsilon K work so that mean
distinctively just encounter yes well
assets inside amgn so it says for every
and it says that existed yes well if you
want yeah that's an if you want some
hand over the sequence of the in there I
don't see the index and so on to the
safer well shows up now okay so s might
now be random doesn't that be fixed so
that's going to mean a probability
measure so call new and it's going to be
an adjective i need to put in which i'll
postpone for a moment so it's probably
measure new now new was unrooted grass g
and i'll call all the river so now i
have s so new is on triples g 0 and s
well the new law of geo is mu what I'm
turning with s is a set of edges in G so
I'm just going in turn the conditions
now this next thing is really about how
often s touches the root
so I look at the degree of the root ng
with s deleted on average okay that's
less than 2 Epsilon there's a two
because it can come from either end
point I won't go into the details but
it's really equivalent to that if you
just took a random route there and
finally the last thing you almost surely
all clusters of G minus s have it most k
vertices okay now there's a space for an
adjective here and that is if you
remember from I forget which taco was
foolish talk yesterday the condition of
you know modularity came up for
percolation well it turns out that you
know modular is also defined in this
context finite graphs are in a sense you
know modular already and that's
preserved you know modular is a mass
transport concept and I don't think I
have time to go into it if I do I'll say
what it is at the end and so my
assumption will be that mu is you know
modular and new also is required to be
universal yes in the integrity war mix
of degree of old in gmail
as opposed to realness degree in s or
some test is what I'm deleting Oh what
do you want that to come on Chris you're
right yes thank you
you
yeah thanks um
this graph is definitely you know
modular kata graphs the inter modular so
if any if you're not familiar with the
concept it's just going to be
automatically satisfied and you have to
worry about it but it's always true the
limits of finite graph sequences are you
know modular so we if we want to
characterize what we get is limits we
have to put in you know modular anyway
and so dead serum is that so first of
all it's easy that a limit of
high-profile graph sequence is hyperfine
it with this definition and a dead serum
is the converse anytime you have any
measure which satisfies this that is for
all epsilon it's there exists a case
such as its k epsilon i prefer night
then and you have a graph sequence which
tends to it then actually that graph
sequence itself is already hyper finite
you cannot get as a small limit you
cannot get a small limit by three graphs
so let me write down the film in fact
somewhat quantitative version of it
already appears in this paper just with
the K and epsilon oh yes I wanted to say
thank you
okay so I haven't defined what i mean by
mean well but they're various ways to
define it you don't you don't really
need to be explicit about how big things
are you one way to define it is there is
a unit modular way breaking it up into
finite pieces not with a bounded size
with taking away just a small amount in
the case where you have a fixed graph
that's transitive it just means there
are big pieces with small battery so you
can just think about that context okay
number of partitions on being there's a
tricky subtle point I don't want to get
into about that but it's not conditioned
no it's different
okay if mu is K epsilon X or finite and
GN has randomly limit mule then roll
large n GN is K epsilon tilde hyper
finite where epsilon tilde is equal to 4
m epsilon plus 6 times n plus 1 epsilon
times log of 1 over epsilon
so how would you show that given any
graph sequence with this limit you can
and the fact that you can break up the
limit in a nice way means that you can
break up the sequences the finer graphs
in a similar way that's the issue and so
that had a very nice idea how is to show
that so the definition of being a up
some type refined it means there's some
witnesses just measure knew well that
new you may not be able to use on the GM
he wants to find a different witness
created from knew that you will be able
to apply or emulate on the GM so what
kind of measure just think of the fixed
graph what kind of measure here would be
good but you so good that you could
essentially apply it to finite grass
which look like it well what does it
mean for final graph to look like it
means that looks like it on big
neighborhoods this means that what
you're doing here should really only
depend on a big neighborhood so it
should be a local decision about what
you remove so what do you want
somebody's going to do is take the given
new and use it to create another one
which is just local then he can do it
and that's okay so that's the first very
nice idea and then of course the second
thing is how do you carry it out
that's not as hard I think it's maybe
the first idea but anyway oh and let me
just mention before giving the idea that
this is similar to what's used in the
theory of random regular graphs people
often want to count various things in
random regular graphs there asymptotics
and they sometimes want to create things
to provide lower bounds the existence of
certain things and the way they very
very often do it is by taking starting
with I ID numbers on all the vertices a
and using that locally to decide what to
do and after a few steps in fact you can
also do that on the tree a regular tree
and start with those same labels and do
the same kind of thing and essentially
of the late and they even mention that
sometimes so essentially it's a similar
idea where you're doing local
information on a limit that you could
also have done on the finite press ok so
let me give the proof I need a little
bit of notation how much know
but we'll see how far we get okay so k
of 0 is the cluster of the root and G
minus s now here are some of the key
definitions so the probability that the
cluster of the root is a given fixed
finite graph k given the graph Ruta
graph g 0 or actually we're just looking
at vertex sets so when i say the cluster
it's really just the vertices in the
cluster and we're only going to look at
k of size the most big cave size the
most little cave because all the
clusters are size of most K now that's a
little tricky to define in the general
setting but if you just think of G as a
fixed graph then that's perfectly fine
but just I just have some vertices for
those four and the chance that when I
take away s that's the cluster of the
road ok
now the problem that of course it
depends on s the randomness here is on s
right and that is not local or we're
certainly not given as local at all so
the idea is to transform this to a local
thing so that's going to depend on some
radius R P tilde sub are fkn
so we're going to have some large are
and all the things that within distance
R of my given K that's probably not
exactly accurate but anyway we're given
a K&amp;amp;N and we're not given what the graph
is outside although for a fixed graph it
doesn't vary but we're not given what s
is outside down either only what's
inside n okay and so r is going to be so
it's the our neighborhood of K now as R
tends to infinity what happens we're
getting more and more information we're
getting all this information in the end
and so this converges
I'll show you and that's what we're
going to use for approximation will take
an hour large enough depending on the
epsilon we're given at the beginning to
make that close so i think i'll have
time at least to give the definitions of
how it works even though i won't be able
to go the proof that it works so then it
mean exercise to work it out ok so for
big ko Sai's the most little k i'm going
to delete or i'm going to choose these
sets that at random where or deleting
their boundaries at random so I'm going
to X ok we have a newly random variable
that means six values 0 1 they're going
to be independent of each other given
geo if if in fact we have a random
written graph and the probability that
is one given geo will be well I'm going
to stop writing the are always going to
be well we're going to have to choose
our later but i can write it so really
what we want is the probability of peace
P tilde of k st. is determined by K so
I'm not going to write it x log of 1
over epsilon well that might be bigger
than one and so we'll have to take the
minimum with one and there's a
multiplication by two just for
convenience okay so that's the
definition and now what are the what's
the new s
so every time xk turned out to be one
consider all the edges in the boundary
of such a cake that's the edge bander
DCB of k all the edges that go from k to
the outside okay those are going to be
in our new set that we're going to
remove and that's good because we never
remove such such we never remove edges
here what's inside besides the most k
but of course we have to worry about
what happens elsewhere and we're just
going to take everything else oh well
okay i need another notation first of
all these are the insides w and then all
the other things we're just going to
remove everything that we need to to
make everything of size at most K so all
edges still there's all they're just
incident to any vertex on w and then
finally s prime is f Union F Delta
so that's the definition so everything
so it's clear that when we remove that s
Prime all the components of size at most
K because either they have size of most
K because we removed boundaries here or
if they remove that way we removed it
all the neighbors so set-asides the most
one what we need to show so what what
has to be shown is that the degree here
is the most this to epsilon tilde and
well you have to do some calculations
you know these are independent so a lot
of the calculations are no hard but yeah
it's not so hard after this is you have
to be a little favor but it's not so
hard but anyway i'm at a time so thanks
for listening
there
some other motivation Oh a des
additional motivation i believe was not
did not have anything to do a proper
testing Gobber Alec was visiting and I
think asked the question although you
Chris and Jennifer probably know a
little bit more about how it arose I
think gamma has a different version is a
different formulation of celebrity a box
is crap sequence which and deformed some
abstract sort of notion among who
normally standard logic logic pro and in
his version is just the other way around
the direction or data to prove is
actually easy and the other direction
but it's I mean it's obviously an
interesting question in which sense to
these this property's carry on the
chosen internet limit
or the last questions okay so we have
three minute break
give it very quick because people ask so
little sneak preview just to show that
it exists so there's lots of pictures
and you can give it to your children to
read and so is it on your web page it is
a gonna be it's sort of you know I'm in
the last stage of revising it so it has
many some sections on the circle packing
and I gonna put it on the archive in
about a week or so so you have to play
soccer ban on the flight okay so that's
just
in mode again but there's so many many
topics that I thought about I mean I had
to choose from and it would have been a
lot of fun to talk about but so i should
like to say that doing mathematics with
our dad was like playing tennis with a
with a champion and I mean not while
you're not being a champion yourself so
they're these boss coming and then you
know you try to hit them back but in the
end all the balls are in your court and
every once in a while you get one and
you're the back but then it comes back
at you full blast and so there's
actually a lot of unfinished projects
that I'm now scrambling to you know try
to finish and so essentially i picked
the oldest one to talk about today and
lets the joint work with curry and of
course we did and well there is another
reason why i chose that topic because it
shows one aspect that I think did not
come out so so well he so far which was
an important aspect of its work which is
his computing skill so he wasn't only a
gifted mathematician but he was also a
very very good programmer and he loved
playing with a computer and that was an
essential part I mean we all know the
pictures that that he drew but maybe we
don't know how much actually how much
brain power went into these pictures and
so before starting doing that I want to
do so one photo I think everybody
expects me to give some anecdotes but
I'm not sure if I really want to I
wanted to at least this picture this is
a dead on the top of anybody recognizes
Mike maybe it's so it's a little little
too home a peek and there was a climb
that I think we both enjoyed and that
was such an unconventional person etc
such an amazing ability to to question
things I mean things that we totally
take on faith and for granted where we
don't think twice and a dead would
question and try a new approach and so
what he did on that trip we had to camp
at a foot of a glacier and but that
tried on that hike to not I mean he it
wasn't that he forgot he didn't bring a
sleeping bag he said he want to try how
it is you know
he had that theory that you know if he
just wraps himself in all the stuff we
brought he is going to be warm enough
and everybody who worked with him
probably knows he had these amazing
numbers of ideas and many of them did
not quite work out but you know it
fractured this was not a good idea he
was miserably cold that night but still
we had a we had a very good time so now
I'd like to do some math and this is
almost on the level so first I want to
give the the motivation but I think it
needs a lot of motivation so eventually
will come to some of you might not
understand the motivation and then don't
vary in the end it's going to be very
simple and almost like a recreational
math but I should like to draw one
picture if you wonder what is a quasi
circus oh I give definitions that you
might not understand but the quality
circle is just the topological circle in
the plane and these objects so basically
the geometric definition is whenever you
take two points then the the smaller arc
so they don't need to be rectifiable so
I don't want to talk about length I just
want to speak about diameter but the
smaller arc shouldn't go too far away so
the diameter of this arc you should not
be much more than the distance of the
endpoints so so what is another quality
circle would be a thing like this
something that has a cusp but then I so
here you can to take two points that are
very nearby but the curve sort of
escapes it has a large diameter as
compared to the endpoints of the two
points and so those of you working with
these random curves know that these
random curves they're not quality circus
but they sort of are they are like
quality circles with a small probability
of seeing bad bad cusp so some of what
that's insights actually what goes into
his proof of lube erase random walk
scaling limit being a simple curve it's
somewhat motivated by at least the
insights that he had from working with
quality circles have we done okay so
they appear as limit sets of quasi books
in groups or I really look I mean in
many many ways but so let's just give a
definition here so there's a conjecture
of carry asteroids that celebrated a
paper on the area distortion
and so all that says don't read the
reader to carefully but the host of
dimension of a quality circle I just
write it in this way I want to take one
of these quality circles and the host of
dimension is should be at most 1 plus K
squared some somewhere we need to
measure the roundedness how how bad
these bottlenecks are there is a
parameter called K and I explain the
second quarter so that's a technical
definition and don't a very well if you
don't know cause I confirm maps you'll
not understand this but there's a
simpler way to express it and that's the
point that we all understand it's about
holomorphic motions and equivalent
conjecture is this take a set the
interval negative 11 and move each point
holomorphic alee so think of a point
here and we have a time parameter but
time is actually now think of it as a as
complex value at time in the unity so we
have a timer a parameter that varies in
the unit disk and the motion of each
point is an analytic function of time
and it should be emotion so if I take
two different points they will not
collide they will never collide so the
definition of holomorphic moisture is
very simple so we think of it as each
point moves at the first coordinate the
second is the time coordinate so we
function from space sums time into the
plane and the axioms are so in the time
parameter it should be analytic find
each point moves analytic and the space
parameters injective two points never
collide and of course the motion starts
at time zero with a line segment so we
just move points okay so then in that
phrase determine that the conjecture is
it's equivalent to saying we never have
such a holomorphic motion then a time k
what i see so the motion of the interval
at time K has housed of dimension at
most 1 plus K squared so we'll see in a
second word relevant sets are but so
this project the motivation comes from
studying this conjecture and we had some
upper bounds and then there were some
some improvements and then other people
found better in the end of the of this
line of results that I won't mention
their smell of proof actually the sharp
theorem the upper bound so stars proved
that actually that whenever you move a
line segment holomorphic alee the host
of dimension is never more
plus x squared but that leaves and the
question open what is a lower amount is
it really sharp and to date it's still
acting the best known estimators where
we go we don't get 1 plus K squared but
we get a 1 plus essentially point 6 K
squared so we exhibit 1 holomorphic
motion after line segment that gives you
a dimension close to a 1 plus K squared
so maybe I should first show a picture
of a holomorphic motion so I this is the
motivation if you don't like it you can
forget everything because you'll see the
new problem it's going to be totally
independent recreational marathon style
so when I talk about examples of
holomorphic motions okay so one example
is actually coming from Julia sets of
quadratic polynomials and so here it's a
little picture and actually here i
should like to say you can see on a to
experience what it is ok so when
eastmont prowess affront from hating he
saw my now at the end announcer of this
talk you said i might be interested in
this program that is you and Alexei
where I can guys wrote and this program
illustrates very nicely some holdem of
emotion and here is the program again so
the parameter is it's the red point and
you can move it that's the time
parameter and the set is actually the
Julia set of the update of the
polynomial the red point is at the
moment as a point of view on the complex
plane when we move it around some
parameters C and the white set is the
Julia set of Z squared plus C so when I
move this around so this is what we get
so you see that Julia said and as long
as you stay inside that main cardioid
you know it's a simple curve and when
you go out and there is something funny
happen some parabolic employees and
stuff and then you see different sets so
it's the boundary of the my main kar di
things go bad but anyway it's a theorem
basically it's a money sets are even
that's where holomorphic motions were
invented that if you stay inside this
this cardioid the things stay nice
curves and they move follow more fickle
e ok so another example
it's actually snowflakes and that's what
the talk is going to be about eventually
I mean you so so a snowflake is you
think of a line segment and you replace
it like this and then each line segment
gets replaced by a smaller scale copy of
it and you proceed the limit set of that
it's going to be the snowflake but we
want to make the snowflake depending
holomorphic alee on one parameter P and
so that one parameter P how does it come
I mean how do we create it so now I want
to explain how to make a holomorphic
motion out of a snowflake and so I'll
show an animation then you'll see right
away how it looks but so here is how it
goes a true so start with a line segment
and instead of doing there's this
picture of the snow flag right away I
break it down into two parts the first
step is I replace that the line segment
by a triangle and the tip is going to be
the parameter and then in the next step
I replace each of these two line
segments by again the triangle like this
and then each of these four line
segments now gets replaced by another
triangles and each step you double the
number of the number of edges but it's
probably best to just not very too much
about it but you just look at this
picture so we have a simple way of
generating the sort of one generation of
the snowflake and then if you just
looked at each even one you see the sort
of the standard of the region alright so
that is best encoded by two maps there
are two contractions f0 and f1 and so
these are maps linear maps of the plane
that map the point negative 11 to the
points well negative 1 P and one piece
to contractions and they generate a
limit set okay so here is um so the main
thing I want to talk about is a debt
program that he called Jordan that
analyzes the limit set and for instance
if you if you if you put in Jordan minus
there is an L that you can't erase see
here point to point two five let gifts
the limit set off well this dynamical
system where the parameter P is point
two plus i times point two five
and the program of course I mean
everybody can write a program like that
that's not the point but it it tells you
tells you more so first before I tell
you what the program actually does I
want to argue that the snowflake is a
holomorphic motion the same that I
described to start with a with a line
segment which is P equals zero and then
the snowflake actually moves holomorphic
alee and this we can see best if we look
at a at a few generations so that's that
the dotted one is a second approximation
this one is now the fourth one and we
look at these these corner points and
they do not change under subsequent
refinements so once they are set then
the next step I just change things here
but these guys are definitely point on
that snowflake so then it's very easy to
see you have I mean the only parameters
this tip here this P of the very first
triangle and all these corners are
actually pulling normals in P and
polynomials of course holomorphic and
the rest of the curve are just limit
points of these corner points or the
limits of polynomial so they're analytic
too so we do get a get a set that is
moving where each point moves
analytically in peace but now the
question is of course is it a
holomorphic motion and the answer is
well if these points don't collide if
this thing doesn't sell in this sector
so we should ask ourselves the problem
is find the set of parameters where this
limit said is a non self in the SEC ting
a simple curve and at this point I guess
everybody can join again you know some
of you might have once if this is
nothing to do with probability and
that's like we're dead and I also we
spoke sort of different languages had
different sort of interests and they do
remember the very first time when I met
him and so he came to talk that I gave
in san diego in 91 and I asked
afterwards so so I knew that he wasn't
exactly complex analyst and so I asked
it made sense to me and you said yeah
you could understand everything he
didn't say anything else and so I asked
him some more you know if you liked it
and he said well he doesn't find it
particularly interesting
so he was very honest he was very gentle
very nice he wouldn't have said it
himself but once pressed for a common
who know he was also honest and here to
the original problem was maybe not the
most interesting one but this problem he
actually liked so this one really
interested him and so then he he started
to working on trying to understand that
set and so that is first it's very easy
to see may be here at this point I
should show a little a little computer
animation and you can see better what
this set looks like ok so let's go
this is not a debt problem this is a
finished program so here that the disc
is a set of interesting parameters the
red dot is P and what you see here is an
approximation to the to the limit set to
the curve and so if we we draw more than
we see see this is a curve and you see
you have to go quite close to the
boundary to see that it's door itself
self intersecting but as long as this
curve is not much self intersecting its
we have a volume of emotion okay so no
that's not true so that's exactly the
point I so this is what I want to do a
now when is itself intersecting for what
parameters so it's sort of easy to see
that outside the disk it will be self
intersecting you can see just by drawing
Peter by computing the house of
dimension has to be at least two very
well there are many ways to see that the
outside cannot give simple curves but
the sort of the computer-aided theorem
says the disk of radius point 9 1 so a
large part of the set is actually where
it's a we have a simple curve and this
is exactly the set you so the black set
is the set of parameters for which the
curve is none self intersecting the gray
set is the set of points where well
where it's probably intersecting ok so
what the program actually does is if you
take a point it returns it tells you if
if the curve is simple it says yes it's
a simple curve so it gives a test that
tells you you have a simple curve if
you're outside it's it's only says it's
probably not that the test works works
one way and I want to say a few words
how the test works and so it was a bit
of a surprise that you actually do get
such a large set of parameters for which
you have a simple curve there are other
models of two generators sort of semi
groups I think it's because a barnsley
set where you just ask yourself whether
you get connected sizes so there is a
big industry it's a very special special
problem but
yeah very good question maybe I should
how much time do I have any weird nine
or ten minutes okay so i do have enough
time but maybe i skipped forward to and
then i'll come back here the answer to
your question is that's the only
probability that's going to appear here
probably not so ok let's go forward so
the problem actually was also able to
and i actually don't quite know how or
dead did it because it had the problem
has many virtues but it doesn't really
scan for islands but he found this
island here but unfortunately so the
problem is able to prove given that you
assume enough accuracy prom is able to
prove that for instance this point gives
a simple curve ok the program at present
does not prove that a certain curve does
not give a simple curve but
theoretically it's easier to prove non
non simple so if you really wanted to
you could write a program that actually
shows that this is an island but this we
haven't really or dead hasn't really
done and you see that it's quite quite
fine maybe i'll show you the picture
i'll skip forward first this is what the
program claims to be a simple curve ok
and it doesn't look very simple but then
it's a limit of non simple curves and so
if you look at a certain approximation
to it so now this should be sort of
before the limit the curve that is
supposed to be simple and at least the
beginning looks good but then it doesn't
look so clear what this is going to me
but here you start seeing that there's
at least a good chance that it is simple
so it goes like I think it goes like
this and then it goes around like this
and you see at least that it's very
delicate this is like the pre pre
stochastic face way where you have a
well like an SLE for where you don't
quite know whether it's going to self
touch another but that's what it is ok
so let's go backwards a little bit and
so I guess what I want to say is one of
the debts strong traits was to also to
hear to such a quest
I think it's not really theoretically
possible I mean it's probably not easy
to come up impossible to come up with a
formula even the question of
connectedness who knows but he just sat
down and started to work on a computer
program and before I come to that maybe
I should answer i should say quickly how
this actually gives us this dimension
estimate but that's sort of very easy
for for the expert i mean as i said if i
saw in the black set in that jordan set
every curve is a simple curve so if i
restrict my motion to that set then I do
have a holomorphic motion and how do i
restrict to it just by conformally
mapping a disk to this one and changing
time by that conformal about that
conform map college fear so if I
conformally make that thing around and I
have a holomorphic motion of a disk and
then it's very easy to compute the house
stuff dimension of that of that self
similar set oh it's just a similarity
dimension and when you put it all
together and then out comes it comes a
lower bound for the house of dimension
and you just the in radius of that set
gives you control over the conformal map
and then let's let's an exercise for an
undergraduate complex analysis
essentially well let's say graduate but
so this is not very difficult so the
main part is really to find that find
the radius the inner radius of it say
okay all right maybe we should stare at
this for a little longer and then we
could ask yourself how would be how
would we test if a curve is is simple
and i don't know i mean when i was a
student and saw the snowflake and try to
prove myself that just that just the
symmetric snowflake it's a simple curve
i think this is not trivial i mean it's
easy it's a simple exercise but it took
me a few minutes than to use the
symmetry but here we have non symmetric
situation here it's very different so
how can you possibly attach a tech this
with this problem and here's a little
Emma that or debt found it's it's sooo
many it's very very easy actually looks
a bit long as I should say where this
comes from Oded worked quiet quite a lot
on this I mean he had
that's not the mid-90s actually but so
he even wrote a documentation to that
program and so this is the documentation
but some point I'll put this problem
also on the web I had Andre greater
student from ladies from Michigan help
me getting the program running again
because the c++ some standards have
changed our libraries when it's
supported so there's a long
documentation that explains how it works
and so I was working through this in
order to to write up well okay so so
somewhere here some of the little
observations that you had are actually I
mean all of them are sort of easy to
prove once you know them but you wonder
how we actually got them and so here is
one of them this one is easy too easy to
find so this is the test actually how
can we test if a given curve is simple I
mean one of these self similar curves
and so here I haven't drawn the full
curve but imagine so you remember the
process that comes out of their self
similarities so we should think we
refine each of these sets so then we see
as a copy of the curve here here here
and here these four sets and I label
them just 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 just because I
compose I have compositions of these
maps f0 f1 and so that if I if I don't
take the line segments but the actual
limit said I want to call this one s 0 1
and this one is SC or as you're just
disguising and so the test only requires
you to see if in these two pictures this
part intersects with that one if this
one intersects with that one of course
it's not simple so test if they're not
intersecting and test of this one does
not intersect that one and that one
doesn't intersect that one that gives
you the three tests of that one
generation okay and here you have the
same for the third generation just test
okay this part and that one is already
dealt with just tested this one doesn't
disick this there's not bad and there's
not bad so three more tests you have six
tests and tests those and then if if you
decide that they are not intersecting
then you're done
okay that requires a little argument and
when I try to work this out i had a
teeny little bit of a problem and it's
it's sort of easy how would you prove
that you have a curve with certain self
similarities and that this test works
and in the end of the day that's a nice
little exercise to do but the solution
at least my way of seeing that is to say
that here at that tip what you see if
you take these four arcs that this is
actually similar to the whole set which
you sort of expect by self similarity
but it's not not not so clear because
what you see here is sort of this is
sort of the right part of the curve and
this is on the left part so it's like
when you chop up the curve in the middle
but you put the right to the left and
the left to the right but together they
still give this the old thing and the
scaling factors are different so
actually I would like to ask or dead how
you saw that I can just compute it very
easily that this is true you can draw
pictures and verify it you can just
compute this point say again okay so how
do you actually execute the test but so
using that similarity it's very easy to
see here that if the curve were so you
take any two points on the curve and you
ask yourself okay so the best way is
probably too I haven't quite explained
how the curve should be parameterize so
the tip I make the curve at time one
half and this one is it the oh sorry if
if I want a parameterize it by negative
1 1 well okay so maybe let's let's
answer your question first the test
depends on how many tests to have to
perform I mean here I would have to know
the limit set and this i don't know i
don't know the set at the beginning it's
a limiting object but what i can do is i
take that's then the next idea of a dead
sea calls at the superball so you take
the super bowl the disk that is mapped
by both similarities into itself so you
take find the smallest disks that it's
mapped into itself by both both
similarities maybe I should just show
the proof by
sure so then you apply all these maps f
00 f 0 1 and so on and so you get these
disks if you know that the corresponding
disks are disjoint then you are done
because the the arcs are inside those
disks sort of by definition of the disk
and if if the test fails in the first
level then you go again you do do a few
more interest and so on and when the
disks become very small then at some
point when you reach the threshold
accuracies pressure then you stop and
you don't know but if the tests
terminates and if the desert is joined
then you know that you're that you're
fine so that's why the test is only sort
of one way and the number of steps is
sort of you know depending on how far
you are from the boundary of the dough
it said okay so i should should come to
the to the end here but we already
discussed yeah that that set is is quite
complicated it looks quite interested
seems to have islands the corresponding
sets at least in these islands would be
interesting to study and I think that's
all I want to set about say what that
debt said I asked myself also I went
back to okay so that was one project
where our debts used a heavy sort of i
mean so some nice ideas and some some
heavy programming to just make some
progress on some question but he'd made
so many pictures why not pictures of SLE
and so he actually wants wrote to me
though there's a debt statement that he
did he did attempt some mathematical
pictures of SLE but she didn't trust
them and they look very unstable and
then I actually try to do some reusing
using pictures using something related
to the Louvre night equation and explain
that to a dead and he was very gentle
and nice he said I hope so you know that
the pictures were nice he said I'm
excited to see the pictures I don't want
to ruin your optimism but looking at the
simulations blah blah and so he
describes this experience that with a
Looby race random walk we don't know if
there are loops before they could prove
it and so I think later actually did
trust the pictures to some extent so I
think he was happy that he thought he
has seen some honors as early pictures
and finally those who have actually
worked with him probably
know that at least in the SLE world he
was extremely Glossop with Mathematica
and he just wrote these amazing
notebooks where he did all sorts of
computations very quickly and then of
course then you can check them by hand
but so here he describes something
interesting I hear he said okay so he
learned from from Sosa in SLE sometimes
have this PDE s and then you need to
find a solution and at least you get sub
solution and so on so first he used the
computer a lot to find this decision but
Mathematica often doesn't like to solve
equations but so then he says he learned
from from playing with it and seeing
solutions that it's actually better to
guess it and the last sentence is it's
interesting he says after he saw a few
of these I mean he said I got bold and
instead of trying to coax Mathematica
into solving I decided I just guessed
the solution up to one or two free
parameters and it's so far always worked
so you were sort of excited that he was
actually sort of beating the computer
was doing better better by just guessing
it and verifying so I guess this is all
I want to say I would just want to
conclude by by saying that I'm when I
first met Odette in san diego and 91 he
introduced himself as a circle packer
and i thought to myself i knew a little
bit of circulating the basing i thought
to myself this guy is a little bit
narrow was it didn't tell that was
certainly the biggest misjudgment of my
of my life and so looking at this
picture I think I he showed as a
direction and in many ways and I trusted
him in both in mathematics and also in
other questions so in mathematics
sometimes I did not check his
computations and most of the time i did
but once or twice I just trusted him and
also on this hike actually on the way
back down you know I just trust him I
was wiped out and we were there glaciers
where crevasses will open snow bridges
he was leading and I was just thinking
okay and actually whisker he was paying
attention I went over one snow bridge
which
gave way and I think my freedom I should
thank him for teaching with that so much
about that was very aware he wasn't self
arrests and everything was was was just
finer which is me just trusting the dead
and there was a great thing he was a
rock in my world and mathematics and I
miss him thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
