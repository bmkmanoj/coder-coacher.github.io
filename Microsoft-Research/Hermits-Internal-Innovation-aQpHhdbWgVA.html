hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
I
thinking about this and thinking about
permits and potentially
mr. coming visual earlier today thinking
about adding them in potentially
profiling this archetype of misfit and
really saying we put so much
on external innovation but what can we
learn
well that have actually pioneered
methods of internal innovation and it
seems closely aligned in some ways to
talk them into it because these people
voluntarily
themselves from society to have his
experiences and this one I treated my
friend Steve and I decided that we
wanted to create these personas and you
go to conferences and I totally failed
to do this but here I promise to do this
and that is we have this one risotto
called the Amish futuristic on fences
like these and tries to predict what's
trending and what's new protect
landscape while having this whole new
version for attack they also not not
being exposed to anything
and so thinking about character like off
uterus I wanted to really explore what
someone like that dirty just about
provision and I have to be honest I
don't know i only have six minutes but
i'm really hoping that some of you
anyone who's had a really intense
solitary experience or has experimented
with things that may be approached the
permit lifestyle or have ideas about how
you know that kind of voluntary leave of
absence from society actually make you
more innovative i really love to hear
from you and in the next 24 hours a lot
of a business case around this for this
being this persona producing some
powerful lessons then this could be a
chapter in the misfit economy that we
were here at this conference and really
the last thing that I'll say is I grew
up right outside of cambridge mass so
slightly or walnut and boldin have
always had
for me and I've been reading a lot about
thorough reason and the kinds of things
that he fought us and what we
look to people like him poor and it's
interesting to look at what that
personality represents someone who had
this intense desire for
her intense desire for self-reliance who
was called by a friend of his louisa may
alcott you know said this thing about
him basically saying he was unfit for
society that his perch his virtue would
remain intact but let's go so hideous
and ugly to bed
what is someone like that
the canonical book about actually
getting to really interrogate yourself
and getting to know yourself what can
someone like that teach you and this is
through the misfit economy experience
I've been speaking to all these people
who have spent time in prison who's
spent time in solitary confinement and
who know themselves and have this level
of insight into themselves that is so
much more profound and the kinds of
dialogues you know I have with myself or
I see other people have
so really just feel free to come up to
me share your your weirdness fitting
experience and I'd love to try and take
this can become a chapter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
