hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
computer lab John crowcroft close to
everyone from Cambridge he is very well
known he was on our technical advisory
board for a few years regular guests at
microsoft research especially when were
still in the old building right next
door to the computer lab but he's come
here today especially to talk about the
warmth and future internet over to you
thank you John okay ah hello everyone
the after-lunch slot is always the
terrible one to have so i'll show you
how not to do an excellent research talk
and then Simon can correct that
afterwards that's like my goal is to
give you two lessons and one of which
you'll forget because I'll do it badly
and then the other you'll remember
because I'm will show you what I did
badly so ah so this is me if anything
strikes you is interesting that I say
you want to follow up afterwards do
email me i'm professor in a computer lab
which is about 15 minute bike ride from
here so it's an immense distances in the
sort of way ste snowy far northwest of
cambridge miles from the railway station
literally too and so I you know when did
my way here rapidly to give this talk
and I'm very happy to be not so long so
if you're wondering what this thing on
my wrist is this this is relevant I
spent six days in a field in southwest
of England at the glastonbury festival
with a large number of unruly children
they were the people on the stage
actually have my family with me there if
they're quite well behaved why is
Glastonbury relevant well Glastonbury
Tor of course was partly connected all
the legends of King Arthur and of course
King Arthur is supposed to be somewhere
in the Isle of Avalon which is sort of
that part of England possibly is the
Isle of Avalon and so one of the themes
of my talk is is a future of the
internet going to be Avalon which is a
sort of place of beauty a sort of
Arcadia on Elysian field somewhere or is
it possibly going to be the other
dystopic vision that TS eliot had which
was a the end of the story of King
Arthur there's this horrible wasteland
and I know most of your computer
scientists or even life scientists you
may not have read that poem it's quite
long
recommended he was quite quite worth
reading if you're into that kind of
thing and the ones of the future once
and future internet is also a sort of
stolen from another bit of our theory
and stuff there was a very nice kids
book which was a sort of simplification
of the legend of King Arthur written by
th why it's a beautiful beautiful
written book and there's an adult
version of it a grown-up version of it
called the once and future king and it
is about the sort of the promises of
this wonderful thing that was the the
knights of the round table almost
democracy except they were knights and
they were surface out there anyway let's
let's not dwell on the the problems of
early medieval society in legends but
that's where the title comes from and if
you haven't read the once and future
king i recommend that to you as well or
you could read the more d'Arthur or many
other things but that's what that's why
that's where the the abstraction and
title came from so can I kill anyone
with this later no I won't it's okay um
okay so so the internet is quite old um
I started working on stuff to do with
the internet I was a graduate student at
University College London where I
noticed some of the poster speakers come
from I was in the computer science
department there in 1980 and somebody
came along and said to me would you be
interested in working collecting stuff
up we thinking of connect to these
computers and we've got this box we want
to connect to America over a satellite
and that was the first route outside
America that was on the internet
together with some other ones in Germany
and Italy in Norway bizarre choices and
actually we also had a link to Cambridge
over another satellite link connecting a
bunch of local area networks together
using thing called a Cambridge ring
which was much better than the ethernet
but never went anywhere sadly and we ran
these protocols which were the
communications stuff of the internet
before nineteen eighty you may hear
people tell you the Internet's been
going since 1973 they're wrong even if
their name is in surf they're still
wrong because it wasn't the internet it
ran a bunch of protocols called network
control protocol right were control
program and it was in nineteen eighty
that we switched over to these new
protocols the Internet Protocol and what
was different about the Internet
Protocol is it connected lots of
networks together serve as a network of
networks so this was a big switch
because we had
these single kinds of network and
suddenly we had this way of connecting
networks and I was and from the get go
from day one in 1980 we had a satellite
network to the US cover large
geostationary satellite connecting
western europe and eastern seaboard of
the u.s. we had packet radio networks
that were jeeps driving around with
radios and we had the ARPANET we at
least three networks actually there was
a mill net which was a dark secret
network which I don't know anything
about and I'll have to take you out and
shoot you if I told you anything by
mistake and there are number of design
principles that were behind all of this
which were actually pretty subtle and
actually in in several areas in computer
science these kinds of principles
reappear that the the you know we're
we're familiar with but back then it was
actually quite a surprising thing to
have got these principles embedded in
this design so architectural principles
we we hear about computer architectures
processor architectures and a set of
design principles like risk we hear
about software architectures and they've
got a communications architecture and
and it incorporates things that are
common with software engineering like
modularity and abstraction and so on a
layered system operating systems layered
systems and modular systems and the
layers abstract the detail below and so
on the standard stuff that we used to
now but back then it was quite visionary
people to think of this particularly
since a lot of the early internet
community were kind of engineering folks
and they didn't know anything about
software really and they were writing
all the software and they had to engage
with a bunch of us horrible computer
scientists in in UCL in London and
Cambridge and England at MIT and Harvard
and various other places that were
building this stuff we started writing
the software and building these
protocols and so on and there are a
number of things that are abstracted in
here that abstract it away detail of how
addressing works how routine works how
reliability and robustness work and the
layering allows you to hide all of that
and then at the top of all these layers
you have applications and users so
that's just some standard stuff in the
early days this was not an easy-to-use
system and one of the reasons I got a
job doing this was actually very few
people here know what I'm talking about
but I actually knew how to use a system
called tops 10 which is a really obscure
old operating system and that was one of
the computers we were using Randy's dead
dekho operating system line
you how to use that as well as eunuchs
and so I could actually use both kinds
of computer on the net from the debt
get-go wasn't easy to use it was obscure
ease of use came along later so the even
at the very level everyone's been used
to for the last 20 years of having
announced names for stuff on the net
service names or URLs for websites we
didn't have that we just had numbers you
had to remember so we went around
remembering things like 1000 to 1 which
was the file transfer protocol server at
the information Science Institute in
university of southern california or we
remember i would remember numbers like
14 0 2 3 which was my reuters address
you know so and when i rebooted all the
rooters on the satellite network and
hope that they would come back if
they're actually new new software
actually didn't crash immediately you
know I knew all the addresses to ping
were so I go round with these things
etched on my heart practically as you do
a bit like debugging the output of bad C
compilers okay and their number other
principles that were embedded in here
one of the interesting principles in yet
we'll get on tues resource pooling and
people here Peter key notably in this
lab has done welcome resource pooling so
very interesting idea it's the idea that
was not present in other networks yeah
that the idea of other networks was a
bit like them at that time in 1980s was
that if you set aside resources for some
users even if they don't use them other
users can't use them so sort of kind of
selfish network that's actually a really
dumb idea so it turns out that users as
humans or users as programs are very
bursty they have statistical properties
and that you can take advantage of those
properties in lots of nice ways and an
awful lot of work has been done by
people i guess notably leonard klein
rockers has just past 80 years old a
UCLA works on all the fancy maths for
that but they're still it's still
ongoing that's it's still very
interesting in that area but there's
some a crucial design principle I want
to get into some more detail about
because you'll see where I'm heading
when I get on to talk about their future
internet and one of the crucial design
principles is the network's
decentralized decentralized no single
point of failure okay so where where are
their centralized systems well if you've
ever gone through an airport and air
traffic controllers go on strike
then you don't go anywhere because
there's a single point of failure the
air traffic control right so that's not
a good plan and in fact the early design
prints for the internet was to be
survivable of accidents or deliberate
attacks that envisaged a critical
infrastructure that everyone would
depend on so a better work even if some
bits of its blown up by asteroids or
tsunamis or or or bad people so
decentralization was crucial I've
already mentioned statistical
multiplexing this is this this nice
property that you get that you can share
resources and if somebody just doesn't
happen to use all the rules as they
thought they were gonna use other people
get to go faster the the simplest
illustration of this is the fact that
when you download a video or you view a
video the progress bar is ahead of where
you're watching usually not always
occasionally it stalls but it's usually
ahead of way watching and that sort of
says that was a good design choice
that's a good thing to do if that
usually happens it depends on the total
resource and total demand and sometimes
it doesn't work gosh that's a bit like
road systems where everyone decides to
go in their car today because it's
raining and you take you an hour to get
from the computer lab to the railway
station instead of the ten minutes we'll
take by car and a nice way of the day or
the 15 minutes it takes either way on a
bicycle another design principle is this
end-to-end principle this is actually
part of layering it's not a particularly
new principal it was a systems mantra
that people at MIT came up with a group
of people that were two operating
systems and on communication systems and
the end-to-end principle is just simply
the idea that if you're going to layer
things don't put any functionality in a
lower layer that isn't used by everyone
above so each layer is keep it simple if
you like as only as simple as necessary
I know more and that led to the idea
that the internet protocol layer is
incredibly simple mind-bogglingly stupid
and people go we had we had fights with
people about this almost physically
people in all the way through the 80s
from other kinds of network they look at
us ago that can't possibly work people
would tell me you can't you'll never be
able to do video over the internet
you'll never be able to audio for the
internet and I be chatting to somebody
at MIT over the internet using video and
audio 1988 and I'd be so showing these
people I said no that can't work so
because this is too simple to work
and they want we were right it does
depend on some resource pooling working
and understanding statistics of the
traffic which is very important so end
to end design ranchers are very
important that you see Swiss Army knife
don't put a kitchen sink or Swiss Army
knife in the lower layer of your system
you know keep everything very very
simple operating system terms of any one
tell us that I didn't notice too many
posters from that kind of background but
that would be sort of microkernel view
of the world if you like or if you're
into cloud and virtualization that would
be a simple hypervisor probably not the
Xen hypervisor that we wrote which is
massive and daft and then there's
another interesting principal named
after one of the important early guys in
the internet community jon postel came
up with the post dale principle which is
which is basically it's kind of it's an
implementation guide line but it's also
a protocol design guideline which is if
you do on a protocol that's got lots and
bells and whistles be careful to handle
any of the bells and whistles that get
used by the other person but don't use
it yourself right so the key phrases be
liberal in what you accept and
conservative in what you said and I have
no idea by PowerPoint did not correct my
spelling me choose a mac and pasta was a
very nice guy a bit of a sort of left
coast tpe libertarian if you ask me but
nothing wrong with that so we had all
this stuff and it kind of worked but it
wasn't very usable and for about I guess
12 years until nineteen ninety-two we
were all using this thing but we were
all kind of I used to talk to people at
dinner parties as you do in London or
Cambridge and mention the internet was
coming it was going to be very important
they'd all look at me like a complete
mad person what do you what drugs are
you taking I didn't I just had the
coffee but then a nice Englishman Tim
berners-lee came along he actually spent
about four years going around everywhere
talking to people saying you know here's
this thing we could do we could share
lots of content between people in this
really nice way by making it available
through naming objects in a way that
tells you what protocol you need to get
at the object where the server is that
object lives and we're on that server it
is what's its filename effectively so he
came up with hyperlinks and
in actually in 1988 I remember him going
around various universities in the UK he
was based in in CERN in Switzerland but
he went round place is saying here's the
thing I've done and how would you do the
protocol which actually turned out to be
HTTP how would you do that protocol and
we suggested various clever things and
he ignored us we were wrong and he was
right he did a very simple protocol and
he also did a very simple markup
language allowed to create pages with
links that some really important thing
in there was what's really important
though was he completely blew away all
the people working in distributed
hypermedia at the time so if you're into
distributed databases they were
distributed hypermedia databases that
people have been working on for 30 years
at this point we're talking in 1988 292
there's 30 years of track record on
hypermedia distributed data so that's
lots of objects linked to each other and
you know what he said is you know in the
internet you never really know what the
other person is going to do so if I link
to them and they change things all I
have to figure it out later whereas the
hypermedia people said links should be
bi-directional so if you put a link to
some your site they must have a link
back to you that doesn't scale you can't
add stuff unilaterally you have to agree
with everyone so as you add more people
to the internet and you scale the
internet at this point website growth
from 92 went from nothing to a thousand
servers in less than a year and any when
it just kept going exponential so it was
doubling every year so can you imagine
if every time you had a server you have
to contact a thousand people and then
ten years later a million people and you
know and so on this doesn't work so so
he was right and everyone else was wrong
very very simple extremely simple so the
internet is very simple or is it so from
about 92 we had sort up until this point
had a sort of very easy time of things
we hadn't had any bad stuff happen
despite the fact that there were sort of
military networks connected but most of
it was nice friendly fuzzy research labs
in universities and a few companies that
were involved but nothing particularly
bad happen about 92 there's a sort of
crucial turning point in various
technical ways but but but also socially
the number of people grew to the point
where there was probably some mileage in
trying to attack the network there might
be somebody out there
mation you could steal that might be
worth money or something you could
attack and get a reputation for being a
cool hacker and those are kind of two
classic motivations for bad people there
are lots of studies in the last few
years which actually go and interview
people about you why did you do this bad
thing and one of the very early worms
that it's happening internet around
there and was an MIT professor who's
still an MIT professor and he did it
because he could he didn't think what
would happen if you hit go truth in
advertising I got interviewed by a
newspaper in England about that about a
week after that happened and i wrote a
worm to show the newspaper journalist
how it worked and i hit go ad shut down
UCL's network and i got bandz as an
academic from using computers for a
month oh you mayor cooper and you know
it was easy to do you think hey it's
cool i do it and you know that's not a
good idea when the things going
commercial so 92 is a crucial point in
history the internet because that point
all these subsidized networks coming
from government agencies like the
military in the universities they stop
their money and they said you better go
buy this from a commercial organization
so they created commercial Internet
service providers at the same time they
created some other cool things which
I'll get on to in a second but one of
them was a decentralized way of managing
interconnect between commercial
providers how do you deal with the fact
they have different commercial
relationships they're not all
necessarily friendly and fuzzy friendly
relationship to each other with the same
motives they have their own customers
and their own business goals so they had
to be embedded in the in the in the
interconnection rules somehow we'll get
on to so there's a whole list of bad
stuff has started happening worms and
first thing viruses malware being around
forever but now sort of big-time
distributed denial-of-service attacks is
an interesting one because the internet
had this very naive model of what
traffic looked like as I already
mentioned so if you could take over a
number of computers and use them to send
traffic to one side you could deny
service by using up all the capacity for
that site and that still is a bit of a
problem so we see things like botnets a
you know exploitive machines
vulnerabilities and software exploited
there are ways to fix that perhaps we've
done work with Microsoft here and some
cool stuff and and then and of course
there are other things which
deny service at another level Cambridge
University's email service actually has
ninety-eight percent of mail arriving at
it classified as spam right so we're
actually running multiple megabits a
second 24 hours a day for year-on-year
if you work it out and sort of
kilojoules burns it's pretty bad and
actually the system for filtering is
awesome almost everything i get is
legitimate email but this is an amazing
amount of other stuff that's just out
there it's a bit like sort of the junk
DNA or or you know the sort of noise in
your system of biome that's not the
useful bits of it or whatever okay so
these were bad things started happening
bad things went on happening there are
two bad things went on happening this is
very annoying piracy of course was one
of them now we've moved on to more
legitimate models of you upload your
video to some company server like let's
say you tube and then rather than asking
permission they ask forgiveness they go
to the copyright owner and they say okay
for us to have this cup this content
here we'll give you some advertising
revenue that's the sort of Jesuit
solution right you don't ask permission
because it wouldn't scale you ask
permission for every item upload it
would take too long use let people all
around the world do your job for you
uploading lots of copyrighted content
and deal with the thing after the event
is pretty clever so the YouTube model
and other models have come a long we're
advertising revenue is makes people
happy or even just analytics makes you
happy why does this work though this
works because people forgot a design
gold of the internet which was
decentralization the cloud we're
responsible for in Cambridge University
with some people from Microsoft we did
one of the first cloud implementations
amazon ec2 service we wrote the software
in the university paul barham is that
Microsoft in Silicon Valley was rather
guys who helped through the make sure
the windows operating system works on
our hypervisor but you know we did the
Linux one which he could look at because
bad things would happen if you saw GPL
code that's another story so we managed
to do that that was very cool and Along
Came other people that de cloud cloud
businesses too but it's basically you
put all your eggs in one basket you pull
your boxes in one big data center and
then what does that what does that buy
you advise you several things like
manageability and scalability lots of
ill at ease but it also buys you a
business model which
now you've captured all these customers
and some of them meta customers they're
people that run a service they then have
customers and you've captured all the
data about those customers so what can
you do well you've now got with this
data you can run analytics on it
analytics is AKA market research right
we can do lots of very clever statistics
we can do machine learning and infer
what people are going to do you know is
that all good well perhaps it is because
it means that people get a service for
free there are pay money for it but then
of course what you use these analytics
for is deriving how to charge people to
advertise and in targeting ads or people
it's not free you put up with eyeball
time or your attention span you have to
look at this stuff so this is not
necessarily a good thing and in fact the
bottom line here is the bottom line on
this slide is this got weaponized by
security services they went off and and
did a backdoor exploits on it by using
secret courts in America to require
conceptualize cloud providers to give
them access to all this data all these
services all your stuff right and that's
not necessarily a good thing that means
there are weaknesses and the security of
the architecture the storage the
processing the transmission those
weaknesses you might trust the NSA you
might not you might trust GCHQ jazz the
British equivalent of five eyes the five
countries are all agreed to share this
stuff on the other hand if they have
access there could be some bad person
there how many bad things do you think
happen a day by somebody in one of those
agencies who's not acting under orders
they just decide to do something bad
lots right lots a day same thing happens
with police databases but they don't put
those in the cloud okay so what's going
to happen next i was going to talk about
the future of all this stuff where we
going to go i'm going to say some some
things about we should we should and now
going to say things that will happen and
then i'm going to go back to what we
should do more carefully so we ought to
recover the original design principles
and figure out how to do a decentralized
cloud and i'm going to give you some
hints about how that might happen it's
not easy it's not that hard if you keep
the principles cook together so you do
the same thing for cloud services
applications you might use whether it's
a flicker or Facebook or being translate
or I don't don't care you could do those
in a decentralized way
another interesting thing to tackle is
incentive to reduce certain kinds of
abuse that might involve accountability
for behavior that can be done in a
decentralized way and maybe we could
then reduce or remove analytics for
advertising as the business model maybe
if you go back to a business model where
people pay well maybe it's free you just
pay for your bits to be moved around and
nothing else and I'm not the only person
who thinks that might be a viable future
one of the guys who used to be here is
now at UCL I keep mentioning George
denise's the security researcher he's
strongly of the position as am i that
actually a very tiny amount of money
additional to your current payment for
owners to net service whether it's on a
smartphone or on a fixed line would get
rid of all that advertising and
therefore get rid of the analytics and
therefore get rid of the privacy problem
and that's just a switching incentives
there's a lot of working on here in that
area which is interesting as a bunch of
game theory and economics meets
computing and system design if you're
interested in mechanism design it's very
cool so could we go back to that now the
second thing is a very interesting area
which i think is much more ambitious so
my first one is ambitious enough the
second thing is really ambitious and
crazy which is one of the original goals
of having the internet at all was the
support distributed intelligence not NSA
style intelligence but people style
intelligence decision-making by groups
of people when you get a group of people
together to try and decide something it
seems anecdotally that they are less
intelligent than the most stupid person
in the room when you try and do
distributed intelligence making and
decision making it seems that things
don't happen well very occasionally
everything lines up and you get some
amazing something works we haven't
figured that out how to make that happen
systematically and we really haven't
figured out how to make a have online
systematically so building how actually
building applications to support
distributed intelligent behavior by sets
of people would be a good thing but I
think that's an a mind-bogglingly
difficult problem and are not talking
about AI so I'm talking about just
support for people that deals with the
fact that once you go online all kinds
of people start to misbehave and as the
group size goes up the misbehavior grows
faster than the use
for communication so how do we deal with
that and I don't have an answer so that
would be a future goal I would like to
see we have built all this fantastic
infrastructure we can improve the
infrastructure making it more privacy
preserving but it would be very cool if
we could also actually support cool
stuff where there's a problem in the
world as a tsunami there's an earthquake
a bunch of people who still have
communication facilities want to do
distributed decision-making to figure
out whether they send physical resources
to solve that problem how do you do that
in a good way and we have old-fashioned
organizations for that emergency
responder things have a bunch of
techniques they don't always work so
it's a fun area okay some less ambitious
things I just briefly mention but these
are just going to happen but they also
cause us some cause for concern and one
is internet things I have a thing here
you know that's one kind of thing but
there are lots of kind of things in your
life home environmental control heating
lighting air conditioning whatever
finding out if the fridge light really
goes off when you shut the door that are
really important Internet of Things
service I think I've always wanted to
have a a webcam inside the fridge so
when I'm in the shop I can look at what
I haven't got in the fridge and decide
what to get right so or even look at the
sell-by dates the best by dates you know
that would be cool home entertainment
obviously we have everything internet so
most six people in my household I think
every single sound and video system is
is ip-based there's no there's no old
analog magic stuff anywhere except when
it goes to your ears and eyes the
entertainment systems utilities power
and so on this is just going to happen
through internet of things including the
larger scale Internet of Things which is
smart cities where we instrument all of
the transportation systems and the power
grid for the city and maybe security and
so on these are all good things because
they just optimize stuff we do and it's
like obvious and it's easy actually of
course there are some downsides here a
lot of the gadgets people put into
houses and into sensors in buildings
have no security so this is going to go
horribly horribly wrong my favorite
example is is the braking systems that
was sold by one company to multiple car
vendors in the US which had Wi-Fi so you
could do diagnostics on the brakes and
then somebody university of washington
seattle demonstrated
telling the brakes on and off remotely
with no access control really bad but
there are many other examples one was a
colleague of mine was scanning a bunch
of building hvac systems monitoring what
they did and he found hospitals where if
you sent a malformed packet by mistake
you crashed the hospital heating and
lighting system because they had no
access control no password and firewall
anything on this box and it was embedded
system software written by somebody who
hadn't learned programming or used bad
programming languages maybe they used
c11 with the residual mistakes we saw
outside in one of the posters whether
they probably didn't get anywhere near
that kind of level of sophistication so
um and as we move up the stat you know
other things you're going to see into
the future internet of stuff that is
going to click mobile a health
monitoring your help that's just going
to happen it's really really good the
starting point would be well being and
we already have devices that measure
your well-being and reported back to
your web service and then you can you
know then you don't have to worry quite
so much about attacks on your well-being
but then we start to put interesting
palms onto the internet so we can
actually adjust things based on the
latest scientific results and download
that for people upload readings from
them and so on others it's all this is
good providing we deal with security and
of course other things where the network
will vanish into the environment and
we'll all deal with it with gestures and
all the kinds of cool stuff happens with
user HCI stuff here that and other
places is just going to be that's how
the world will work I wouldn't have to
hold this object i'll just be able to go
wave it something in the right way and
so on those are those are all good but
they motivate fixing that centralized
problem the privacy problem the security
problems that centralized system because
they're all much much more dangerous
things could happen with this and just
leaking lots of information right i mean
really bad things can happen if you can
turn all the lights green in a city
anyone remember the italian job not the
remake there is one or turn them all red
I mean that would be more fun actually
there's the story about that there was a
mayor I think in Liverpool whose
daughter was getting married and he
borrowed the remote control for the
traffic lights from the ambulance
service so they could drive through
green a green wave of lights so we
already have systems that do that and it
can be misused there's some issues not
dangerous but that could have led to
danger if there were two mayors and they
both set the lights green right
so we can easily imagine lots of bad
things so we need to fix this we need to
fix this earthly dive for a few minutes
into this decentralization idea okay so
I'll take questions at the end so I
should have said there's an example for
Simon PJ after this tool to go now
crowcroft you should have engaged
somebody got their name and said okay
have you got me so far you with me right
he'll do that better okay ah so one of
the underlying ideas that this
decentralization actually comes from
biology biological systems ecosystems
has got highly optimized tolerant
systems very very cool work and looking
entire ecosystems and evolution guy
could John that Doyle at Caltech did a
bunch of work on this and you can model
the decentralized nature of the internet
before the cloud in a very similar way
this has a nice property that failures
are localized you can have you can't
actually with a non centralized system
it's very hard to have a single point
failure crash everything there is an
exception you could have emergent
behaviors in a decentralized system
where things synchronized by bad luck
this actually happens in some badly
designed protocols and every now and
then we have to go fix them by
deliberately putting in randomness which
I my favorite computer science is
putting randomness into things so you
know one non determinacy we don't want
synchronization we really really do in
some cases and so we put randomness into
routing updates in the internet to stop
them synchronizing we put randomness
into the back off algorithms when you
try and use the net so you don't all try
and retry a busy neck at the same time
it just make it busier and so on so we
that that's fairly standard stuff we
have a set of design principles for
doing that there are other design
principles for decentralization where
you may want to coordinate things before
in an offline way before you set things
up but then you want to have
decentralized coordination when you run
the thing but you may want to have
offline checking after the event as well
so you separate time scales and in
computer science we're familiar with you
know when do you do binding between this
now it's a fairly similar idea so there
are lots of examples where this shows up
in the successfully decentralized part
of the internet with like the address
allocation and the name services so
essentially we have a centralized
allocation or prefixes of addresses we
have centralized allocation autonomous
system numbers which were Internet
service providers you
to identify them to each other but they
then allocate the rest of the namespace
to the address space that goes with that
but then for security reasons you may
not believe something you see from
somebody else so you can go off a look
at the central registry to check things
if you want to so two different time
scales operating there one for the
before and after and the during one has
to run real fast now because you don't
get a lot of instructions that typically
today's backbone network speeds or data
center speeds are panda gigabits the
second is pretty common around the world
nowadays so this decentralised
distributed redistribution of identifies
is important I should say originally the
root of a hierarchy of decentralized
allocation was the internet assigned
numbers authority and this was this guy
I mentioned called Jon Postel who's
postel principles named after he had a
great sense of humor he allocated
numbers for documents as well as for the
internet and he we had a discussion in
year two thousand the American
government said they wanted to put in a
facility in all the internet to be able
to wiretap every internet Rooter and in
the internet standards body we were a
document I was one of the authors and we
said no that's a really bad idea because
if you have such a thing a bad person
will get hold of it and they will
wiretap everything from all the banks
and then all kinds of bad things and jon
postel gave us a number for this
document there was a vice to the US
government and of course he had to
number it 1984 which was very clever of
him he'd saved that number of her a
rainy day I wasn't the next free number
he just happened to have it lying around
for a useful reason so funny man okay so
we have them this distributed allocation
of addresses and that works pretty well
we were distributed allocation a esas we
do need to check things there are lots
of bad things have happened accidentally
in the internet a small ISP in the
Middle East advertiser's itself is the
best way to get to youtube for everyone
in the world that wasn't a mistake what
they wanted to do was to temporarily
block YouTube because it had some
offensive content for their nation for
their culture and I were completely
correct the problem was their next door
internet service provider believe them
and so everyone when oh look there's the
best way to youtube and nobody could
reach YouTube because I really went to
them and then got thrown into a black
hole got fixed but now what we do is we
actually go and check is this person the
author authoritative source of such
information but they're checking is
configure time and then later on sort of
just check do you really believe this
not at the time of forwarding every
packet so you just make sure it's a
slower time scale so it's just an
example of that separation of concerns
and then getting you the scaling of
large-scale allocation having a slow
time sales and checking but fast
behavior Church short time scales it
also we also have the coupling of the
algorithms you even choose to run you
can run different hour than a different
part of the net particularly in routing
if you want to deploy a better routing
algorithm then Dykstra you deploy their
their reasoning algorithm and your your
bit of the net runs that better eating
apple as long as it gets packets from A
to B that's fine and then you can also
deploy better traffic engineering if you
come up with a better scheme so I've
already mentioned namespaces originally
we had all these number spaces I used to
go around remembering these numbers like
type these numbers in recently one of
them is the name server of the computer
lab in Cambridge so that happens to be
its IP address in ipv4 I cannot possibly
give you the IP version 6 address
because I can't type 128 bits very
successfully without making a mistake
most of the time but we have this domain
name system so we have this nice
friendly names but the names now are not
only d couple things and for allocation
is a hierarchy so you get given a prefix
you get microsoft com you can put other
stuff if you want foo bar baz door
whatever but also it allows you to give
different answers when people map
between the name and address so now
suddenly we have another very cool thing
we can run load balancers and rotaries
in the domain name system and this is a
different hierarchy from the network
address hierarchy it's not connected
with business relationships and
typologies is connected with
organizational structure I won't talk
about certificates because they're
horrible and we haven't sold how to do
them properly yet resource management is
another area decentralized rules
management is a good thing so we have
decentralized results management
basically how does the network operate
the network forwards packets it's trying
to maximize and rural packets he gets
around which will maximize its revenue
from getting packets around the moral
customers I get I forward their data for
thur more I can charge those customers
and they were happy to pay because
they're getting their data forward up to
what I forward the user wants to
maximize their utility biting the most
throughput
for them or the lower latency perhaps
but at least subject to minimal latency
modulo the speed of light they want to
get the pice download rate they can
possibly get or upload rate so
distributed solution works great Frank
Kelly and the statistics typing carriage
came up with this PT key who worked on
it bunch of people implemented it in
Berkeley in the 1980s and we have a
distributed solution a bunch of people
at Digital Equipment Corporation also
worked on it in parallel came up with
the same distributed solution that's
really cool so we have a distributed
resource allocation scheme actually it
can be changed recently I just mentioned
a couple of things we've been modifying
it so that you can send your data of a
multiple paths will see why that matters
in a second but imagine you have a
smartphone that's got 3g and Wi-Fi and
bluetooth and zigbee or whatever if
you're managing your home devices why
not use all of them at the same time why
you restrict your choosing one radio at
the same time you'll get all kinds of
nice properties in that that would be
good so matching between the user
requirement for maximum throughput and
the network requirement for sherry out
capacity to maximize revenue that's done
by some feedback distributed feedback
system that's part of a highly optimized
tolerant system distributed feedback
systems are how ecosystems work of
course you can get population
fluctuations and so on so you have to
worry a bit about that but this is
distributed optimization really really
cool and it's still evolving and that's
really cool because that says we can go
on evolving the internet because we've
got this distributed solution some folks
over here modify what they do Microsoft
ship a slightly different version of
congestion control scheme in there are
windows operating systems the Linux
system has a slightly other different
system we've evolved several times the
last 20 years on this it's very very
neat okay so we're a web I've already
mentioned is decentralized because URLs
are unidirectional so you can change
this site and you can add links to it
you can add a sigh and get people to
link to it and so on of course you can
check for missing links but that's a
decoupled in time scale you can around
you a search engine that finds things
that are bad links and tells people to
fix their site that's but that's a
separate business so that's a very very
cool thing there's no centralization in
the web then it was never part of the
notion each server owns its data of
course
you can have copies of a servant of
replicas and of course you can have
temporary replicas in caches that's just
fine as long as you manage the time
scales and updating replicas and that's
not so simple which is kind of
interesting so okay let's go back to the
cloud so what I want to say for the main
last message of this talk we made a
mistake centralizing everything in the
cloud I believe I believe this is a
mistake it's been very useful we've had
about 10 years of cloud services and
everyone thinks you know maybe I know I
actually it's been six months I've been
on facebook i left facebook in january
so so i don't know what happens on
facebook anymore I left linkedin i left
at almost everything actually i think
the only thing i'm on now any
communication medium is is email so huh
but the cloud centralized you power lots
of systems in rats commodity items
they're very cheap lots of storage is
very cheap the switches in the
datacenter are not cheap they're
mind-boggling expensive and they use a
lot of energy you could sort of do power
saving on all these things but you don't
because most of the running most of the
time and the back planes of all these
switches don't power down nicely so
actually you burn a load of energy power
usage efficiencies not that great so
there's a whole green problem of that
but it's centralized it's subject to
attacks if you you know if you if you do
the wrong thing to it foam an insider
attack which is according to Ross Anna's
and is the security guy a very high
fraction of most security problems arise
from insiders you have a problem the
insider could be a security agency it
could just be a corrupt person or a
crazy person or a script kitty so why
did we lose all those internet
principles why not decentralize their
cloud why don't we just go back to this
decentralized thing why don't you just
run your cloud server in your pocket in
your smartphone right why are you
running all your stuff over there on
someone else's computer I've got a
device here that's got enough storage
for the last 35 years of my email with
all attachments have a device at home i
just bought a terabyte disk for 50 bucks
that's that's like 25 times all the
documents I've ever written right so
this is no problem right so storage
isn't a problem what is what might be
the showstoppers with you so surprised
decentralized cloud would be everyone
runs a copy of the social network they
want to use the photo sharing system
they want to use the email system they
just run their own one
has their star and it communicates
directly to all the people who also
running their own one there is no
central server you just directly talk to
everyone over the network that's what
the internet does what what are the
showstoppers it's not processing it's
not storage what it used to be and we
did some work actually you people here
it used to be the uplink speed the link
from you to the rest of the world would
be a bottleneck so if everyone wants to
get at my facebook which they hope they
don't because it's not there anymore but
when they did then serving all the the
1,500 friends I might have might be a
bit tricky once upon a time but in most
developed world the uplink speeds are
just getting crazy you know 4G wireless
Wi-Fi hotspots adsl2 or five it sat at
home we're looking at you know people
increasingly hitting 50 megabits a
second some of the favorites of their
home services lower that a bit so your
uplink speed is only 5 megabits second
that's actually if you do the numbers
that's enough so I did some work with
people looking at fully decentralized
games instead of using a game server an
xbox 360 whatever you happen to use you
actually to centralize the game
completely paid directly to all the
other players you need the inbound bound
with all the updates from you know or
the other people that wasn't the
problems the uplinks be from you to all
the other people that what's the
crossover point it's around low megabits
a second old version of Wi-Fi 10 megabit
second they'll do so there is no real
showstopper except this bottom line here
which is the asymmetry of the internet
there are internet service providers to
be stuck with a very old addressing
schemes doesn't have enough addresses so
they give them out as you need them and
take them away again so you're not
reachable all the time that's not a
function of the capacity it's just a
function of a stupid bit of stuff which
we have a fix for which is being
deployed IP version 6 which cannot
possibly run out of you've gotten up
bits to address every atom in the known
universe and spare so that's going to be
fine he said people said that in the
past and okay what about a couple of
other things i might say what about I
kind of did a forward reference here
what about the sort of reliability
availability not just can I be reached
but you know when I'm reached it I'm I
there is to stop working how often are
your links down because the probe
network provider has broken a link just
by local maintenance well
I actually share links with four
neighbors my house we have an agreement
with all the Ritter's talk to each other
the home Reuters Wi-Fi just check to
each other so chances of them being down
if we're all on the same provider quite
high but we're not there are three
different providers so I have never seen
that go down since we set that up about
eight years ago we've had at bar that's
without even considering we all have
smartphones so we have 3g and 4g as well
so we haven't even configure that in yet
we haven't needed to so that gives you
two kinds of availability one is you've
got failover the other is you've got
diversity which gives you load balancing
for free there are very cool random load
balancing algorithms valiant lamp load
balancing will be your friend here so it
actually is a win-win-win scenario so so
no service everyone's running their own
server if you like there's no
centralized servers no passwords to
worry about our bar of course you want
to encrypt all your data don't you
because something's still might try to
hack into your site so you encrypt all
your stuff in storage you might wait
encrypts it even while you're processing
it there's a great research area if
anyone here can solve had it to have a
morphic encryption at speed you will get
massive prices from people or garbled
circuits at speed there's a bunch of
very cool research there but even before
that you can reduce the attack surface
on your system by only decrypting the
minimum necessary data while you process
it you don't need to decrypt a photo
somebody wants to look at the photo you
posted on your facebook on your server
you said it sort of encrypted and they
decrypt it on their device because
you've said he you can use offline in
some other key distribution magic so
that would be that would be just fine so
in in your storage in your transmission
their processing is I need the last
second they do anything and they do it
in the privacy of their own system so
this is doable we could do this we've
got some work in the computer lab on a
very cool way of avoiding worrying about
how you think about all the different
keys and passwords you need but I don't
have time to talk about app if you're
interested in that kind of thing as a
system called pico which uses multiple
devices and biometrics and multi-factor
authentication it's very very sweet so
and you can then do key recovery for
that if you lose all the devices that's
ways of doing that so why would people
buy this this is people will say to me
you've done this mad thing what's the
business case well there isn't a
business case for this there is no money
to be made doing this right because it's
going to be free
but people might like it because it
gives them privacy it gives them
provenance and audit trail of who went
to looks at stuff because they see that
outbound loads from their server it's
not on in in Google and Facebook land or
Bing land or as your land or whatever
you get then you get rid of the
requirement to make money for the data
center there's no advertising as
analytics which saves lots of energy
which means you've got much more green
networking there because you don't have
all these big engines running MapReduce
or whatever it happens to be
unfortunately the bottom line here is
quite entertaining so I'm actually
funded I'm truth in advertising by
Microsoft to do research in
next-generation cloud and the bottom
line here is that if we do this there is
no next generation cloud business
there's no money in it right on the
other hand there might be money in new
apps and those apps might be able to do
cool new things we haven't thought of
and so you know we might move on to the
next level of creativity rather than
they sort of rather naive model of
things so I'm out of time so I should
wrap up here and apologies for going
slightly long not leaving much time for
questions summary is the vision of the
network that the once and future
internet the once vision was weak add
all these decentralized mechanisms ahead
of the whole family of different tools
for doing decentralization of lots of
different ways of building the network
and we've lost track of that vision
we've lost track of it and it's led to
some quite bad situations and it could
lead to worse situations as we put more
and more of our critical infrastructure
more mile critical information into
these systems this could be could be
quite bad so we could go back and
revisit this whole decentralization and
and we then have to face a number of
challenges dealing with consistency
between replicas other people have if
you update stuff there's a challenge is
an interesting one most of the time
people don't update photos of themselves
they add new ones so it's actually not
much of a challenge most of the time and
if you're interested in that whole areas
or eventual consistency is our lovely
buzz phrase which even what it means is
not crisply clear yet and I will find
you know this isn't there isn't a
business case for this video there is a
national cybersecurity case and a
citizen's case for it as well as I mean
we should kind of think maybe want it
you might kind of say
yes but you know my grandfather can't
work I had to use a mac let alone this
don't have to write you don't have to
it's all going to be gesture-based it
will be done for you that's not a
problem that's a usability question
we're so very cool people dealing with
but where that data resides maybe it
will be somewhere where they can least
have some notional trust about its not
being fiddle with by some random person
they've never heard of okay and it may
be much more resilient to bad attacks
and so on it give them lower latency
access as a long list of plus points
which I I think I hopefully made plain
okay so I'll stop there and we have a
few minutes for questions hi I have a
question regarding the collective
intelligence how does it fit into your
dis decentralized architecture thank you
uh what exactly do you want to know
about it you are mentioning about
collective intelligence and how would
this fit so if each of the people have
their I don't know preferences or stuff
like that how would this fit in a
decentralized okay I i don't think the
decentralization is all socialization is
germane to that question so whether it's
centralized east central idea to
communicate with the center people but a
decentralized system the internet is
decentralized and I can communicate from
this device to device in my pocket
direct over the local Wi-Fi or Bluetooth
or try our server in the u.s. if I want
the the distributed intelligence
question was a high level thing I just
want to point as other topic which i
think is a very nice one which is the
original goal of the internet was to
provide something originally the rand
report was written that led to the
internet was how do we support groups
doing activities so that the group can
work more effectively so the example i
point out where people who tried to do
this in the civilian world is actually
the pirate party in germany where they
had a big got a few people elected in
their government and they didn't have
any policies except on copyright and so
they crowd-sourced policy and they built
a system but they also had to build a
system was very clever because I
to deal with trolls and people
misbehaving so that was a social tool
not a technological tool at the low
level and they did a lot of clever work
that is quite like a Wikipedia work
which prevents edit Wars there's there's
a bunch of tricks but they're almost
like human the support for human
protocol to reduce the damage made by
misbehaviors of people and there may be
a link between that and low-level
misbehavior of users attacking things on
the internet as well but I haven't made
that link but i think the the liquid
democracy if you look at that several
people try to implement this there's
some group in italy it's trying to
implement it in a local government where
you get direct engagement of people who
try to engage people continuously rather
than just having referendum every now
and then about things and people are
empowered by that we have tools that
prevent this race to the bottom which is
the usual problem as you had people you
get this race to bad behavior so
everyone's trying to the few people are
bad to take over the conversation so
that's what i was referring to their
decentralizing all the service I don't
think has a plus or minus point on that
particular way of doing things although
I could I could imagine you you could
think of some connection it might be
might be interesting to look at and so I
just wanted to ask you as a young
researcher in networks we've seen a lot
of interesting and strategies let's say
for instance related data center
transfer protocols and then that's the
content sent written its contents and
trick networking and things like you
mentioned MP TCP so something sometimes
when we were working on these new ideas
one thing that we come to that comes to
mind is that many of these things never
actually then sort of come on to the
internet so it's sort of like a how can
you say it demotivator so could you sort
of you know perhaps guide someone like
me that what should we do or how should
we think about approaching these
problems that's a great question as well
so the insula is very very very big for
having an impact with a really good idea
it's really hard and it's almost a
matter of accidental luck with a few
people actually get something to work
get it out there I think one of the best
things you can do in the last my
experience the last 20 years has been
working with big industry research labs
who have links
two operational people so working
microsoft research is a good example
there lots of such organizations and
then you would if the work you do looks
like it's really going to work they will
ship it so one of the things we did with
MP tcp so i'm in the project that
multi-party speed is a bit of a detail
here we register persuade some people at
Apple to use it so now if you use Siri
on the Apple surface it acts uses the
npt CP and they shipped it and it was
like oh wow that's like okay we're done
their job is done here we don't have to
do anything else I me nicely Microsoft
didn't I know it got ideas in that space
as well but yeah what so working with
somebody is I think the best way to have
because because you're trying to add
things to a massive operational
infrastructure now and it's a very have
to be very patient that so the time
scales tip for something time I work one
of my students I'd worked on a thing
called sip which is how voice over the
internet works signaling it's kind of
being used now we did the work 20 years
ago so you have to be very patient to
actually see something make it out there
you know so so during a PhD or a postdoc
project it's unlikely it's not
impossible if particularly if you work
with a big research lap and then you can
get that leverage and plus also they
will have filters for choosing what they
work on where they think that that's
something that there won't be too many
barriers also equals in the operational
internet there are barriers which are
not their business or non technical
barriers so sometimes you have something
is definitely I mean you mention
concentrated networking could be the
best way to do things you just can't get
it shipped because other people have
some vested interest in something else
there's not as good sadly so I don't
think one should not do work because of
that bar if you want to have a big
impact in the world in how many people
use your bit of code that's kind of
tricky and I'd a lot of encourages think
about how you how you collaborate with
with industry labs and people have those
pathways to get stuff out there hi
thanks a lot for that great presentation
I just wanted to point something out you
describe their first hackers has bad
boys but don't you think that by
rebuilding bugs in the system it
actually helped make the internet more
first and second if you go to like books
like hikers ethic by becca humanum you
can see that this weren't really
necessarily bad guys and actually just
them gave an example about the pirate
party if you see what the pirate party
did in Iceland how they reform the
Constitution was of the ethics come from
the hacker culture yeah I actually I'm
right the problem with the word hacker
of course he has two different
derivations but in fact they're not
separate they overlap and a lot of
people who works on the early internet
sat in in that overlap area and still do
a lot of innovation happens in the open
source community there are people are
motivated to go faster TTP or go faster
web servers or go faster cloud servers
and they are two guys we're working with
right now sat in a desert in North
Africa for the last six months writing a
better implementation of transport layer
security in a language called o camel
and we're now cooperating with Microsoft
who are doing another implementation so
that we can run model checkers on the
two these two guys are hackers but what
are they doing they're trying to fix
something that's got a whole bunch of
weaknesses fundamentally a better way
and so Microsoft and so we've got this
sort of corporate research group but
also corporate development of something
and then this is hacker community for
both well-motivated so I totally take a
point I think I said it's well made and
I think it's sort of yeah yeah I think
you can learn a lot by going in those
communities and re even in the really
sort of strange parts of it yeah it's a
lot of fun as well yeah if you go see
people said it we run a just a bit
advertising run a conference called
extreme call where we we take people to
a random part of the world where they
have to get their themselves and build a
network we started out in in Lapland and
up in the Arctic Circle and we did one
in Iceland and somebody had to be
helicoptered out because they broke
their leg at we're in the middle of
nowhere and we did one up and base camp
in everest and use go out with a bunch
again everyone arrives or tries to build
networks and we've done you do the with
some of the Burning Man people and and
it's the reason for that is you want to
build networks out in places where
they're not have any money to pay for a
network and there and then you do it I'm
fortunate the funny thing here was that
everest base camp had the best 3g and
Wi-Fi coverage so he showed up as
deplete lee point is going there so but
all the other places was was fun so
but yeah it's a well-made points or a
social point that these communities are
not there's not the bad people look at
people that's a role model so one of the
important reasons why we centralize
things today both computing and
networking infrastructure is the
efficiency like the need for
consolidation so where does your
proposal stand with respect to
efficiency energy efficiency for example
well I'm not sure there's a scale-out
efficiency of a data center in the sense
of the economy of scale of buying a lot
of stuff but all the edges are now
wasting resources because the all the
edge devices people have already have hi
res displays they already have a lot of
storage they're already got enough
memory to run a serious operating system
they have a had shed out of storage to
catch video content and so on so
actually we were just all the
centralized system gains in efficiency
of scaled to some extent it's actually
not that great and the edge systems
actually already have the resources you
did not need that central system so I'm
not disputing if you compare 100 small
data centers one massive one the bigger
data center is better but if you fully
decentralized to the edge then I think I
will claim we use less resources overall
but when we've done the numbers for this
you know there are certain break point
in the overall resources so yeah it's
not always true so it's a sure well so
right so most home systems are far more
energy efficient and two power saving
mode much better than centralized
systems so as long as I'm not serving my
facebook pictures for everyone 24-7 my
system will be down most of the time and
they'll be on wake up on packet boat or
whatever whereas the central system will
have to have some resources out the
whole time because there'll always be
some users tickling it with some traffic
so I would claim I mean we can have a
offline discussion about the detail but
it is a breakpoint thing there are
places where you know the balance is in
favor of what you're saying what I'm
saying is we're moving to a point in
terms of edge resources where I think
the balance in favor of the fully
decentralized approach I mean of course
you never hybrid that's fine you know
and if everyone's using edge resources
but occasionally essential resource is
useful it can
it could have you know better power
saving modes than it currently runs and
have a lot less systems running that
might be fine I have a sort of view the
world where you put a data center in
every car and if every car is electric
and it will plug into a network and a
charger you've got powerful your data
center every car you're never more than
100 meters from the car and you can time
shift the use of the network and the
data center and charging the battery in
the car so you've got a whole world
there we were lots of medium-size data
centers around the world and that's
efficient because you'll you need to
time shift energy use for electricity
anyway when we move to that world that's
a another discussion we could have but I
i think i think you're right at certain
point in history i think we could move
away from that again back to the my mole
but amazing yeah you actually are tied
right into it it seems that we're
balancing on a spectrum between two
extremes that of total decentralization
every user their own server and that of
total centralization to have a single
giant mainframe Facebook out there well
11 happy medium solution might be to
have geo replicated Deus data centers
that provide availability in different
regions safety for when your home gets
demolished by flood and plenty of other
analytics and bonuses to what shouldn't
we go more for that solution than four
total decentralization to each user
their own yeah no it's a fair question
we have a we just taking a position for
the perfect seeing how far we can go
with the full decentralized solution
part of it is we do need to provide
archiving and backup of your replication
but the way we do replication is we
strike the data using some network
coding technique you know resilient
coding technique and actually cover
arraylist codes which we didn't make up
a lot of other people have over all the
other edge systems from time to time and
that gives all those systems plausible
deniability none of them has all the
data to reconstruct our data if our home
is flooded but a small care of any of
them can recover our data you could move
that up to a number of small data
centers as well and just have them be a
backup ER archiving service if you had
her more think ription because also you
could you could pay for that but then
doing some analytics
maybe or or differential privacy
preserving mechanisms for data mining
what you've got without giving away
individual information so I think there
are intermediate solution so I totally I
totally buy that each year microsoft
