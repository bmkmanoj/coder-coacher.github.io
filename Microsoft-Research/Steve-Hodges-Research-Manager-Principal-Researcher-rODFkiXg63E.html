engineering by training and and we have
a team of people here who explore new
device form factors so we're thinking
about new experiences that technology is
going to deliver and in particular how
the shape and the type and the
functionality of a device is going to
change that one of the projects we've
had a lot of success with was a project
we called net gadget here and in that
case we actually took a technology we
developed to use ourselves for our own
research to help us build devices
prototype devices more quickly and we
built a platform from it like a toolkit
we made that toolkit available publicly
so we actually did took our work and
made it open source and then we work
with a number of manufacturing partners
who made these little modules which are
essentially like LEGO building blocks
for electronic devices so if you've got
an idea for a device then you probably
have an idea what components it needs
maybe it needs Wi-Fi an image of
temperature center in a small display in
a processor and you take those elements
and plug them together and so we got a
lot of traction with that not only with
other researchers like ours but also in
education we found teachers are very
excited that they can engage their
students much more in learning computer
science by having them build the devices
that they were then programming for
Microsoft Research is the dream job for
me because every day I get immersed in
technology I can play with the latest
stuff but at the same time we've been
given the challenge of understanding how
our knowledge of technology is going to
transform into experiences and products
and services that change the lives of
people at scale right millions and
millions of people in the world and so
that's an incredibly exciting challenge
