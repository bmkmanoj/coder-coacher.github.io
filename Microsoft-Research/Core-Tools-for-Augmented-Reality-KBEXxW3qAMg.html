researcher here in redmond and microsoft
research we've got a project today i
want to talk to you about it's called
core tools for augmented reality as you
can see on this poster the idea is that
we can point a camera at scenes in the
world and get information back from the
scenes automatically for example I might
point my device at a restaurant in town
and suddenly I would see the menu or
maybe some reviews might pop pop up I
could just sweep the camera across the
scene and it would create a panorama for
me on automatically and then down here
if you are watching the Inauguration you
may have seen a Photosynth on CNN to use
that same underlying technology that
technology is really called features and
it's those little features in the image
that lets us do that matching from image
to image but today we have a kind of a
fun application we want to show it's
really a treasure hunt let's say you
were trying to set up a birthday party
for your for your child you could take
your camera for example and point it at
places in the scene and then set a
narrow and say well the treasures that
way and as soon as I do that you notice
a bunch of bubbles start to flow in the
direction that I'm pointing it and so
what I'm really doing in a way you might
think of it as i'm setting up sort of a
virtual wind that's pointing in the
direction of the treasure now we could
do this and set the whole thing up but
I've actually set one of these up for us
already so I'm going to take this
handheld device and let's see if we can
just follow the bubbles so if I come out
here you'll notice the bubbles all start
flowing away from me it's telling me
that the treasure is actually in this
direction if we move a little further
they continue to flow not quite sure
which way to go now so we look around
and aha the bubbles are getting quite
excited now they seem to be flowing down
this way we go a little further you're
all flowing off to the side so it must
be over here as I get close enough
suddenly the treasure peers and I know
that I found the treasure
end if you're lucky enough we have a
little chocolate at the end the end of
the treasure hunt so it's really these
underlying features that exist in all
images that we're using for all these
different applications serious things
like being able to walk around the
streets and get directions or reviews of
restaurants or setting up a treasure
hunt for your child's birthday party</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
