Israel innovation labs and I'm going to
present you one album one album is an
application that enables you to get all
your relevant photos from your social
network on your friend shared albums and
should see them all together to with
your photos and the technology behind
one album is a novel unsupervised face
recognition algorithm combined with
event matching algorithm it by analyzing
my own album the photos in my own album
it understand automatically which photos
I must care about which people and
places I must care about and then it
calls all the shared album of my friends
the photos that they were willing to
share with me and they finds only the
most for irrelevant photos and bringing
them to my album so now let's see how it
works for my own album I have about 25
photos in my social networks almost all
of them are not relevant to me one album
calls all these albums and it finds this
top 30 relevant photos this is photo of
me this is photo of my son this is my
daughter and this is my wife almost all
of the photos here are very relevant to
me if I take for example this photo this
was taken by Sharon my friend in a joint
kayak to when I click here I go to the
flickr account of sharon and can browse
for more photos in a hard boom so and
again this is photo of my son my sister
took this photo again one album
automatically recognize that this face
is relevant to me just by analyzing my
own album brought it to me and now can
view all this interesting photos and
moreover if I'm going to event I took
photos in for example this was one of
our group event and ego dubrovsky team
member of one album also took photos in
the very same event and now i can say da
my photos together with the photos is
taken just side by side as if i was
worth takin them and we believe that
this technology actually define the
concept of my album currently the
concept of my album of s2 photos that
I've taken with one album it refers to
all photos that interest me regardless
of the photographer
