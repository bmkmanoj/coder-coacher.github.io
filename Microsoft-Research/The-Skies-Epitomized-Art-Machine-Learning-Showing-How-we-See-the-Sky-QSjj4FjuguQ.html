multitude of the experiences people have
we're looking at a sky
we have one sky but the experiences are
infinite and they depend on the location
from which you're looking in the sky on
the time of day and the climate most of
all it really depends on your eyes your
subjective view
so the machine learning representation
under these algorithms is meant to
capture a large number of images into
something that's relatively small
compared to the size of all images put
together we call them call these
representations at pyramids because they
epitomize the entire collection we
started with images of skies I started
creating these huge epitomize of skies
and we use various types of constraints
in addition to whether the images match
nicely or not to represent the artistic
vision of Maya about what sort of things
we want to show how do we want to
capture human experience of these guys
suppose that you wanted to create some
representation of the skies from a
certain location in the world and let's
say that you're interested in polar
skies so one way to build the pyramids
of polar skies would be to download
images from the web that you get
response to searches for polar sky
so in my performance searches like that
to get the most evocative images of
polar skies and then my algorithm
summarized them into these pyramids that
capture the essence of these skies
Maya has also added faces of people that
would live in these areas as if they
were actually looking at these appear
amis and she's made a series of pieces
like this from various locations in the
in the world and also from various time
points in the world that is supposed to
be a pocket of what people would have
thought the skies were at those
locations of those moments in time
another example is creating a world map
of skies and there the idea was that we
wanted to have one thing that looks like
a world map but from every point in that
world map you would see a typical image
that this most evocative of that
location and so when you do all of this
you get this representation of the
global sky it's sort of as if you're
lying in a hammock and looking up in the
sky but you see the sky for more vantage
points at once
