you
hello and now welcome everyone it's a
great pleasure to have Matt visitors and
it's an even greater pleasure to have
him give a talk because that gives
wonderful talks no pressure yeah Matt
graduated from MIT last year and has
been posted at Princeton since then and
matt has won many fellowships and awards
including the MSR graduate fellowship
and ACM doctoral dissertation award for
the wonderful work is done on
algorithmic mechanism design and Matt
will tell us about what he's been
working on recently on interpolation
mechanisms so oh do you mind ok thanks
ok thanks for the introduction and um
this talk is going to be on two works
the first one is joint with nikhil and
Jamie Morgenstern and bacillus in the
second which was a follow-up is with
Mark Braverman and gemming mal so the
first part of the talk is I'm not going
to tell you what interpolation means and
I'll just talk about simple common
authorial auctions okay so just make
sure everyone knows what I'm talking
about in a combinatorial auction there's
a set of em items for sale to n
different bidders and the buyers have
combinatorial valuations for the items
so they just have a valuation function
that takes its input a set and outputs
their value for this talk I'm always
going to assume that the valuations are
civ additive and the goal of this
problem is to find some way to allocate
the items it maximizes the welfare which
just sums over every bitter their value
for the set they get and catch is that
these valuations are private information
to the bidders and so they might lie to
whatever algorithm you try to use if
they think they can get a better outcome
so this problem has been around for a
while and there's kind of three
different approaches did we use to solve
them the first is due to seminal works
of Vic reek Larkin groves and what they
show is that um there is always a
truthful mechanism that allocates the
items optimal
so by truthful I mean that this
mechanism has a property that every
bitter prefers to report their true
value so the mechanism no matter what
the other buyers choose to do and kind
of the drawback of this solution is that
in basically every setting that we care
about it requires exponential
computation or communication to actually
run the VCG mechanisms this is basically
never used in practice second approach
that people have used more recently is
to say okay we can't run the optimal
mechanism in practice but maybe we can
design an approximately optimal truthful
mechanism okay and there's been a lot of
work on this front and a lot of the
approximation ratios that we get are
actually quite good the catch is that
these mechanisms are often quite
involved then they're not transparent to
the buyers what's going on and they're
also difficult to implement and so these
are also virtually never used in
practice and kind of the drawback of
these is that they're not simple in
design right so buyers don't like
participating in these mechanisms and
sellers don't like implementing them
sorry so that's approach three so okay
price of anarchy is not used in practice
but what is we often see in practice is
people are just using very simple
mechanisms that are not truthful and
before this long line of work on price
of Anarchy we didn't even really have
any understanding of why they should be
good in practice or why anyone should
want to use them so what people have
started doing recently is more analyzing
simple mechanisms so for instance may be
the simplest thing you can think of is
just a run a second price auction
separately for every item and then you
know bidders you can do whatever you
want it's not truthful okay and so with
the price of Anarchy studies is we say
okay the mechanism is not truthful so I
don't want to try and predict how
bidders will behave but maybe at the
very least they'll do something that you
know constitutes some kind of
equilibrium behavior and then we try and
prove claims that say you know what as
long as they play according to this
equilibrium behavior things are not so
bad and so the formal definition of
price of Anarchy for an auction a search
is over
all instances so for all valuation
vectors that you want your guarantee to
hold over all possible equilibria and it
finds the worst equilibrium of the worst
instance and compares the ratio of the
welfare to what you would get in the
optimal solution ok and so actually
there's been like a ton of work in the
last couple years about showing that
many simple auction formats have low
price of anarchy in particular selling
every item separately has a low price of
energy as well okay and I'm recently a
critique was raised about on all of
these results which is it none of the
equilibria at which these price of
Anarchy bounds are known to hold our
arise naturally and I'll be a little bit
more formal about what i mean by that
later and in particular some are even
known to be computationally hard to find
so what this means is it you know just
because we we think it makes sense for
people to play games at a Nash
equilibrium if it's computationally hard
to find then maybe a price of energy
bound at a Nash equilibrium that we
don't know how to find is not you know
it's not as appealing is for solution
concepts that we know how to find ok so
the what I'll say about these is that
these mechanisms are not strategically
simple in the sense that buyers cannot
look at these auctions and figure out
what they should be doing to play ok so
here's a just a chart that summarizes
what we know so far so these are the you
know four categories that I want to talk
about in this talk so we care about the
approximation ratio over the price of
anarchy we want all the mechanisms to
run in poly times that we can actually
use them we want the mechanisms to be
strategically simple in the sense that
buyers should be able to figure out what
they should do we also want them to be
simple and designed so that people are
willing to implement them okay and so on
what we know so far is that we don't
have any mechanisms that kind of check
all the boxes and what I'm going to show
you in the first part of this talk is a
new auction format that we call the
single bid auction that has a price of
Anarchy of log M and it is it has a poly
communication and run time it is
strategically simple and I'll be formal
about what i mean by that later it's
also very simple in design so okay so
this is like a fuzzy statement I can't
prove that it's simple in design but
i'll describe
it to you and hope I think you'll agree
with me that it is pretty simple I think
it's up for debate so like it's simple
in the sense that i can describe the
mechanism to you right i mean you know
what it is but on the other hand like
actually running it you know is empty
hard to do so there's going to be some
crazy optimization going on and this is
still not something you know someone is
going to want to implement i put a
question mark there because i don't want
to discuss it yeah but even so even if
you think it's simple you still can't
use it in practice like only one sitting
like the option happens only one sharp i
can start repeating um this is our text
is so so these results okay so what they
show is that the auctions still have low
price of anarchy in the repeated game
the catch is that even what you would
naturally say is oh and the repeated
game people are going to play no regret
learning it's even computationally
infeasible to do learning in these
auctions okay so it's not so you
shouldn't even expect to be able to
converge to correlated equilibria and
actually that's relevant to what I'm
going to say soon does that make sense
so even learning you can't do okay with
other okay so this is the first part of
the talk i'm going to describe the
single bit auction okay so here's what's
going on in the first phase each bidder
is just going to submit a single bid so
just one real number in the second phase
the bidders are going to be visited one
at a time in decreasing order of their
bids and then when they're visited they
can purchase any number of remaining
items they want and they have to pay
their bid per item okay so have a little
animation okay so the first phase
everyone submits a number so Jamie is
bidding five and the keel is bidding
eight and vassilis is bidding six and
then in the second phase and akhil was
the highest bidder so he goes first he
can buy any of the remaining items that
he wants he chooses the Apple and so he
pays eight okay now vassilis is the next
highest bidder so he shows up the Apple
is already gone he can buy any subset of
the orange and bananas and he chooses to
buy both of them and he pays 12 which
was six per item and now when Jamie
comes there's nothing left so she gets
nothing in page 0
okay so is the format clear for okay so
hopefully you agree with me I think this
is pretty simple too okay so the main
theorem we show and again these
statements are a little bit informal so
first we showed that the single bid
auction has a price of Anarchy log em
whenever buyers are sabbatic and so the
reason this is not formal is because I
haven't defined the equilibrium concept
yet and second is that the single bid
auction is learnable so what I mean by
that is it whatever regret minimization
algorithm you want to use it will run in
poly time okay so what this means is
that this single bid auction has a price
of Anarchy log M it is solution concept
that you should actually expect to arise
in practice because in practice when
bidders play repeated games we expect
them to have no regret okay and this
says you should expect them to be able
to minimize regret because whatever
algorithm you expect anyone to use it
will run in poly time n is the number of
items okay and I just want to before I
go on recall that all previous auctions
either didn't run in poly time to begin
with they were prohibitively complex in
design even though they did run in poly
time or the price of Anarchy bounds were
only known at unnatural or intractable
equilibria okay so any questions I'm
going to get into proving some things
next don't be Albert I'll build concepts
concepts I don't think the price of a
healthy that would correspond to a
different solution concept that will be
relevant to these other things so
another thing people study is the price
of stability and we do know that good
price of so price of stability is
looking for the best equilibrium and we
do know in not for sub additive buyers
but for sub cases we do know how to find
you at least one equilibrium efficiently
and we know how to find an equilibrium
that has good welfare the problem is
that these equilibria are extremely
unnatural it's basically like one person
did something very high and everyone
else bids 0
and it looks like this on every item and
it requires a big centralized
computation to find out what's going on
so technically there are pure Nash that
exists for some of these simple auction
formats that have good price of Anarchy
do we know how to find but they're
really unnatural and I don't think you
should expect to see them in practice
but um that's the extent of what I know
of other approaches so I just wonder
sound is this price of a knock you ball
two it's dependent they so again so it
depends on the auction yes so every
auction has a different price of energy
which is you look at the center of you
that can be least with this yes so for
so for every auction for every class
evaluations you look at what is the
worst instance for that instance find
the worst equilibrium and then see what
is the ratio of what I would hope to get
versus what I get in this bad
equilibrium sup so it's too fine for an
auction and for a class of instances
that you want to have a good bound for
sure some forum for whatever notion of
equilibrium you want and even the
approximate equilibrium sorry even so so
we don't have formal results saying that
approximate equilibria so I think the
approximate is like really really small
like like exponentially small epsilon is
hard to compute I don't even think we
know that like PETA's doesn't exist or
something but you know like some like a
meta argument I would say look if if
you're using a complex Pete ask just to
find an equilibrium I don't know that
you should expect bitters to do that in
practice either yeah okay okay
okay so it's kind of two separate claims
going on here the first has is just
talking about the price of Anarchy the
second is just talking about how well
bidders can learn this auction so the
price of Anarchy so there's been this
recent development of techniques called
smoothness did have kind of like become
a big hit in price of Anarchy recently
and so we're again going to use these
same techniques I'll explain them I'm
starting from scratch and that's going
to be the majority of the first portion
of the talk and now it turns out it's
actually pretty straightforward to show
that this mechanism is learnable and
basically what we're going to show is
that when a bitter is trying to do
learning they only need to consider a
polynomial number of actions and when
there's a polynomial number of actions
however you decide to learn it's going
to run in poly time okay so I'll get
started with smoothness so what
smoothness is it's a generic tool for
approving price of energy bounds at many
equilibrium concepts at once and so
here's the formal definition I'll parse
through it in a second but we say that a
mechanism is a lambda mu smooth if for
every valuation profile that you're
hoping for you're bound to hold each
bidder has some safe strategy and the
safe strategy should satisfy the
following guarantee so what this is
saying on the left hand side we're
summing over every buyer their utility
for deviating to their safe strategy
from the existing profile and then on
the right hand side this is just lambda
times the optimal welfare and mu times
the optimal revenue so this right hand
side is just a bound and you say look if
everyone has a safe strategy such that
the sum of utilities deviating to be
safe strategy exceeds some bound then
something nice happens okay there's
something nice that happens is um sir
condition tardo showed that whenever a
mechanism is lambda mu smooth then m has
a price of anarchy of the most this
bounce this is just me over lambda at
basically every equilibrium concept that
you would care about okay and I'm not
going to prove this because this is some
older work but basically the idea is it
how your reason is it if you have a
strategy profile that's any of these
equilibria concepts
every buyer is at least as happy in this
equilibrium as they would be by
deviating to their safe strategy okay
and so this means that the sum of
everyone's utility is at least as large
as this term on the left and then the
rest of the proof is just moving around
terms from this inequality okay legs
we're okay yeah yes that's right yeah so
this should be what's on the left-hand
side okay so let me give you an example
first of how you might show that a
mechanism is smooth and then kind of
relate this to how you should understand
why this implies the price of Anarchy
bound so let's say that there's one item
for sale and we're going to run the
first price auction so sir coniston
Tardos also showed that the first price
auction is one-half one smooth and
therefore by their previous theorem the
first price auction is price of Anarchy
at most two with all of these
equilibrium concepts okay so let's see
how you would prove this so for each
bidder we have to define their safe
strategy they're safe strategy is going
to be to bid half their value okay and
now for whatever strategy profile we're
looking at let's let P be the
probability that the highest bid you see
in this strategy profile exceeds the
highest value over 2 ok and so what's
going on is that whenever the highest
bid is larger than the highest value
over to certainly the revenue is at
least the highest value over to as well
so the revenue is at least p times opt
over 2 and also whenever the highest bid
is less than the highest value over to
now the highest bidder will win the item
when he uses his safe strategy and when
this happens he gets you cheeky only
pays half his value so he gets utility
half of his value okay so this means
that just by the highest bidder his
utility by deviating to the safe
strategy is at least 1 minus P times opt
over 2 and now when we plug both of
these back into this bound will see that
you can get lambda equals a half mu
equals 1 okay so i think following
through this reasoning formally is not
super important but the important thing
is that you kind of see how you would
reason about this okay
so every bitter has a safe strategy and
by reasoning through what happens we can
see that everyone's utility exceeds this
bound okay so how I think of
interpreting this is that in any of
these equilibria the highest value
player is at least as happy with
whatever strategy he's using then he
would be if he used his safe strategy
and just bid half his value instead and
it turns out that this fact alone means
that the price of anarchy is at most two
at these equilibrium concepts okay the
way you prove it formally is going
through smoothness but intuitively this
is what's going on okay so any questions
okay okay so now I want to do a slightly
more complex example so in the single
bid auction I want to only look at very
simple valuation functions and show that
the single bid auction has a low price
of energy here as well so i'll define
this constraint homogeneous call it c hv
so a valuation is constrained
homogeneous if there exists a set s and
a value X such that your value for any
set is just x times the number of items
in s that you get so your additive
except your value for every item is
either 0 or X so it's a very restricted
class evaluations okay and so something
we show is that the single bid auction
is also one one-half smooth whenever
buyers are constrained homogeneous and
I'm not going to go through a complete
proof but um oh sorry this is just
reminding you of what the single bid
auction is in case you didn't remember
from the earlier slide so this is phase
one where everyone submits a single bid
in phase 2 where the bidders are visited
one at a time and they can buy whatever
set of items they want and so the proof
idea is the safe strategy is going to be
basically the same as in the first price
auction every bitter safe strategy is
going to be to bid half of their per
item value over two and then when they
get visited in the second phase they're
going to buy whatever items in their
special set remain okay and then the
rest of the proof i'm going to skip but
it's very similar to the
smoothness proof for first price
auctions you're just summing a different
bound over each item okay and again how
you should interpret this is it in any
equilibrium every bitter is at least as
happy with the strategy they're using as
if they deviate it to their safe
strategy instead and in this case
they're safe strategy is bidding half
their per item value and taking whatever
items are left in phase 2 in this fact
alone implies that the price of anarchy
is at most two in the form of way you
show this is through the smoothness okay
so what do we see so far so proving that
single dimensional auctions or smooth is
not so bad but directly handling
combinatory evaluations is much harder
and kind of the reason is that we can't
break down per item contribution on when
we try to prove these bounds because the
evaluations are combinatorial and
they're weird okay so what we would like
to do is come up with some kind of lemma
that will let us reduce proving
smoothness bounds for complex valuations
to proving smoothness balance for
simpler valuations which you can see is
not so bad okay and so it turns out that
the right notion that we need is this
definition that will call a point wise
be approximation so say that a class
evaluations V big V point wise be
approximates big V prime if forever
evaluation in V prime and subsets s of
items there exists a little V such that
this first guarantee is just saying that
a little V is close to V Prime Italy on
just on this special set X and the
second claim is just saying that the
lower bounds V Prime everywhere okay so
this is a really weak notion of
approximation the only guarantee is it V
and V prime are closed on s everywhere
else v could be like 0 it could be
infinitely smaller than the prime we
don't care as long as it's less than V
Prime
okay so what we show is that this even
this really weak notion of approximation
suffice is to get this kind of extension
lemma so the claim is that whenever a
class of valuations pointwise be
approximates another class and you have
a mechanism that's lambda mu smooth
whenever valuations are in the simpler
class then M is also lambda over B mu
smooth for this more complex class okay
and the proof it turns out is actually
not so hard it just uses each of these
properties exactly once but I'm not
going to go through it because it's
mostly just chasing around these
inequalities okay so now the interesting
thing that we show and this is a little
bit more technical so I'm omitting this
as well is it constraint homogeneous
valuations pointwise log M approximates
about it evaluations okay so this means
that for every sub additive function
there is for every sub additive function
and for every set s there is a
constraint homogeneous evaluation such
that whereas our less of definition oh
no it's up here such that it's close to
that so bad ative function on s and for
everywhere else it's no larger okay and
then this alone by our theorem says that
on the single bid auction is now 1 minus
1 over e log m one smooth first about it
if bidders this is using the fact that
it was smooth for constraint homogeneous
and this extension lemma okay so
therefore what this means is that the
price of Anarchy at all these
equilibrium concepts is at most 1 minus
1 over u times log m ok and again so how
you should interpret this stepping back
from the smoothness and how the proof
comes is it in any equilibrium of the
single bid auction for sub additive
buyers every bitter is at least as happy
with their current strategy as they
would be if they use their safe strategy
and what is our safe strategy it's to
pretend they're constraint homogeneous
bid half of their per item value and
then take whatever items are left and
their constraint homogeneous set okay
and then this fact alone guarantees at
the price of anarchy is at most 1 minus
1 over e log m
so I want to point out too that this
guarantee holds even if the bidders
don't know what they're safe strategy is
okay so the point is you might look at
this and think like ok you know maybe I
don't know what chv evaluation i'm
supposed to pretend i am and that's
reasonable but what an equilibrium
guarantees you is that whatever you're
safe strategy is you prefer to do what
you're doing then anything else so you
don't need to know what this special
anything else is you prefer to do what
you're already doing then to deviate to
it so so any where is it any of these so
Nash correlated course correlated or
Bay's Nash and I haven't defined them
yet because it's it's not going to be
super relevant yet okay okay so this is
so this is the the first part of the
theorem where we showed that the single
bid auction is a 1-1 over ye log M
smooth first about it if bidders and
therefore the price of Anarchy at all
these equilibrium concept is at most 1
minus 1 over e times log M does this
mean anything to vote well it looks like
it Vanessa so when you so specifically
when you do a smoothness proof it also
extends to so if you have like epsilon
course correlated equilibrium you just
lose a multiplicative epsilon here
multiplicative it's 1 minus epsilon
times this bound this is not necessarily
true for any price of Anarchy bound but
specifically ones that are proved
through smoothness they're all so smooth
with respect to approximate concepts
okay so the so the next thing I have to
do is so I told you that the important
part about this auction was that some
equilibrium concept at which this bound
holds should arise naturally okay and
it's going to be course correlated
equilibria okay so let me put these two
theorems on the board that maybe you're
already familiar with so the first one
is just relating learning algorithms to
course correlated equilibria so what
this says is that if you have any game
and that game is played multiple time so
thank every round you play the same game
if every player plays
strategy that guarantees no regret then
the aggregate strategies that randomly
sample around and each player plays our
strategy from that round converges to a
course correlated equilibrium okay and
I'm actually still not going to formally
define what a course correlated
equilibrium is the only thing that's
important is that every player
separately minimizing regret converges
to a course correlated equilibrium and
the price of Anarchy bound that we
proved holds it this equilibrium concept
okay and then another theorem is if a
player is trying to do no regret
learning and there are K possible
actions that they can take it is
possible for them to do this in time and
space Polly in the number of actions
okay and by no regret I just mean that
um this is the standard definition but
every player is happier with the choices
that they've made then playing any fixed
action every round okay so let me just
give you some examples so that we can
see why you can't do no regret learning
and some of these other auction formats
significance of the first few run yes so
you say that the players can learn a new
query on but each in each count of the
learning process itself well not
necessarily that's correct so that's
correct you need to switch eventually so
so it's not so it's not quite like that
so what's going on is that um so
formally the reason that you care about
price of Anarchy bounds of course
correlated equilibrium even though every
day they're not necessarily playing one
is that if you look at the average
welfare across every day that the game
is played this is saying that the
average welfare is necessarily good
because the strategies that are played
over time is a proximate course
correlated equilibrium so it is not the
case at any single day you can look and
say the welfare is good on this day but
but you can guarantee that over time the
average welfare is good so because every
day maybe so just saying this course
quality the room you can pretty good
estimation
please you think one day at random then
everybody please okay in the venture in
this response to operational fair yeah
so it's not the same as cold okay the
course in such a day akan diminutive
everybody play they started you pulled
that particularly yes that's right yeah
so this make sense to the important
thing is that over time the average
welfare is guaranteed to be good because
of this claim okay so as an example
let's say that we decided to use the
simultaneous first price auctions format
which is known to have a price of
anarchy of two so each bidder has
exponentially many possible actions in
this mechanism because they can place a
different bid for each of the M possible
items so if they can place at least two
different bids for each item then
there's 2 to the M different strategies
so they can't necessarily in poly time
run no regret learning ok so this isn't
a proof that you can't do it but at
least you can't just use an
off-the-shelf no regret algorithm and
maybe you shouldn't expect them you know
bidders to be able to do this on their
own ok in a sequential first price
auction it's actually even worse each
bidder has exponentially many an NM
number of bidders x number of items
possible actions because now they have
to consider what are they going to do
for every possible history of bids on
the preceding items ok and so maybe this
is a little bit more interesting is it
if instead you have a truthful auction
then each bidder may have many possible
actions but they can always guarantee no
regret just by telling the truth every
round right because we know that every
round no matter what happens you're
happy you're telling the truth than
doing anything else so you only have one
possible strategy that you need to
consider ok this is this last claim is
important does that make sense so even
though you may have lots of actions you
only need to consider one of them ok so
here's a observation about the single
bid auction is it during phase two when
the bidder is visited and there's some
set s of items that remain
they have no incentive to select
anything except for their favorite set
that they can get right so they can't
affect anything that happens to them in
the future they can't affect any other
bidders behavior so they might as well
at this point just pick their favorite
set which will maximize their value for
that set minus what they have to pay to
get it so what this means is that even
though the bidders technically have
exponentially many strategies during
phase 2 they can always minimize regret
by just picking the best one so they
don't need to learn what they should do
during phase 2 ok now during phase 1
they just have to submit a single real
number and it turns out that you only
need to consider bids that are powers of
2 and this is not an interesting proof
but what this means is that now the only
actions the bidders need to consider our
actions that during phase 1 submits a
bit that's a power of 2 and during phase
2 buys their favorite set of whatever's
available to them and these are the only
actions that they need to learn over and
then the punch line is that there's only
polynomial II many such actions okay so
what this means is it because there's
not too many actions however they wind
up doing there no regret learning it
will run in poly time okay so this is
wrapping up this portion of the talk so
what we showed is that the single bid
auction has price of Anarchy log em that
course correlated equilibria whenever
buyers are sabbatic and we showed that
it's learnable and that any standard
regret minimization algorithm runs in
poly time because bidders only need to
consider polynomially many actions and
spiritually what this means is that it
has a low price of Anarchy add a
solution concept that is actually likely
to arise in practice and just to remind
you of how this contrast was previous
work is it on prior mechanisms either
we're not used because they had a
prohibitive runtime or prohibitive
complex design or they are used but we
don't understand what will actually
happen when bidders play them
just nikhil so sure Orson's have been
used some pieces we had an early version
or draft oxygens the potato is
confidence that has been used hopefully
this attention to this yeah it allows
we're gonna see how the creators of this
why is it so that it or whatever to the
price of a coupon to the same but you
don't get this learnability and so this
isn't so the point is in the draft
auctions how you act the first time you
bid may affect how bit you know like
there's a lot of interaction going on
between your first bid your second vid
your third bid so it's not necessarily
the case that you always want to pick
your favorite set of items its left
whereas in this one because it's so
short you immediately want to just pick
your favorite thing okay so let me say
so maybe this auction I don't sounds
like it might be used in practice even
if it's not what might be more likely to
be used in practice is um you know one
that fills in this last column so maybe
so I think what would be nice price
vanity of log M is not bad but it's also
not constant and we know that the price
of Anarchy could be two for these
auctions that don't have or that we
don't know have learnable equilibrium
yet so this I think following this work
is kind of the main open question is to
find a mechanism that is simple in
design is learnable it runs in poly time
but has a better price of Anarchy option
you described
little give me the lower one yes so
that's the second part of talk it's
gonna prove that to you it's log M over
log log n but um ballgame i think is
probably the right answer so what is
this auction it's kiss this one so this
is a every item you just run a first
price auction separately or started
releasing for what does it also means
that we don't know how to find any
equilibrium of this auction in poly time
cool this may be spiritually to think of
it if I told you that you were gonna
play in this auction like like what
would you do and that's hard yeah
whereas sorry for many games you can
come through that yes that's also true
yeah so it's it's actually got close
next to me yes so I think that's the big
things that you can't even learn right
so there's the point is there's
exponentially many different bids you
could make so even if you were willing
to do some kind of no regret learning
you can't do it in poly time whereas for
this auction okay it's still not it's
still not obvious to me like in one step
what I should do in a single bid auction
but at the very least if i run a no
regret algorithm i can do it in poly
time and i'll learn something the
guarantees me no regrets the polynomial
dairy might be with polynomial seen you
around like you helped a little maybe
many options hmm just walking what's how
many striker give you yes ah so it'll be
not basically it's just how finally do
you have to discretize the bid space so
if but it's not very fine so it'll it'll
really be maybe like on the order of em
or something like even if you let them
have em different strategies that lets
you send exponentially meant like from 1
to 2 to the M you can represent a lot of
values like this so it may even be less
particular sensor in this you're saying
if the option is that every item goes
separately right a bit for every idea
doesn't matter what the Tea Room will do
is that doesn't matter what if you will
be tied up yes it leave it in factored
to correct only problem is we don't know
how
that's correct and in some sense you
should maybe not expect bidders to
naturally wind up at one magically
either right yeah okay that's so i would
say another approach is maybe you could
look at simultaneous single item
auctions to find a new equilibrium
concept and say I think bidders will do
this and if it makes sense and then
prove price of Anarchy pounds there but
um we don't know how to do that yet okay
so the second part of the talk is gonna
discuss these things that we call
interpolation mechanisms and basically
they're going to address let me hear say
here what they're going to address is
that um so after you know after this got
out a bit so I think a lot of people
were asking questions like oh there are
so many natural generalizations of this
auction maybe one of these simple
modifications will let you significantly
improve the price of anarchy okay so and
the important things you want to
maintain that the auction is learnable
so that's a key property and so a lot of
natural ideas are like okay you know
bidders could learn over two bids
instead of just one bid we made at the
same time this isn't that much more
information maybe this helps a lot maybe
you can set a different price for each
item so there's no reason that you have
to use the same price for every item you
could report some information and then
somehow I come up with a non uniform
pricing maybe just sabbatic is hard but
it would be nice if this auction worked
first a modular a budgeted additive or
some other valuation class it was not
quite so general another thing is maybe
we could study the price of stability
instead of the price of anarchy you know
and also I think we just wanted to
understand like what are mechanisms like
this so like what should that mean and
I'm so what we did in this follow-up
work is we defined a class of mechanisms
like this that we call interpolation
mechanisms and using this we showed that
none of these for relaxation Zebub can
improve the approximation ratio so if we
want to be log M we have to do something
new
not no combination of them yeah okay so
let's define so an interpolation
mechanism we say is a two-phase
mechanism the first phase is just some
arbitrary communication protocol the
output of that protocol is a truthful
mechanism ok and then phase two is just
bidders play the whatever truthful
mechanism was selected during phase one
so think of the single bid auction phase
one is everyone submits a bid and the
output for phase two is a truthful
mechanism that visits bidders one at a
time and when they're visited they are
faced with an item pricing that depends
on how everyone bid during phase one
okay so is this make sense so once phase
one is fixed and in the books phase two
is a truthful mechanism and that's for
the same reason that once they get
visited they just want to pick their
favorite set okay so I think this is the
right way to kind of generalize this
format and again so what we're
interested in is how much time or space
does it take to run a no regret
algorithm on an interpolation mechanism
and the point is it like we said before
bidders will never regret telling the
truth during phase two so a priori they
just need to consider all possible
actions during phase one combined with
telling the truth during phase two okay
so the important features of an
interpolation mechanism will be how much
communication and how many rounds take
place during phase one and this is
important because this tells you how
many number of actions the bidders are
going to AA priori consider and second
is what kind of truthful mechanisms
shows up in phase two and I'll use this
terminology and interpolation mechanism
to be if the phase two mechanisms come
from some class m ok so this definition
makes sense good okay
okay and so um this is the last
definition i think i'm going to give so
we'll say that an interpolation
mechanism is a priori learnable if the
first phase consists of a single
simultaneous broadcast round of
communication and each bidder
communicates only log M bits okay so the
reason this is useful is because this
implies that every bitter only has
polynomially many actions to consider in
the first round so they can run any no
regret strategy that they want in poly
time and you see this is a sufficient
but not necessary condition that a
learning algorithm exists ok so again
using the single bit mechanism as an
example in phase one there's log m
communication / bitter and there's one
round and that's why there's
polynomially many actions in phase 2
i'll call this format a single posted
price mechanism okay it picks some
prices ahead of time visits buyers one
at a time and offers them any remaining
items at whatever their prices per item
okay so all right so another view of
single bid mechanisms now that we're
looking at it like this is it on this
phase one by itself is really pretty
useless right so each bidder is only
submitting log n bits right when they're
at their valuation is a sub additive
function which takes doubly
exponentially many bits to represent
okay but somehow this isn't as right so
this is not enough to guarantee any
non-trivial approximation the second
phase by itself is also completely
useless because no single posted price
mechanism can possibly guarantee and
it's even worse you can't get any kind
of approximation just using one of these
mechanisms by themselves but
interestingly combining them in the
right way somehow results in a pretty
non-trivial approximation starting from
these two pretty useless components okay
so there's some hope that maybe starting
with a more useful component in phase
two will actually let you do better okay
and so the the right questions to ask
for here are how much phase one
communication does it take in order to
get a
approximation ratio with an M
interpolation mechanism you can ask us
for any class of truthful mechanisms and
what is the best approximation guarantee
that you can get of an AA priori
learnable M interpolation mechanism okay
so let's specialized that to the single
posted price mechanisms so how much
phase one communication is required to
guarantee better than a log M
approximation with a single posted price
mechanism so how much communication do
you need to beat the single bid auction
and so actually it turns out that no
amount of communication so no single
posted price interpolation mechanism can
beat a little o of log M over log log M
approximation no matter how much
communication happens during phase one
and this is even when the bidders are
just additive so the buyers don't have
to be very complex for this lower bound
to kick in so in particular what this
means is it the best approximation
guarantee of an opera or e-learning bowl
single posted price mechanism is
somewhere between Omega of log M over
log log em in Oh of log M okay so I'm
going to give a proof overview of this
now so what we want to do is we're just
going to construct an example where no
single posted price mechanism does well
and then if we have an example like this
no amount of communication is going to
help you magically find the single
posted price mechanism that doesn't
exist okay so here's what the example is
going to look like there's going to be
for each buyer there's a different
bucket of items and the buckets are
going to have you know wildly different
number of items it'll be n to the I for
bukkit I each item is going to be
special for exactly one bitter and each
bidder is going to have a 1 over N
fraction of all the items in each bucket
is special for them and bitters value
their special items in each bucket it a
factor of n more than their non special
items okay so maybe the concrete example
is more useful here so the red items
each different color is a different
bucket so in the red bucket there's
three items everyone values their
special item at 27 and their non special
items at nine in the blue bucket there
are 9 items everyone has three special
items that they each value at nine
they value their non special items at
three then in the green bucket there's
27 items and they value their nine
special ones at three and their non
special ones at one okay okay so clearly
the optimal thing to do is just to give
every bitter their special item and now
the question is how well can you do with
a single posted price mechanism ok so
the trade-off here is that if I want
bitter one to get his special item in
the blue bucket I have to set a price
for him of nine or lower but if I set a
price for him of nine or lower he's also
going to steal the special items that I
wanted to go to one of the later bidders
and if I wanted to get his a special
item in the green bucket I have to set a
price as low as three and then he's
going to steal all the previous special
items as well ok so this is kind of the
trade-off is that you can't give the
first bidder all of their special items
without him also stealing special items
from the bidders who come after him ok
and it turns out that the way the math
works out that um opt is n to the n plus
1 no spp can do better than order n to
the n there n to the n items in the
example so n is log M over log log M so
that's where the gap comes from ok so
what this means is that the single bid
auction already reaches the limit of the
single posted price interpolation
mechanisms what about a more general
posted price scheme so I think the
natural next step is will consider yeah
so let's say in that example that a good
that did you do your auction like the
first video for some reason was
announced 10 the second will announce
for insane then you'd go in the right
order and give each one the items that
they want No so this so these are the
items and these are the bitter so if
bitter one announces 10 he would show up
and he would buy only read item one he
would not buy any of the blue or any of
the green items and then he would be
gone and he would never come back and
then two would show up and if he bid
for he would take so what's left he
would take all of the remaining red
items and he would take his special blue
item but he would not take any of the
green items and then three would come up
and let's say they bid one they would
just take all of the remaining items
whatever's left that makes sense so the
point is it so bitter ones bid was too
high for him to possibly get his special
items in the lower buckets bitter tues
bid was too high for him to get his
special item here it was also too low
for him to pass up on taking three
special item in the red bucket so the
point is just that every bitter has a
wildly different value for the different
items and one number is just not enough
for them to represent their preferences
what you lose is exactly log em
did that it I think okay okay so a
slightly more general scheme that we
want to consider I'll call non-adaptive
posted price mechanisms so here you
order the bidders however you like maybe
at random and then for each bidder in
each item you set a price maybe at
random and then you visit bidders one at
a time and offer bitter I the
opportunity to buy any set of items
paying pij for item J ok so this
generalizes it in the sense that now you
can have whatever price you want for
each item they can be different across
bidders they can be different across
items ok so now it's always the case
that there is a non adaptive posted
price mechanism that results in any
allocation you want and for any
allocation that you want to induce you
can just set the price of item J equal
to zero if you want bitter I to take
that item in infinity if you don't want
them to take that item ok so we're not
going to get a strong impossibility
result like on the previous slide
because there's always a non-adaptive
posted price that results in the optimal
allocation so the question now is how
much phase one communication do you need
to find a good non-adaptive posted price
mechanism ok so just because one exists
doesn't mean you can find it easily ok
and so the answer is that on any
non-adaptive posted price interpolation
mechanism the guarantees a little low of
log M over log log M approximation still
just on all instances of additive
bidders necessarily has at least em to
the 1 minus epsilon first-round
communication / bitter and this is for
any epsilon this is not just for 16
epsilon for any epsilon this house to
hold okay and so the proof I'm not going
to go through the proof it looks similar
to the previous construction the idea is
that now we need a family of examples
such that no single non-adaptive posted
price does well except on an
exponentially small fraction it turns
out that using a probabilistic
construction and ideas from the previous
one we can do this okay so what this
means is it the best approximation
guarantee of an opera or a learnable
adaptive posted price interpolation
mechanism is somewhere between Omega
vlog m / log log M and order log M okay
so this means that even for this way
more general class of mechanisms single
bid auctions have already reached the
limits of these so maybe what about
other classes of mechanisms whether to
be not extremely cold right so no so
even for additive so the problem is that
um if you have an additive buyer it
takes basically M log M bits to describe
your evaluation so if I let you use em
log M bits you could tell me your value
I could allocate the items optimally
there's no problem it turns out that in
order to do anything better than log M
over log log M you need basic you need
basically to say your whole valuation
and that if you use anything less you
can't be log M but that just one number
is enough to get you log in so yes so
for additive fires that's exactly what
you would do yeah okay so I'm gonna just
maybe briefly go through this so we
consider two more classes of mechanisms
that have been previously studied I
won't read through the definitions but
they're called a maximal and Ranger
value query and very strong lower bounds
are known against both of these classes
of mechanisms as truthful mechanisms
without interpolation and what we show
is that all of the existing lower bounds
also extend to interpolation mechanisms
that have sub exponential first phase
communication is that means these are
also not going to let you do anything
interesting with operatory learnable
mechanisms okay so now I'm going to wrap
up so just to recap the motivation was
we wanted combinatorial auctions that
had to either approximately optimal or
had a low price of anarchy and we wanted
them to be simple in design and also
strategically simple and specifically we
mean learnable so in the first part of
the talk we showed you the single bid
auction and it's the first one that hits
all 3 of these criteria but the price of
Anarchy was still logarithmic and not
constant in the second part of the talk
we introduced this notion of an
interpolation mechanism to try and
properly generalize this format
and the way to think about this this is
kind of like mixing a non truthful and a
truthful mechanism the first phase is
non truthful but really limited and the
second phase is a truthful mechanism ok
so we proved lower bounds on mechanisms
that are like the single bid auction we
showed that we've already reached the
limits of interpolation with all these
classes of mechanisms the one that we
left open is called adaptive posted
price mechanisms so these are posted
price mechanisms where based on what you
see for the first couple bidders you can
update the prices of the remaining
bidders so these are oops all right so
these are more general than the nonets
that's why I called non-adaptive the
ones that we saw so far where the prices
were fixed oh all right where the prices
were fixed ahead of time okay and we
know that the techniques that we have
right now cannot possibly prove lower
bounds for additive buyers and not
adaptive posted price mechanism so we
need either new techniques for lower
bounds or maybe this is a nice direction
for a positive design okay and then just
to give you this chart one more time so
the left hand side is what we already
knew the green column is what we
contributed with the single bid auction
and then the right hand column is I
think the nice open direction in
interpolation mechanisms or maybe a nice
way to address it okay so that's all I
have thanks a lot for listening
delicious did you look at um like
characterizing the strategy better
felony which Brochu is a civil action
that's a good question um no we didn't
um yeah so I guess first you would have
to free you know for different valuation
functions you could test and see what
happens but um we didn't look at that
that's such a pretty good question so
what I do by the sound of this you can
play it Sardinia single item yes it's I
mean it's optimal so for additive
isolate it's better than learnable it's
truthful for additive buyers
simultaneous auctions you should always
bid your value on every item there's
nothing better you can hope to do right
so so for additive buyers vcg and
simultaneous and sequential are all
they're all
same thing and they all collapsed good
news okay so the reason we were using
additive buyers for lower bounds is
basically to rule out you know you might
say look so bad ative functions are
really complex maybe you can have a good
price of Anarchy for some modular buyers
or something way simpler we're saying
there's no way that restriction is going
to help you because whatever restriction
you come up with it should at least
contain an additive buyers yeah so just
say I'm not motivating that searching
for better mechanisms for additive
buyers is not a interesting research
direction but if you have lower bounds
for additive buyers you shouldn't hope
to get anything interesting beyond that
all right yeah so mark is here till
Monday and greet all of you two talking
not ready to this all right thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
