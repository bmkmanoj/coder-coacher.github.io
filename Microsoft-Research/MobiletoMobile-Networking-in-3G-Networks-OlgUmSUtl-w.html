mobile computing and cloud computing so
move our phones today they come with a
3g data plan they have very good
internet connectivity they could very
well I'd use the cloud as a backhand to
store additional data or to make use of
the cloud to do additional processing
that is kind of expensive to do on the
phone so I'm looking at opportunities
that come up in the mobile computing
sector what we've done is we've built
some applications that showcase the
benefits that you get so the
applications themselves when you look at
the U is their primitive however what's
interesting to understand is that at the
back of in the back of the hood we're
using Windows Azure which is a scalable
cloud platform and all of the
information that's being shared is being
shared with the utmost privacy now on my
mobile device I receive a filter request
from my friend and I accept that filter
request I take a picture of an object
with my phone this image matches the
filter that my friend have installed
gets encrypted and shipped via ashore to
my friend who now sees the picture with
the appropriate tag so let's pretend i
have a friend Alice who is interested in
my location while I'm in her vicinity
Alice can draw a region on a map that
indicates that she is interested in my
location while I'm inside this region
and sent a filter to my device I
received this filter on my device I can
choose to accept this now subsequent
location updates that are generated by
my device that fall within the region of
Alice's interest end up getting relate
to her and you can see this as the red
bush pins that are showing up on the map
if I'm installing a filter on another
person's device that filter gets
uploaded to the cloud and the other
person is downloading it from there so
now of course once you bring in the
cloud again we have to be worried about
privacy again which was the problem we
wanted to solve in the first place so
what we do is we encrypt all data on the
antivirus so that a filter that is going
to be installed is encrypted before it's
going to be upload it to the cloud and
any data item that match the filter is
going to be encrypted before
where it's going to be uploaded to the
cloud so in that way we be guaranteed
privacy of the users so the data that is
stored in the cloud is always an
encrypted form and cannot be viewed by
any by anybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
