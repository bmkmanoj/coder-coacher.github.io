install on who we can just can actually
talk and see what good so I'm going to
demo a bot that i wrote using beep boop
from here hosting it on beep boop and
written in vodka why I built this but I
started this bad because our sales team
have been demoing how to create BOTS and
how to create integrations on slack and
the way they've been doing it is
actually scripting the conversation and
then giving it in the early days to
engineers to build the other side right
to build the box so to create
notification to create / commands to
clear conversation with but they
actually had to scrape the bots and then
send it to one of our engineers to build
and that was very cumbersome so I'm a
geek and when my kids wake me up in the
middle of the night I code so i decided
to code the bots that you can actually
program while talking to it so i just
discuss that on on the done on botanist
which you were all invited yesterday so
i install it here this is the demo bot
so let's say hello to the demo bot oh
sorry hello but as you can see when you
got here something that it doesn't know
it actually say hey what should I say
right so i can teach the box to respect
hello with 1l because i probably people
will do that as well right so i'll do a
learn and when people say hello you say
i am a demo bot typo
and now the demo bot knows so I called
it dr. Jacob you'll know why it's called
dr j Cole soon but now when I do a hello
then the mobot know what to say so it's
pretty cool what it's really nice is
that you can create actual you can I
call dr. Jacob because it has
personalities it has multiple
personalities so let's let's create a
personality personality and all this so
I'll cut this and they say set persona
name help desk
from now on I shall be called sir help
desk and now we'll give it set persona
URL and I'll I've taken the image I
borrowed from the internets and now I'll
say hello
and as you can see it's now help desk it
has the icon and that's pretty cool so
now i can i can change another i can
create another put a note you know what
we'll do this so we'll create a channel
here and we'll call it helpdesk help and
another and we'll invite the box
okay and as you can see it works here as
well so what another thing that I can
really do is pin that persona because I
can support multiple personalities I can
pin this persona to this channel which
is really useful because you can have
multiple channels associated with
multiple personas of the box so I'll do
this print persona and now this persona
is saved in to this channel so we can go
back to the demo BOTS and create a new
persona
oop create and
new persona yep and we'll call it sales
and we'll create a new name sales person
named Salesforce
and we can take Salesforce logo
and now let's teach it to do a slash
accounts right because we support
accounts we support a slash command I
can download and we'll do a slash
accounts general electric I don't I
don't know if we have General Electric
but let's see and now we'll say that the
I can the dollar not dog dollar account
mana manager Lily Chang and right let's
do it parts mmm yeah this is a good one
tech support ben Brown sorry bad
too much tech support are awesome
and now I can do a slash accounts GE and
the Salesforce BOTS answers and now I
can actually create a channel for
salesforce and pin that Salesforce
bought into the into that's the same but
right remember dr j Cole it has multiple
personalities so when I can create a
sales channel
and invites the demo bot here and now
pin this persona here so what's cool
about this is that for you can create if
you have a UX designer or you want two
prototypes right the bot into a channel
and then the sales bot will live here so
I can do a slash accounts GE here and if
I move to the help channel I can still
say huh hello and the help desk bought
answers and it's the same bot so I'm
using one engine one bar and you can
typing difference so I guess my question
is this you think is useful yes no
should I publishes if you think it's not
useful tell me later or if you have any
feature requests i'm always working on
this nice i know you have it in buckets
actually private right now but you have
it close enough beep boop with non-pom
kitchen now install it bothers you can
play with it create your own channel
invite the box and play with it a little
bit and if you think I should publish it
let me know awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
