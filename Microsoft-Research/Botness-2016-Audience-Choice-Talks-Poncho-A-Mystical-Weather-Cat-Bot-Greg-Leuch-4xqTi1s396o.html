buncha was okay we will solve this one
very quickly very easily ah poncho is a
weather cap it tells you the weather
pretty simple it is not a fox contrary
to what a lot of people ask we have a
lot of people actually ask is pancho of
fox um yeah so for those of you they
don't know we just launched at Facebook
Developer Conference fa back in April
we've been doing the bot thing for about
two months now you turn that off I can't
I guess I can uh we had basically one
month the launch of this Facebook came
to us and said hey we think ponch is
great you guys have been doing really
interesting stuff with SMS with email
with your iOS app we want you to do
something on facebook Messenger we had
one month to figure this out it was a
big what the for us at the same
time we saw what was happening with
today shall ice and some of these other
BOTS and we knew that we needed to do
something different we wanted to be fun
we didn't want to get caught up in the
bad feedback cycles that happen with day
so for us one of the biggest concerns
that we had was negative feedback
negative criticism and how to deal with
that one of the big things with today
was the screenshots actually happen I
mean I'm not going to pull up any of
those but you know it was something that
we were worried about we did not want
people taking screenshots of Pancho's
saying something bad something terrible
we wanted to keep it pc enough but also
be friendly enough so one of things that
we actually did we built an entire
content management system using reap
script which is very similar to rob
superscript to allow our editors to go
in and actually write out a bunch of
different keywords phrases or rays of
things and be able to match on that so
this one for instance is a conversation
flow for how to deal with banned words
you know we don't want people coming in
saying a lot of nasty stuff so let's say
we're talking to Pancho bot and we say
the word panchal says hey that's
rude it will call you out the trick
though here is with sorry if you say
sorry it'll be like okay I forgive you
but if you say whatever we actually
ignore you for a couple minutes because
we don't want the you to continue trying
to harass the bot trolling us whatever
else so welcome in here L to say sorry
poncho forgives us um but you know we
can't do everything right people are
going to complain people are going to
find problems with us so for instance
this person try to talk to the bot got a
little bit uh carried away decided to
you know be like hey you keep on talking
to us typing us that happens um but it
then the day though like we are a
weather bot we're trying to do
interesting things let's see did it to
do now I'm not that one oh yeah so for
instance like you know there's a lot of
people that you know understand teen
lingo they understand things like BB
I'll you know LMAO lol there's a lot of
people that don't there's a lot of
actually old adults also using this
we're finding that to be a fun challenge
to do is how do we respond back using
normal language but also be able to feel
fun playful with our language yeah
that's that's about it I'm Allah
scatterbrained today so I apologize if
that was a big whatever um yeah if you
guys haven't talked to pancho you guys
should you should ask it the weather you
should talk to it we have a lot of
different conversation flows so you guys
can like say hey Pancho you know hey I
love you or whatever else so you know
even something as simple as sending
alike be able to respond back and if you
guys ever have any questions you can
just hit me up you know G Looch you guys
can find me on the invite list for
botanist happy to talk to you has more
about this
