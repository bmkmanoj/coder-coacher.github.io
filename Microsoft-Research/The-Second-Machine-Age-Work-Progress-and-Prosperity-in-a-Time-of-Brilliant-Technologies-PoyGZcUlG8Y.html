thank you for coming my name is Jamie
Draves and I'm happy to welcome Erik
Brynjolfsson and Andy McAfee to the
Microsoft Research visiting speaker
series Eric and Andrew are here to
discuss their book the second Machine
Age in which they reveal the
technological forces behind an economic
sea change Eric and Andy are cofounders
of MIT is initiative on the digital
economy and Eric is one of the most
cited scholars and Information Systems
and economics Andy is a principal
research scientist and the author of
enterprise 2.0 please join me in giving
them a very warm welcome thanks I'm Eric
that's Andy and we're delighted to be
here in part because we as we were
writing this book and and as we continue
to do our work we really benefit from
interacting with audiences like this we
actually did some of our research here
at Microsoft research to understand some
of the trends that were going on as well
as course in the labs at MIT computer
science in the AI lab the Media Lab
folks in Silicon Valley and we spent
time to talking to a lot of economists
and to be frank we ended up kind of
confused and that was part of the origin
of this book I'm confused because there
are so many disparate trends going on in
particular when we talk to technologists
like many of you are I'm sure we often
come away amazed at the things that
you're accomplishing and that are not
only have already been done
but that are in the pipeline that we're
likely to see in the coming years and
there's sort of this common optimism
infectious optimism even techno
utopianism that you get when you talk to
technologists about being able to solve
all sorts of problems and that the
world's going to be a much better place
and it all seemed to make a lot of sense
to us but then there are other groups we
talk to economists for instance I was
just at a meeting at the American
economic
Association in Philadelphia where I was
in a panel with the three other
economists and I realized it's a reason
that economics is often called the
dismal science they have a very
different perspective on where we are
and where we're going and and they have
a lot of data behind that as well
economic statistics and some dimensions
are actually pretty dismal median income
today is lower than it was in the 1990s
and you as you ensure you know
employment has been falling as a share
of the pot of the overall population
unemployment is still quite bad and to
the extent it's improved a bit that
mostly reflects the fact that people are
dropping out of the labor force so they
aren't looking for work anymore as
opposed to a lot of new people being
employed and Indy and I sometimes call
this the great paradox of our era the
fact that on one hand innovation has
never been faster yet people are more
concerned about their futures and their
children's futures we have record 11 the
country we just hit a new all-time high
seventy seven trillion dollars a couple
weeks ago record levels of GDP record
levels of productivity record levels of
profits and all those numbers are going
up but not everyone is sharing in that
if median income is lower that means
that 50% of the people have not gotten
better off and many of them don't even
have jobs so reconciling these two
disparate trends is something that we
really struggle with and we were
confused with but about and as we were
working on the research for this book we
ultimately came to the conclusion that
paradoxically both of these sets of
trends actually have a common cause and
that is the way technology is being
deployed and unfolding in the economy
not just the United States but worldwide
and it reflects an important fact and
kind of a dirty secret of you can
really which is the technology tends to
grow the economic pie making us
wealthier than ever before but there's
no economic law that says everyone
benefits evenly from that advance it's
entirely possible for some people
potentially even a majority of people to
be made worse off
not just in relative terms but in
absolute terms now with earlier ways of
technology it was a relatively small
group buggy with manufacturers were made
worse off by the introduction of the
automobile but in time everyone
benefited and that's the case with most
other major technological innovations
but if you look at the data that hasn't
been true more recently the latest wave
of technologies seems to not be
benefiting people nearly as broadly the
data show that for the past 200 years
productivity GDP median income
employment we're all rising more or less
in sync with each other a decade after
decade but starting really about the
early 1990s and accelerating since then
the trends have started diverging
productivity has continued to grow
pretty strongly as has overall GDP but
median income became disconnected from
it as did employment now the nature of
the new technologies is part of the
story behind that we call our book the
second Machine Age which is an obvious
echo to the first Machine age by which
we mean the Industrial Revolution
throughout most of history economic
prospects for the vast majority of
people hardly changed at all until the
first Machine age when we hit an
inflection point and growth really took
off that was in the late 1700s early
1800s in the first Machine Age for the
first time we really learned how to
automate and augment remove the limits
really from our muscle power
and provide a much more access to
physical power through a whole set of
machines the first big one being of
course the steam engine but later the
internal combustion engine and others
and that set living standards soaring
which we're still benefiting from even
today
what's the second Machine Age the second
Machine Age is when a set of
technologies is affecting not so much
our muscles but our brains removing the
limitations from a lot of cognitive
functions like the first Machine Age the
second Machine Age is unleashing
enormous wealth and productivity and
raising living standards on average but
it's also different in some ways you see
in order to take advantage of physical
power systems you need a control system
you need brains to manage the physical
power systems and so as technologies
like the steam engine gave us more
physical power to manipulate the world
it was actually very complimentary to
human labor required more human workers
to manage that and that was a
synergistic system in the second Machine
Age as we remove the limits from a lot
of cognitive tasks it's not so clear
whether humans will be complements or
substitutes for those technologies and
that could have very different effects
on labor and on the distribution of
income let me be a little bit less
abstract and and stratospheric about
that and talk about some specific
applications so one one for instance is
uh an event that happened just as we
were beginning to think about this book
I was getting on to a plane and the
person in front of me was kind of
talking really loudly on his cell phone
and I couldn't help but overhear him as
you know you've sure you've been in that
situation before and what he was saying
was that oh no no no I don't use H&amp;amp;R
block anymore I use TurboTax it's faster
easier cheaper and so I don't need a
human tax preparer anymore
and I was thinking about that and of
course he was absolutely right
TurboTax $39 can do your taxes very
quickly efficiently accurately and it's
it's hard for a human tax prepared to
compete with a thirty nine dollar piece
of software
what Intuit has done is I think
Microsoft is a product Mis category too
doesn't it I'm not sure but no okay but
anyways Intuit has taken a process and
codified it and then taking it and
digitized that and once they've
digitized it as you guys know more than
better than just about anywhere else in
the world you can make a copy of it and
you can make ten copies of it you can
make a hundred million or a billion
copies of it and each of those copies is
a perfect replica of the original one
and each of them can be made for almost
zero marginal cost and each of them can
be transmitted virtually instantaneously
anywhere in the world through the
internet so there are free perfect and
instant those are three characteristics
we haven't seen in goods and services in
most of human history but those are the
characteristics of digital goods and
those technical properties lead to some
interesting economics in particular is
very common in digital markets for them
to be winner-take-all markets after all
if you're buying a piece of tax
preparation software or or any kind of
software it's unlikely that you're going
to want to buy the the tenth best
program or the thousands the best
program you could probably want to buy
the best one that's available and so
there tends to be a great concentration
of the revenues and just one or two or
maybe a handful of most of programs
instead of tens of thousands or hundreds
of thousands of tax preparers each
serving their own local markets and
neighborhoods you have just a handful
and maybe just one or two on dominant
providers who can get most of the market
share by providing a higher-quality
and or lower-cost product and that's
certainly what happened in with with
turbo tax you have a question there well
so let me just say I mean what we had in
mind was that nd now we're gonna speak
for maybe about I'll speak for another
three or four minutes and then Andy for
maybe five or six minutes then we'll
open to questions that'll probably best
but if there's some there's some
clarification if I mistake something you
know feel free to drop but if you want
to talk more generally when we do that
in about five to ten minutes so where
was it the winner-take-all markets like
in in for tax preparation software and
that leads to a real concentration of
the revenues in the case of tax
preparation software there are about 17
percent fewer human tax preparers now
than there were before
you're not because taxes are so much
easier to prepare than they were before
but because technology can now do it do
a lot of those tasks and what I just
described in that particular category is
a microcosm of what's happening in lots
of other categories obviously lots of
other kinds of software but also in
music in media and Mark Andreasen the
venture capitalist had this great phrase
that software is eating the world and by
that I think you means that these
digital technologies are becoming the
core of more and more industries
manufacturing retailing finance all
sorts of different industries are being
affected by it some day maybe even my
industry education are increasingly even
that industry and as more of these
industries have digital characteristics
at their core they start having the same
kind of economics these winner-take-all
economics or winner take most economics
and that has a big effect on the demand
for labor it's a big effect on the
income distribution in particular there
are two sets of winners and one set of
losers that are common in this sort of
the situation in the case of tax
preparation software the people who
developed that software and who are
marketing it and selling it they've done
very well
some of them are billionaires now many
others are millionaires also another big
group of winners is consumers there's a
tremendous amount of bounty lots of
people are made better off because they
have access to something today that is
better cheaper faster than what they had
before and digital goods by and large
are much more accessible to a much
broader group of people in lower cost
but this also a group that's made worse
off and that's the people who previously
did that job the human tax preparers who
aren't really adding a lot of value
anymore if they're competing with a 39
dollar piece of software and they need
to find something else to do some other
way to add value in the economy for some
of them that's proven very difficult
many of them had significant training in
this area college education ziza and so
that's a group that has been made worse
off by this and that's something that we
see happening in lots of other
industries as well so making sense of
these patterns of this growing wealth
this growing productivity the digital
bounty that's making many of us better
off or than the overall society better
off is part of the story but also this
significant change in the income
distribution and the way the benefits
are allocated and we think that these
changes are likely to accelerate in the
coming years as you look at some of the
technologies in the pipeline now I'll
turn to Andy in a minute here to
describe some of the things we saw as
we've looked at other sorts of
technologies so ultimately we think that
these kinds of changes in the technology
call for a better understanding of what
we need to do as individuals as
organizations as a society that the
technology is going to continue to
accelerate and the difficulties that we
face generally occur because as the
technology accelerates many of us are
not keeping up with it as technology
races ahead many of us individuals and
as organizations are being left behind
so once we recognize that issue we
in a position to maybe do thing take
actions and we'll talk about some of the
policy recommendations and ideas that
for what individuals can do to keep up
with the technology so that we stay more
and more in sync but why don't I pause
there and turn it over to my co-author
India McAfee who's gonna talk some more
about some of the the technologies and
the other issues that came up in this
book and then we'll open up to questions
from all of you and have I hope a robust
discussion about this
so Andy thanks Eric so like Eric says we
started writing the book because we were
confused about some of the things we saw
in the statistics but over the course of
writing it and anyone who tells you that
they have the goals of their book in
mind when they start writing it is lying
to you so over the course of the book
this I kept on hearing this message that
I really wanted to really wanted us to
get across as we were writing the book
and I kind of wanted to grab the reader
by the lapels and just deliver one
message which is we ain't seen nothing
yet and all these weird advances that
we've been seeing over the past few
years with natural language processing
and translation and autonomous vehicles
and unstructured search and reading all
these things are great they are not the
crowning achievements of the second
Machine Age of this digital revolution
they are the warm-up acts and we ain't
seen nothing yet let me try to make this
concrete and I want to do it I'm sorry
to put this on you were gonna do a pop
quiz trust me you all are gonna find it
really easy when I say go please point
to a door in this room go huh full
credit there are two doors in the room a
please point to where you are in the
room yeah and there's this really
interesting disjoint some folk go like
this and some go like this we'll accept
both answers for this you all have just
solved one of the toughest challenges in
robotics you all have just solved the
problem known as slam it stands for
simultaneous localization and mapping in
other words why does this room look like
where are the doors and where am I in it
what's what's my localization inside
this room it's a fiendishly difficult
program in a problem in robotics our
evolution has programmed us to be really
really good at it we there was a hundred
percent pass rate on our
but you'd have a 0% an absolute zero
percent pass rate with any flavor of
robot up until just a very short while
ago it was so bad that we came across a
review paper of the discipline written
in 2008 that said essentially man we're
making no progress on slam nor will we
at any point in the future this is just
too damn hard a problem to solve last
year a colleague of ours named John
Leonard at MIT did a brilliant
demonstration where he solved the slam
problem for a room about this size I am
NOT making this up by waving a Microsoft
Kinect around the room this is a hundred
and fifty dollar piece of gear this is
consumer electronics that stuff is now
powerful enough to solve the thorniest
challenges that we see over and over in
2004 there is a great book written by a
couple of our colleagues saying people
are people are going to keep driving
cars in the future because it's just too
hard a problem for digital stuff to
solve you know the punchline of this
joke right over and over again we see
the same thing where people were saying
smart informed people in the discipline
were saying less than 10 years ago
ain't gonna happen ain't gonna happen
and then these things have started to
happen and I'm reminded of a wonderful
quote from Hemingway about how a man
goes broke he says it's gradually and
then suddenly and that characterizes
this era of technical progress that when
we were making incremental progress for
a long time on some really thorny
challenges and now boom and we're just
off to the races and all the geeks that
we talk to geek is a term of highest
praise by the way in the world that Eric
and I live in all all of the technology
geeks that we talk to say guys we are
just getting warmed up you ain't seen
nothing yet so to continue on robotics
for a while
humanoid robots are still expensive big
slow heavy clunky they can't navigate
the world have any of us I think there
are probably some geeky enough people in
this room watch the video of the towel
folding robot at Berkeley and I see yeah
there's some geeks in this room this is
a robot that they that can fold towels
which is actually extremely difficult
because they're not towels we're not
rigid materials it takes the robot about
ten
second ten minutes to fold a towel and
you literally have to watch the video
and speed it up time because otherwise
it's just watching a robot collide it's
deadly born that robot is going to get a
lot quicker in in the months and years
to come we're gonna have fast towel
folding robots before too long all the
other so many of the other things that
that we think were inherently good at
you know speech writing reading
comprehension taking in a bunch of
different sensory channels and
navigating a vehicle Touch sense
mobility fine motor skills we hold out
the high ground in a lot of these areas
right now not all of them we are no
longer the best jeopardy players in the
world I think if we are not if we might
still be the best medical diagnosticians
not for very much longer
watson went to medical school as soon as
he was done winning on Jeopardy
so this encroachment that this is why I
don't think we've ever seen anything
like this before there's this digital
encroachment into stuff that used to
belong to human beings alone and this
encroachment is fast broad deep and
irreversible and making that case has
taken up about the first third of our
book you'll read that in chapters one
through six I think of the second
Machine Age chapters 7 through 10 or 11
I I helped write the book I should
probably have the chapters pretty firmly
in my head by now right the second third
of the book is about the economic
consequences of that and just like Eric
said there are two main consequences
there's good news and then there's some
challenging news as well the good news
is is more is bounty is more stuff more
volume and variety in higher quality
lower prices and just this ridiculous
abundance that technological progress
gives it it's honestly it's the best
Echenique economic news on the planet
today the second consequence of what
we're seeing is a lot less pleasant for
everybody it's spread it's this just
this ever-increasing divergence and
things that we should care a lot about
in a society wealth income social
mobility opportunity a stuff that we
care a great deal about there's a lot
more divergent
in that then there ever has before and
if we're anywhere near right that we
ain't seen nothing yet on the technology
front then we ain't seen nothing yet on
the economics front as well the good
news is that the bounty will continue
its my strongest prediction about the
future the other prediction though is
that absent some interventions the
spread is going to continue to widen as
well and there's a lot of reason to
think that's fairly bad news for a
society as a whole so that's the second
chunk of the book the final chunk of the
book is a set of recommendations what
can we do to keep the bounty going while
mitigating the spread or dealing with it
so we dip our toe into policy world and
we offer some recommendations for
individuals then we have a chapter on
short-term policy recommendations and
more radical longer-term policy
recommendations the short-term stuff one
of the things that really surprised me
and Eric is as we were writing and
talking about these ideas is the number
of extremely smart people who evidently
have never taken a good econ 101 course
I know that sounds like an insult I
don't mean it that way but it's amazing
if you grab an econ 101 textbook and it
really doesn't matter if you grab one
written by a conservative economist or a
liberal economist you grab an econ 101
textbook you will learn the same things
about effective policies for economic
growth and in particular what what's the
role of the government promoting good
healthy economic growth there is just
not a lot of controversy about this
stuff have fantastic infrastructure
liberalize your immigration get your
educational system right create a good
environment for entrepreneurship invest
in basic research these are just this is
the no-brainers we're not doing a very
good job on all of those things right
now
so our short term chapter is just kind
of an econ 101 refresher longer-term if
and when this ridiculous technological
progress continues there are more
radical recommendations required I think
they might well be so we go a little bit
farther out into strange policy land and
talk about things like a basic income or
guaranteed income and or a negative
income tax there one of the other main
conclusions that Eric and Ike
is we really want people to work because
when when work goes away individuals
suffer and communities suffer to a
terrifying extent the data are just
shocking when you read them so one of
our strongest policy goals is we were
writing this book was to try to maintain
work for people a great very
straightforward way to do that is with
instead of a positive income tax where
for every dollar you make the government
takes you know let's say 30 percent have
a negative income tax for people at the
entry levels of the workforce where for
every dollar they make they actually
make a dollar 30 that's a very strong
incentive to continue work and to work
when we look at our current tax policies
one of the oldest insights of economics
is tax the stuff you want to see less of
and subsidize the stuff you want to see
more of we tax labor right now fairly
heavily and that's leading to exactly
some of the behaviors you'd expect so we
get into some tax recommendations and
get farther out into into policy land
that way but the final point that we
make in our concluding chapter is we are
heading into I think it's an overall
fantastic future it's a weird future in
a lot of ways we honestly have not been
here before we have choices to make Eric
and I are both what we call mindful
optimists we if we make these choices
correctly we're heading into a much much
better world but don't believe either
the utopians who say oh don't worry you
and your silly economic worries
technological progress will solve all
problems for everybody we do hear that
it's not correct and also don't believe
the fatalist who say there's nothing to
be done here this is some kind of
inevitable progression and we're heading
into this kind of society where there's
a pretty small lead up here and a bunch
of fairly miserable people way down here
don't believe that either the last line
in our book I'm gonna quote and then
we'll shut up and open it up for
discussion the last line in our book is
technology is not destiny we shape our
destiny let me stop there i we would
love to hear our favorite part of all of
these is honestly not listening to each
other by this point because we've done a
lot of that it's hearing what what you
all want to talk about what questions
are on your mind so with that can we
throw it open yep
business models another characteristic
that
it's inherited digital goods is that
their non-rival non-excludable and then
they make some public goods and the
weird thing that's going on right now is
confusion a lot of activity buying back
stock instead of investing in a cup of
goods and when I look at the actual
business up there you look at like tax
preparation because it's non-rival not
excludable the end up with three peoples
providing it and inevitably somebody
says I'm going to take the price to zero
and you have the situation where
producer surplus is basically
evaporating and without producer surplus
you can't generate return on invested
capital and so you're getting a second
is saying well I can't generate any
pricing power so I'm just going to buy
back shares and not invest in their
business and it's kind of frightening
because in a situation like IBM and
they're basically doing exactly that
I'd be more worried about the situation
you described if corporate profits were
not at an all-time high
and business investment in equipment and
software were not at an all-time high
normalize for buybacks I don't know if
that statement can someone explain what
non-rival no I mean yes chapter six of
our book it means if I drink this water
you can't drink it as well that's that's
a rival good this bottle of water is a
rival good if I listen to a song on
Spotify you can listen to the same song
on Spotify at the same time that's a non
rifle good good example that is I have a
friend to stop
and he makes video games and he used to
pay $3,500 a C for some analytic
software that allowed him to figure out
who was failing various levels and all
that K in three years has gone from 3500
to c-23 now people can do this it's easy
enough to do with a small number of dads
and the prices drop to zero and that's
good
tremendous consumer surplus but without
some producer surplus
people say what's the neat you know why
this won't work and singing a lot of
situations so what I eat you didn't lose
your third book software eats the world
and all the values provided there but
all I need is a couple of devs to jump
in to name the business and price drops
to zero you know so let's just take tax
preparation I think I think I think
we've got your point Thanks yeah yeah
yeah no I think that you make a good
point about the but I want to emphasize
the other part of it too which is the
growth in consumer surplus and when we
in addition to having a chapter we
discussed non-rival and non-excludable
goods and some of the properties of them
and I have to say I share in these
sentiments right there right now we're
doing all right with with profits and by
and large with investment so I'm not I
mean I can see that scenario in some
time in the future but I just don't see
it happening right now what we also do
see though is a tremendous explosion of
free goods which mostly are non rival
and non-excludable so Wikipedia and
YouTube n being and lots of other
services that people can access for
essentially zero cost and that is the
exact as you're pointing out that leads
to a huge increase in consumer surplus
there's a lot more value that consumers
get without having to pay for it and is
that a good thing
I think that's an absolutely a good
thing but ironically if you look at the
GDP statistics it's bad for GDP the
music industry and II was just talking
about us sharing music and getting
access to music the music industry has
shrunk according to the official numbers
but most of us are listening to more and
better music than ever before and this
leads to a real
problem with the GDP statistics that we
are measuring the right thing GDP
actually kind of goes the wrong way when
Wikipedia replaces Encyclopedia
Britannica
that actually paradoxically has a
negative effect on GDP even though it
has a positive effect on all of our
surplus and well-being by our
calculations there's something on the
order of three hundred billion dollars
per year of additional consumer surplus
from all these free digital goods and
that number is going to grow and grow so
in addition to the reinvention of some
of our organizational systems we have to
reinvent the way we measure the economy
because we're not capturing the full
bounty the bounty the official
productivity numbers are going up what
we have discovered doing this book is
that the real benefits are growing even
faster than the official numbers because
so much of it is not being measured we
can make this concrete would you raise
your hand please if you have and use a
GPS system that gives you turn by turn
directions when you drive around wait
put your hand way in the a way in there
keep your hand way in the year if you
had one of these five years ago all
right what's weird though is that the
GPS market is smaller than it was five
years ago because we get this stuff via
a free app on our phone as opposed to a
device that we paid $200 for so how many
of us want to go back to the world of
two hundred dollar devices right unless
you work for Garmin that answer is
nobody
but it's shrinking it's literally
shrinking GDP so one of the challenges
we confront is the fact that our
official economic statistics which guide
a lot of decision-making in a lot of
policy they're they're tracking the
actual economy less closely than they
used to and less closely year by year
right and the official productivity
numbers are driven right off the sheet
number so they're equally skewed let's
take another question how about over
here
yeah Priestley released a study
comparing Facebook
they said that basically between 2015
and 2017
they're expecting Facebook to lose about
80% of its user base I'm already seeing
it dwindled and stuff like that do you
think that that's more of a byproduct of
the rapid evolution of technology and
that people are able to migrate to other
locations or other you know yeah this is
a characteristic this is common it's
what Sherpa dar called creative
destruction in any eye and I talked
about that a bit in this book as well
that digital goods in addition to having
those winner-take-all properties that we
described they're often it also means
that someone else can come along and
displace it and just because you have a
dominant position at one point doesn't
mean you're going to continue to have
the dominant position that could be due
to fads or you know or could be due to
better technology and so you get this
constant evolution just like a Microsoft
Excel replaced Lotus 1-2-3 at one point
and so you can get this shifting in
technology platforms much more rapidly
than you did with in the pre-digital era
question you touch on it maybe it's in
your book if so let me know I was
listening to a similar talk last October
and they were talking about how this
acceleration well in the past when
technology came around and the jobs were
lost at the bottom and everything just
search it's up yeah right but in this
revolution instead we're seeing right in
the middle or even in the top half or
top third on an entire profession go
away yes we talked about that parents
the tax loss example is a perfect
example of that that is a classic
actually kind of upper middle-class
American job you need a college
education to do that that's a great
middle class occupation it is going away
because of this digital revolution and
colleagues of ours have done fantastic
work to highlight this this hollowing
out of the polarization of the economy
are our geek explanation for that is we
can automate a busboy yet we can't
automate a gardener
we can't automate a home health aide
these are all fairly low-level
professions we also can't automate a
data scientist or a CEO those are the
high-level the stuff we can automate as
squarely
in the middle and it's creeping in both
directions fundamental ones you
mentioned it our early medical diagnosis
doctors right which is considered a high
level position today right yes so the
policy challenge really is how what do
you train people to do how do you line
them up to be ready in five years you
know you got a teenage son or daughter
or what do you tell them to study hey so
we used to know right you just look at
the strata so well that's exactly that
that's a good point yes we do touch on
it and we spend a whole chapter talking
about this it's still true that the
routine information processing tasks
have been the hardest hit and if you
look statistically those are the ones
where computers have made the biggest
inroads but they're beginning to creep
into these other areas that said tasks
that involve creativity also toss that
involved interpersonal relations into
touching into interacting with other
people and understanding their feelings
those are also things that machines
aren't particularly good at and so those
are two areas where humans have a an
advantage these days but as you suggest
with your question the pace of change is
quickening and having you can't expect
to have a 40-year run with one
particular profession or one particular
task so in addition to learning those
skills you also need to learn to adjust
and to constantly update and change your
skills I'm not just to put this a little
bit of context it's important to
understand that computers have always
been destroying our not not computers
technology has always been destroying
jobs and it's always been creating jobs
but the pace which is happening is
happening a lot more quickly so our need
to adjust and adapt to that is happening
a lot there's a lot faster as well it's
a really really tough question to answer
because the answer that we would have
given with confidence 10 years ago is
basically hone your pattern recognition
skills that's a joke now right computers
are much better than us at most flavors
of pattern recognition that said Eric
and I in all of our work never came
across a creative computer an innovative
one in entrepreneurial one so this idea
of ideation of coming
something new still seems to be uniquely
human territory we've never seen a
computer that could motivate a team to
go do something that was a really good
negotiator so those kind of deep
interpersonal skills are really really
valuable but I think most fundamentally
if you've got kids teach them to love to
learn because they're gonna have to
learn and shift multiple times in this
world that we're heading into another
question
bit of a naive question but when you
think of the jobs that were lost on the
tax preparing people when they're more
jobs created for people who write the
code for the tax preparation software
and thanks to our IRS to change the
rules so there's always gonna be people
needed for that so I you know it's like
energy right just change what a model
it's not that rate of destruction of the
dog the rate of creation of jobs
there's a massive disparity have you
done any analysis that says that the
percentage in the first machine age and
the percentage now right you know what
is that your question is actually not a
naive question it's a really really deep
really good question for 200 years
people allegedly smart people have been
saying technological unemployment is
right around the corner have you heard
of a group called the Luddites 20 years
ago these were British fairly high
skilled workers in the textile factories
who started smashing the automated looms
because they were afraid of unemployment
all of these people predicting
technological unemployment have
basically been wrong for 200 years we've
had huge amounts of technological
progress and we've had very close to
full employment in in the rich world
that's because exactly like Eric said
earlier it's easy to emphasize the
destruction and a lot harder to
emphasize the creation that takes place
the creation keeps pleasantly surprising
us the question that we go back and
forth on all the time and we don't have
the final answer on it at all is is this
time finally different my gut tells me
that it is we got to stay tuned
and specifically the data say that for
the past 10-15 years it has been
different we have had a divergence in
job creation from what it was
historically even before the Great
Recession and it's been especially sharp
in specifically routine information
processing tasks we can look at
particular categories like tax
preparation software and there are a lot
fewer people doing that than there used
to be even accounting for the relative
handful that are involved in the
software companies that are producing
that that but if but colleagues of ours
at MIT and elsewhere have looked at the
skill content of all the occupations the
United States and what kinds of skills
were required in them and you can rank
all the occupations by how much routine
information processing is required in
the like tax preparation bookkeepers
clerks travel agents the more routine
information processing in the tap in the
job the more that there's been a decline
in the total demand the total number of
jobs and the wages in those categories
so that's pretty strong evidence that
they're being hit quite hard ten people
shift into other categories absolutely
they can and they should how long does
that take five years could take ten
years and of course by then the
technology has shifted again as we've
just heard from Andy there's a whole new
set of technologies in the pipeline that
are affecting other parts of the
spectrum so there's going to be this
constant race this constant catch-up and
it becomes more and more difficult to
keep up with the technology unless you
accelerate your Ries killing and the
reinvention of work
that seems like that's a huge growth
area it is it is a growth air and
absolutely there's areas that are
growing
there's area there areas that are
shrinking net-net
there's been more destruction than
creation in the past 10 to 15 years what
we've been through to your point we've
been through long transitions before
where there was sustained on a pretty
high unemployment and we reached a new
equilibrium of pretty close to full
unemployment again the historical
pattern should calm you down I just
don't know how much history is repeating
itself this time when cars drive
themselves and my phone talks back to me
and computers are the best
diagnosticians in the world the
shrinking set of stuff that we need
people for winds me up a little bit I
think is a question in the back how
about all the way back there well I
think that's a great question so let me
break those five million people into
into two broad groups let's look at
other developed countries and then let's
look at more developing countries so
other developed countries there's the
organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development that gathers data from those
relatively wealthy countries Japan
Western Europe if you look at them you
see remarkably similar trends in all of
them on some of these key metrics for
instance inequality has grown in 18 of
the 22 countries that our survey is
grown in Sweden in Germany and Japan the
two it stayed about level and to which
it actually reduced a bit and that was
Greece and one other one and I don't
know how representative they are of of
economies that are on the right track
these days so it seems to be a wild
worldwide trend it's not they started at
different levels of inequality but
they're all have a directionally similar
impact and that suggests to us that
there's a underlying force that's
affecting all of these countries it's
not just politics or particular
institutions or culture in one country
or another it's something more pervasive
and worldwide and fundamental let's look
at the developing countries well we've
looked at what's happening some of the
employment trends there so take China
out we've spent some time visiting there
many people talk about globalization and
the move of jobs from the United States
say to China and certainly globalization
and technology are probably the two big
forces right now but if you look more
closely as what's happening in
manufacturing for instance what you see
is what you think is happening actually
due to the amount of manufacturing jobs
in China is that industry grows
massively over there it turns out that
the number of manufacturing jobs in
China is dropping rapidly there's 20
million fewer manufacturing jobs today
in China than there were in the late
1990s there are fewer manufacturing jobs
the United States as well so it's not so
much like that the jobs are going from
the United States over to China is that
are going from both the United States
and China to robots people like Terry
guy who runs Foxconn is talking about
putting in place 1 million robots to
replace half of his workforce assembling
iPhones and other phones over there in
China so our view is that yes
globalization is an another important
force in these other countries are being
affected but ultimately offshoring is
just a way station on the road to
automation and in many ways those
low-wage workers who are doing
relatively routine tasks are even more
in the bullseye of some of these
powerful technological forces than the
relatively smaller number of workers who
are still doing some of those tasks in
the United States and other developing
countries the research is really adding
up and it's becoming clear that both of
these economic phenomenon that we talked
about the bounty is not just the u.s.
phenomenon its global as well that's the
good news but spread is going up in
almost every country around the world as
well so the examples we've given so far
kind of us rich world examples the
phenomena are pretty clearly global
examples but of course I mean overall
overall income and I want to stress the
bounty part too I mean let's not lose
sight of that the overall wealth in not
just United States but worldwide has
gone up tremendously how about up at the
far corner over here
the similar correlation similar
correlation with what sorry didn't hit
the first brother in food production
well okay yeah it's like a Greek ulch is
a really interesting example because
that was really the big industry that
was being affected in the first Machine
Age right at one point ninety percent of
Americans worked in agriculture
worldwide for that matter today it's
less than two percent now all those
people didn't become unemployed they got
reemployed into new industries over a
course of a couple of hundred years
that's what happened so part of the
reason they became reemployed was
because they learned new skills we
talked about that some people have said
that the best idea that America ever had
was mass compulsory education and that
helped provide a set of skills for a
workforce that previously had been
involved in agriculture and then became
involved in industry and services
there's also a big role for
entrepreneurs who invented those new
industries that those people were
involved in it wasn't MIT professors it
wasn't government policymakers it was
people like Henry Ford and Bill Gates
and others who helped come up with
entirely new industries that people
couldn't have even conceived of at that
time and they had need for a lot of
workers in those industries and they
redeployed those so that combination of
some enlightened government policy that
helped Ries kill people and some real
powerful entrepreneurship that helped
invent some of those new industries
ultimately redeployed tens of millions
of people from agriculture into other
sectors we think that's a bit of a model
and hopeful for what can happen going
forward now of course it's not so simple
you can simply mimic what was done
before and say ok we're going to have
compulsory I don't know college
education it's not nearly as simple as
that we have to reinvent education more
fundamentally to the kinds of creativity
and
to personal skills and whole other set
of things that we need to to learn and
we need to do we need to invent a new
set of industries and we're parently
we're not doing fast enough that's what
the data suggests in fact the amount of
job creation from new startups in the
past decade has been smaller than it was
in the 90s or 80s you may hear some buzz
about lots of entrepreneurship but it's
not actually happening as fast as it
used to so we need to make progress on
both of those but I think the example of
agriculture and food production is is
one that we can learn a lot from I
appreciate you I think you're exactly
right but isn't it possible to take that
back set look at it differently I've
done those jobs frankly I hope nobody
ever has to do that because a lot not
keep a bunch of that so it really sucks
yeah but there's a breakthrough that you
haven't talked about which is the smart
guys over at MIT would figure out how to
do magnetic confinement for fusion
we could have pointy not the fancy term
for the for the shareable giving city
literally have unlimited power and then
unemployment doesn't really mean
because there's enough of those physical
goods for everybody you could call it
the star trek why do you think that we
won't hit the star trek acknowledging
the changes meant before pressing what
why don't we hit that tomorrow and
someone says hey look at the picture I
see water producers everybody right
we're already getting close to that
closer and closer to that star trek
model in a lot of ways most of us and
more of us all the time are being freed
up for material want from deprivation to
me that's heading toward that Star Trek
universe where you push the button and
your meal comes out or whatever we're
getting there that's honestly that's not
enough for a healthy society we came
across a fantastic quote from Voltaire
of all people when we were writing the
book he said work saves a man from three
great evils boredom vice and need of
those three the need is the easiest one
to take care of my question is in this
sci-fi future that you're articulating
what what does a meaningful life look
like what does a good life look like
what is a fulfilling life what does a
healthy community look like we have come
nowhere near to solving that problem
when you look at communities now where
where work has gone away in America
anyway you don't see starvation you
don't see malnourished children you
don't see these terrible material wants
you see children growing up outside of
two-parent homes you see divorce rates
skyrocket and you see crime skyrocketing
you see people not voting anymore
participating in civic life you see this
really ugly breakdown in their community
and that that's the problem that I find
myself I think we find ourselves a lot
more worried about than the you know how
are we going to provide for the material
needs of the people sometimes we have
it's come early a little more optimistic
when we talk a little bit far out into
the future and I think that that's a set
of concerns that we have more short-run
but I think that that Star Trek future
of the far far future is is potentially
one that could be very very appealing
one of a great deal of abundance I think
there's a realistic possibility that
within say the next 20 years we will for
the first time in history eliminate
severe poverty on the planet that's the
trend that
on and it's not I don't think it's gonna
happen tomorrow or the next year because
it these things do take time and even if
we had fusion reactors that wouldn't be
sufficient because energy is only one
input there's a lot of other inputs that
we need to deal with but we're on the
path towards having a lot more abundance
than we used to have it's going to be a
very rocky transition for several
decades and I'm not quite sure what that
Star Trek future will look like and how
people will get a sense of fulfillment
and meaning in their lives it's
something we talked a little bit about
in the book tour towards the later part
of the book but much of the book is
focused on say the next decade and the
decade after that where we see a great
deal of disruption and because because
unfortunately when most of us aren't
gonna have replicators in our homes
anytime in the next next few years
although my friend Neil Gershenfeld our
friend Neil Gershenfeld a media lab when
I went around at a dinner with him about
five days ago that's how he introduced
himself he said he was working on a Star
Trek replicator so good luck to him so
to have an effective Union the most
empower 'fl most important thing you
have to have is some bargaining power
and bargaining kottpower comes from
having something that the other party
needs and and that they can't do without
and what's happening increasingly is
that technology is weakening the
bargaining power of the working man to
use that that terminology as is
globalization as is globalization and
that is one of the main reasons I think
that unions are having a lot less power
than they used to I think if you just
sort of tinker with the union laws and
all that that's sort of like rearranging
the deckchairs is not really dealing
with the more fundamental transformative
issues that are happening in the economy
right now which in our view had to do
with in part globalization but
especially the underlying technological
trends
you spent a lot of time where we've
talked a lot about displacement job is
believed sort of one for one car
industry workers going away because took
on me you do you look at any of the
collateral effect you know safer cars
and the effect on insurance agents cuz
you need less adjusters and and that
industry falls apart because of those
pesticides it's it's a super complicated
situation but I want to pick up on one
aspect of what you said when we talk
about bounty and and the reason Eric and
I keep talking about the bounty a part
of the economic implications is it's
it's too easy to overlook and it's too
easy to get gloomy about some of the
really tough statistics we see about
jobs and wages in the middle class and
it's important to spend time on those
but also important side of the good news
part of this as well you mentioned safer
cars you know that we have fewer
accidents in America than we have at any
time since the k-member that's the 60s
or the 70s not per mile driven overall
total in America road fatalities are
dropping every year even though there
are a lot more of us and a lot more cars
and we're driving faster that's a safety
story it's a technology story it's a
quality story it's all about this this
bounty that that the world is is that
our world is creating for us we think
it's really important not to lose sight
of that good news and much of that is
unmeasured in official statistics I mean
one little amazing fact that that we
that's in the book you'll you'll see is
that if you measure the value of the
increased safety and quality of life
years in the longevity that we've had
over the past 50 years that any
reasonable economic estimate of that
value is greater than the value of all
the other innovations put together so
and that doesn't show up in the GDP
statistics that improved quality of life
so that's just G he can't count someone
who doesn't die in a car accident you
know their bet even though they were
Hitler yeah so those those effects are
are real and they're enormous and they
reflect the fact that we aren't
measuring our our economy properly how
about over here we're just gonna follow
that you know that's Star Trek yeah you
know i canta me do you think that our
sense of challenge is waiting so in
jeopardy i mean
watson kicking rotten can be anyone in
the world you know and other things you
know with machine learning our machines
can become innovative today you know
perform you egg races across sets of
data and come up with you know an
experiment to manufacture something put
it out there so you consumes it if it
doesn't then try something else
i mean that's a philosophical but that's
not what I see at all I mean maybe I'm
hanging around with a non representing
group people I hang around with the
folks here at Microsoft and Silicon
Valley at MIT and I've never seen people
as excited and as creative as ever
before in fact I would make the argument
as physical deprivation gets taken care
of for a bigger bigger chunk of the
planet and as more and more of them get
connected to the global Internet we're
gonna have a lot more people being part
of that creative community not every not
only can billions of brains
human brains now tap into the world's
knowledge and it's something that was
never possible before but perhaps more
importantly billions of people can
contribute to the world's knowledge in
that way and we have a whole chapter on
something we call combinatorial
innovation which is the idea that most
innovations don't just spring out of
nowhere they come from combining and
recombining pre-existing ideas and the
more people you have contributing to
that stock of ideas it doesn't use up
innovations for other people instead it
creates building blocks for other people
to add to and I think that as we get
more innovation including some of the
ones you mentioned it only provides more
fodder for the next generation of in
some cases teenagers to build on the
shoulders of giants in a way that they
couldn't have before keep in mind we
still play jeopardy it's still a very
popular quiz show every night even
though a computer is better there's
still a lot of chess players in the
world none of them can be anywhere near
the best computer anymore so I don't
think that digital progress necessarily
you know stomps on our human aspirations
and makes us go slink away luckily
that's not what happens it's going to be
the Olympics right in a little while and
people are gonna be racing the hundred
meters I mean yeah you four more years
will have a skewed skip fading speed
skating robot that's faster than any
human will still have speed skating it
for eight you know sometime soon how
about read French it would be a cool
robot on it just this song for people
who get this space when their jobs are
given for example you gave my past
apparel at office you'll get this place
by software
hey that's happening over the years of
training to get to where they are and
this is kind of becoming very real entry
and that's how they get so pay so much
right when they were doing it so it also
really really request reason they did
that expensive cpa is to go get a job as
a tax preparer and have a good long
career right so I got somebody taken
away by the software then they are not
prepared to switch him to either high
paying career that right away so so
that's why we have the high end
appointment because they are not going
to go for a bit something it's going to
take an adoption so that so how do you
recommend to like make this transition
sure so as people find that the
investment they made in comments call
human capital and these skills becomes
more rapidly obsolete because of
technology and these other forces
what should we recommend that we do well
how can we respond to that and I think
that the answer that that you know to
build on what we said earlier you have
to we're gonna have to we're in a world
where you have to adjust much much more
rapidly and that's true at the
individual level we're all gonna have to
work harder run harder to keep up and
learn new skills maybe digital
technologies can help us learn those
skills faster than we did before
as a society we're gonna have to smooth
that transition more easily
entrepreneurs are gonna have to be more
creative about finding new ways of
redeploying people using those skills I
think that they haven't been doing it
fast enough we love entrepreneurs not
because we think everyone wants to
become unemployed is then begin to
become an entrepreneur it's not like
that's the job that they end up in but
it's because in our society
entrepreneurs are the people who are in
charge of coming up with the new
industries and the new jobs they're
they're charged with the creative task
of figuring out what that that person
who you just described might be able to
do next along with the person himself so
it's really a joint
between government society the
individual the entrepreneurs to work on
that it has to happen faster than it did
in in the in the past new people say we
have lots of entrepreneur's we need more
we need we people say we're investing in
education rescaling we need to do that
faster so all those things are going to
have to accelerate so you ask a really
good question I find it an extremely
tough question what do you say to a CPA
who just doesn't have a job anymore I
find that an almost impossible
conversation to have you know pick
yourself up learn some new skills that's
how capitalism works the Yaak that's a
terribly terrible thing to say to
somebody so instead I try to concentrate
the conversation elsewhere and say to
policy makers and people involved in the
educational system look you have got to
create a very fertile environment not an
environment that makes sure that that
person can never be laid off that's a
terrible idea right we can't freeze the
economy but we need to create an
environment where when that person loses
a job that that there's a good
environment for them to move into there
are jobs available there's actually an
educational system that will give them
skills because when we talk to business
leaders we hear over and over what you
just said which is I can't find the
skills that I need I've got I've got
hiring once I can't find them from the
entry-level up to the very top our
educational system is not doing a great
job in this very tough time so I want to
try to shift your question because it's
such a difficult one instead of talking
directly to that laid off person let's
talk to the other institutions around
and say what can you do to help or in
addition I think it's it's a kind of
everyone's gonna have to take some
responsibility I'm looking at the clock
here and I think we want to leave some
time for for signing books so why we
just take one last question and then we
can talk some in some one-on-one
conversations going to take host
prerogative and ask the last question
only oh that's a really good one though
as an offline question there's been oh
cool blowing up here we didn't realize
that pick one question hit us with it so
let's talk about licensing and
regulation a little bit a lot of us
stupid question time how many of us are
familiar with uber how many of us have
uber on our yeah okay um
uber is a great example there because
they are finding themselves fighting all
kinds of regulators and when I look at
that fight it seems to me that what
we're seeing is it is incumbents an
entrenched interest trying very very
hard to protect themselves and make sure
nothing changes but my favorite example
of that is you know in France now uber
has to bake in a 15-minute delay before
it can send a car to you because the
taxi drivers in France in Paris were so
upset about that that's the wrong kind
of regulation an extremely stupid kind
of regulation you guys know who Tim
O'Reilly is just one of the Guru's of
the tech industry he's a buddy of ours
and he's got a beautiful way to phrase
that he says look with our regulations
and our policy decisions and our
licensing and all these other
requirements that we have you have a
choice you can protect the past from the
future that's the choice that France is
making with its taxi drivers or you can
protect the future from the past that's
the choice we really should be making
because the future that we're heading
into is a better place than the one that
we've got today
