and speak thanks
I don't know why you're cheering me but
thank you I did you told me while you're
chatting away so just be quiet until
until this afternoon after all the talks
are over so this morning you heard from
Peter and on and on about what it takes
do research who are the kinds of people
who are researchers I'm gonna you heard
a little bit from Han about what do
researchers work on what kinds of
problems do they work on what I want to
talk about is not just research in the
general but research in computer science
and I want to talk about also some
stories about what kinds of research
computer science just work on but I also
want to talk about the impact of the
research that they do and why that might
choose a particular problem to work on
or what motivates them in the first
place so I'm going to talk about
computer science research I'm going to
talk about computer science research is
impact on science technology and society
I'd like to first start with this triad
of science technology in society and
talk about the drivers of computing I
use this term drivers of computing to
indicate if I'm a researcher in computer
science and I'm trying to figure out
what problem to work on I might look at
fundamental questions of computer
science science questions of computer
science for instance what is computable
what can the Machine compute what can a
machine not compute what problems can
machine solve what problems can machines
not solve so there might be there are
deep science questions in our field in
computer science that drive researchers
to pursue their research goals to pursue
the problems they work on people like
Ravi Khanna and you heard about earlier
tomorrow today another area of that
drives
the kind of research problems computer
science to choose is of course
technology technology advances
expeditiously and exponentially I mean
every time there's a new technology it
Ria's the old questions of the past in
computer science we often ask the same
questions but answer them in different
ways because of new technology and
finally something that's much more
prevalent today then when I started as a
computer scientist its societal Grand
Challenges people today people like
yourselves people like Bill T's who
you'll hear from later to this afternoon
you um try to address larger Grand
Challenges of society like healthcare
and energy in the environment and those
societal Grand Challenges Drive the kind
of questions that computer scientists
ask thinking maybe in advances of
computer science or maybe in advances in
computing technology we can help address
the societal Grand Challenges we can
help potentially transform the very
nature of healthcare and so these are
the kinds of drivers of computing these
are the the the ways in which a computer
science researcher might think of what
problem to work on and once you choose a
problem and you're persistent and you're
you discover and you create and so on
just as was discussed this morning what
you hope in the end is to have an impact
on the on either science or technology
or society of all three of them through
the results that you attain in
conducting research so of course if you
are a theoretical computer scientist you
pursue it as a reticle problem for the
sake of just pursuing the problem but
you never know that the solution to that
problem might have you know in 10 or 20
years an impact on a new technology or
an impact in a way that some other
sector like healthcare can be affected
so I'm going to talk about research
impact along the lines of science
technology and society and I'm going to
use this triad to tell my stories but
what I really want to close my talk with
is not so much what we've done and some
of the stories showing what kind of
research Microsoft researchers have done
but I want to use this triad to talk
about what's coming what you in the
audience will be working on as
researchers in computer science so I
want to talk about the future of
computing along these three axes so
before I begin I do want to share with
you the mission of Microsoft Research
this is something Anna dhaan alluded to
earlier this morning this is the mission
statement that all of us at Microsoft
Research ascribe to and the first one
you'll notice is really very basic it's
advanced the field and the areas we
choose to do research it's an advanced
extent of the art well should I start
again it's advancing to the state of the
art the second mission is to transfer
best our best research into Microsoft's
products and the third is to ensure the
future of Microsoft and of the computing
and related disciplines and I'm not
going to belabor the the mission
statement of Microsoft Research too much
I just wanted to share with you them
especially since on Adam showed how they
were specified or tailored for Microsoft
Research India
this is Microsoft's research global
presence you'll see that we have labs
around the world
and this is my triad with the mission
statement overlaid you let every
researcher in Microsoft Research is
either advancing science or advancing
technology or addressing a societal
grand challenge or all three so now let
me actually start with a few stories and
I'm going to tell a science story a
technology story a societal society
story and then one last story that wraps
it up and then I'm going to talk about
where I see the trends of computer
science being the these are going to be
the opportunities for all of you as
future researchers in computer science
to be thinking about where your research
problem is going to come from so the
science story I want to start with is a
story that comes from some work at done
by Microsoft researcher Nickell
Srivastava and two colleagues at Yale
University and it's a story of computer
science meets quantum mechanics the
problem that they were addressing is is
it possible to take a set of small
vectors who in whose energy in every
test direction is equal to one and
partition this set of small vectors in a
red into a red blue partition in such a
way that the energy comes half the
energy comes from the red vectors and
half the energy comes from the blue so
it's called splitting a quadratic form
in half and before I actually state the
theorem of what they prove I want to
give you a little background of what I
just said in terms of test vectors and
energy and so on so consider these four
vectors in two-dimensional space and in
the test vector Direction test direction
along the x-axis we can then compute the
energy of these four vectors
by just calculating how much energy each
individual vector contributes along the
the test direction so this set of four
vectors has some energy of energy can
compute 21.5 and I can consider a
different test direction along the y
axis and you'll see the energy is
greater intuitively because three of the
vectors are pointing upwards more
towards the y axis and you can do this
at every test direction to compute the
energy of these four vectors in every
test direction and what you can do then
is basically draw an ellipsoid around
the test vectors this ellipsoid in each
test Direction basically tells you what
the direction of what the energy is in
that direction so this is just a an
algebraic structure it's called a
quadratic form and what's it's so the
ellipsoid is the quadratic form so now I
can state the theorem that was proved
and that is given a set of sufficiently
small vectors whose energies in each
test Direction is equal to 1 I is it I
can I can always find a partition of
this set of small vectors into two parts
the red and the blue such that each part
basically contributes 1/2 energy half of
its energy to the original set of
vectors so this would seems like not
such a difficult theorem to prove but in
fact it is profound because many many
different disciplines find that
quadratic forms show up naturally in the
problems that they are trying to solve
and also it turns out that this theorem
implies an outstanding conjecture since
1959 that was stated in quantum
mechanics and so clearly was not an easy
theorem to prove and this theorem was
proved last June it was truly a
breakthrough result in mathematics so
the I mentioned already that their other
quadratic their quadratic forms that are
found in other disciplines for instance
in computer science and it was actually
an understanding this particular
computer science problem that the
computer scientist Nikhil and his
colleagues were struggling with and
stumbled upon the generalization which
led to the theorem that they stated
improved this is a very typical computer
science problem where you're given a
graph and you try to partition the graph
in this case into two pieces in such a
way that the the sub graphs have have
the same properties that you care about
of the original graph in this particular
case we have a two sub graphs each are
have the same number of nodes but fewer
edges and the property that we want to
preserve of the original graph is a cut
properties so each the cuts of each of
the sub graphs are approximately the
same as the cut of the original graph
and the reason you want to do this is
because it's easier that means more
efficient to run algorithms over the sub
graph and it's usually you have you need
less storage for the sub graph and so
you want to be able to do this kind of
partitioning this kind of decomposition
of a big problem into smaller smaller
solvable problems is calm
Oh in computer science you see this over
and over again whether it's in a data
structure like a graph or a program or a
large system and so it's very a very
common technique in computer science to
decompose a large problem into smaller
problems to solve the smaller problems
knowing that you either can solve the
smaller problems to imply that the
solution at a larger problem or put
together the solutions of the smaller
problem of problems and then get the
answer for the larger problem so this is
a very common technique of decomposing a
large problem into smaller ones
quadratic forms are also found in
understanding signal processing if you
substitute the coefficients from
discrete Fourier transforms the you
basically get vectors as in the
quadratic form case and this hints at
the uncertainty principle that's found
in signal processing which basically
says you can't localize a signal in both
the time and frequency domains but as I
mentioned this theorem implies the
Caterson
singer conjecture which was outstanding
since 1959 and what was interesting
about this part of the story is that the
physicists and the mathematicians who
have been trying to prove this
conjecture thought that it was false and
so for since 1959 many many decades of
researchers physicists mathematicians
were actually trying to prove this
theorem was false or the conjecture was
false and it's no wonder they they
struggled because in fact it's true so
that's my science story I want to move
to a technology story and this is the
problem of video stabilization
so here we have a video that you can see
is pretty shaky these kinds of videos
you often take with your smartphone that
has maybe a video camera on it what we
are able to do in our research is to
stabilize that kind of video and see a
much smoother version of what we just
shot so I'm going to tell you two tricks
that we used in order to effect this
first let me start with the standard
video stabilization pipelined you start
with a video that has many frames and
what you first tried to do is compute a
camera path from frame to frame and so
that's what's done in this first step
the second step is actually to smooth
out that camera path because obviously
if you're going from one frame to the
other it could it could be quite jerky
from one frame that for the next so
you're smoothing out the camera path and
then once you do that then you can
basically warp each image to be some to
adapt to the smooth path and that gives
you the final video and that's what
video stabilization is all about well in
this research there are two ideas that
enabled us to do much smoother video
stabilization the first is the idea of
using multiple camera paths instead of a
single camera path the idea here is to
take each frame and cut it up into a 2d
grid and then you treat 2d grid mesh and
then you treat each mesh as a little
video and so then you compute a camera
path for each mesh in that 2d grid and
so that's what happens here so now we
have multiple camera paths that we can
play with the second idea is called
adaptive filtering and
the standard approach isotropic
filtering is used to smooth out the
camera path what this means however is
that it's not very good at handling
large parts of it's not very good at
handling rapid motion in the camera so
if you're if you have your phone and
you're taking a video of some exciting
movement then you might it'll be very
jerky and what happens then is from
frame to frame in order to accommodate
for that you'll have a lot of empty
spaces and then if you want to make it
look pretty
you basically crop out the empty spaces
but the end result in your video is
pretty ugly so what we can do is use an
isotropic filtering and that smooths out
the the disruptive motion that you get
when you're doing rapid camera motion so
you can see that this is slightly but
this is better so what do these two new
ideas put together give us in terms of
video stabilization well first we can
handle parallax better and that's
because if you take a frame in a scene
where they're different depths you can
accommodate for those different depths
because we're actually using adaptive
filtering of multiple camera paths we
also get less geometry distortion so
here you'll see on the lower left
picture the the not-so-good video you'll
see global shearing and global skewing
and lots of local distortion if you look
at where the red arrows are pointing and
the lower right is what we get with our
technique we also get less cropping so
here you'll see again the lower left is
the the old way and the lower right is
what you get with
our technique less empty areas and thus
less cropping and thus a better looking
video in many cameras that you see on
cell phones the UCM CMOS technology
which means that they generate images by
drawing line after line after line and
that means again with rapid camera
motion you get some really jerky videos
with our technique we can smooth out the
the jerkiness and get a much more stable
looking video so I'm just going to show
some more results these are input videos
and these are what they look smooth we
can also handle people and here is what
it looks smooth out good
so my society story actually is comes
from Microsoft Research India in from
the group called technology of for
emerging markets it's a group in the
research lab that really looks at how to
use technology to help society before I
show the video of this I want to just
explain a little bit about the
technology that's used it's the the
intent of this project was to actually
help TB patients throughout India comply
with the treatment that they the doctors
want them to take in order to get rid of
TB because I if you don't comply with
the treatment then you don't get rid of
TB and then you still are someone who
could spread TB and so the technology is
basically a biometrics terminal and the
idea is that someone who's a patient
goes to a clinic where there's such a
terminal set up and you use your finger
on this biometric reader to show that
you are who you are and
then you are given the medication and
you you are taking the medication in
front of a health care so that the
health care worker can show that you're
complying with that particular treatment
and of course there's a database stored
somewhere that keeps track of the fact
that you've taken this treatment over
the course of months and so if at any
time you miss a treatment then someone
can be alerted to make sure that you
come back and and and so on so I'm just
going to play the video that's make it
better and a bit back we meet after work
you say here for a few Majed
countries with great migration or
transit of populations you will find a
greater proportion of tuberculosis
happening so also in border regions of
the United States wherever people shall
go and wherever they call they're gonna
give it to other people often nine to
ten million people that contract
tuberculosis annually every year around
the globe it's about 2 million happened
many of these are quarter million or so
50 million people in the world are not
affected by the bacteria causing
multidrug-resistant tonight unbelievable
but true for somebody who is for
Douglass's in tuberculosis definitely
becomes a death sentence and this
represents the threat of really a
pandemic because drug-resistant TB is
also contagious and so if this strain of
TB actually spreads it represents a
threat to everyone
a little subsidiary between
maybe Scandinavia children
nACCHO is running a fantastic program
for health workers deliver medication
sedation for the tragedy and the threats
in India is that that delivery breaks
down so the goal of this project is to
make sure that doses of met
are delivered on the right schedule to
tuberculosis patients throughout their
entire six-month course of people
ah
basically basically say you are after
konohana
this could be a real disaster in public
health so it's everyone's business to
understand and combat tuberculosis
okay one last story and this actually
picks up on the curtis's talk so I can
breeze through this quickly but it's
going to make a the real point about how
impact that we do in computer science
can be on basic science including
astronomy technology and society so we
start with what people have already been
talking about today both Han about data
big data and Curtis in terms of big data
transforming astronomy we start with of
course astronomical astronomy data from
that we have the world wide telescope
that allows us to have these kinds of
worldwide or Universal tours through
using the image data that we collect
from ground telescopes to scout the
telescopes in the sky so you can see
here we're taking a tour through the
universe we're going to hit the Milky
Way and from the Milky Way um well let's
get to the Milky Way I'll cut this I'll
cut this short because you've already
seen a lot of curtis's videos
that one but the point of this tour is
that you can be quite deliberate and
where you want to go in your tour
starting from outside the Milky Way to
the Milky Way into your own solar system
into visiting one of our planets the
Saturn continuing on till we enchi Li
get to Planet Earth
okay so as you saw her from curtis's
talk the ideas the technology behind
giving you a tour through the worldwide
telescope is the exact same technology
that can give you a tour through any big
set of data including data about the
earth and so that's what is now in Excel
as a feature it's called power map and
so now basically if you have any
spreadsheet of data you can actually
visualize this data and take a tour
through it so let's just look at one
example this is female literacy in the
states of India and I'm just going to
depict what it's like to to go through
the the states of India and see what the
literacy is
and you'll see that in each of the five
largest states the female literacy is
above average compared to literacy of
men and women put together except her
one of the states now why am i showing
you this
the reason I'm showing you this is that
people talk about big data but it's not
just having big data it's extracting
knowledge from that data for instance as
depicted through these visualizations
but then it's about making intelligent
decisions from that knowledge so it's
not really enough to just show you the
state about female literacy in the five
populous states of India you can imagine
a policymaker or decision maker saying
well why is the female literacy in this
particular state less than the average
or what about the other states or
basically making some kind of government
policy about education for men and women
in India so another example of that is
traffic accidents in Seattle and here's
just a fly through
the reason I'm showing you this is maybe
the amount of data used to calculate the
female literacy in the five states of
India's isn't very large and that's not
very impressive but the amount of data
in terms of traffic accidents in Seattle
is much greater and so you can actually
use vigil as a visualization to better
see the differences of which
intersections for instance could better
use a stop light or a stop sign and so
well that's again the point is from data
to knowledge to decision and you can
imagine the police force of Seattle or
the traffic or Department of Seattle
looking at this data and saying you know
those two spikes we saw well maybe we
should actually put a stop sign or a
stop light in those highly traffic
accident or prone accident-prone
intersections so obviously one of the
reasons I wanted to tell you this story
is that from astronomy to excel to
policymaking it really speaks to how
research might start out as blue sky
research as Peter talked about blue sky
research in astronomy and science
leading to a new feature in our own
technology at Microsoft in Excel but in
the end it's not so much just about
advancing science or just about a new
feature in in our technology it's really
about helping society it's about for
instance decision making a policymaking
based on in this particular case the
visualization of big data okay in the
remaining time I have as I promised I
really wanted to talk about the future I
wanted to talk about the future because
you are our future you are going to be
the future researchers in computer
science who are going to be choosing
problems solving problems advancing
science
creating new technology and helping the
world and so very briefly I'm going to
I'm going to talk about some the deep
science questions that continue to drive
our field not dwell on these too much
but talk about technology trends that
help drive the kinds of research
questions computer scientists ask and
then some of the societal grand
challenges that many computer scientists
today are addressing so I really talked
about what is computable this is
probably the most fundamental question
in computer science this is our question
our science question
unlike in astronomy where the question
is something like you know what is the
origin of the universe or in biology
what is the origin of life
what is computable is fundamental to
computer science
it's harks back to peters example of the
factorial function that that
mathematical function the second
question I wanted to raise was the
outstanding P equals NP question this is
probably the mathematical question that
underlies our field and we don't know
the answer to this so this is something
that theoretical computer scientists try
to address the question of what is
information is shared actually by many
different different disciplines biology
now for instance considers itself in
information science if you think about
quantum information science that really
means there's that branch of physics
that thinks of it in terms of
information where information may not be
represented just in terms of bits but
qubits
the question of what is intelligent
intelligence is an outstanding question
for the field of computer science it
started the whole field of artificial
intelligence on back in the 60s which
branched then into separate questions in
terms of vision
and speech and natural language
processing and manipulation and what's
so exciting today is that all these
separate branches that spawned out of
the original question of AI are now
coming back together they're coming back
together because some of the advances of
techniques that we've we've had recently
especially in machine learning that are
now being commonly used across vision
and speech and natural language and so
now there's a hope that we can revisit
this question of what is intelligence
and really understand what makes humans
think and then the last question how can
we tackle system complexity really
speaks to the engineering aspects of our
field we build tremendously large
complex systems the Internet is the most
complex engineered system in the world
ever invented by man and it's amazing
that it works but in fact no one really
understands how and why it works one
can't prove prove very many properties
about the internet yet we can't our
lives depend on it we can't live without
it I wrote a little article that
expounds on these questions you're
welcome to read what about technology
trends well let's just look at machines
and devices and the trends and
technologies there are from the very
large so we've got exascale computing
coming to the very small or the medium
wearables and portables to the very
small nano computing and using carbon
nanotubes for instance to build our next
generation of computers and the
combination of molecular computing and
nano computing and of course information
science is very much a teaser one
imagine building computers that are
molecules were a communication between
these computers community
Katia's between molecules is through
chemical reaction not sending electrons
over a wire and of course the other
teaser if is quantum computing in terms
of scale and intelligence we've already
heard about big data
we know that the combination of cell
plus cloud will give us the scale at the
cell level in terms of billions of
end-users to the cloud of a storage
capacity that will hold you know
information from everyone and everything
to the billions of devices that are
going to be sensors of the physical
world also data streams into the cloud
for that and then the the what you get
from storing all this data in the cloud
is the ability to share data across
different applications and to discover
new knowledge based on data perhaps
accumulated for one reason
but analyzed for a different reason the
there's an area called cyber-physical
systems which is where you have a
physical where you have a device that
has a computational core that interacts
who which interacts with the physical
environment so an embedded medical
device is one example robots will be
here they will be in your home they will
be in your office they will be at work
at play they'll come in different sizes
they'll move they'll manipulate they'll
do all sorts of wonderful things to
improve our lives a neuroscience is a
very hot area now in computer science
partly to understand what is
intelligence partly to understand the
brain and if we can use the metaphor of
the brain to understand
a techniques like deep learning which
Peter talked about this morning the
computer of today is not just the
devices that we use there our phone or
our laptops and so on the computer of
today is a network of humans and
machines working together the idea of
crowdsourcing is just a simple version
of a network of humans and computers
working together crowdsourcing of course
gives us the scale to solve problems
with multiple people but more
importantly it taps into the human
intelligence of the individuals in this
network of humans and computers so the
idea here is to combine the intelligence
of machines what machines are good at
with the intelligence of humans what
humans are good at and the combination
of human and machine intelligence gives
us more than either alone
and finally society the societal trends
are in high expectations of our
technology in diversity of users in
personalization and in addressing
societal grand challenges energy food
water health care education
transportation and security and safety
so I'll stop here and just remind you of
this triad of the drivers and impact of
research and computer science science
technology and society thank you
