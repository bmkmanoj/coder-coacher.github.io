hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
well a very warm welcome to all of you
thank you for coming it's a great
pleasure to welcome Mike Brady here
today mike has not only braved the the
train system but also various unexploded
bombs around the station and give
themselves wad and managed to make it
here in the nick of time so we're
grateful to you Mike this is really as
well as the first official inaugural
lecture in this impact lecture series
and the idea of the lecture series I
think really is to emphasize the fact
that doing deep basic research and doing
applied research that reaches the world
and affects the lives of millions of
people that these two are not at odds
with each other far from it they're very
much complementary to each other and I
can't think of a better person than Mike
to to introduce the series with this
first lecture mike is about as
distinguished as you could possibly get
on the academic scale he's a fellow of
the royal society he was until recently
professor of information engineering at
the world's second-best university and i
think i thought i would say that because
I know he would otherwise have made the
same joke about cambridge so i thought
i'd get in there first I wouldn't do
mean there in his quote retirement who's
professor of oncological imaging at
Oxford and runs a number of companies
he's had a tremendously and continues to
have a tremendously successful career
both on the academic access and on the
axis of bringing this research to life
in the real world so it's a great
pleasure to introduce you might thanks
very much Chris and thanks for thanks
for inviting me i love coming to this
place yeah so I following chris is
suggesting I wanted to talk about how we
can go from whiteboard to in my office
to white coats which is what clinicians
were and so this is a kind of picture of
me I'll show you a real picture of me in
a minute but basically as Chris said I
was I did transform from mathematics
through computing science to engineering
and now into oncology which seems like a
perfectly rational thing to do but I've
also started a number of companies on
the right hand side here the key point
about this is that unlike this picture I
don't have a split brain I really do
believe that rather than keeping
these activities separate but actually
they're not only complementary their
symbiotic actually many of the problems
that we've worked on and with many of
the challenges that we faced in the
company's having fat led to you know
succession of research projects funded
by cancer research UK or epsrc or the EU
I want to try and give some sense of
that and most of all I'm going to do
today is talk about I'm not going to
talk about the top couple of these I'm
not going to talk about the bottom
couple I'm going to fundamentally about
medical imaging and so this is the kind
of thing I'm going to talk about where
we go from doing the stuff that we get
really excited about which is up at the
top there this is a particularly simple
pair of equations and what we do from
that is I'm going to talk about image
fusion which is the the company the
company mirada I'm going to talk about
breast cancer and about computer-aided
detection of breast cancer and then
towards the end fatty liver disease and
towards the end I thought I thought I
would talk about what is happening to
healthcare informatics because we are
actually seeing the end of the age of
the dinosaurs and I think people like
microsoft and google and IBM are going
to be the new great players in this
space and it's one of the things that I
came to talk to Chris and to Antonio
about a couple of a couple of months ago
and again today so just for those of you
who don't know this we've come a long
way in about 25 years in imaging so on
the top left you can see a picture of my
brain and on the top right you can see a
picture of my heart and you hear down
here you can see a picture of my spine
just I've tried to try to teach my
grandkids how to do a backflip into the
pool which was a little stupid thing to
do as my wife in for me I have to
confess this is not my breast these are
picture of their Anatomy but of course
we've long gone beyond anatomy and we're
now beginning to see
first of all functional information
physiology and so here you can see at
the top you can see now and this was
that image was taken 12 years ago so
even then you could begin to do some
really useful fluid dynamics based on
the coursing of the blood through my
heart I semi arts in pretty good Nick
actually and on the top here you can see
a breast and if you look in the one that
will appear on the right to you you'll
see what looks like a little light bulb
turning on and that turns out to be a
carcinoma and now of course we've gone
beyond that beyond physiology we're now
beginning to look really a metabolic
information and in particular here is a
picture of glucose metabolism through
positron emission tomography and even
beyond that now we're beginning to look
at how you can image cellular and
molecular processes and one of the one
of the great friends at the moment in
image analysis and delighted I'm still a
young bloke is that we're beginning to
see this convergence between cellular
molecular biology with radiological
scale imaging and that's into what is
known as radio mix and theranostics so
that's it's a very live and it's been
changing very much over the past few
years so I'm going to talk about image
images and I thought it would start off
by asking you know what our images form
the first the first thing but by no
means the thing that I'm most interested
in is simply supporting clinicians and
the first of that is enhancement so this
is a mammogram and I'll come back and
talk about mammography in a few minutes
but this is a particular one where the
contrast is too high there's no
information about the breast boundary
the breast boundary contains any huge
amount of information about the amount
of adipose tissue within the breast on
the other hand this is an enhanced image
of the breast in fact it turns out to be
a quantitative image of the breast so
that the the gray values on the left
hand side mean nothing it's just a black
and white photo whereas the one on the
right actually those shades of grey
convey information and I'll come on talk
about that but the most important thing
is that you can't just Photoshop these
things
because the enhancement can't change the
diagnostically useful information you
must not add or subtract anything that's
clinically relevant of course that
presupposes a semantics about what is
clinically relevant a second thing you
second example is that you can begin not
just to do enhance web of visualizations
so this is an example of an mr
cholangiopancreatography MRCP which is a
way in which slightly I'm a slightly
invasive manner one images the biliary
structure the as it were the sewage
system around the liver and this is
fundamental to understanding a whole
series of liver disease in particular
autoimmune diseases and things like
primary sclerosing cholangitis which
i'll come to a little later so you end
up with this this 3d image 3d MRI image
and from those we need to be able to
extract and to visualize the extracted
skeletonized biliary tree and then from
those you need to get numbers we need to
be able to compute the branches this
isn't you know some fanciful headdress
for a raster fan it's a measure of the
color coded measure of the the cross
sectional radius of each of these
branches measuring the the junction
points and in particular flagging up
dilatations and structures because those
are the kinds of places we are going to
get pressure points would lead back to
inflammatory bowel disease and so forth
so that's visualization as the third
thing than the under and the third
example of what most people think about
in image analysis is image fusion and so
here for example is a cross-section just
around here happily not on me in MRI and
I can tell you that there's a very very
large and extremely aggressive counter
in this image but you will not be able
to see it because cancer is
fundamentally a metabolic metabolic
abnormality it is
turn AB it's not anatomical abnormality
and this is a picture of anatomy however
if you take positron emission tomography
and you combine you fuse them together
by registering Co registering them then
you can see that cancer very very
clearly but of course you can't see
anything else so you can see is it's a
you have to take my you have to take my
word for it that this large white blob
in the middle is a very aggressive
cancer but of course now you can overlay
those two things and you really can now
begin to switch them on and off and you
wonder why you didn't see it in the
first place okay but that's the kind of
work that's going on at the moment with
with image fusion and just to give you a
sense of that what you get typically in
the case of mr and I'm pet in this
particular case i'm showing you pet and
CT so CT computed tomography is the
ground white stuff the color is there is
the the pet information and basically if
you can see that these are completely
misaligned on the other hand if you do a
rigid body so you restrict yourself to
six degrees of freedom then you can
clearly do reasonable job but actually
you know as a matter of playing fact if
someone who wanted to do radio therapy
or surgery and they wanted to be
accurate to within a millimeter I sure
as hell wouldn't trust a rigid body
registration so you want to move to many
many more degrees of freedom which is in
fact deformable image registration and
though you can get these things very
very precise indeed and these things
have gotta work you know 99.99 PS at the
time 24 7 and you've got hundreds and
hundreds of degrees of freedom that
you've gotta control to do this so you
know what is this problem and underlies
this so fundamentally what we do is we
these days formulate this kind of
problem in terms of energy minimization
so we will try to find a transformation
between two images I and J whoops two
images I and J in such a way that and
we'll find a transformation T from some
appropriate class of transformations
which might be B splines they might be
whatever and or there might be various
motion fields and what we normally do is
we'll have some similarity criterion
between the transformed image and and
we'll need because that's effectively an
ill-posed problem will then after add a
regularizer some form of smoothness um
and if you do that then then you can get
from the one to the other and you can
begin to make these things align and
that's fundamentally what was underlying
that pet-ct I just showed you before so
what's the status of this at the moment
well you know there are thousands of
academic publications in this game and
there's also reality and the two things
that are intersect in a van diagram
sense but not by much so generally
speaking deformable image registration
works pretty well for the brain but not
much else there are usually promising
results are shown at academic
conferences but they're very very rarely
translated into routine clinical
practice to work on millions and
millions of images and there are whole
classes of clinically important cases
for example whole body registration so
for example in pet-ct the real driver is
you've got a primary tumor for example
in the lung but what you really care
about here is the distal met metastatic
disease elsewhere in the body so you've
got to be able to you've got to be able
to align the whole body has taken by pet
to a small section of the body as taken
by CT and that's something which
actually is quite a challenging problem
even though even taking a hold of the
large scale defamation such as for
example alone because you know UK you
get very uncooperative patients who
insist on breathing you know especially
for you know they get image for about 20
minutes and you know the buggers want to
take a breath I mean it's really quite
inconsiderate and yeah
doesn't deform the brain does not deform
that much there are in fact peristaltic
movements actually sign them but there's
not that much actually there's very
little in the way of motion and second
of all some of the imaging modalities
but particularly MRI have been
specifically specifically developed to
have maximal contrast and spatial
resolution for the brain for example
tree in gray matter and white matter
between vascular structures and
nonvascular structures but that's the
reason why it works particularly well
for the brain at least at the
radiological scale again breath-hold
most people with liver disease the the
median age which people get liver
disease is 75 most people who have liver
disease find it impossible to hold a
breath for more than around 12 to 15
seconds 12 to 15 seconds is a lot it's
very rare that you come across people
who are scuba divers and come to the
hospital so you have to take images in a
whole series of snapshots and that means
taking images of the deform love / of a
different over different breath holes
and then finally in the case of the
breast in the case of mammography the
breast is compressed in the case of MRI
the breast is pendulous in the case of
ultrasound the woman lies flat on her
back these are extremely difficult and
generally speaking the breast is not
rigid the solution to most of these
problems is in fact to come up with more
physiologically plausible constrained
optimization or kind of smart
segmentation and registration techniques
such as pictorial structures but I'm not
going to go in about that today there
are so many practical problems so for
example what works for one pair of
images for example pet-ct doesn't
necessarily work for another pair for
example mrm pet and the way to deal with
that is to try to incorporate some model
of the imaging physics into the
registration I'm going to come on talk
about that a little bit more in a few
minutes and
you generally speaking cannot take a
pair of images and say to a clinician
come back in four days time you know
they want they want they want answers
they prepared to wait an hour they
prefer to have it in 10 minutes and they
prefer having 10 seconds so we've had
initially we had one way of dealing with
this and I at the first of those two
statins is sentences is not a joke in
the case of my company mirada what we
did was we we went out and bought
snooker tables and coffee machines and
try to create a very nice working
environment i can't imagine if I came to
Microsoft I would find anything like a
snooker table or free coffee machines or
anything that'd be far too crass
wouldn't it and the xboxes do more more
recently of course what we've discovered
is that instead of actually doing
discretization of an underlying
continuous problem which is how I
formulated that optimization we've now
learned that there are various very very
fast ways of doing discrete optimization
and that is basically a brought is much
more likely to get to global minima and
be in a factor of anywhere between a
factor of 10 and a factor of 100 faster
than we were doing previously and that's
now standard stuff that we do and then
finally and if you if you report a false
minimum you can undermine clinical
confidence I mean basically this is a
little bit like it's a bitsy spider you
build confidence very very slowly like
that but you can lose it instantly I had
a very enthusiastic graduate student who
went to show the new version of his
software to a guy up at the Center for
mr in Oxford who pointed out to this
clinician that the most enhancing region
wasn't the breast it was the heart and
that's where the most vascularized
region was the heart the clinician was
absolutely enthralled by that and that
set us back three four months to rebuild
the confidence of that clinician to work
with us fortunately now you can we've
now begun to develop various smart forms
of regular Iser moving towards things
like for example anisotropic diffusion
or in the case for example here which is
very very difficult in general we build
a representative a build a
representation which is guided by as it
were an anatomical map of what you
expect to find in here and that's built
in to guide the registration regularizer
the smooth too smooth it's the thing
that you know it's the thing that
actually turns something which is a
little post problem into one that's well
posed by adding an additional constraint
of smoothness so it originally their
reason why it's called regularizer is
nothing to do with old brown it
originally came from dealing with
control systems building optimal control
systems from the 1960s actually then the
real reason why we do medical image
analysis is numbers what we've really
occur about is and this is where this is
what is changing medicine is bringing
the numbers so for example here in the
case of pet what you can get is this
standard uptake value which is a measure
of the amount of glycolysis sugar uptake
after a particular pet injection and on
the basis of that you can begin to
figure out whether something for example
is likely to be a tumor which is the one
that's the one that's shown from the bar
on the Left versus the one on the right
which is in fact standard brown brown
fat that you will everybody has got more
interestingly though you'll get patients
who will come back over several years
they will have pets ETS here I've just
shown one that's taken five times over
over three years we've actually got
sequences of people for over 15 15
images over about seven or eight years
and what we're interested in is
registering aligning those images and
then looking at for example the the
total volume of the lesion or the
avidity of the tumor and here for
example of the bottom that on the
right-hand graph at the bottom you can
see that despite the fact this person
has been under quite
aggressive chemotherapy you can see that
nevertheless the avidity of the tumor
has actually barely been has barely been
affected I'd like to talk to you now
really about two cases that I'm I that
was most of that red just that fusion
stuff is about my company mirada and I
want to talk about company of mine volt
power which I've been working on for 25
years and which started out in a pure
research project in in Oxford
engineering in the 1990s so some some
facts about breast cancer right now
around one in eight women in developed
countries will will get breast cancer at
some point in their lives and it's
amounts to around twenty three percent
of all cancers in women and that that
number is set to rise to very nearly
thirty percent by 2030 and the peak
incidence is for women between between
60 and 70 and I'll come on Lex going why
in a second and just to give you an idea
that number one in eight used to be one
in twelve when I started 25 years ago
another time indeed until about 15 years
ago in developed countries breast cancer
was almost unknown and it's now already
about wanting one in ten women now in
Asia will get breast cancer at some
point in their life it's rising
particularly rapidly in Africa and there
were already half a million cases even
even seven years ago and the reason for
that it's now become clear that between
95 and ninety-seven percent of breast
cancers are not directly genetic or even
epigenetic so much as due to extrinsic
factors such as toxins diet lifestyle
and so forth and as there's been
increasing urbanization in Asia you've
seen this surge in the amount of breast
cancer now the standard dogma of cancer
is that if you can get an early
detection plus you've got a appropriate
way means of intervention whether it's
kimo radio consult conserving surgery
and you've got a risk analysis a proper
risk analysis then you can contrast form
the figure so for example
if when a woman if 30 years ago 35 years
ago if a woman was diagnosed with breast
cancer they had effectively a 75 percent
chance of dying within five years that
number now is less than ten percent and
actually the thing has checked that you
know the situation has changed
dramatically in in breast cancer unlike
for example for blogs with prostate can
prostate cancer or it's a much less
happy situation so the fundamental
situation is this that when a woman goes
through the menopause which is
government's decree to be at the age of
50 then what happens in in many cases is
that normal structural tissue which is
milk burung or stromal converts to fat
it gets stored as fatty gets stored as a
whole series of hormones and fat and fat
is essentially transparent to x-rays and
so it's dead easy to see cancers in fact
it's hard to think of any image of
modality that could do better for breast
cancer than mammography for those women
who have normal involution whose breasts
changing that normal way in fact you can
measure it's about ninety-eight percent
ninety-eight percent effective in that
case however about forty percent of
women do not have normal involution the
breasts stay stubbornly dense and it
turns out that for such women the child
the risk of getting breast cancer is
increased by a factor between six and
nine and worse than that not only is the
increased risk but because the breast
remains dense it's much harder to see
tumors because now you're looking for as
it were a big big snowball in the middle
of a blizzard and worse yet in terms of
the perfect storm it turns out that the
the phenotype of the cancer is likely to
be more aggressive as well so it's a
total triple whammy so what it says is
there and in this case my mom
is no better than a coin toss okay so it
turns out then that breast density the
amount of dense tissue is a vastly
vastly more important and more
significant risk factor for breast
cancer than anything to do with having
mothers and sisters and you know
mother-in-law's twice removed it the
amount of dense tissue so the question
is can we use that information and so in
the United States over the past five
years there's been a slew of legislation
in fact it could well be one of the very
few things that gone to the federal
books during Obama's period in the last
couple of years but all of these all of
these country all of these states in
green and yellow have now effectively
got laws that require a woman when she
has a mammogram to be told her breast
density okay and one of the reasons why
that came around is because you have
these advocacy groups in the United
States like are you dense it was run by
an inspiration woman called Nazi Paulo
and there are various things like the
dangerous boobs tour and here are the
dangerous boobs and that's me just after
I made a donation to their cause and so
this is all very well but it's welcomed
by women but what exactly is a clinician
supposed to report your supposed to tell
a woman in fact you're now legally
obliged to tell a woman what her breast
density is but what are you supposed to
do so here just to give you an idea of
the challenge our two mammograms taken
it's a small hospital a couple of miles
south of here in which these two
mammograms because of the amount of
brent's dense tissue we were asked
radiologists two radiologists agency BK
and TLS to estimate the amount of dense
tissue in this woman's breast and BK
estimated twenty-five percent and the
woman on the right said forty percent
but those two images were taken ten
minutes apart it's the same woman okay
so clearly there's a challenge here
you can't just do it from the image
itself and the answer is fundamentally
that the one on the left was exposed to
x-rays for twice as long as the one on
the right now we know that if you
manipulate image parameters you can get
very different images you know I spend
years and years i love doing photography
and i play around with photography to
get various enhanced things whether it's
to do with the amount of exposure time
the the depth of field whether it's to
do with the film stock i'm using and so
forth right and i do it in order to
emphasize those aspects of the scene
most interest isn't the scene out there
is the same and the same is true of
medical imaging but clinicians are told
to report judgmentally so they're given
a three particular for particular hooks
for particular categories so for example
the breast tissue is heterogeneous Lee
dance which corrupts cured detection of
small masses approximately 50 1 2 4 75
cent is glandular that's a typical
instruction to a radiologist it turns
out that the inter radiologist variation
on assigning classes is thirty-five
percent now to say three and a half out
of ten don't agree with each other more
if you take the same radiologist and you
present a whole city of image and you
randomly put them in 25 cent the time
they don't agree with myself either
right now in order to deal with that
clear so you've now got huge variation
across swimming enormous variation of
imaging enormous enormously very very
subtle conditions that cost constitute
breast cancer how can you deal with it
well you know I was in an engineering
department I had a very simple answer
you know to me we simply had to build a
model of the imaging process and then
try to invert that process okay so this
is the model that we built I mean I'm
not going to go through it but there's a
whole book about it so what you have is
the x-rays fly flow down from the x-ray
tube you generally speaking you know a
lot about the x-ray tube and
particularly you know about it what its
spectrum is that's shown on the right
hand side in terms of photon energy
versus relative photon count we it's
then the breast is
compressed in order to spread out in
order to spread out the dental tissue so
that you don't get superposition of a
tumor be no dense tissue so you get
radiation incident on the upper plate
goes through the breast and through the
bottom plate and then exposes a sensor
that converts directly from x-ray
photons two electrons and if you model
all of that you end up with the equation
I've shown down the bottom here and
basically that piece in the models the
breast contents and I'll come on and say
a little bit more about that in the
middle but basically you want to
understand what I spent eight years of
my life in Oxford in the nineteen ninety
was developing this mathematical model
of a tumor it's exactly that's the
bottom of this slide so the literature
tells us if we're going to try and make
sense of this stuff the literature tells
us and I believe it's wrong but the
literature tells us that there are two
classes of substance fat which is not of
clinical interest that's wrong but it
was deemed not to be of clinical
interest and dense tissue which is and
they've got very different attenuation
or absorption of x-rays okay so we call
the one interesting and the other one
fat and as it were the compressed breast
thickness we know at any given voxel any
given pixel is the sum of the amount of
fat in the amount of interesting tissue
so we can write down our equation again
we measure the thing on the left the
thing some just pointed out in the
middle all of those are calibration
parameters or you can get from the dicom
header there the amount of the exposure
time there the amount of the size of the
pixel etc etc the bit in the middle here
is the compression plates with lucite we
know that we know the thickness of the
plate the bit we don't know is is the H
mu and what H mu is is for each
discretized energy it's the weighted sum
of the amount of interesting tissue and
the amount of fat tissue and remember
that H fattest plus agent is equal to H
so we can
rearrange the equation here to get the
one at the bottom and now since we now
know H fat if we knew if we know these
two attenuation parameters we can solve
for H int and that's exactly what we do
and if we do that across this is
massively supervise its simplified i
wrote 300 page book explaining all of
this stuff but fundamentally what you
get is this now there on the left-hand
sides take those two images again the
one at the top left where that
particular pixel we can say that there
is naught point 4 centimeters of non fat
tissue and if you look on the one on the
right around very different exposure
again nor point four centimeters of non
fat tissue and again at other places on
here so we started out we wrote a book
in nineteen nineteen ninety nine and
then eventually basically 12 years later
that was a the basis for a regulatory
approved piece of software and what does
the software do well basically it
computes for every single point in a
mammogram the amount of dense tissue it
can then some the amount of dense tissue
therefore it can estimate the amount of
dense tissue which you recall is the
single most important risk factor for
breast cancer but we can also do things
like we can compute from that the amount
of dose of x-rays we can figure out the
pressure applied to the breast because
we can figure out what the earlier is
and they record the fourth I'm if with
the percent density just to give you an
idea we started this company in 2009 we
got FDA clearance by 2011 we got the
first part of the program out in 2012 we
processed our four million for mammogram
actually I should say 2015 and this year
we will pass 10 million mammograms okay
10 million mammograms wait a minute
that's minuscule remember there are 75
million mammograms taken per annum and
that's number it's going to rise to 150
over the next five to ten years as it
becomes more commonplace throughout Asia
and Africa our software is now installed
in
33 countries and the way which is works
if you remember back to that business
about involution what we have is you
take a mammogram we compute the density
score and in essence if it's low density
so remember if it was a fatty breast
then we'll say mrs. Jones you're
perfectly fine there's no evidence of a
tumor come back in 23 years time on the
other hand if it's dense then you should
not be recalled an oven of the mammogram
that's daft is just going to get loads
and loads of x-rays what you should have
is an ultrasound on MRI so one of the
things that's turned out to be a
windfall from my company is that the
insurance company is now in the states
except the quantitative analysis that we
do to reap to reimburse a woman who has
an ultrasound based on the fact that
their breasts are judged to be dense
either by MRI or by ultrasound so the
same piece of physics that underlay that
has subsequently gone on to looking at
the computation of x-ray dose and has
gone on to estimate an information
system for the breast imaging center
after all these the people who've got
money unlike radiologists who like to
write papers and seek and three patients
and various random things like that and
now what we've done is we've now built a
cloud-based version of that which we
call enterprise and this is just to give
you an idea we can generate the
productivity of a research center by
looking at the amount of breast volume
image by day of the week we can look at
whether or not you know four different
mammography mammography machines how
productive they've been we can look at
the amount of x-ray dose that's been
given all of this we can get just on the
basis of that physics I showed you and
by taking since hospitals typically have
multiple centers you really want to pull
all of those together in order to for
example rationally allocate resource
light expensive new machines and so it's
very natural to do this in a cloud-based
manner so that's basically what we're
doing and just to give you an I just to
give you just to tell you one thing and
that is that this company which
started out with me and one graduate
student who actually came from Tony
Tony's master's course in in Oxford came
over and did a dphil with me in Oxford
from nineteen eighty nine to nineteen
ninety-two we've built this stuff up
waited for the market to want to want to
get this technology because there's no
point in having technology if the market
doesn't want it and now on the
twenty-second of April this year this
company will float on the Australian
Stock Exchange we've now got something
of the order of 45 50 people working for
the company meanwhile I got contacted by
an old friend of mine who was also one
of the founders of this company volper a
guy named nico casa maya hua antonio
will know well let's this guy at the top
here and basically what we've been
interested in is doing a complementary
piece of work which is in fact applying
pattern recognition to mammograms to
effectively estimate if a clinician taps
on a particular point in a mammogram
says I suspect that there's an
abnormality there will show in this
particular case I've shown here a
cluster of what are known as
microcalcifications which should be the
calcium salts or magnesium salts and
which are typically these things are
typically evidence for what is known as
ductal carcinoma in situ which is the
main reason why woman as a mastectomy or
we can then take and we can link up the
images from the previous time both the
cranial coral and the medial lateral to
medial lateral oblique compression of
view of the breast and we can come up by
enhancing the probability which is
what's written in red here we can give a
probabilistic and assessment of whether
or not there's anything serious at that
point now of course at the moment we've
done that in a four years Nico and I
have done that by sweating and worrying
about signal processing and image
analysis and various filters and so
forth what we've more recently done is
we've applied deep learning to we happen
to have
available a relatively small database of
around three hundred and seventy five
thousand cases in the University radboud
university nijmegen and god dammit
within two months with the deep learning
classification system is outperforming
what Nico had done over 20 years and
that's actually quite interesting and
that's one of the directions were going
so I was going to say if only there were
an underlying semantics for deep
learning as opposed to rabbits out of
the hat and black box and that's exactly
of course what Antonio is doing let me
turn to my my second case something
another example but again quantitative
analysis to give you an idea of some of
the stuff that we've been doing that
this is work I've been doing together
with Stephanie bar in cardiology and a
couple of his colleagues one of whom is
a brilliant young guy called Rajasa
Banerjee so this is this is the just
some basic facts about the situation at
the moment in the Western world which is
that somewhere between 25 and 35 percent
of western populations have fatty liver
disease in the in the UK somewhere
between 15 to 20 million people have got
fatty liver disease of those about
one-quarter so in the UK is emerging
three and five million will develop
stato hepatitis I'll explain to that
what that isn't second and of those a
very substantial fraction will develop
either cirrhosis or and cirrhosis is
when the fibrous tissue basically gets
like chicken wire and prevents any form
of nourishes so the breast just so the
liver just dies or go straight to
hepatocellular carcinoma liver cancer
and it used to be thought that you had
to go from fatty liver disease to stay
at or hepatitis to cirrhosis and then to
liver disease now clear that you can go
to liver cancer directly and very early
and why is that happening well you can
see that
are a number of really quite slim people
around and to a very large extent there
are two main drivers for this one is
junk food and fizzy drinks and the other
is Hep C I'm not going to talk about Hep
C or hit be today though that's a part
of the story what I can tell you is is
the numbers are getting to be
frightening there's already 170 million
people with serious fatty liver disease
around the world there are it's
projected that would be nearly 400
million by 2013 you can see the rise in
the developing world the percentage rise
in the developing world where is the
percentage of children for twenty
percent of children in the EU have got
already fatty liver disease and are
moving towards non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis nash or 2 diabetes
because actually most of these liver
diseases are manifestations of the
metabolic syndrome just like diabetes or
diabetic retinopathy so this is what a
healthy liver looks like the kind of
thing you'd eat and what happens is as
you develop fatty liver disease you get
these globules of fat and then in
essence what you get is this abnormal
retention of lipids that's fats and that
begins to disrupt the normal processes
the normal garbage collection process of
the liver and in essence what happens is
as that becomes more serious the amount
of fat the amount of ballooning of cells
within the liver increase it's quite
substantially at that point you either
move to cirrhosis which is this
horrendously scarred thing looks like
chicken wire on the right or you get a
tumor which I've shown you here but to
cellular carcinoma um so how do you
detect liver disease and it's pretty
difficult because it's what's known as
the silent killer you tend to find out
only towards end stage that you've got a
liver disease but not always but but
usually
really speaking the gold standard as
it's called is to have a biopsy that's a
20-centimeter needle anybody wants to
volunteer to come and have one in Oxford
I'd be more than happy to arrange it
they're bloody painful there is enormous
inter and intra rate of variability
about one in four hundred there are
serious complications they cost around a
thousand quid to 1,200 quid to the NHS
and for all that it's samples about 150
thousandth of the 2.5 kilogram liver so
this is not a gold standard in the way
that I would normally think of gold what
we have done is we've come up with a an
MRI test which is non-invasive and which
I'll explain in a second computes a
particular parameter which we call
corrected t1 where the value 733 869 906
etc that number we have shown is highly
correlated with what you would get from
biopsy extremely highly correlated all
right so how does that work well it had
been known that mr the t1 the relaxation
parameter T 1 of MRI was correlated with
histology but the correlation was very
weak and what we realized was that if
you take the average t1 shown under two
left panels there then in fact that is
confounded by the amount of iron within
the livin there's quite often if you eat
excessive amounts of red meat or you
drink large amounts of red wine then you
will have excessive iron within the
liver and then actually that really
begins to that which is quite abnormal
I've shown it they're basically messes
up that measurement so what we did was
we developed some physics that come
basically correct that which is
collected but on every machine by that
and you get this corrected t1 so while
that one looks
reassuringly normal if you understand
what the color and I'll show you what
there is in a second then that indicates
severe disease so just by doing that
correction you completely change the
diagnosis okay and there's another
example at the bottom there so what we
do is we take a quantitative t1 map we
take a t2 star image which measures the
amount of iron and the same time as we
do that we compute a fat map in fact for
these we use a particular well-known
pretty much universally deployed
sequence known as Dixon and by combining
by fusing these informations together
with a particular underlying physics
model we can estimate the corrected t1
and what does the corrected t1 mean well
it actually is a score that there is a
number in terms of milliseconds so it
has the dimensions of time but of course
clinicians are used to seeing this
underlying histology scale from from
North 24 so what we've done is we've
come up with a scale we basically
quantize those numbers to give a scale
and we call it lifts and we call it
lifts not because we are a keen on
dublin but because because what we've
got here is that a measure what we're
actually measuring is information and
fibrosis and it turns out that when you
start to get an insult to the body the
information of fibrosis co-evolved and
in essence what they do is they restrict
the motility of what if you think about
that that chicken wire which is
cirrhosis you know the moat once you've
excited a proton is God can't go
anywhere can't move and so it's
relaxation time becomes lengthened right
so that motility of free water by
looking at the corrected t1 of protons
is a very very strong indicator of the
amount of underlying inflammation
fibrosis and therefore of early disease
stage so we've now got so we started
this company three years ago we got
siiii marking
we've got FDA clearance we're now
selling this and we're selling this
through the cloud as reporting as a
service right the whole thing is now
being soldiers one deserves I'll come
back to that in a few minutes so a
couple examples they want the top here
is a simple stare ptosis this is a fatty
liver it should be blue if it was
perfectly healthy it's beginning to get
on to the boundary of something that can
be concerning the one down the bottom
here how this guy's walking around is
utterly beyond me this person is either
got autoimmune hepatitis or they've got
severe severe disease to give you an
idea here's an example of a lady 44 year
old lady who had bariatric surgery or
probably read quite a bit about this in
the in the in the press so the woman had
a pre BMI of 30 for which is actually
quite modest compared with some of the
people we see just give you an idea we
recently had a kid who came a young lad
who came to be scanned in in our Center
in Oxford and he actually got quite
severe stara hepatitis the kids 12 years
of age he already weighs 60 kilograms
he's enormous which sold we told them
the mother you know your son has got a
BMI of 36 and she said that's great it
was only 32 a year ago right such as the
ignorance you have to do right so so
that's the picture of the liver
beforehand and that's after the
bariatric surgery insertion of a sleeve
so you can see that the BMI is reduced
from 24 34 24 well okay so the woman
lost weight it doesn't necessarily mean
that liver improved but actually we can
show in the way we just have they're
actually this has been a significant
improvement in the state of this liver
and moreover should this woman begin to
regress to eating garbage again then
that green will
change back towards orange at which
point you can say look lady you know
you've had your one shot at bariatric
surgery up to right now it's up to you
here's an example of a kid a 19 year old
kid when I saw him who was being
scheduled it was being scheduled for a
liver transplant the clinician asked as
if we would look at it because he
suspect he wasn't quite as bad it wasn't
bad enough for a liver transplant and
actually if you look at it there's part
of the liver one of the lobes of the
liver is actually quite functional but
the other ones completely shot so the
clinician put him on a very very
aggressive very aggressive steroid
regime and just eight months later you
can see that there's been a significant
increase in the amount of good tissue in
this liver and one year later than that
the liver is almost entirely good cause
you can also see there's a chunk of
that's fat but that's you know if you
look at any of the weight lifters who
are full of steroids that's the kind of
fact that they get this is happy that
guy was going to have a liver transplant
now he's completely stabilized on
asteroids regime and just got married
and we've just run through 3,500 cases
in the UK biobank some of you may be
volunteers for biobank and what we've
done is we've taken the fat content are
shown on the left the iron content and
this corrected score the lift score on
the right if you look at the the
government basically decrees that you
should have a liver fat content which is
less than 2% which actually makes
unhealthy something of the order of
ninety-six percent of the UK population
this is fat that's liver fat this one is
liver iron content this is the lift
score on all I've tried to do is put I
may I agree looks like a Christmas tree
all I tried to do is to get all the
3,500 data points on to this one school
is me tease me tease me they know the
enemy yeah it's just how many right so
there's all 3,500 run here it just
happens to be piled up in this way so
even if you take five percent you can
see that there's you can see that
there's a significant number of people
who are beyond that and actually of
course by the time you get up here and
remember these are asymptomatic people
walking around the UK right and you can
look at people who generally speaking
anything above 20 you are beginning to
expect that they will be Susan if you do
the numbers if you look at the numbers
it turns out to be entirely consistent
with that one quarter of the population
having Nash and similarly here so the
point is that we're now doing this we've
just been asked to run this out to
100,000 people and I'll skip over that
I'm going to skip over that as well one
thing that we've had to do is to show
that this thing works on every
manufacturers machine so we've had 3 t-4
siemens and phillips and 1.5 for Zeman's
and they're all the same you would
expect you would expect that they will
lie on a straight line that's that's
basic that's basic physics of the
lemoore equation so and we can develop
nowadays enhanced segmentations
probabilistic representations of what's
going on inside the liver that basically
go beyond the basic clinical thing and
now this is being used more and more by
pharmaceutical companies who are using
these numbers our surrogate endpoints in
clinical trials and just to finish this
stuff often is here you've got a bit
whoops here you've got the biliary tree
that I showed you earlier this is the
liver we can now align this biliary tree
onto this we can do some analysis to
pull off these vascular structures and
so forth so just a couple of slides to
finish with there are a whole series of
trends in healthcare above what's
happening
in terms of science one every health
care system around the planet is
increasingly unaffordable you know the
fact is that people are living longer
people the taxable percentage of the
population is getting smaller and the
government's are basically refusing to
face up to the costs the ticking time
bomb of health care that's led to what
is known as the Affordable Care Act in
the United States the ACA which drives
towards things called value-based
payments which basically says i'm going
to give you you know a thousand dollars
to deal with a liver deliver imaging and
it's up to you guys to figure out how to
split it up rather than what was
previously a gravy trail where you do it
on a per procedure basis and the more
procedures you did the better so what
that's done is in fact it's maximizing
the return from existing infrastructure
and what that's doing in turn is it's
moving from capital to recurrent
expenditure ie it's driving things away
from selling boxes to selling smart
software application specific smart
software and it's driving things towards
big data with cloud and indeed deep
learning you may know that IBM recently
IBM the Watson recently bought merged
for a billion dollars in order to get
the 7500 install base that they've got
so now it's their way of trying to apply
the Watson technology to Big Data that
is but the first of many examples we're
going to see in in that line and there's
increasing interest these days in whole
life costing for health care rather than
just individual procedures and I'm not
going to go on about it today but the
link in between what I've been showing
you which is radiological scale to
genetics and epigenetics through what is
known as radio mix and theranostics I'm
not going to talk about that at all just
want to leave you with one
thought up until about 10 years ago
medical imaging which is a 334 billion
dollar industry was dominated by big
iron companies GE Phillips demons
toshiba and nowadays Samsung and these
devices were effectively islands on
which things happened big iron as
they're called whoops as they're called
these companies big iron did not
understand software and to a very large
extent still does not and therefore
innovations took years to get to market
but to give you an example of that at
the time that we did a management buyout
of a piece of what had been the former
mirada from Zeman's in 2009 late 2008
2009 we started to work on the same kind
of device having having to start from
scratch the zimas were working on and
with one half the number of people and
within two years we had a product was
FDA cleared and five years six years
later Zeman still did not have the
product out on the market and that's
because they're completely utterly
processed band right where's you've got
the agility of small companies so
innovations took years to get to market
so that's the way it was and then of
course what happened was that people
begin to build file servers particularly
for image data inside hospitals and
these were known as packs picture
archiving and communicate communication
centers and you might think well that's
just a you know what the hell that's
just a local area network it had one
profound effect on hospitals namely
where an image is produced is no longer
where it's stored and that's no longer
where it's read it actually separated
out three functions that previously had
been collocated around the machine okay
and what that did was in order for that
to happen we began to find file
standards for all of the images through
things like dicom which in fact shifted
things away from Hardware towards smarts
software image is merely one example of
that and now what we're seeing is cloud
is beginning to completely accelerate
this trend so all of the all of the real
practical issues to do with the fact
that you had to deal with constraints on
the communication patient data which in
the United States things like HIPAA and
now being overcome the D identification
of patient data is now kind of routine
all or five years ago people worry about
it this you know the the idea that you
would do the worldwide wait for an image
you know is now with the increased
bandwidth is much less of a problem
automatic billing for services is now
fairly routine and more importantly
cloud is now encouraging recurrent
expenditure through subscription models
of payment so to come back to what I was
kicking off to talk about the road from
white board to white coat is in fact
strewn with rocks you know you can't
just take a smart idea what you have to
do is you're going to go through
regulatory clearance with cee with the
Federal Drug Administration FDA
clearance you've got to go through a
whole series of quality processes you've
got to worry about interoperability
through the dicom jungle there are any
number of routes to market whether it's
thick client thin clients cloud you've
got to start worrying about insolent
installation maintenance and so forth
well you know that's a big deal for
people in the University who want to go
out and do a company based on some smart
algorithm it sure as hell isn't a
problem for Microsoft you know most of
this stuff is routine for you guys so
what does it want to be provider do well
you know if you're in a university and
you want to do this kind of stuff you
want to get some stuff out to be used by
clinicians step number one is you bite
the bullet and you just do it and that's
what I've done through each of my
companies or you can outsource to
somebody who's already got all of those
regulatory capabilities and quality
approvals and that's what we did first
upper spectrum diagnostics we outsourced
tu mirada and now we've built our own
and so we're now doing their own stuff
in
house or you can outsource the
development you know even somebody in a
university you know even a even a piddly
little one here you know you can you can
see people come out of engineering or
computing with a really really good idea
and they may say you know he's a great
idea is a great app I just don't I can't
deal with all that other stuff right now
so how might you respond well you know
you might actually you've got cash and
you can also take equity right so they
can get some sweat equity but you know
you can take equities accompany so one
of the issues is what might Microsoft
Lee thank you so you just think want to
very clean questions are going to be
rounded people on a talk yeah this kind
of stuff only the live voting algorithm
to families in dealing with an it
regulatory big question so generally
speaking I guess a typical company we
would have about if i look at my
companies and I tried roughly in my head
to do this I would say a third of the
people are involved in finance business
development sales and marketing our low
of course you know doing sales and
marketing if you're dealing with cloud
and cloud services are very very
different from having you know boots on
the boots on the street going and
banging on hospital doors it's a hell of
a lot easier you can deal with a lot
leaner organization but about a third
are sales marketing finance admin and
types of the of the other two-thirds I
would say so that sixty percent would
say something of the order of around ten
fifteen percent tend to be scientists
engineer
as developing next-generation product
and then the remainder so a half we were
because my companies are all software
companies they would be split into the
people who are doing the prototyping the
people who are doing the real
development and the people who are doing
testing and maintenance and we've always
organized the companies in fact you
pretty much have to so that the people
you're doing the testing and the
troubleshooting are completely separate
from the people who are doing the
developing and the people who are doing
the actual development of the stuff
again again formal specifications are
different again from the people who come
up with the algorithmic ideas and we
have very rigid very rigid processes no
no no it's something that it's something
that something that we did I became very
you know I became very convinced and it
was kind of in the in the water in
Oxford that you had to think about you
know formal specifications are suspect
formal specifications for me out what
say Tony would have done in the in the Z
days in night but but that the rigorous
the rigorous specification of software
and through a mixture of and
documentation examples etc code and that
would be then translated to the people
actually building the I didn't want the
people who are doing that creative stuff
to be worried about interoperability
dicom interaction with the networking
and so forth and then you must have
people who are trying to break the stuff
on the regular basis before it goes out
the door so we've always had that very
very very very rigorous structure to the
company and it's one of the reasons why
we have very very few failures in the
field you know because the cost of
dealing with something not just in terms
of money but in terms of reputational
damage
if you put something out that doesn't
work it's just immense so you know
especially when you're dealing with
health care you know you really it's
really got to work absolutely right out
all the time yeah so that's roughly the
breakdown of other people we haven't
accomplished just a time will pause the
the form of Q&amp;amp;A there and I know that
you've rearranged your day a little bit
and I to focus on Obama incidents you'll
be here for a little while longer so
anyone who wants to get a bit of time
this might just let me know very time
actually very excited message of course
we've just launched our own medical
image yet analysis group headed by
Antonio so it's a very upbeat message at
the potential of this technology for the
future so with that that's just I might
regret</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
