hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
so the next talk is about massively
empowered classrooms as as we saw a lot
of people have already been touched by
it let me introduce Sid Prakash or from
your perspective Santa Claus whatever
you want from Microsoft Research india
since the guide to go to and so let me
welcome sit on the stage all right so
we'll do this talking in you know in
like two ways so the first part of the
talk will do some fun stuff because many
of you already know about Meg so what
we'll do is we'll you know kind of quiz
you on what you've seen in mac and how
do you get to know about Meg stuff that
we did behind the scenes and then second
part obviously many of you would know
want to know why we are doing something
like neck right so an invite shriram
over to kind of give you an overview
from a research standpoint and help you
understand what why we are doing what we
are doing okay so let me get started so
again the fun part okay so if this part
you we need your involvement you have to
give me answers and let's see how well
you guys know yourselves so this is the
question typically how many hours you
spend online and be honest about it
twenty percent is not ours come on 24
hours who is a 24 hours he was being
honest i'ma say okay give me a more
realistic on average what do you think
an average typically how many hours does
an engineering spend okay so basically
you got the answer anything from four
hours to you know 24 hours now
interestingly there was a study done a
couple of years ago so whatever I am
talking about here is not something we
did we found out this was a study done
by a very well-known recognized
institution and this is what they found
out so do you see the right spike what
do you see this is variable on right so
the study said very clearly that
obviously lot of people spend time
online especially five plus hours online
every day but the biggest pipe is from
people like you people like us now
obviously that
yeah let me complete let me complete
this is more to come more docomo to come
more interesting facts about yourself
wait now the next thing the next part of
the study was okay you spend 5 plus
hours online every day what do you do I
know a bad question to ask in a public
forum but even guys what do you do
please use politically correct terms
what do you do ok how many social media
how I'm going to how many of you think
social media is the most popular thing
online these days everybody ok I
shouldn't device that next what do you
think number two so you are right here
number one is social media everybody
kind of accept the fact that social
media is the thing online all the time
second what do you think o de UT what
else forums who said forums prada ok ok
good sir so from the study youtube and
online you know watching videos online
was very close to doing things one sky
do talk you know doing lot of charts so
these form the top three now
surprisingly we were expecting online
learning also somewhere right we thought
at least someone's the top five it'll be
there but I mean unfortunately it wasn't
but what was interesting was that
finally somewhere in the list of top 20
25 things it was there so people who
think would look like this the studious
types I actually do spend time online so
how many of you again a question how
many of you do some learning online half
of you are confused do i do a nor do i
do I know yeah okay good so you are
raising your hands but out of those five
hours I'm sure five minutes every day is
what you spend so that's fine that's
fine but you at least do something right
so this was one of the motivations we
had when we I started looking at
massively empowered classroom and I
won't explain the project in detail
because that's what she Rommel do next
but then then we started two years ago
something very interesting again happen
I mean during the process of mass
civilian powered classroom or know how
many things we discovered about know you
guys things we suddenly assumed but they
happen to be not true and you will know
why so we started in 2012 and
until June 2014 this is what we did we
took a very academic approach now many
of you must be wondering what's an
academic approach right so the ultimate
objective was to reach reach out to you
to get you on to the portal tell you
there's something good coming your way
it's free you know leverage it so we
went to your teachers we did Lord of
teacher workshops we spoke to them and
we told them that you know why not you
go to your students and tell them that
something like this exists and they
spend so much time online this may be
something productive and useful for them
then we told you it is very important to
learn concepts how many of you learn
concepts no one means real understanding
try to understand things again half the
answer like this I know it's easy to
crack exams the other way but some of
you do try to do it right so we tried to
go out and give this message loud and
clear that it is very important and the
entire industry not only in India
everywhere else in the world is saying
that students today don't you know get
the real concepts just you know do stuff
and come to come for jobs we even
initiated supervised learnings so we
actually appointed some interns some of
your peers some student partners and
made them go to your campus and you know
try and convince you that this thing
exists make use of it obviously they
were learning as usual you came back
with answer so this is very interesting
okay pay attention to the first question
you know academic approach this is what
he told us thank you so much or college
keeps on telling us things every day
there is another thing that is coming
our way we are not super interested
buddy are you are doing a great job
second equation concepts you challenged
us what do you mean hello we get
distinctions and this and that and
you're saying that we do not learn
concepts we not only learn concepts with
muck them as well we go and you know
what the entire textbook and just rent
it out on the exam papers when we score
with the last art sorry supervised
learning again right all of you have
come it means post 5pm staying in
college getting somebody to come help
you quite a task you have to go to a
coffee shop cyber cafes spend your five
plus hours online every day so again
didn't work
so what we decided was that v thought
will flip it we will instead of us
telling you what to do and how to do we
will listen to you and then figure out
what can happen so again going back with
all this effort all this these three key
things that I listed out what do you
think the result was you think people
like hugely successful no yeah you are
right because the result also said
something like that only 15 case two
wins over the last whatever 33 plus
semesters on so based on this as i said
we decided to flip it and by the way
this is the look all of the researchers
on us had when we saw those numbers
after those three semesters went by
right so jun 2014 onwards we flipped it
we decided to do something that you want
and do it in the way you want and you
told us that give us rewards anytime you
want us to spend be it for us be it for
you whatever it is we understand it's
good and all that but you have to kind
of give us a candy and incentive to
participate in something like that we
did that we started giving away like
cool stuff right at p shirt it's like
such a big deal isn't it we gave
t-shirts the j obviously big prizes we
ran lot of contests we actually did some
coding context as well mommy's lot of
people participated renzo big i think
that was one of the motivations why a
lot of you participated but then all
that happened and we started talking to
you in the language you like and the way
you like it right it Charlotte oh hey
what's are there is something called as
massively empowered classroom they're
giving away t-shirts did you enroll bad
one right now suddenly why are you doing
this I mean serum will talk about that
we have lot of other interesting studies
that we kind of uncovered during the
process we introduced the most important
thing more free certifications right
certificates themselves are super
important and then the free word comes
anything anything works so lot of you
started writing to us and you said you
know what I've watched two and a half
videos can you give me a letter saying I
watched these two and half videos so we
said sorry we cannot do that but yeah we
will at least give you a way of knowing
your teachers will give you a way for it
teaches to know what you have done and
how much it would so we started doing
all that and
we've introduced some more
certifications recently we ran a
referral campaign and this was massive I
don't know what went so well but this
was massive so we had some some of your
friends some miters of student partners
themselves and we asked them to go and
convince you and tell them that this is
good and it just free oh I mean you guys
loved it we had around 30,000 plus
people register in like no time they
were obviously incentives for those kids
who were working hard the student
partners and such people but then you
somehow liked it so when we were telling
you is good you never believed us but
when your friends came and told you you
probably did them a favor and join us we
made an offline and a phone app
available because that's another very
important on a serious note and
important learning we had over the last
couple of years that bandwidth seems to
be a big issue in many of your colleges
you would prefer to kind of look at
these video lectures while you are
traveling in a bus or you are computing
to your college you know in which other
way so we made an offline version
available where you can actually go
ahead and download the entire make our
package view them on demand and later on
whenever you have time go ahead and take
the quizzes because obviously
certificates are very important right so
to get the certificates you have to do
something you log in and you get them
now what do you think the result was on
all of this good bad some prediction I
kind of gave it away but even then it
was way beyond our expectations suddenly
from 15,000 we went to 100,000 people on
net so that is where we are currently
and what we have discovered during the
process as I said is that just the
content obviously is not what you want
you want lot of other things packaged
around the content you want things to be
presented to you in the way you like it
and that's what we are trying and we are
going to try and in the next semester
you will again see lot of new changes
lot of new campaigns offline online lot
of you know other engagements that will
do so please go spread the word after
you get to know what make is inside out
so i'll invoice shearim over to come and
talk to you about what make is from a
research standpoint boy i don't think i
can make research as interesting as what
Sid was talking to you about let me try
okay so so what I'm going to talk to you
about is you know you might wonder why
is the research lab interested in giving
t-shirts you know coffee mugs and so on
what is that interest in doing this and
believe it or not there is a lot of
research behind doing things like I'll
let me give you a flavor for what the
research is to start with the context I
want to give you is that there are the
in the past two or three years there are
these large number of MOOCs you know
they stand for in a massive open online
course man and that I've taken the world
by strong right and then this so many
people you know millions and millions of
them have enrolled in EDX Coursera and
so on and and everyone including us
thought that what a wonderful idea and
how how empowering this should be in
environments like India where there is
such shortage of qualified faculty
compared to the number of students we
have in this country so we have had no
several focus groups you know you would
have seen me or sit there with the RV we
may have even visited your college you
know several of your teachers came to
msri we had focus groups and so on and
typically would ask questions like the
following right like Karnataka for
example vtu has 230 colleges right and
we did some polls we would ask a
question into a class how many of you
have heard about Coursera so it turns
out that eighty percent of the students
never heard about them and then in the
ask a question right how many of you
have ever watched an online education
video right I mean I actually I I had
the answer here all of you have have
taken I guess you've watched a mech
video but if I go to a an audience that
is not touched by our campaign it is
less than three percent so so we looked
at several things about the Indian
educational system particular thing that
we decided to focus on is that
universities like BTW you have a common
curriculum and that is spread across
hundreds of colleges vtu has 230
colleges in this state tamilnadu has
540 colleges and so on so one of the
things we decided was was why not
instead of making it as a separate thing
from your class which you know you all
mentioned to say that we already have a
lot of work in our classroom what what
what benefit am I going to get by doing
something else over and above what I
should already be doing so we decided
that instead of keeping it as in a
separate thing why don't be integrated
with your classroom and I don't think we
have we are fully successful in
integrating yet but I think we have gone
some ways from there we started which is
that one of the first things we decided
was that will at least sync the syllabus
that your college is following and we
will help you do what you're already
learning better and we we made a lot of
effort working the institution's your
teachers so that this is something that
works together with your institution
rather than replacing your classroom and
relying on individual motivation for you
did for you to make take advantages
right so I already said is even be we
tried to sync with your syllabus and in
addition to those kinds of things right
we you know Siddharth and others came up
with so many ways to get your attention
which was which is extremely important
you know they did media campaigns they
did competitions they did certificates
and and you know we did certain things
like you know we know that bandwidth is
low how do you address those kinds of
things and all of this was found by no
doing one deployment of the other after
the other talking to you finding out
what are your pain points and fixing
them that's how we made progress right
so since so that all already give you a
punt the punchline but let me give you a
little bit more details you know we have
been doing this for four semesters and I
mean what happened was that I mean the
social media one was done in the last
last one that's when we saw the bump of
75,000 but also our our software and our
platform evolved I mean it was very
experimental we put together something
real quick and then with every version
our software got better as well so so
those things also also helped okay so
now I will tell you about you know what
we learn from you Sociedad ask you lots
of questions like how many of you spend
you know time online what do you do and
so on let me ask you a question about
mech how many of you take all the mech
whizzes honest
and how many of you copy from your
friend like I see stunned silence yeah
I'm not going to take a picture right so
this is a very important question it's
an important question in online
environments you know how many people
achit and how many people coffee copy by
searching the web and so on so here is a
study we did with you so we divided I
mean some random population of the
100,000 people we have touched into
three parts one-third of the students
did not get any on record so they just
took the quizzes as it's one third of
them got this honor code it says you
know I promise not to visit other
websites and you have to fight it how
many of you remember doing this okay I
think you were there in the second one
time the third one third beast right the
scary we type right choice if you cheat
something bad is going to happen how
many of you remember that how many of
you remember typing that one touch me
okay so so then now you must be
wondering how the hell are these guys
going to figure out whether I cheat or
not let me tell you about that a little
bit later but let me tell you that the
first group which which in which we
didn't show you anything we find that
about a third of you cheated I you can
i'll ask you how would we figure out why
are you cheating on i'll ask you that
question as well and and and the
fraction of you that got the honor code
a little bit less and the one that got a
severe warning a lot less how do you
think we could do such a measurement yes
pardon do you think we come and ask you
a question did you cheat do you think
you'll answer yeah pardon cookies yes
I think we should give him a price yeah
so that's what we did yeah thank you so
we we you know see that the web with
actual answers and you know we put honey
pot websites and and if you click on
them you know you will get a timeout and
then the record your cookie and so
that's so if you get it out but we've
never released individual names we
release what these statistics so please
be assured not a problem all right yeah
okay so the other interesting thing
which you may already know is that we
also know the ones that cheated and the
ones that didn't how did they actually
perform and this is probably not
surprising to you write the ones that
studied you didn't have to cheat and you
got good scores the ones that right to
search the web a partly also because
there was a time out in the the website
so maybe you wasted time trying to find
an answer maybe you found it elsewhere
but that's that's the answer right so so
that was actually you know maybe
somewhat useful but let me tell you
something that's far more useful it's a
very important question for us to figure
out whether this kind of system has any
positive effect at all does it actually
improve learning that's an extremely
important question for us to find out
right so how would you measure that this
is actually a question for you suppose
you you know you are like us your
research as you're building these
systems and you have to find out right
mean you know Jeanette this year I have
to somehow communicated Jeanette that
this is having some value so one ways I
could bring all thousand of you into the
into the auditorium and ask you to clap
it could provide a value do you think
I'll convince her if I do that maybe
I'll give you a t-shirt at the end of it
you clap anyway I'm not so sure so so
how do you how would you measure how do
you measure with something like this has
had an effect or not what do you think
how would you measure Marlon
the after after you complete your work
right i can actually can actually check
how well you did right and see whether
you whether you did well or not right so
i can probably do the following right i
can actually take i can actually you
know maybe I you know we can talk to VT
you and then you can find out oh these
are the students that took mech and look
how well they did and these are the
students that didn't take mech and how
well they did do you think that's a
reasonable way to study whether it
worked or not why because you know the
ones that took back probably are already
motivated right that's why you took it
you if you are already smart right you
know it's like saying you know you know
we are we somehow fair in the way we do
comparison right in fact the the how
many of you have heard about these
things called randomized control trials
rcts very few people but up is this is
how you test if a you know something
somebody comes up with a drug for a for
a disease how do you know whether it
works right suppose you give it to you
know certain kind of people maybe it
works for them how do you know that
actually really works right so the way
you do randomized control trials is that
you need to take populations that are
identical in all aspects right so what
we have to do is that in the case of
something like an online education
system we have to find a population of
students that are identical in all
aspects in motivation in economic
background in the socio-economic
situation they are in the kind of
classroom they are in the kind of class
one day in and and then you'll be able
to divide you into half and a half and
on one half we have to administer the
drug which is Mac in this case and one
half year it is leave you alone and then
we have to give you an exam to find out
what what the relationship is and the
way in which we divide you into this
group has to be completely random that's
the only way in which the test would be
you know we would hold water do you
understand what I mean so this is what
we did what we did was we worked with
vtu and we found out several aggregate
past exam scores of colleges in the
state and we had a really good
relationship if they they were very
helpful in providing those course to us
not the names of students but with
anonymous anonymizing the names of
students so because of that we were able
to identify colleges we were able to
group colleges into colleges with
roughly similar capability based on
several years of pass course and then we
divided the college's into two halves at
random and one half of those colleges
got a dose of meg which is that we
actually hired a an intern which went
there and did like a teaching assistant
kind of thing when he was there with you
how many of you know what is the name of
the guy nitish right how many of you
know any dish okay at least he has come
to some of you right so so he he might
have seen him you know in your labs you
know playing videos and making sure you
watch these things and so on that's what
he did right so in half of them in a
half of half of you I mean you know
there's several people outside of this
room that participated in the experiment
as well right so and then we then we did
a measurement the measurement we did was
yeah so how did it work I said control
is the group that did not where we did
not go all out and push Mac and
intervention is the one in which we had
myth ish go and and actively promoted
and what we found was that there was is
a you know observable improvement in the
final exams course between the group
that got meg and the one today now he is
such a huge sigh of relief I think we
should give ourselves a huge hand first
and and we also did some statistics
about CSC versus IAC and we found that
the improvement that people had in CSC
in ISC was more than the improvement
people had in CSC and this tallies with
other studies that have been done we
know that when students get em door do
these colleges the first preference is
CSC so the people that do well in there
in there 12 standard and so on getting
to CSC and only after CC gets filled up
people go to ISE and I see students
apparently on an average or weaker and
and then they tended to do better with
the intervention the other thing that's
interesting is that if you look at
performance per question so y axis here
is the difference between the
intervention in the control which means
the difference is big which means that
neck made a big difference for these
questions so there are two questions
which made the most difference can you
guess what those questions what kind of
questions they wear maybe you remember
the exam what are these questions maybe
you don't remember so these questions
actually have prayer coding questions so
they were they were not things that you
could have memorized and written down
you have to actually use the concepts
and actually write some code and these
since we had so many lessons where you
know we made you go through these videos
we made you do quizzes and so on if you
went through them you had enough
training that you could do something
like this okay that's the other thing so
I won't hold you for very long so in in
in summary right we learned so many
things we learned that context matters
you know we have to think about your
syllabus bandwidth matters you know a
badness matters you know you need you
know somebody like Sadat spreading the
message that that this is a useful thing
to do things like certificates and other
incentives matter and from a research
perspective we can do several
interesting studies where we can really
evaluate whether these things work when
I didn't talk about some other things
that we have researchers that some of
the assignments you got they were
automatically generated by some
researchers that know how to do these
kinds of things and then it's it's a
very interesting question as to whether
we are being fair in the sense that no
are some problems more difficult than
the other problems even though we
automatically generate them so we we are
in the process of studying all of those
kinds of things right so I'm I'm
probably ahead of time but I don't have
anything more to say so I maybe I could
finish early so the the call for action
is that you know who we are so you know
tell your teachers to collaborate with
us tell your friends to collaborate with
us if you want to do experiments have
ideas come talk to us we can collaborate
and do them together
and Sid gave me a few more things to
tell you there's four courses already
there's a fifth one on linear algebra
that is going to come online and he has
seen has a lot more planning not no
plans on more fun things like contests
and quizzes that that that they would do
next semester the referral program is
going to be expanded we are
significantly thinking about faculty
participations if you are faculty member
you could come talk to us we have
several ideas on how to work with you
better and for more rewards it is also
going to give you more watch so i'll
close with that thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
