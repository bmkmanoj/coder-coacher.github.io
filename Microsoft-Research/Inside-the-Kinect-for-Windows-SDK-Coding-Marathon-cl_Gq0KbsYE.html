go all night if we need to and we're all
committed to that part of the code camp
was hey what can you come up in 24 hours
we could do this and this and this
they'll be lasers over here it'll be a
pit oh my gosh and then we know the
other guys help make it more realistic
as well we have shows tomorrow morning
we have a backup idea but our main idea
was we're calling it conductor hero
you've ever control the volume and the
style and the tempo of the music so the
project we're working on is a
visualization tool format hopefully
it'll work out and we'll have something
good for the demo tomorrow but we'll see
how that goes so don't want to do
something that's already been done
before the SDK the linking two images
linking to data linking to networking
the stuff that you can't do on an xbox
that's what we're hoping to take
advantage of improve the user challenge
for us really is designing a new gesture
system for us to control our drone it's
the wild race right now nobody really
knows what can be done with this will
have to think it differently obviously
right it's getting used to this idea
that the computer can also see you and
and I just want to keep playing with it
to see see what I can come up with I
mean things are changing it's getting
better getting all the little
coefficient so it doesn't go too fast
one way or too fast the other way we
have found that the SDK is very
developer friendly we have created a lot
of applications in a very short amount
of time there's so many ideas so many
like abstract goals in
it's that was like oh we could do have
it do this it enables new scenarios that
we haven't done before yeah it's really
cool all the hand gesture seemed worked
pretty well it's been great medic bunch
of great people through a project
together edit running in 1213 hours
tinkered with it played with it tuned it
