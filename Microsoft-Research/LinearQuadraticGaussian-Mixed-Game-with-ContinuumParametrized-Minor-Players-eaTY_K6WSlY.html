we'll just go ahead and get started it's
we're a little bit ten minutes overtime
so I guess everyone knows that you know
the nature of this little Saturday
workshop each fall is that each of the
consist constituent participating States
Oregon and you bc and universities in
Washington nominates a representative
and it's my pleasure to introduce the
representative from Oregon Sonny you and
the Sun is just joining us this fall
from the past two years as a postdoc in
at Carleton University in Ottawa and
he's now a postdoc at Oregon State
University and with that I give you and
well and who works in numerical methods
for stochastic differential equations
and optimization and control so some so
thank you for giving me an opportunity
to top in the seminar so I'm going to
talk about the linear quadratic Gaussian
mix game we'd continue parameterised
mine minor player this one is a John
work with dr. Huang in Carter diversity
so I'm going to talk about the midfield
dynamic games model home so this model
will contains to kaiser players so major
players we have a strong influence to
other players and the minor players have
some weaker influence to other players
so here's the contents of of my talk so
this talk is related to the stochastic
game with last number of weekly
iterating players and it is motivated
from the complex system arising in
engineering and psycho economics
problems for example in Destry dynamics
with many firms or wireless network
resource management
or arm surface hurting receiving
individual radiation risks by joining
the group so so we can see these
pictures so fish are join a group to
produce the pricks from predators so
these pictures are taken from the
National Geographic so for this on cayo
system there are two key features the
first one is that each arm asian only
receive or negligible influence from
other in which individual and the effect
of the overall population is significant
to each agent and because the number of
the player has very large so we cannot
expect that the ex player can collect
the state information of all other
players so for the control problem we
want to develop a low-complexity
solutions that explain just need to use
its own state information so the skype
status see is ghazals decentralized
Chatterjee so the color class the games
we consider here involve a major player
and a last member minor player so minor
player has a significant role in
affecting others and minor players have
weaker influence and the minor players
are parameterize by continuum parameter
so this result is motivated by societal
economic problems so it describes the
interaction with one or more or less
corporations and many smaller
competitors so the objective of my talk
is to these assigns the decent
decentralized strategies and establish
and asked sympathetic Nash equilibrium
property so the method
are to be use is some backwards ste by
course stochastic differential equation
so let's consider the dynamics of the
players so the dynamics of the moisture
player is described by a linear
stochastic difference equation legatees
and the second equation is a dynamic sup
of Representative a minor player so X n
stands for the average state of minor
players so it is average space of X so
we want a sub N and uses not and you I
here are controls and the minor players
are parameterize buys smoke parameters
theta sub I and we assume that the
Brownian motions w snot and wi are
independent standard Brownian motion and
the matrix a B and F and D are
continuous a constant matrix and have
compatible dimensions so the cost for
the miser player have the quadratic form
and the cost of the minor player have
sees this form with some mythical
coupling term so X and he is stem for
the mean-field term and so if you
appearance of except zero in the cost of
the minor player shows us the strongly
flow in the symptom major player to the
minor players so for the game problems
with has a number of players so this
centralizes epsilon Nash equilibrium was
considered by huang pure canes and
muhammad in serious of paper and forth
so this census the centralized control
for last population stochastic our
multi-agent system was considered by lee
and then in 2008 and me feel lik
equilibrium a condition for nonlinear
system was considered by lastly and
lions in 2016 2007 and the application
for mockup effects industry dynamics
with many films was considered by when
chopped so more related to our talk the
case that's a perimeter set data when
the set is finite then the problem was
considered by one in 2010 and in this
paper you use some mock of state speed
augmentation approach so say he a greek
gates own parameters horns are all
equals parameters in the same set so so
the system is reduced to finite
dimension problems so in our case when
the permit assess is in finite then it
is not applicable so we directly chased
the midfield process as a random process
and we use a bike was SD SD approached
by this mode and the model of a little
of moisture minor players who was
considered by young in 2002 is easter
motor up leader and follower players and
we also use a maximum principal ste so
another kya maximum principle for me few
problems was considered by understand
and on giochi in 2010
so we assume that the initial state X
sub say zero are independent and have
uniformly bout it second moment and the
joy and empirical distribution of the
parameter and the expectation of the
initial states converts quickly to some
distribution and we assume that sub sub
matrix a BF and d are continuous
functions for a with respect to theta
and the comp parameter set theta is a
compact set in D dimensional space so
when n stands what's the number of the
player tends to infinity then the
midfield term tends to stochastic
process and based on the linear property
of the equations observe player then we
assume that the limit has this form here
f1 f2 and GSD are deterministic function
and this function will be determined
later and after we approximate submit
filter by a stochastic process Z then we
get a limiting problem so you get a
limiting problem for the major player so
in here submit view term is replaced by
a stochastic process so we get a
stochastic concern problem with a random
coefficient D so using the method by
bismuth in 2019 76 we can solve this
optimal control problem and we can show
that the optimal control for the
limiting a problem has this form u bar
not have this form
this controller on depends on the state
of the major player and another process
a new sub 0 and new sub 0 is a
stochastic process and it is a unique
solution to a given forward backwards
sde and it's the matrix P dot T here is
the solution of the riccati equation and
now we apply that optimal control and we
want to show that the optimal dynamics
have this form so this form is similar
tools of the form of the process Z we
said three coefficient functions so
so first function f naught f Agnes 1 is
a function of function function f1
everything so that the second
coefficient F X naught bar 2 is a
function of F 2 and the last function G
of X naught bar is functional up g and
we can compute this operator directly
and here the kind of fees sub 0 is a
unique solution of a given of the system
so we can compute to dynamics up the
mess up the optimal dynamics of major
player there explicitly so after we can
solve the limiting for the problem for
the major player we can apply the
optimal dynamics and the process Z to
obtain the optimal limiting optimal
concern for the minor player so in
here's a midfield term is free placed by
the stochastic process see and is a cost
function except zero is replaced by
optimal dynamics X nachbar and Lance
samee few term here is replaced by Z so
we get another ultima cancion problem
with random coefficient Z and X not bar
so by similar way we we can solve that
problem and get the optimal control of
UI bar in this form and UI bar still
depends on the state of the ocean I and
it also depends on another stochastic
process but this stochastic process
is known and we can represent the
optimal dynamics for the ocean I in this
form so the difference here is that the
dynamics of the eyes and I also depends
on the Brownian motion WI and also
depends on the initial state up so I
should I and the co-efficient functions
can be computed by similar way so the
first coefficient function is a function
of F 1 the second coefficient function
is function of f 2 and the colonel jay
here is the function of Z and the third
function here and the last kernel can be
computed directly and here Phi is a
solution upon audio system and all of
these coefficient functions are linear a
continuous function so after we solve
the limiting control problems we can we
can obtain the optimal dynamics for them
minor player and we need we have a
consistency condition so Z Z of T should
be the limit when n tends to infinity of
1 of n of the ultimate that states
dynamic states and by the formula for
the dynamics up so the ultimate control
for minor player we could get the second
equation so based on this equation we
can we can buy the process Z so we
denote the operator gamma 1 equals the
average gamma theta one with the
distribution theta and plus another term
and come the function
gamma to have this form and the
functional grammas three I'm sorry um
lambda is a ratio lambda theta then the
chief of function f1 f2 Z should be the
solution of this system of equations so
we cause the count this solution of this
system the consistent solution to the
nastic certainty equivalent equation
system and under milk on a Simpson we
can show that this system has a unique
solution f1 f2 G so where you can solve
this system we can obtain the
approximation fault for the midfield
process now we can apply the mean field
approximation to the finite system with
our last number of minor player so we
are seeing that how so we defy the
ultimate control for for the finite
system by this formula it is similar to
to the control of limiting problems but
a different here is that we only have
finite number of minor player so each
player can use the information from its
own state and the major players Brownian
motion and after this controls law are
applied and we get the dynamics for the
major player and minor players and we
get a milfy of here
and we can estimate the difference
between the approximation process ziti
and the mean field from the that's a
finite finite minor player so it is this
difference tends to 0 when n tends to
infinity and we can show that the set of
control you had J has a epsilon
asymptotic Nash equilibrium property so
it means that the cost function for for
the shade player if we change if we
change the control of the J's player
then this the infimum of the cost
functions afford a player is between the
optimal control for the limiting
problems and this arrow should be
epsilon and epsilon is tense is very
close to 0 it tends to 0 when the number
of the player tends to infinity so let's
consider a scalar model so we consider a
scalar model for any player with certain
coefficients here here we consider the
dynamics for the major player by this
equation and the question for the minor
players by this equation and we don't
put the Semitic term is that dynamics
types of players and we assume that the
permit parametrics set of the major
player is from native one to one and I I
years has a uniform distribution on
native one to one so we can compute we
assume that the cost function of the
major player and the minor player by
this formula and we can compute directly
the approximation of the material
process so we can computer f1 and f2 by
numerical method and here's a colonel
jay and we can obtain the mid field
approximation so when we can solve this
one we can construct the decentralized
strategy for X player so for the case
that the perimeter set is if a nice set
then the mark of state augmentation
cannot be applied and we can decide in
the strategy based on the functional
space and we can solve the system of
deterministic equations so it is
completed computationally efficient so
next are we we consider a midfield model
with a stronger influence of the major
player we consider the dynamics of the
major player and the minor player which
the stronger influence of the major
player so the appearance of the major
player in the dynamics of the minor
players shows a stronger confluence of
the major player and in this case we
assume that a V F and G and D are fixed
matrix and it doesn't depends on
parameters so in this caper problem ISM
is complicated more complicated in the
sense that if we change
if you change the control of the major
player a little bit to u naught plus
Delta u then it we dynamics of such a
major player will change Delta X naught
and because of appearance of the major
player in the dynamics of the minor
player then the state of them minor
players will change Delta X I and
because all minor players will be
changed so it costs a change in the
midfield term so when n tends to
infinity we approximate the milton by Z
but now it's more complicated when you
is change by the data you then xeler x0
owns also change and the material change
and it is still described by this system
so to solve this problem we need of more
flexible definition for the control
problem so we say that X naught X naught
by you not bar an equilibrium solution
for with respect to a process g-star if
we have this inequality here is not
passed it satisfies the dynamics
equation and the cost function for you
nachbar is smaller than any other
verizon variations of you not bar and
the equations of the variations is is
given in this equation and the cost
function needs the same as the cost
function in the first part so we can buy
this way week we can also construct
limiting problems limiting control
problems with
the same limiting process z bar and we
need to find we want to file a
equilibrium solution X naught by unit
but with respect to Z bar and when we
can solve this problem we can construct
the limiting cultural problem for the
minor player and for the minor player we
have X naught bar is sub-optimal
dynamics from the first problem and diva
is given here so by the same way we can
have this representation of the X naught
bar it's not by also have this form
where accident where the first function
is a function of f 1 and the second
function is functional F F F 2 and the
last function is a function of the J and
similarly the dynamics of the minor
player also have this representation and
the first coefficient function of some
minor player also is a functional of f1
+ the second function is a function of F
2 and the fourth kano here is a function
of G and third function and the last
kind of can be given explicitly by this
function so again we let average the
state of all miners players and we get
another equation 2 to obtain the
limiting process Z and we obtain a fixed
point operator and from that we can
solve for for the limiting midfields
process and then we can proceed
similarly and we can opt a tan epsilon
Nash equilibrium property and we can
estimate the performance of the of
approximation so so so this method
reduce the competition into the
deterministic function space and for
certain problems we can compute directly
by numerical method so so thank you for
your attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
