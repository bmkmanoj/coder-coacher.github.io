engineer next I'm going to show you the
research project we touch in this
project we use a kinect sensor to make
the interaction on the touch board go
beyond touch connect know a lot about
users for example how far I am from the
board now why I'm approaching the board
the system automatically dims the
display to make me comfortable can I
also know my position if I raise my arm
the menu shows here i am moving on the
manual will follows me this is important
for interaction on this large display
otherwise it's difficult for users to
reach the UI element on the far side
next I'm going to show you another in
place UI element for example if I want
type on the sport I just need to show
this typing gesture I can type this is
go and pull over here connect also can
distinguish my left hand and right hand
left and right if I want to change the
color open the pub bring the color
palette I choose the eraser for the left
green color for the right black for the
pan now let me erase this too and write
V touch connect also can distinguish
different users next I'm going to give
the display to my colleague the channel
so the system knows I'm different user
from the impound so you can hear you can
see that I'm now I'm use it to you now i
also want to write on the board so if i
want to change my color scheme I got
over my palm I do this the palm shows up
so now I used to erase them with my
right hand so I'm going to push out this
I'm going to your choose pen color of
blue let you saw
and yellow so now if i write with my
left hand it was the yellow color if i
write them as my my pen it's going to be
a blue but if i use am a writer finger
of course it's going to raise some of
the content now i returned to the board
system recognize em user one and
remember my selections so my right hand
it's green and pan it's black next I'm
going to show you when user is further
away from the board they can still
interact with the board using gestures
for example pointing if you show the
power of fist nothing there until you go
back to the pointing gesture of course
we can do to hand this V touch project
makes the interaction with the dashboard
more powerful retouch better touch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
