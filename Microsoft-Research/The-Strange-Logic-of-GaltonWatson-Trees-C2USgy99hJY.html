you
alright uh thank you for coming to the
MSR colloquium it's my job to introduce
Joel Spencer I don't know what to say
there's so many people in this room who
know Joel well I'm just gonna start with
a personal reminiscence so 2003 summer
I've just started an internship at
Microsoft Research is my first ever
experience with this group one or two
weeks into the internship Joel visits
and just drops by my office one day and
says hi I'm Joe Spencer do you want to
chat and you know my jaw dropped I of
course knew of him his book on the
probabilistic method is a Bible for me
and anyone else in my generation who
developed an interest in discrete math
and I was so flabbergasted that this
famous mathematician would want to come
in and talk to me we had a fantastic
conversation has been fantastic talking
to him every time he visited the lab
since then when I was around we'd love
to have you all visits and I hope that
you'll keep coming back many many times
and years to come great thank you thank
you Joe just promise me he'll is it for
sometime in the fall yes yes yes so the
golden watson process is a very vital
mathematical process but it was
certainly controversial for its
sociology right from the beginning some
of you may know Peter jaegers who's a
distinguished statistician at Guttenberg
and also fairly political and he
actually looked into a lot of the
history in this talk will just talk
about the mathematics but you know
galten and Watson here they are you know
looking looking appropriate for their
age and and I was talking to Mary grey
about this to get the sociologists
perspective and we came to an agreement
that the word misogyny would not
accurately reflect gulfton and Watson
because in the golfin Watson process
there are no females whatsoever so one
has to invent a new sociological term
for a society not that's against females
but has a total absence of the maybe it
was called Cambridge it a good name so
it has an interesting and controversial
history but it certainly is some
beautiful mathematics now the golf team
Watson process can be over any
distribution but I'm going to be talking
about the Poisson distribution because
here's the formal definition but the the
real key thing that makes the Poisson
nice so since this was golfin and Watson
I changed Adam to Eve you might notice
that that if if you have plus on mean
lambda children and each child is of
type j with probability P sub J then
that's the same thing exact not as
Impala CLE that's exactly the same thing
as saying that the number of children of
type j is poss on with mean piece of j
lambda and that those number of children
is independent so if you're going to
have a plus on five children and each
one is male or female with probability
point five then that's exactly the same
as having + on 2.5 male children and
plus on 2.5 female children and that
property plays a nice role although we
want to look at other other
distributions which is work in progress
and here i should make sure i add that
this is with my graduate student Lou
Monte Potter at the courant institute
and time for an advertisement so thank
you for the kind we
words about the probabilistic method but
please throw out your old copy because
all the really good stuff is in the
fourth edition and so and it's coming
out Eddie any day now any day now they
said december so we're all excited about
it and yeah that was i was a yeah that
was a deliberate a deliberate choice
that's right yeah ok so this is the
golfing Watson process which many of you
are familiar with it the eve has a
Poisson mean lambda children and then
all its children have children with the
same distribution then you have
grandchildren and great-grandchildren
and it may go on forever or may be
finite and that distinction becomes
quite important ok and in analysis
analyzing things this is something I
like as a general thing in analyzing
random structures I like to to
pre-process the randomness and this i
like to call fictitious continuation but
you thought about the way to analyze it
you let X sub I be your probability
spaces that x 0 x is Poisson lambda
independent appendant for i equal for
all positive integers I and then you say
that the i'th node has XO by children so
for example if you have the following
string and Eve has two children anna has
no children Barbara has one child carol
has no childhood and at that point the
process stop there there there no more
children but the fictitious continuation
is that it continues with Danielle
having three children Florence Gabriel
Harriet that didn't actually happen but
it this is very helpful for the analysis
and there's a general point about random
structures I find that analyzing random
structures and we had this conversation
that it's very helpful to pre-process
the randomness in someone
otherwise you get into all sorts of
problems about conditional conditioning
on the past and this helps to avoid it
so just the general comment about that
all right let's take an example of a
property that some node has exactly one
child with one child maybe we can call
this the old China property since China
has now changed its policy but this is
the so let's call this the old child old
China policy and how do we analyze it
well the way I want to do it is I want
to have a finite phase space Green for
yes read from no and yellow well we'll
see and when I count I'm only going to
count 0 1 and Omega where Omega stands
for any number bigger than or equal to 2
and I'm going to call a node green if
when you look at that node and downward
that is the tree generated by that node
of course trees have this recursive
nature which is so central when you look
at the node and go downward that there
will be some node in that tree that has
exactly one child with exactly one child
so then you call the node green um I'll
call the node yellow is a kind of an
intermediate step if if so V is labeled
yellow if V has exactly one child but
it's not labeled green and otherwise
it's labeled red and now what I want to
say is that if you want the state of a
node you just look at the states of its
children and the states of its children
determine the states of it snowed and
furthermore in counting how many green
yellow and red you have you don't have
to count past one the counts are either
0 1 or Omega me so it doesn't matter
whether you have six yellows or 11
yellows that's counted as the same and
you can determine the rules so just
briefly if you have a green
tile then you're definitely green and in
fact if you have many green children
you're definitely green but what happens
is if you have exactly one child which
is yellow but that point had exactly one
child so that means you're agreeing and
if you had exactly one node which was
red then your yellow because you have
exactly one child and and and otherwise
your red I mean you can work them all
out okay lot see exactly one child oh so
the state of a node is you look at the
tree starting from that node going down
yeah so so you haven't some tree for
each vertex I'm going to in the tree I'm
going to give it red yellow or green but
I'm going to just look at the subtree
generated by it and and and these are
the rules well I'll call it green yellow
or red in these three cases and now what
we do that's that's yellow no it has one
child there is one rich there's zero
green children 0 yellow children and one
red child right yeah these are in order
these are that's why that's why they're
color coded yeah there that says this
means 0 green children 0 yellow children
and one red child then your yellow
you're not green but but but you are
yellow because you've had just one child
so all right I mean you look at this and
you come up with these rules once you
have this this this situation which
we're going to generalize then you can
get a system of equations you let x y&amp;amp;z
be the probability that the random tree
is going to have its root the state of a
tree is the state of its root node is
going to be yellow green
yellow or red so you really have just
two variables because the it's a
distribution two independent variables
and what you see is you get some
equations the probability of being green
is well well let's let's do yellow the
prop the only way to be yellow is if you
have zero green zero yellow and one red
but remember the number of green is poss
on is plus on lambda X and the number of
yellow is plus on lambda Y and the
number of red is plus on lambda Z so the
chance that you have zero green is e to
the minus lambda X the probability of
having zero yellow is e to the minus
lambda Y and the probability of having
one red is lambda z e to the minus
lambda Z when you do the mathematics you
get this equation for x it's a little
bit more complicated because you have
all these things but you get an equation
for the distribution in terms of the
distribution okay and it turns out and
this is one of our early examples that
you can now solve this and and you get
in a nice salute it's implicit but still
it's a it's a solution and you get a
unique solution which is going to be
really important and here's actually the
graph although this is the probability
this is one minus so this is the
probability that you have no node that
has exactly one child with exactly one
child and we can get this analytically
from the solution to to those to the
previous equations what time so take
some analysis but but you know we're all
good at math here so we can you believe
in we can do that well my grad student
said in pencils now let's look at
immortality which is the classic thing
that that golfin and watson were so
upset with the possibility that the the
noble classes were going to disappear
that was their objective of study and
this is really classical stuff now
there's just two states yes and no and
the count is either zero or non zero so
so many is one or more and now if you
have any green children your green but
any is many I mean because omegas is one
or more so if you have any green
children your green so if you have a
node it has you know if you have let's
get biblical about this you know if you
have Kane and Kane has an infinite
number of children then then adam has an
infinite number of children I would do
it with Eve but I don't know about the
female the female children seem to have
disappeared from the Bible so I I a
different number of the descendents
exactly right infinite number of
descendants yeah what were the daughters
of Adam and Eve maybe they didn't have
any it was mystery this on Santa charges
the Muslim it must be the solution I
think that that's the only possible
solution I could come up at least but i
don't know i always i fail to knock so
what can i hmm yes ya the monkey trials
yeah Clarence Darrow makes a great
speech in that movie about Cain's wife
and where the heck did she come from I
knew I wasn't clever enough to think of
it myself ok so here this is very
classical stuff you get you get an
equation I'm you only have one variable
because if the distributions on two
points you know it's a distribution so
there's only one variable X and you get
this classical equation x equals one
minus e to the minus X lambda but
something funny happens here there are
two solutions to this equation there are
two solutions to this equation and here
they are
I mean when lambda is less than one the
only solution is zero so again there's
some nice stuff for a good first year
calculus student to do this up and you
find that for lambda greater than one
there are two solutions one is zero
which means that the processes is the
probability of immortality is zero so
the noble families are doomed and and
the other is this positive number and
one can prove in this particular case
that the correct answer is the positive
number again this is classical stuff on
and really today i want to say let's not
look at this as some anomaly but let's
look at the question when you get these
systems of equations when do you have
just one solution and when do you have
several solutions and if you have
several solutions which is the actual
answer to the to the question that that
you're looking at so let me give another
example I have to thank my daughter for
coming up with the title of it so let's
imagine the so maybe this is the Korean
yeah right maybe this is the the Korean
method because I just read an article
that this is South Korea actually that
South Korea is very upset that their
their birthrate is now 1.2 well of
course now we have two genders but in
this model it would be 0 point six okay
so so and and and they're trying to do
something about it well one suggestion
would be a draconian fecundity which is
that if you only have 0 or 1 children
child you're killed okay I mean this was
yalls mode for hahaha
but it turns out that having three is
may not be sufficient because what just
keep it I am NOT boys are you for it
because what happens is if your children
if your children don't have enough
children then they get killed and if
you're left with less than 0 or 1 living
children then your kilt all right so so
this is the model yeah I'm not limiting
myself but i will be talking specific
yeah these are not but but that's right
so right now i'm looking at several
properties i will be specifically
talking about first order but i won't be
limiting myself to first order but good
point so here on another way we don't
have to put UIL on them yeah we could
say that the property is that the tree
contains in it an infinite binary tree
this is subset where the route has two
children both of which have two children
you know racing the other children both
of which have two children and so on on
forever and that's the same thing all
right that's the same thing so we we
don't have to do it by cutting things
off we could but anyway when you do this
you get the same thing again yes or no
now the count is 0-1 or Omega if you
have and green is yes no red is no if
you have Omega meaning at least two
green children than your green and if
you have one or zero then your red okay
it doesn't matter how many red children
you have because they're going to get
killed so so they won't count so so we
get this set and we get X and we get
this nice equation for x and now we do
some beautiful calculus and really great
stuff I mean you know when I say it's
great for
first-year student what that really
means is try it yourself it's it's
really fun thing to try and analyze what
this equation has and now to say the
special buzzword I didn't just say this
because Christian and Jennifer are in
the audience but what we get is a first
order phase transition yes here it is
the when we look at the solutions we
always to this equation we always have
the solution zero but when we reach a
critical point which is a I mean it can
be given an exact value what happens is
passed the critical point we get to
other solutions to other solutions and
it turns out that the actual answer the
actual probability is the green line
until you get to the critical point and
then what color is that supposed to be
oh no this is the purple line and then
the the green line yeah and that turns
out to be the actual thing but you don't
see it from the analysis you don't see
that so these are the three examples in
one everything is not only continuous
but it's it's all the derivatives are
continuous in the case of being infinite
you have two solutions and the actual
answer is while it's continuous its non
differentiable and and in joco nian
fecundity once you get past this
critical lambda critical you have three
solutions and then the actual answer is
discontinuous at the critical point so I
mean that's really an important thing
when you have when when you're going to
have which which one okay all right now
you asked for the first order world so
now here's so I want to look now at
properties involving the first order
world in the first order world you can
only talk about nodes and you can use
Universal or existential quantification
over nodes but
only knows you can't use quantification
over sets and your sentences have to be
a finite sentences so I think this one
is that so and I pi is the parent
relationship that the exes child is why
and Z's child is what yeah and and and
furthermore when you want to say exactly
one you can always put exactly one into
the first order system so this is the
example of the the China old China one
can be written in first daughter and a
key thing in first order is what's
called the quantifier depth which is you
have these existential quantifiers and
you look at how much they're nested so
if you say for all X there exists Y and
for all Z there exists w that's only a
nesting of two so quantified depth is
how deep the next and goes and that
turns out to be a key variable in in in
studying the first-order world no it's
not that's a very good point in fact the
alternations are something we're
studying that so it's just the nesting
so if you say for all X for all Y for
all Z for all W followed by a boolean
thing that's a nesting of four yeah so
what happens is expression which
involves data not so for ya then it
would be you'd add them all up yeah it's
a total number of quantifiers it's also
appearing directly behind each other
they don't have to appear directly but
they have to be inside what's called the
scope there was if you imagine when you
say for all X you dad a big parenthesis
that came after it then yeah so it
doesn't have to appear directly after it
but it has to be
question by just putting all first order
senses in normal forme we could but I'd
rather you could do I mean there's a lot
of tricks to you for us like as long as
it's a constant as it mattered was sorry
we matter for us exactly how we count it
like after factotums Oh etc I'm doing it
with the car and the quantifier depth is
a standard there's a standard thing so
yeah it's not consecutive but it's
inside the nesting you know that so you
know for all X blah blah blah blah there
exists Y but the exists Y depends on the
X then okay so it turns out that so this
is again some standard stuff that if you
fix the quantifier depth there is only a
finite number of first order statements
this is not at all obvious because you
can write statements of arbitrary length
but up to tautology there only a finite
number of statements and and this is a
deep theorem and the and the number is
actually at our function of K so it's
it's it takes some doing but but let me
just state that now what what happens is
that in the first order world locality
plays a key thing let me define the
radius R ad to be four to the K though
that's not the that could be a little
bit lower but it doesn't matter let me
define it for okay and now if you look
at a point in the tree you look at its
all of radius of 4 to the K and that
structure even though they're an
infinite number of possible such
structures because there's no limit on
the number of children they're only a
finite number of types so k is fixed so
they're only a so this finiteness
is rather critical that that they fall
into a finite number of types
Oh tide means they're the depth k
sentences exactly yeah so let me let me
repeat what Bobby said two things are
the same type if they satisfy exactly
the same depth k sentences exactly the
same depth k sentences and the very
strong basic result is there only a
finite number of types which follows
four in fact that up to tautology there
only a finite number of sentences but
all of that you know I'm not going to
give the proof of that but it's it and
now what happens yeah yeah just say that
a ball of a given radius satisfy the
senses yeah different from saying that
the entire tree right I'm just looking
at the ball yeah actually to be
technical I'm looking at the ball with
the center is a designated point which I
left out but ok so the sentence well you
look at you know the leaves of the ball
yes yeah that's right change when you
consider right yeah that's true I don't
mind that all of that's true yeah
although it's true and now what happens
is upward to know up downward and upward
and it's important that it be down
loaded up and now what happens is that
suppose you want the tree and and and
you want to know what class is it in
this theorem says that under these
conditions let me come back to it all
you have to do is look at the ball
around the root now what are the
conditions the conditions are that
pretty much any local event does occur
and that but it's a little bit technical
but but so there's some technical things
here that basically and not only does it
occur it occurs k times so some
technical things that is every if you
think of the types of the balls suppose
that that a tree suppose you know that
every type does occur in fact it occurs
k times then the own then the only thing
that that determines the
type of the whole tree is what's
happening near the root see the route
might have two children are three
children and then it would be different
so you can't say that you totally know
things just from the types from the
neighborhood's yeah yeah yeah oh yeah
two points or a distance one if they're
an apparent it's not directed the points
are the nodes of the tree yeah the nodes
of the tree and so you leave out the
direction you define a graph by saying x
and y or adjacent if X is the parent of
Y or Y is the parent of X so then the
ball so yeah so the ball of radius for
includes the cousins okay so that's yeah
these are good good questions and so
with some technical things what happens
with the locality is that if the tree
has the property that every type appears
in the tree lots of times then the type
of the tree only depends on the root and
sort of it has to like I said it has to
depend on the roof as if the route one
tree has two children because the root
is a designated point so you can make
the statement that the route has exactly
two children so but that's all you can
do once you have the locality so we're
going to have that and when we put this
together what we get is universality
that is again depending on k there's
some fixed tree let me call it
some fixed tree so that if you take let
me not call it t though i'll call it you
all right so that if you have any tree
and and somewhere in it it's got this
universal thing then its type only
depends on what's near the root only
depends on what's new and the reason is
that this universal tree already has
inside it it's like a creek I call it
the Christmas tree theorem because the
universal tree is designed to have every
ball of radius R inside the universal
tree and yet it's still finite and yet
is still find it um now okay now let me
switch to to try and generalized for a
moment let's the examples we've had
before and this is something called tree
automata that's been studied before but
not as far as I can see with respect to
probability so this is just meant to
generalize the three examples we've had
before we have a finite state space
Sigma we have a set of accepted States
so this is following the theory of
finite state automata if you're familiar
with that and the key thing is that the
state the state of a vertex means it's
really the state of the tree rooted at
that vertex and there's a constant K so
that everything that scarab of is
regarded as the same number as many and
then the key thing is that in a tree
automata and sort of previous things
were examples the state of a node is
determined by how many of its children
are of each state and where by number I
mean k or more counts is the same and
then we call the process recursive if it
holds if and only if the root has one of
the accepted States so the three
examples I've given our examples of
recursive properties
is you can define a finite state space
you can define this case or this notion
of many so that the state and then you
in our case is accepted was just scream
it doesn't have to be and and and and
you have this yeah find this what's
increase yeah define a specific to a
particular defined by cylinder Benzes
yes yeah why is it clear that your
finite state it's not clear no it's not
clear i'm going to say suppose you have
a finite state space and then and then
go on yeah yeah i'm going to look at
examples where you do have a
representation by fine I mean you could
make up other properties that don't but
but these are like I'm going to restrict
really to that so and a theorem which is
a nice theorem in logic is that if you
have a first-order statement that these
are recursive and the state space is the
possible Aaron Foyt classes and there's
a proof involving the errand boy game
but let me not that would take me too
far down another Road so let me just
State this as a result that if you have
a node and you look at its children and
each child generates its own tree and
this tree ah has a state namely its
state is it's two things have the same
state if they have the same truth value
on all quantifier k quantifier depth
case statements and so there's only a
finite number of states if you know the
states maybe this one doesn't have any
children maybe this one has the same one
is this
and maybe this if you know for each of
the children of the node what the state
is and furthermore the numbering is such
that if they're more than a que of a
particular state you don't care that
they're you just know that they're more
than K it doesn't matter then from that
one can deduce so I'll just State this
when we can deduce the state of the
whole tree so this is a nice logic
theorem and and the proof uses a proof
we have uses android games but but it
would take some getting into okay what
happens is though that first order is
not the only thing if we look at my
natick second order properties these are
also recursive now what is mine attic
second order me a magnetic second order
you are allowed to quantify over sets of
vertices so again it's you you have a
universal and existential quantification
but you're allowed to say there exists a
set s so if you want to say that the
tree is infinite you can say there
exists a set s the root is in the set s
and for every X in s there's a y + S
which is a child of X and sorry you can
say that there are two kids and then you
get the property that you mentioned
before exactly exactly so all these
examples that we've had have been man
attic second order and so there's a nice
connection that the monadic second order
properties are recursive properties in
fact it goes the other way so we have
this nice connection between the logic
of what's called monadic second-order
logic and these recursive properties
which are more combinatorial in in
nature now yeah it is but yes yes yeah
it is yes
you could look at arbitrary grass but
i'm not sure what the results would be i
don't know i would just looked at it
trees have this nice recursive property
that the that you know you have a root
node and then each child forms a tree
and they're just joined from each other
and that seems to be central but i don't
know maybe there are other ways to do it
I don't I'm restricting two trees okay
there's a good question but the answer
is absolutely absolutely yeah and I
don't know the answer to that I'm
restricting two trees here yeah yeah no
good quite I don't know okay so when we
get these equations we're going to get a
solution which may regarded since we
have all these economists around here is
a fixed point so how do we do that we
look at the set of distributions just
maybe not some maybe not so many yeah so
so what do we mean by a fixed point
where that's true that's true that's
true so we're looking at the set of
distributions now this is a finite
dimensional space so so we're looking at
this so this is a nice compact set a set
of distributions over the finite set and
I want to map distributions to
distributions so I'll just say this take
a point V let it have paws on mean land
the children give each of those children
a state with the distribution X those
states then which is because of plus on
we can do it in this nice way in terms
of calculation and the states are the
children then determine the state of V
and so that defines a distribution on on
V so the distribution on the children
defines the distribution on the parent
and so
have a map from distributions to
distributions if we have a distribution
over the states of the children then we
have a distribution on the on the parent
and what we're looking for is the fixed
point that's the equation that we've had
can be expressed I mean we did it with
variables x and y but we're now we're
just using vectors this is just the
fixed point of this map size of lambda
well we're able to get a lot of theorems
here that I'll be able to state one is
we can show that size of lambda is a
contracting map on the set of
distributions so in particular that
means it has a unique fixed point it has
a unique fixed point but this is when
one a is a after a 1 a is not a
first-order property we have examples
where there's more than one solution
we've had examples where there were two
solutions and three solutions but when
it's first order we have a contracting
map and that means that the fixed point
is unique and furthermore this is the
result I like best is that when you look
at the probability of a first-order
event in the Poisson tree and you look
at it as a function of lambda it's real
analytic everything is nice about it all
of its different all of its derivatives
exist ok so so I mean we've seen three
examples one that was real analytic the
the second which was non differentiable
at the critical point and the third one
the first order was was was
non-continuous at the critical point but
what this says is that if you have a
first-order property then none of those
bad things happen and indeed the soon as
a function of lambda it's a real
analytic function it's given implicitly
is the solution to these equations
rather than explicitly
but still it's a it's it's a
well-defined function a further thing is
that if you condition on the tree being
infinite then things are particularly
nice because whatever statement a you
have it only depends on another
statement called a tilde that involves
the neighborhood of the route that
involves the neighborhood of the root
and that follows from those general
statements let me I won't go into the
technical stuff about it but I want to
give this definition which i think i
like very much so so the T sub lambda
are given by this fictitious
continuation and there's a nice notation
by Don Knuth that never really caught on
many of us did but this one didn't and I
think it should especially for people
nowadays let's call something quite
surely if its failure probability drops
exponentially and he actually put this
out generations ago and it never caught
on but I think nowadays we're very often
thinking about things that are that
happened quite surely well there has to
be a yeah I mean there has to be an
index there has to be an index here I
mean I so I mean you have some kind of
index and you say that something occurs
quite surely in the index s if the
probability that it doesn't occur is
dropping exponentially in s and as we
now I think most of us have dealt with
things that occur quite surely so I I'd
like to resurrect this notation and now
the the following thing I want to call
it properly rapidly determined if quite
surely the first s values taught
illogically determine whether the
statement is true there's an interesting
connection combination here it's quite
surely absolutely surely determined I'm
not saying it's absolutely surely true
or false but it's absolutely surely so
yes yeah maybe that was in the back of
my mind either exactly right yeah that's
it yeah that would that would be that
that's right so we call something
rapidly determined if it has this
property and what happens is that the
first order a are rapidly determined
which i think is interesting in its own
right and just to quickly go through hmm
right sorry let me get back first year
so why in your example with the drunk
lunatic MTG what what was that noted for
solar property well sorry say again so
you you should an example with draconian
fecundity yeah why was that not a
versatile property well just not i mean
i can prove it's not but but the
statement of it was that there exists is
set where everything has two children so
that you're saying there exists is set
in first order you're only allowed to
say there exists a vertex so so the way
you'd like to say it is there exists a
set of vertices in which each node has
two children but in first-order you're
not allowed to say there exists a set
okay is that yeah and one can actually
prove that it can't be done in first
order as a matter of fact one proof that
it can't be done is from this theorem
because we proved that the function is
nice and this one doesn't have a nice
roof a nice so what we can actually show
is that the first order are rapidly
determined but let me skip over some of
the technical things here because I want
to finish up with some things on second
order so what one can show through some
technical things is that in the first
order one gets a contraction map and it
takes some but it's based on the
locality but still it as you can see
it's not it's not a one minute argument
but they're there
some stuff so let me jump ahead to what
happens if you condition on the tree
being infinite and now there's a very
nice theory that Monty has worked out in
great detail which is that if you ask
for what is the almost sure theory that
is what can you say about the statements
that hold with probability 1
conditioning on the tree being infinite
well for each tree for every tree with
probability 1 that tree is a sub tree if
the tree is going to be if we know it's
infinite it's not too hard to prove but
I'm it takes proof it's not too hard to
prove that that conditioning on the tree
being infinite if you take any
particular finite tree it's going to
show up somewhere I mean it takes proof
but it's true and it turns out that that
schema is enough to get the almost sure
theory that is if you take those as your
axioms then one can show that every
statement that holds with probability
one follows from those statements so we
have a good feeling for the almost sure
theory furthermore if we look at any
statement at all um if we look at the
almost sure theory and if we add what
the nature is of near the root then we
will get something that's well it's not
it's k complete there's any any first
order statement of quantifier depth k is
is either true or false and and so from
this one can further deduce that for any
statement a of quantifier depth k even
though the statement a is talking about
all sorts of stuff but its first order
the probability of a is just determined
by these various probabilities that only
depend on looking near the root and
these probabilities turn out to be nice
but you can read Lou Monty's thesis when
and if she writes it I mean
in fact actually there's something on
the archives already that giving more
what nice means so so what happens is
for any first order statement the
probability of a given that the tree is
infinite is a particularly nice function
of lambda it only involves Exponential's
and polynomials and nice stuff let me
just at the end go yeah yeah particular
it's sorry there are these conditional
probabilities conditioned on immortality
yeah that's a guess yes yeah no no
because the previous theorem is not
conditioning on immortality and when you
condition on finiteness no you need more
yeah let me turn to the magnetic second
order and there's several different
things going on which I feel combined
the logic and then different elements so
magnetic second order is your
quantifying over sets of vertices so you
can say like for all sets s there exists
a settee and then you can follow by some
kind of first order statement but now
you can talk about V being an element of
s or of fees so you have these
additional things so that's what's
called monadic second order existential
magnetic second order means that the
quantification over the sets is
existential so that the two examples
we've had have been existential monadic
second order that is that there exists a
set s such that the set s has the
property that it has the root and for
every vertex in it there's a child which
is in it okay the stars
I count that I allow I allow that yeah I
allow that number of says yeah yeah but
I don't allow the us through the heart
what happens when you start alternating
quantifiers but that's not and that's
very good question but here I just think
of this if you have a tree automata you
can create a monett magnetic second
order statement but it's not unique and
if you think of the property of being
infinite on the tree if you look at that
tree automata oneman attics second order
statement is that the tree is infinite
the other man attic second order
statement that also satisfies the tree
automata particular tree automata is the
statement false all right that statement
we're saying that if you have any green
children your agree so if you just say
that everything's red then it satisfies
it and that's the one that has
probability zero so where did this
spurious solution zero come from well
the tree automata really had had given
the automata there were two magnetic
second order statements that reflected
one had probability zero which was this
line and the other was was the other
line and then we have other connections
if we have a monadic second order we
create we can create a tree automata in
a unique way and from a tree automata we
can create an existential magnetic
second order statement we can and this
we can do in a very cookbook way of
looking looking at the tree automata and
then the tree automata if we have green
yellow and yellow green yellow and red
the the existential magnetic second
order is simply there exists green there
exists yellow there exists read that
they partition all the vertices so
that's first order and that for all V
and then the list of the properties we
can write down so so we get this
what happens is that when you have a
tree automata you get an equation from
it but the problem is and or the
interesting thing is the equation may or
may not have solutions so let me jump
over let me end with some open question
corresponding to an MSO formula yeah is
it decidable whether it's at first
whether it's representable in
restorative logic I I don't know I don't
know I can't decide it let's just say
that not decidable by me all right so
let me let me end with some open
questions so you look at a tree automata
and you create this enso this
existential magnetic second order and
from the existential magnetic second
order you have this system of equations
and you look at the largest solution and
the question is is that the probability
of the event that you're doing and I
don't know I don't know sometimes ah and
here's a question I particularly like
let me back up to the place this is some
reverse engineering let me go to my
favorite picture here whoops there it is
okay um
the if you look at draconian fecundity
if you look at the arm state the finite
states and then your green and red and
your green if and only if you have to
green children then Oh one solution is
this one which is the one we want which
is is that you you want to know whether
or not there's this complete binary tree
the other one is this one which is the
statement false which is also there and
my reverse engineering question is you
ever get this curve that is can you can
you create a problem where the solution
is this lower curve I think not but I'm
not quite quite sure i don't know you're
right but i'm not sure that yes I well I
think that's an approach we're thinking
about I ok I hope so all right i'll work
up ok good so let me just go back and
finish up
so yeah can you get something where you
get the smaller root and i conjecture
know and maybe from the stability
analysis one can show it i'm not i'm not
quite sure but it seems somewhat not
easy to create a properties where you
get none on the tonicity in the lambda
you can do that officially they say yeah
you know you're not at least so so one
weaker yeah the greatest shape right so
so one way of staying the question is
suppose you don't want to get the curve
suppose you just fix a lamb the bigger
than the critical one and now I just
want for that lambda I want a single
statement that gives that value all
right well now these arguments about
stability maybe are not coming in but i
don't know i mean this is this is an
interesting open question and these
general questions that really were what
we started really from the beginning was
to say let's not look at golfin and
watson the the zero solution is some
kind of anomaly let's say let's look at
that as a central thing when do you get
spurious solutions or to put it in
another way how do you know when you get
this system of equations which you can
get are there certain types of a tree
automata so first order generates it but
maybe some other things also generate
where the solutions are going to be are
going to be unique or going to be unique
and then a similar question on where you
have corresponding properties and the
properties we can't quite say the
properties are unique but unique up to
probability 0 so that's a similar kind
of question so let me end with a one of
my favorite authors could
Dara and I like this statement with
exponentially well so thank you very
much yeah give you a tree otamatone yeah
with multiple fixed points yeah and i
chose the computational problem of
deciding which of the fixed points is
the actual probability yeah that's what
I'd like to know is that yeah I don't
know I I don't know I mean I it seems
like I mean you should be disabled to
distinguish probability point three and
probability point seven I mean they're
two different values I iterated
desertion debs they look at which one is
converging towards I'm a little bit
worried this thing of iterating is a
little bit of a problem you know when so
let me maybe end with with one example
with where funny things happen suppose
you want that there exists a set s where
every node has exactly one child okay
now if the tree is infinite you could
just take an infinite paths okay but but
if you look at the equations for that
then you would say that something is
green if and only if it has exactly one
green child and and when you do that if
you let X be the probability that it's
green then X would be the probability so
now it's Poisson lambda X children would
have to be exactly one so you get you'd
get this equation this gives the wrong
answer this this is this is actually
just the wrong answer the the actual
probability is is known to be the
probability that the tree is infinite
which is not that equation at all
everything
known about it I mean this has a
solution but it's just the wrong
solution so we don't really under would
like to understand you when two things
work out well one of the things not work
out how can we find if somebody's given
if you're given a magnetic second order
statement how do you find out the
probabilities how do you distinguish
which probability is the correct one all
of these are the questions would would
like to answer in one place where we do
know it is in the first order world
where everything is great you get the
equations the equations have a single
solution even computationally it's a
contraction so you can actually even
compute it quickly although the number
of states is at our function of K so
that's small problem of k is 10 but okay
but but but still so in the first order
world we have a very good situation
order world where we've got a lot of
open quite we really don't understand
that as well as we'd like to that's yeah
enriching the language of trees yeah to
include for example Pressburger
arithmetic sentences about the number of
children so you can't say things like
there's a node which yeah whose children
all have more children than it has yeah
uh that would be very good I actually
haven't thought about that particular
one I mean one question I didn't list on
the open questions is to extend the
first order system by adding ancestor so
it's still first order but you have that
x is an ancestor of Y so now you no
longer have locality because you know
things can be be far away um so that's
but I have no results I mean I I wonder
you know you know you can ask all these
questions you know you again because it
is minh attic second order see ancestor
is a second order in the second order
world you can say ancestor because x is
an ancestor of Y if there's a path from
X to Y so you can say that in second
order
so that's the one I haven't looked at
Pressburger but there are a number of
possibilities for between first-order
and second-order there are a number of
things in between that are worthwhile to
look at yeah lots of questions okay I
know slept so I'll say thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
