contributions to the theory and practice
of computer science and Leslie certainly
has Leslie invented the theoretical
foundation underneath distributed
systems technology so the Internet is a
distributed system so you like using the
Internet you owe Leslie every time you
access a modern computer today whether
it's your desktop or even your cell
phone over a network
I can guarantee you you're using one of
lamport's ideas it's unbelievable how
what kind of reach Leslie has had on the
entire world nowadays when we have
machines with dozens of cores and and
data centers with hundreds of thousands
of computers in them this is just the
way computing is done and Leslie showed
us how to do it reliably anyone who uses
the internet which is off a lot of
people is depending on distributed
systems those systems work because of
Leslie anyone who has been a student in
computer science has been touched by
Leslie because if you've taken an
operating systems course you've probably
studied the bakery algorithm and that's
Leslie's Alcala it's so simple when
Leslie describes it that you cannot
imagine how you didn't think of it
yourself which is simultaneously
wonderful and extremely frustrating
Leslie is very unique in the sense that
he can really prove to you
mathematically the solution is correct
and the yes neither can be applied at
you very practical problems the
algorithms that he designed which in
many cases were not viewed as important
at the time are now fundamental to the
way we build web scale systems the
systems that all of us use every day
what Leslie's done with this language
the TLA plus modeling language is to
make that accessible to everyday
engineers his work on distributed
systems predated the rise of the
internet as a force in the world by many
years and being way actually really
studied his paper on taxes and applied
to the technology to build as a
distributed system stat that we still
use today I've gone back and read
recently some of his papers and I still
have not been able to exactly get inside
his head and figure out what he was
thinking when he when he came up with
them what he did want to do is build
something solid that people could count
on for 40 years a hundred years whatever
else I mean what he's God you know as a
mathematical truth just as much true as
two plus two is four
I can think of any single person who's
had a more profound impact on how we
think about concurrent systems and
making concurrent tasks perform
correctly what Leslie has taught us
probably more than anything else is the
importance of keeping the mathematical
principles the mathematical
underpinnings of computing firmly in
mind when you build systems he can take
and analyze problems and construct
mathematical proofs light a few people
in the world can maybe you know five
maybe ten I don't know not many I can't
most people can't without less least
innovations which in many cases were not
appreciated in the instant we wouldn't
have the computing environment that we
have today
Leslie congratulations on winning the
ACM Turing award Microsoft is extremely
proud to have you among us
congratulations Leslie congratulations
Leslie on this well-deserved exciting
award congratulations Leslie I'm so
proud of you congratulations Leslie
congratulations Leslie
congratulations Leslie congratulations
Leslie it's well deserved and thank you
for all your work this is such a
deserving award for your really
congratulation it's wonderful thing
we're awfully glad it finally happened
and now get on with your work
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
