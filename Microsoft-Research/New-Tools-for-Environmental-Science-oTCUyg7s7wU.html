hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
there's a little change in the schedule
today just changing the orders Lucas did
use visa issues he cannot be here today
but he's gonna do his presentation on
skype we tested and then keep our
fingers crossed should should go just
fine i think um how's everybody doing
yeah so one of my dear call colleagues
at microsoft annual location summit and
i'd love to participate that one he
always start his sessions with a joke
and just to get get everybody started i
see that we have a good diversity of
culture and geographical regions and and
disciplines research disciplines so i
figure we can do some blasting
translation kind of jokes and and so
i'll but i don't have all the jokes I
can do one and then hopefully you guys
will help me so like after break
somebody should volunteer tell jokes
I'll tell mine and see if it I can make
you laugh um what I have a lot of things
with my talking partners I have her like
an English Chinese talking pear partner
so she teaches me English words that and
I teach her Chinese and I had the
partner like this many years ago and now
my daughter my 12 years daughters is my
talking partner anyway so one of the
things is that in the very beginning and
I was teaching my talking pear partner
about Chinese not only language but also
culture kind of things so she asked me
so how exactly do you use chopsticks and
so I wanted to show her how the whole
chops Leon how to pick up things and but
there's no food on the table yet as I
use the chopstick and I pick up the
spoon she said oh my gosh that's hard
way you use spoon so next time is your
10 let's get started and so Lucas I
think I'm gonna just switch you you
and let me bring up the Skype and if you
could show your screen now we can get
started Microsoft Research Cambridge
have been developing but the kind of the
thrust of that talk was just going to be
a about 60 minutes of kind of in-depth
demoing of tools that we've been
building and as you can see with the
technology she's we've already had I
don't think it would be too too helpful
to try and do any any hardcore software
deviling on this line so instead I'm
going to give a little bit more of a
general talk which I'm calling a
building and environmental prediction
engine at Microsoft Research and you
can't get away from addressing the the
new tools for environmental science that
double you've been building along the
way but um just to start because most of
you probably aren't all that familiar
with with our group or the fact that we
even exist given that we're on a
completely different continent at the
moment I just kind of wanted to give you
a brief rundown of who we are what we
are and why we do what we do and so who
we are there's a there is a group at
microsoft research cambridge UK called
the computational science lab and the
the kind of overarching grand aim of the
computational science group here in
Cambridge is to make enable and
accelerate transformational dances in
science in areas of societal importance
and so that was really put um together
by a guy named Stephen Emmett which none
of these pictures are all that great on
my screen so I'm assuming they're
probably ten times for Sun on your
screen but um and be the guy okay great
and if i should say if anybody has any
questions i don't think i could probably
hear you but I can hear Jana perfectly
so please just stop me and so so that
kind of overall aim of the group was put
together by by Stephen Emmett when when
he kicked things off and under his
leadership the group's grown on into
parallel but separate directions one in
biological computation and the other
computational ecology and environmental
sciences the group in which i sit and
when you look at the computational
science lab in general it surprises even
me to look at some of these numbers
because i often don't think we're as big
as as as we actually are we have about
50 people in total we have seven
principal researchers or investigators
those are the people that you're
actually looking at on that slide I'm
the kind of crazy looking guy with
looking slightly to the side in the
computational ecology group with the
with the leaves behind me but we also
have um these numbers are changing
almost all the time but we have 12 posts
toxics software engineers and a huge
kind of revolving cast of PhD students
interns contractors etc etc and really I
mean we all are active scientists doing
what what scientists do we do basic and
applied research we publish papers we
give talks not all that different from
from what your traditional kind of
academic scientists might do and in the
computational ecology and environmental
sciences group in particular we have
even more kind of focused aim which is
to develop the new concepts methods and
and software tools needed to produce and
this is this is actually important I why
it's an italic Stu produce useful and
predictive models of ecological systems
looking at things you know for example
like climate change in food security and
and the reason that we say predictive
models of ecological systems is because
with very few exceptions ecology to date
hasn't really been able to make very
useful predictions and so we are kind of
aiming to try and change that by
developing kind of a new kind of
computational ecology to underlie more
rational approach to managing the
world's ecosystems so here's kind of a
snapshot of some of the people in the
computational ecology group again
there's three pi/6 postdocs two of Earth
half of which are shared with an
organization called the World
Conservation monitoring center which is
the environmental data reporting arm of
the united nations environmental program
I've got three software engineers and a
bunch of again PhD students and and
interns um but what I often get whenever
I tell people about what I do and the
group that exists here at Microsoft
Research you always get the question of
why and and often people mean that in a
couple different ways and so I'm going
to dress it here briefly in in two
different ways first the question of why
at all and I think instead of trying to
explain to you which I'm sure you all
know just as well as I do a lot of the
arguments of environmental problems that
the world is experiencing I just
actually kind of wanted to show a video
that I think explains a little bit about
where we are the group's philosophy
about predictive ecology etc etc and it
really can be kind of encapsulated by by
what you see on this slide here where
the world is is kind of experiencing at
least in my mind a crisis of confidence
we're really interested in environmental
side of that crisis of confidence but
really it's behind a lot of the the
global financial issues that we're
experiencing etc etc where people
thought that they could make predictions
and that those predictions would carry
them them forward into time they thought
that they bought a house it's it's some
value would just increase keep
increasing into the future off into the
distance they thought that if they made
investments that would happen they
thought if they just kept throwing trash
away that the landfills would just keep
them appearing to take their trash and
then all of that kind of disappeared and
and their investments didn't work and
their house value wasn't increasing it
was decreasing and suddenly that's where
this crisis of confidence came about
people suddenly started thinking that
you know maybe everything that we
thought was true wasn't and it's making
us kind of go back to basics and asked
well just what can we predict and and
with how much confidence and so to kind
of explain where I'm coming from from an
environmental point standpoint on this I
just wanted to show a quick video from a
scientist named chris bishop who
actually a a microsoft partner he's a
senior scientist here in Microsoft
Research I think he's the only scientist
in in Europe with that title and he was
invited in 2008 to give the Royal
Society christmas lectures here in the
UK and the christmas lectures are
actually a pretty big deal they're shown
on prime-time over six nights over the
Christmas holiday season they're
primarily targeted towards school-aged
kids to try and get them excited about
about science in general Chris was asked
to talk about computer science in
particular so there is there's cameos
from from bill gates etc etc but this is
just one kind of clip where he's talking
about predictions and and certainty and
laws of physics and so in front of a I
don't know if the clip i have will
actually out there you go in front of a
rather large auditorium of
schoolchildren Chris's is explaining you
know if he takes this ball and and
performs a rather death-defying stunt
with it he's actually willing to put
himself in that situation because
because some of the laws of laws of
physics that he thinks he understands
and so if you haven't taken um you know
elementary elementary physics or science
this might seem surprising to you but
like these girls here but for most of us
is probably the outcome of this
experiment probably is already
preordained so he pulls this back to his
head right and he says assuming the
world operates the way I think it
operates I'm gonna let go of this ball
and it's not gonna kill me even with
Chris's kind of belief structure you
could tell he was still a little bit a
little bit nervous there um but but the
point about this is that we do this
every day we don't pull bowling balls
back to our heads and let them go but we
drive cars we work in skyscrapers things
that
engineers have built according to two
standard laws of physics and and and we
trust them because we they make pretty
pretty accurate predictions about about
what's going to happen in time plus one
but the worrying thing is that we also
do this every day with the environment
and I think most of you if you're kind
of honest with yourself probably
wouldn't be as confident as as Chris was
with that bowling ball if that was if
that was what we know about Earth's
systems today those things are
significantly less predictable but we're
experimenting with them all the time
deforestation at ocean acidification co2
emissions species extinctions and and
really when you think about it while
Chris's experiment was kind of a nice
demonstration of the laws of physics
what we're doing with the environment is
pretty much the world's worst experiment
well were we're experimenting on
ourselves basically we're the only
control there's no replicates and so
whatever the experimental outcome is
we'll get to we'll get to decide and
find out about sometime in the fit into
the future and the thing about Chris's
example is he didn't die right because
because laws and experiments have
combined overtime to provide very high
and predictive certainty about about
what that bowling ball was going to do
as it came back to his face but we're
not even close to that kind of thing for
for the environment so we still want to
know for example where basic things you
know where will carbon be in the future
where and when can I plant my crops
what's the climate going to be like what
will actually happen if a species goes
extinct and and so because of that the
computational ecology and environmental
sciences group here in Cambridge I think
we all strongly share the belief that
science and especially environmental
science is really set to be the driver
of our times and so that's kind of why
we do what we do why we're trying to
build an environmental prediction engine
but the next probably more pertinent
question is well why at Microsoft right
that's that's not a goal that isn't
shared by other people outside of
the corporate world for example in
academics and in government agencies but
why are we doing this if Microsoft well
I think you really can't deny the fact
that as people at least this for from a
personal perspective but also as a
company we really do care about doing
the right thing and in particular doing
the right thing actually means doing
some science because a lot of the things
that we want to know about environmental
systems simply aren't known at the
moment and so we've actually got to get
in there we've got to do some new
science and we've got to solve some of
these problems and and some of these
problems are massive and I think one of
the reasons that we're doing this at
Microsoft is because some of these
problems are so big that they really do
require a company of proportional size
to tackle and the one thing that you
can't say about Microsoft is that it's a
small company so you know I think by
Microsoft throwing its its weight behind
this it's it's um acknowledging the the
enormity of the situation and and
putting confidence in its ability to
provide some some strong steps forward
on on this problem and there's also
another reason that at least we in the
the computational ecology group have for
doing what we do at Microsoft and that's
because we really do and truly believe
that information about the earth is
going to be more important than simply
providing information about people is
today things like social networking
sites and and advertising revenues on on
search engines and and the reason that
I'm so confident that that it's going to
be is because it already is when you
look at data on natural resources things
like extractive industries of logging
mining and and oil extraction those
industries overwhelmingly swamp the the
sectors that companies like Microsoft
traditionally focus on focus on at the
moment and so obviously as kind of one
of the world's largest technology
companies i would say that ignoring this
this market sector would be would be
extremely ill-advised and in particular
I think there's huge scope for for
software that provides predictions for
policy and and society and and for
software that actually enables the
science that we're going to be needing
to do into the future and the thing is
Microsoft actually is a software company
and so that's a pretty pretty head on
argument there and increasingly um
Microsoft really understands the power
of predictions so it might come as a
surprise it came to surprise to me when
I when I first applied to this job that
Microsoft was trying to lead the way in
building environmental solutions but it
more and more shouldn't come as a
surprise that Microsoft is interested in
in predictions and in the power of
prediction so Bing Microsoft's what you
might call microsoft search engine what
Microsoft would used to rather have you
call it is a decision engine and and now
I can't remember what is the the
official noose logo for Bing it's oh
that's right it's Bing is for doing
right and so it's not just for searching
what they're trying to say is this is
about decisions and when you make when
you talk about decisions those things
require a prediction about what's
actually going to happen and so a great
example of that is is Bing travel which
is a really big success story for
Microsoft it's one of the reasons that
people leave Google for their searches
it's it's to go and do travel searches
with Bing and that's because they
provide a very a service with very high
accuracy on predicting whether a flight
price is going to go up or down and
they're willing to make bets on that by
telling you to buy now or wait and those
are simply predictions that allow you to
make decisions and people are really
interested in that when you think about
Connect which is the computer vision
hardware and software that goes to xbox
360 allowing for controller free
gameplay purportedly the fastest selling
hardware devices in the history of the
world what that is doing is all about
predictions it's modeling what your what
your hands look like and what your arms
look like and what your head looks like
and it's trying to predict what that's
going to do into the near instantaneous
future microsoft adcenter being run by
things like infer dotnet these are all
again about
making predictions for consumers and
clients and trying to help them make
better and more accurate decisions and
so in the computational ecology group
were following that that model of
thinking very strongly we are firmly
committed I think to trying to take a
crack at building the world's first
environmental prediction engine I don't
know if it's an appropriate analogy or
not but the one I always like to use is
you kind of think of it as a Bloomberg
terminal for the environment but it says
plus plus there because I don't know if
you know what Bloomberg terminal is but
it's what most financial analysts and
traders are using to continuously in
real-time monitor stock markets and
provide some analytical solutions on top
of those some real-time streaming data
and so what we're what we're envisioning
here in the group and actually working
towards is building a system that allows
access to relevant environmental data
information but also providing predict
predictions and decision support tools
on top of those predictions anywhere on
earth and at any resolution and what
this does is it's integrating software
data models and predictions all is the
service on the cloud for anyone anywhere
and that really does follow Microsoft's
kind of commitment to providing software
as a service across its entire kind of
business model so I'll be by far the
first to admit everybody in the
computational ecology group will be the
first submit that this probably sounds
kind of absolutely crazy you know it
probably is but we're giving it a go
because we think that on the off chance
that we get it right the the the payoff
will be will be appropriate and and the
nice thing about it actually is is that
I see it as least as a a win-win
situation that's because if we succeed
at doing this we're going to do good by
the world and we're actually going to
help Microsoft lead the way in providing
software services for the world's
pressing problems i think that's that's
a great kind of win-win thing for for
for Microsoft to be involved in but the
but the best part is if we fail there's
two nice things about well
still nice things I guess about failing
the first is that we're still going to
advance some really important areas of
environmental sciences this is just a
snapshot a kind of a word cloud but not
a fully comprehensive one of all of the
bits of environmental sciences that our
scientists are actually working towards
and and contributing towards so we
publish papers I think last year our
group published something like 80
peer-reviewed papers and a lot of the
top scientific journals science pnas
ecology ecology letters on all of these
sorts of issues and so you know at the
end of the day trying to build this this
environmental prediction engine requires
us to do new and interesting science and
and that's really important because
we'll still have done that even if we
failed I'm just going to go through
three really kind of quick snapshots of
some of the science some of the larger
bits of the science that we're doing
that kind of incorporate a lot of the
stuff on that previous slide the first
is global terrestrial carbon model we're
really just trying to provide a much
more open transparent and and workable
solution to estimating the world's
carbon stocks and flows so I'm not sure
how many of you have seen are familiar
with this this graph I don't know what
side you're looking at it on but the one
under science it says current
predictions and what's showing on the
y-axis over time on the x-axis is is
carbon uptake from from the global
terrestrial and surface and as you can
see as you move on the x-axis away from
the the year we're currently in these
models which each kind of squiggly line
on that graph are showing these models
start to diverge very very very widely
and so what that's saying is that you
know these these are almost basically
useless predictions because from one
model extreme to the other we're saying
you know the world is taking up tons of
carbon it's releasing tons of carbon and
so basically we're making predictions
but but they're not that useful and
one of the problems with this is is each
of those models isn't really assessing
any sort of uncertainty amongst its its
model components and so those bits of
uncertainty we can't then go in and
start to ask but why is that blue line
so much higher than the black line that
requires a lot of time a lot of times
because those Motley's models are
extremely complex and computationally
intensive and it takes forever to run
them but also simply because there just
isn't uncertainty estimation built into
the model process in the first place and
so over the last two years we and in
particular a scientist named Matthew
Smith we've really put our heads down
and taking a step forward and trying to
build the first global terrestrial
carbon model where every component bit
has has parameters that are actually fit
to data and and have resulting
uncertainty about them that uncertainty
has appropriately passed across the
model framework so that we're able to
actually provide uncertainty about
carbon fluxes anywhere in the world and
what's nice about that is it moves
beyond just a scientific exercise at
that moment because suddenly you can
start building applications like I'm
showing a screenshot of on the right
where it says carbon future service
where we can actually start mapping out
places across the world how much carbon
they have how much carbon they should
have start matching that up with things
like the the trading price of carbon
futures and the Chicago carbon exchange
and you can actually start to make these
predictive decision support tools for
four people in science and and beyond
another modeling effort that we're
moving forward with is what is um called
the mattingly model which is named the
mattingly model mainly because it's been
developed in a building on Mattingly
Road in Cambridge but it's really the
what we're trying to make the first
global ecosystem model which for the
first time combines marine and
terrestrial processes in a single
integrated framework
it takes a kind of individual based
modeling approach and a bit of a
functional type approach and a few other
things so we've got for the marine we've
got autotrophs with plants and
phytoplankton we've got heterotrophs
with carnivores herbivores omnivores Oh
plankton and plank divorce and then all
of these functional types in their
respective environments are running
around doing things that the animals do
and that we think about from an
ecological process point of view right
though they're metabolizing they're
eating there they're dying the
reproducing they're going extinct
they're dispersing from one spatial
location to another and we can model all
of that by fitting this overall kind of
the model components of this this
overall model to bits of data that we're
able to actually collect we can pass
that uncertainty around as well and
eventually what you can do is is you can
make maps again like the one that you
see on the upper right here where we're
actually for any point on terrestrial
and marine surface here which is showing
terrestrial you can actually ask
questions about Oh what's the biomass of
large herbivores in in this system you
can look at that over time you can start
perturbing it then with various
scenarios and and decision planning
frameworks and so what we're showing
down here in the in the bottom bit with
this orange and blue is something called
the global living planet functional
index where people have been looking at
functional traits of species over time
and and looking at species extinction
and coming up with an index of of how
those functional traits are changing
globally over time but the problem is
when you're doing that all you're
basically doing is documenting
documenting processes in in real time
and there's there's nothing predictive
about that and so what's nice is this is
just me doing some ad hoc arree and in
PowerPoint a couple minutes ago but you
can start with it what this mattingly
model will allow us to do is start
putting things like this dash black line
on on graphs like this so we
can move ecosystem models more towards
the framework of of global climate
models where we're making predictions
into the future and that's really
important for upcoming international
framework select international platform
on biodiversity and ecosystem services
which is just starting up and is aiming
to be a IPCC like framework for for
looking at changes in invited versity
ecosystem services over time and and
finally um we're working kind of a lot I
head up the the conservation research
unit within the group and and I'm really
interested in looking at how we scale
from small to large scales how do you
how do you go from a global to a
regional to a local to a very specific
place to optimize conservation
objectives priorities and and impact
actually and so I spend a lot of my time
thinking about how do you actually
estimate what the true impact of an
intervention like a protected area might
actually be and how do you estimate what
types of biodiversity might actually be
in that protected area and so you know
you really are starting to stray down
into the Donald Rumsfeld world of
unknown unknowns but but you can start
to build tools like I'm just showing a
screenshot of here that will allow
people to start having a much stronger
grasp on on the decision support
frameworks they might be able to use
when they're thinking about implementing
conservation actions on the ground and
integrating those into into much larger
regional and national frameworks and and
finally the other nice thing about
moving towards this this environmental
prediction engine is that if we fail
we're still gonna have created some what
we think to be at least useful tools for
for science and for Microsoft because a
lot of the science that we're doing we
need new new tools to do we need new
tools to allow other people to
do the science that we're doing and so
some of the tools that we've been
building are part of an integrated
component process for example for a
global ecosystem modeling or global
carbon modeling it requires a lot of the
component pieces that I'm that I'll show
here in just a second but some of them
are just kind of one-off things that we
think are important to end solve a bit
of problematic bits of that analysis for
for scientists in general and so this is
this was actually all of that that I've
been talking about for the past while
was not actually going to be part of my
speech I was going to kind of kick off
from here which is actually the tools
that our group has been developing along
the way on this journey towards towards
prediction engine but I don't really
have the confidence in my ability to do
convincing demos on the fly from a
couple thousand miles away so what
you're going to see are some screenshots
and what you'll hear from me is a very
strong encouragement to to visit this
this website up above most of these
tools that I'll be talking about are
found on our website their lives they
have examples many of them like fetch
climate and fills back which I'll talk
about in just a second our silver light
moving to html5 online applications that
you don't even have to download you can
run from the browser they provide kind
of standard services others are
traditional microsoft download and
install on things and you'll see there's
there's biology tools on here as well as
ecology tools i'm just going to focus on
the ecology stuff but if you're at all
interested in the bio to you please get
touch with us as well or check out check
out the website so the first tool that i
want to talk about is something called
fills back i'm just going to stop here
and this isn't anything against
microsoft but if you're wondering why
all of our tools have kind of crazy
names it's because it's almost
impossible to actually name anything
after anything
when you work for a large technology
company because you're dealing with all
sorts of trademarks and copyrights and
whatever so usually what's safe is to
name a tool after a place and I think
Phil spot got its name from a workshop
that its creator drew purvis actually
led in a town called Phil's box so if
you're wondering why it's called fills
back that's why but really all it is is
a.net library but also a browser a
silverlight based browser application to
that allows you to fit complex models to
heterogeneous data it sounds pretty
boring until you're the person that
actually has to do start doing this and
you know when somebody says they want
you to do a likelihood-based bayesian
analysis and you start looking at your
options especially if you're looking at
doing it in any sort of dotnet framework
it becomes extremely extremely um
difficult and so basically what this is
is a robust and extremely fast way of
doing bayesian and like elated base
parameter estimation and and you can
actually do it on the cloud now as well
so so that's it there's a there's a web
sample that you can actually go and it
teaches you how to write likelihood
statements how to how to set up kind of
traditional ecological models some
standard biological models and it
provides some decent visual output as
well to let you know just how well um
just how well the models then then fit
another tool that we have as a as a
browser-based application is something
called fetch climate and I think at some
point today if you want to I think the
the research connections people there
will have a link to a video that drew
purvis did as part of the kickoff
keynote lecture with rick ration for
tech fest this year at microsoft where a
demonstrate an application that we've
put together called fetch climate and
basically fetch climate simply allows
you to retrieve global environmental
data with a click of a button or a few
lines of code and so you can go to this
application online and you can query
standard things like air temperature
near surface precipitation over time it
goes back about 60 years it goes up to
this year you can vary the the sampling
resolution so you can get this
environmental data at any any resolution
anywhere in the world over pretty much
any time period and you can just simply
view it you can download it as a CSV
file what's really nice about it is it
provides estimates of uncertainty about
those data because of course we don't
actually have weather data for all of
these places and so what it's doing is
it's finding the appropriate weather
stations where real weather data have
been taking taken and it's running some
fairly intensive interpolations between
those points to provide a best estimate
of what that parameter that you're
looking for actually is in that place
but it'll also give you some uncertainty
about that and so you can start to build
that into your into your modeling
process you can also actually include it
though as part of any kind of dotnet
code that you're building and again
these are these are tools that we've had
to build and they seem kind of basic and
easy but at the end of the day they do
solve a lot of problems anytime somebody
wants you to build a geospatial
application with environmental data in
it for example you basically have to go
back and and reinvent the wheel now we
have an application which so that none
of us have to have to reinvent at least
this wheel again the visualizations that
you've been seeing on a lot of those on
those first few applications that I've
been showing are all part of a dotnet
library called data dynamic data display
and the most the closest that you
actually which is itself just the dotnet
library allowing you to do dynamic
visualization of data and parameters in
any dotnet functions that you're writing
but this is the standalone version of
dynamic data set
our dynamic data display which is the
data set viewer and really all it is
this is easy visualization of scientific
data so you can take netcdf files txt
files excel files etc etc you can simply
drag them drop them you can cut your
data by by different ways you can filter
it you can slide it you can immediately
put put these put your data on maps you
can look at maps over time you can zoom
and and you can actually export those
settings and and share as well and again
that's that's you can find that on our
website there's something called network
3d which is probably our most successful
tool to date but that might also be
because it's it's the oldest it was
built by a scientist named rich williams
who actually started the computational
ecology group here in Cambridge
unfortunately it's no longer at
Microsoft but it's a simple and
extremely easy-to-use software
application that lets you visualize
networks flip them rotate them look at
at paths of influence and it's been used
extensively it's it's been used in
Microsoft to actually look at code
dependencies when people are pushing out
software updates for example the US
State Department is starting to look at
it to understand their kind of paths of
influence in their global networks
there's a really good TED talk if you're
aware of TED Talks by a colleague of
ours named Eric Berlo who uses who uses
network 3d to actually break down the
actors of influence in the Afghanistan
war conflict and draw some basic and
pretty simplistic insights based on just
look taking a network approach to to
looking at this this is actually a image
of a study that I use network 3d to do
which is which is trying to look at some
biological connectivity of meadow
habitats in Yosemite National Park so
it's not just about you know
who knows who social interaction
networks but whoo-whee to food webs but
it can also be spatial networks as well
and it's it's a tool that I I found
quite quite useful quite often in the
work that I do and a lot of the work
that especially that I used to do is
looking at networks of ecological
interactions so what species interact
with what other species and I use
network 3d quite often to to visualize
those networks but one of the basic
problems is is actually trying to
compile the data for those networks in
the first place and it requires long
hours of ecologists often undergraduates
sitting out in the field recording notes
about what's happening with with
different species but even then it's
almost impossible to get the the spatial
data that that your eyes are constantly
processing registering and then throwing
away the XYZ coordinates of these
species and so here we've been working
with a couple of the researchers in the
computer vision group here in in
Cambridge some of the guys who are
actually principally behind the the
science behind connect the computer
vision algorithms behind the Kinect
camera and we've built a really general
purpose tool for automatic object
tracking in in video so this doesn't
actually have to be for ecological
systems can use it for pretty much
anything but really what what we've done
it for is is to go towards a more
autonomous monitoring of ecological
interactions and so here you can see the
computer is picking up that these are
two separate rabbits they're hopping
over each other it's not perfect so it's
getting confused sometimes but um up
here you can see this is a bee
pollinating flower this is a a bunch of
bees actually an interesting experiment
we're running with some plant scientists
here at the University trying to track
pollination frequency and preferences of
different beast species within a music
awesome and then and then a last tool
that I kind of want to talk about really
quickly I think that's the last one yep
is a another tool this is a integration
of hardware
and software actually and it's called
scomber after scomber island where the
where the scientist Robin Freeman has
done a lot of its work and he's really
interested in geospatial tracking of
migrating seabirds and so one of the
problems that with that is that current
tracking technology is extremely
expensive most of those tracking devices
are are quite heavy sometimes too heavy
to put on the birds that you want to
track and most of them often aren't open
or reconfigurable and they're often
generally not you can't communicate with
them once they're there on on an animal
that you're tracking and so he's built
you can kind of see a probably a fuzzy
image here a small open reconfigurable
flexible wirelessly enabled and low
cross cost tracking technology and some
software tools that go along with it to
address common problems with with
tracking and what's really exciting
about this again is that you know you
can throw these things on birds which is
great that's what we're really
interested in as well but it's an
extremely general solution to geospatial
tracking problems in general so you can
think of of fleets of automobiles that a
large company is deploying can
drastically reduce reduce costs on on
that end as well one of the things
that's really cool about about this
technology is that it lets you do take
advantage of what i like to call
ecological informants so a big problem
with with putting geolocation trackers
on species like like lions or wolves for
example are there often species that are
difficult to catch and you don't really
want to have to catch them more than
once it often involves darting them and
putting them to sleep and some highly
invasive procedures and so what's what's
really nice about some of these scomber
trackers is that day they're an
infectious they have some infectious
software built into them and that you
any any tracker on any individual can
download data and programs from any
other tracker and so for example if you
wanted to track a lion and you knew that
it was often in in frequent spatial
proximity of some more common species
like so
bird species or monkeys etc you can put
these trackers on the lion but you can
also put them on monkeys and stuff like
that which are way easier to get your
hands on again and all you really have
to do is get one of those trackers back
and it will have collected the location
data from every other every other
tracker the other thing is if you for
example want to change the program you
want to say start collecting data at a
different time interval or frequency all
you have to do is push that programmatic
update out to one of those trackers and
you can let the the social network of
the animals out in the wild actually
spread that programmatic update rather
rather organically and that's about it I
do apologize again for kind of the fact
that i've just been droning on and none
of you were able to interact with me nor
I able to interact with you I guess what
I would like to say is that if you're
interested in any of these tools you can
definitely go to the website you can
definitely check out some of the more
in-depth demoing videos that I've I've
sent to the research connections crowd
and you can check out our group website
both the links that I'm showing there
and more importantly I guess if you just
actually want actually know some
information that you don't think you're
going to find just skimming along please
please do get in touch with me my email
is pretty simple lu japa at microsoft
com and i can answer any questions point
you in the right direction or or let you
know more about what we're up to or
potential collaborations or anything
like that and and so into the future
that's fine but also if anybody has any
questions for me right now that's that's
great as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
