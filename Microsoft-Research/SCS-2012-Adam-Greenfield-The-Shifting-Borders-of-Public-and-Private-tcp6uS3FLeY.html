conversation amount and the loss of the
public online and then flows really
nicely tabs where the loss of the public
will change the topic in real yeah
that's that's exactly right that's the
framing that I want to purchase from the
Serbian everything because just like the
last hours I want to talk more about
instead of publix on the network of what
I'm talking about happens when the
network is traditionally initiative
public space and particularly in a
context I want to shop with it do a lot
of work in the context of what we think
of as the network signal which is not a
science fiction place at all as a matter
of fact we are constantly that we
already in a place where everything
around us is very dramatically
by objects and surfaces which are the
process of potentially atomization
violence we live in a place where
there's pervasively even a comprehensive
minutes during the population I was in
no gap until fairly easily and accordion
to my soldier in our approach a mentor
which you can essentially get smart
phone capability filling materials
something went 213 euros so we were
talking about something over five
million people couple of years being
able to be personally instrumented with
some pretty dramatic capabilities
together and disaster lies information
we live in a world of riesling there is
a widespread adoption of located in the
clarity yeah looking to tell anybody in
this room that things like foursquare to
permit the interpretive analytics to be
performed on the data that deserves
produces amount of course inception
analysis things that we do declare and
the reason is what we live in cities
that are populated by your favorite
objects this is one of my favorite
projects
alchemy designer gave television its own
Twitter account and allowed it to speak
to the world and of course I register
very much approximatively to each other
so the bridge itself is equal to you to
a public in a way that you might call
your friends associates finally we live
in a place where most of the objects in
spaces around us have been providing
information shadows so if you live in a
world where our public spaces are
increasingly popular projects learning
process and display transmitting and
we're taking action
and particularly where new modes are
surveillance awesome but do not awards
will be necessarily individuals mr. my
arguments this the tens of millions of
people or what minimum exposed to these
conditions perhaps it's time from your
theory and probably minus jurisprudence
like all public objects to help us and
at a deeper level but it might mean to
speak of a right to sleep you know the
right and so what does that like to the
city apply in a space that's a
comprehensive network and what I want we
can talk about is what I think it was a
spectrum concern when it talked very
concretely about four different kinds of
objects and services and redeploying the
city's Harbor blow over the last year or
so two years at this paint and I want to
begin taking apart some of their
implications for this sense of publicity
versus privacy and I very deliberately a
random as a convenient they start from
assisting the permeate not really at all
problematic and in fact associate
position and taper up towards a system
that i would argue dulles reasonably
profound on time without
the first is the wrong spot prizes this
is something called my divine little
cocky platters it is a local radio
network busy is something that is
superimposed over traffic bowler on that
post and it's not emotion attack and if
it detects the motion pedestrians are by
suppose it's a new intersection it
trying to burn bright delhi at into the
van coming traffic notify the fact that
there's something of a bicycle or
something about to cross an intersection
and this is of course very very useful
in finland birth star 27 months in here
some days it's just really it's a very
very dangerous environment for
pedestrian something robert sorry thank
you and even though this is collecting
information from public space and he's
sharing it over local network i find the
relative being problematic this doesn't
really rough on my feathers in any
meaningful way and I technically about
my eyes there's definitely that it's a
global collection of information for
global effect never really use that
region there are no analytics that are
performed on this information there's
nothing to tie it back to purchasing to
tie back to a sense of identity and even
more importantly there's a demonstrable
public good that arises out of this the
the only real argument you could make
about this system if you are opposed to
it was
that they cost a certain amount of money
to employ the system and you know how
many lies you're looking to say I don't
think that that argument really stands
up but that is you know something that
you can you can retire to object to the
presence of the system in public space
you could probably so I think that this
kind of collection of information where
again it's purely local and it doesn't
visit identity away I don't want to have
really trouble then when we begin to get
to something like this this is an ad
that was in the shoot going station it's
all subway couple years ago and what's
happened is that a red park that has
been run through the corner of the
subway and there are motion sensors
underneath that far from about here to
about here and when you walk in front of
this Nikon we trigger the motion sensors
and the paparazzi in the add their their
flashes goal and the idea of the ABS
obviously is supposed to be to make me
feel pretty special you're supposed to
feel like a slender in your occasion
like this so again not a particularly
harmful system there's a local
collection of information for local
effect it's not tied to continue anyway
it's not gathered it's not archived it's
not if you know Annalise um but it
doesn't have that fig leaf of public
goods for purely commercial purposes and
I would even argue this is mildly
disruptive or disrespectful this guy
doesn't look like he's a superstar to me
he looks like he's been shocked out of
his state of mind and so you know if
that's the worst thing you can say
that's really not that bad we definitely
don't waste your advertising before but
you can see our again kids is gradient
where we're losing the things that made
this okay and we're beginning to layer
on to the situation things that make you
feel less good to you here again
something really interesting this is a
vending machine by a Tokyo gates
designer that was deployed on subway
platforms and that in train platforms of
jrs this is a vending machine barakatuh
and this made the rounds of the design
wall except everlasting the confess
rightly it's an absolutely beautiful HD
touch surface on entire front of the
vending machines in HD screen and these
beautiful high-resolution images of the
products that contain with them and the
really interesting thing about aqua day
from my perspective is that it's
equipped with sensors that beginning
staff cameras it's got facial analytics
algorithm that's built into it and what
it's attempting to do as you approach
the machine is ascertain your age and
your gender and then offer you a
selection of beverages that has been
calibrated to appeal to a model of
people that have that ancient gender and
I begin to find this less happy because
it's making prescriptive and normative
assertions about what is appropriate for
14 year old man or 20
to desire and what's even worse than
that for me is that all the aqua day
vending machines are connected with one
another hand we vending company itself
so they begin to even begin quarters for
the beverages that they're going to
bring to market over the next couple of
years based on the patterns been working
provided it seems an obvious time there
is that insidious element or the city's
to me about a pain told what we should
desire and having the market in real
time became to fold itself around that
very gendered very each based
construction of desire here the
information is escaping this particular
sensor installation here in the
information is being drawn off into a
database security information is behind
for commercial value and there are at
least enough signatures that are
associated with the connection of that
information to begin to tie it back to
individual identities where it gets
almost scary for you in my presentation
of this information of the last several
years the reaction is gone from okay
we're really talking about
depersonalization and we talked to
talking about information databases of
the disruptive of any personal traces
look the audiences have gotten
increasingly sophisticated about this
and what if you got to hear is that this
game here is that there's essentially no
such thing as a personalized
they are if there is a signature that
correlates to your personal identity
that's out there and it's available you
can begin to correlate that to other
patterns that that return to you and
some pretty damn anyways so this is
really interesting not nearly so much as
this last system I want to talk about
which is something called community
reports this is a back-end analytics
package which is sold as as part of the
solution so this is for a video
billboard that's to be deployed in
public space and in the frame of the
billboard is a camera and again there
are the typical sensors of the analytics
packages of the background that can not
merely start to identify your age range
within four bands your gender whether
you're male or female it will begin to
use 81 indices of facial bone structure
to make some stats about your ethnicity
and on top of that I will shine a light
off your eyeballs and use a reflectivity
index for me to determine whether
now this really begins to irritate me
for a couple reasons that I clearly this
is like mining commercially valuable
information from public space in a way
that doesn't return the value it's been
derived from that attempt to harvest
backs and ingenuity in the first place
here's why I think that the people
walking by the billboard in the distance
you don't react to it all are actually
furnishing to be with commercially
valuable data they're basically that is
that is a absolutely valuable piece of
information to have remember concert or
whatever i'm putting on the screen
hasn't managed to retaining the
attention of the people of all capacity
so this is essentially all being
passively deriving meaningful
financially selling data from our
activities in public place without our
knowledge without our consent and in a
way again even all the parameters of
personally identical identical tori
information that are associated with
this anyways they definitely come back
to lodge against our identity and the
situation is more complicated than that
still owe because we've so far been
talking about discrete objects and it's
got to be one of my concerns to think
about when power knowledge like this it
resides not just physical object itself
but in the khansama related things this
is an access control system in Barcelona
which is gathering information from an
embedded sensor bri over there but there
are other components of the system as
well there's the network bother itself
here which rises to block traffic
through the area there is an rfid touch
played over there where the keypad there
is a system of lighting and signage and
make sure that surrounds this object and
gives its effect in practice and
function in physicality law and again if
you're going to object to this you can
object any one of these components if
you think about them as components the
power knowledge doesn't really didn't
anyone of itself it's only you bring
these things together that they have
that kind of effect on public space and
things get people foggier when power
knowledge resides in code this is
something that my wife and I learn when
we were doing a series of walking tours
of cities around the world devoted
towards exploring an impact of
information gathering in public space we
were told a story in Wellington New
Zealand about a system of CCTV cameras
that have been installed by the city and
the city had actually put whether the
question of whether or not to install
these cameras to a public referendum and
state justification for the was traffic
sync against was protecting the rights
to help and security for people in the
city and when put forth in that way
under the guise of being about the
regulation of traffic and protection of
children and other people the referendum
was overwhelmingly favorable passed away
neatly cameras were authorized attempt
to install the next year after that new
software package became available in the
interpretation
coming from the stammers repurposed and
turning to the uses of the police
department you wanted to use them for
facial recognition and to track the
movement of no individuals to the public
space and magazine now what's
interesting to me about that is that the
object is were identical the camera has
no availability itself it's going down a
new generation of capability to English
and software has been deployed in the
back end and that cat wanders never put
so even it to somebody like me it feels
really strange Jasper well cameras you
can put that question to a hover
reference or not physically second
question too so I don't know exactly
what to do about this situation I think
that we can take a stab at defining and
even regulating around the presence of
discrete objects in public space they
gather information to the end you become
to articulate a definition some people
think it was a public object in this
definition is back in two thousand any
discrete object in a common spatial
domain that's intended for the use of
enjoyment of the general public any
artifact is located in our value on the
public right-of-way and any discrete
object which is the fact i shared I'm
accessible to the public regardless of
its ownership we were to the attention
having to find things that way I can
then we can begin a public discussions
about them and all of the communities in
which these things exist and we get to
bring to the surface some of the
profound questions in existing I would
argue that we need to actually put
brackets on how to construct the
presence of these dishes in our public
spaces with games of resisting
concentrations and symmetries
common knowledge resisting capture the
commons by private interest and ensuring
that where the public generates data
Republic has a meaningful access to your
ownership of that data and that was what
I want talking today hey cheese coming
up to install has anyone got any
questions for now how's everyone today
you will look lovely any questions write
up any one yet
i started a new yorker Astoria City
Council I started trying to raise these
issues to the radar of people who like
empowered to school here it's a giant
question at hand I can guarantee you
that these questions are the
particularly on the radar of my own
representatives there's a sole exception
they've kind of dropped like in call the
office and keeping it very very high
level language try to present this to
them and say this is something that you
should be thinking about because it's
already affecting your constituents and
will certainly affect your constituents
and leaders to come we begun to get some
traction and ultimately it's difficult
for you because I speak on your behalf
of the company is developing software
and services is username but also as a
citizen and what I'd like to see these
regulations around information
public spaces what I'd love to see is
regulation and protects my right and to
some degree an assumption but it's very
hard on public space that is
characterized big city since the Dominic
cities we're beginning to see some
regulatory interest in that I think that
that's slippery slope though and it's a
wire that somebody get bitten by this
pretty big problem way before I think
it's it's something of concern to write
with my little trouble is my yes well
over time you got to find this last time
yeah the plaza de gorge or Barcelona a
camera actually it's been yeah because
because of all of the states use
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
