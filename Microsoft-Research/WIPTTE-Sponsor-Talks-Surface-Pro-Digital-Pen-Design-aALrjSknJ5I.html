you
okay good afternoon where this is the
first in a series of sponsored
presentations this this the first
presentation is one that will be given
by Vinita to vara it was a group program
manager of the surface team and Darrell
Wilson was a program manager on the
surface team they were very they were
very interested in giving this
presentation there they're very excited
about doing this they've been planning
it for some time they could be talking
about the surface pro digital pen design
thank you all right good afternoon
everybody thank you so much for joining
thank you for so much for joining thank
you so much for making this session
possible when we say sponsored
presentation it is not a marketing spiel
I'm not going to sell any product here
we're just going to tell you some
stories first of all I get this
opportunity along with Dell on my team
to talk about our products to represent
a group of really smart people at
Microsoft who work on technology and
take the technology the next level every
day but for me what's most exciting is
to come here and see a group of people
who are taking that technology beyond
what we can imagine people who are
creating leadership positions in the
grassroots thinking about real users and
making a difference in the lives of
people so to the 400 odd people who are
here who are taking a leadership
position in technology in the education
space and creating youth readying our
youth for the future thank you for doing
that and so it's a big round of applause
from Microsoft and my colleagues for all
of you please join me today Darryl and I
are going to talk about the story of the
development of the surface pen no no big
demos or any presentations but gently
talking about what we as a team think
about when we try to solve these
problems what are the key things that we
care about and there are three parts of
the story why
what's a vision for Microsoft how does
the pen fit in the second one is what
are who are our customers what are the
scenarios in which they are using the
pen how does it fit into our overall
framework of Microsoft technologies
along the broad spectrum of hardware and
software and finally we've talked about
some of the technical challenges that
the team faces and how do we solve them
on a day to day basis so that's that's
the quick story but what you guys are
doing here is the most difficult thing
to do on a sunny day sitting inside in
Seattle it rarely happens so thank you
so so if you look at the history of
productivity in olden times thousands of
years back people had to walk thousands
of miles to deliver a message
then advent of writing comes in we right
hang letters to pigeons and send them
and deliver the message and that leaves
behind people time to do other stuff
that makes people's lives productive and
then Henry Griffin Berg invents the
printing press it's easy to communicate
further around the world and then
finally with the advent of Internet and
the digital revolution we are able to
send messages at an instant around the
world but one thing that remained
constant is the power of writing writing
is something so powerful so personal it
is an embodiment of your personality you
want to write when you sign your page we
we still sign our pages we still sign
when we pay make payments on a credit
card because it's something so
fundamentally close to defining our
identity so we think writing is not
going to go away anywhere the forms of
writing will change how we capture data
how we communicate in the digital world
will change but the idea of writing is
going to stay and our intent is to make
sure we take that and make it so
powerful that it becomes natural writing
in the digital age if surfaces vision is
to be the most productive planet on the
earth then the pen is something that's
going to enable that vision along with
the surface device so we are committed
to pen and inking yesterday you might
have heard announcements on Spartan and
few other things that I'll talk about
shortly we are
Julie committed both in hardware and
software perspective to make our writing
experience is great for our customers
who are our customers a lot of times we
travel we meet people customers partners
suppliers from around the world and some
people ask who cares about writing
anymore we just type emails now but
there are a few set of customers who
still earn a living capture thoughts
create new ideas and create imaginative
stuff and those are people who work in
offices they take notes in meetings
students know take notes
doctors are a huge category of people
who walk around take notes write notes
about their patients artists and
illustrators we have a group of people
who are constantly taking the pen
creating new pieces of art whether it is
with software created by third parties
or whether it is created by us there is
a whole spectrum of people who are
earning a living and making creative
stuff artisanal traders and then one of
the most important categories we have is
students and educators I
how many educators did everybody are
educators here okay and how many of you
used the surface pen I forgot to ask
that question
that is fantastic I'd like to hear more
towards the end but these these are the
set of audiences who are who are who are
so important to us that we are
constantly having a forum of these
audiences and then we go talk to them in
a constant basis get feedback and find
out what is relevant for them how do we
make the writing experience is great go
to the next one this is just a framework
it is not fully detailed so as we talk
about the session today we share some of
the stuff some of the stuff because of
confidentiality it'll be more at a
higher level but this is just to show
you how we think about the framework of
solving the problem there are several
things that impact the writing
experience there is latency palm
rejection like identifying whether it's
palm or your finger or your pen or
something else that is touching the
screen eraser when you erase the erase a
digital ink mark how do you make it feel
like an eraser and how do we solve that
problem storage pen touch ergonomics I
just listed a few
of them just to show you these are some
of the things that people care about use
a lot of times they are not able to
articulate it but they when they use it
we can see that it impacts their writing
experience and then depending on what
they do with the pen whether their
information workers sometimes it's the
same set of people a person might be an
information worker in the office but an
artist at home so but based on their
usage scenarios some of these factors
are different in terms of amplitude in
terms of impact it's going to be
different for each of those people so we
we kind of look at this and figure out
what's most impactful which audience and
how do we create a pen that addresses
the concerns of all these all these
people this is something I want to stop
and reflect students and teachers this
is these are the key things that we
found from our feedback from students
and teachers people like to take notes
very obvious signature where there is an
application form online application form
or PDFs navigating through tests art
sketches playing games duels during
classes and sometimes annotation so this
is something I want to show you think
okay sorry I will show you in the end I
was trying to annotate on the PowerPoint
we can annotate on the PowerPoint story
windows P and
nope okay sorry about that failure but
when you use the PowerPoint when you see
using the PowerPoint on your machine you
can actually put it in present mode and
so that's coming back what what Benitez
talking about is the scenario I think of
is in a classroom where the teacher
gives a material to the students
beforehand so they don't have to type
everything down or write everything down
with the Pens and they're able to
annotate a PowerPoint slide or a word
document or whatever they given in
real-time so a couple things with that
it makes it frees them up to listen to
the what's being taught I see some heads
nodding here and also that when you do
that writing that piece of writing it
down connects it to the memory so you
just remember it better later on too so
that to me is a really powerful
classroom scenario with the pen yeah and
then as thank you Darrell thank you for
continuing the conversation so as you
continue your presentations you can save
them save those annotations but then
there are contexts of use there are
devices that you operate your pen width
so pen is a complete ecosystem in itself
how does the device how do we influence
the device while designing the pen then
you do have to define define what the
pen needs to be and then there is an
external environment that people work in
you sit on a chair and try to use this
people sit on airplane seats and do it
so there is a context around usage so we
look at each of these factors and say
how do we solve the problem
input detection how do we find whether
it's a finger or a palm or a pen and
there is a lot of algorithmic work that
Darrell and the operating system teams
that they do to figure out what's the
best way to find out whether it is a
palm so that doesn't react to it whether
it is finger where you're trying to
navigate or a pen you're trying to write
or maybe tap something backward
compatibility this is this is where I
think a lot of times we say hey at what
you will leave behind the past there is
constant innovation happening in the
industry there is the heart our heart
says yeah we have sold so many products
to our customers if it changed the
platform it's going to hurt them how do
we think about it so this is a constant
battle for every every company in this
industry because we're constantly
looking at new technology our goal is to
make sure we don't like we make it easy
for our customers to transition but
there are times when we had to make
drastic changes to move to a new
technology because the trade-off in
features and benefits that you get out
of those are much higher than what you
would get by just keeping sticking to
what we have so it's a shift that we
have to constantly battle with when you
write with a pen the other thing that
comes to mind is screen dependencies
there are different screen suppliers we
have so when you define design a surface
device there are suppliers like Samsung
or LG or sharp there are so many people
supplying screens and depending on the
screen that you pick your writing
experience going to be different because
there is there is coding this kind of
glass that is used all these things
matter screen protectors a lot of people
buy screen protectors to protect their
screen and there is absolutely no
control that we have on what anybody can
go and buy so how do we how do we think
about those challenges and how do we
simulate some of those conditions to say
okay depending on the different friction
levels that we have screen protectors
available or simulating some of those
friction levels we we go and try and
develop new chemicals materials and nibs
working with suppliers and partners so
that's that's one and just like I
mentioned screen dependencies that is
impact dirt and dust and oil when people
use it leave it in their cars for long
periods of time or your kids use greasy
hands how do you make sure that the pan
can still right so these are some fun
challenges we get to work on a
day-to-day basis this is one story I
want to tell you angle instability so
when we use the pen on the device so
this is where some of the interaction
between the 10 and the device plays a
big role in how we define our
experiences on the device when we launch
surface pro 2
we had a three stop hinge I don't know
how many have you seen that at the end
of surface put the awesome awesome yeah
you should you should race it and show
it surface bro - it's a great machine
it's an absolutely great machine we run
a lot of our team members run pro
engineer and like really advanced
modeling software awesome so she talked
to you so when we talk to customers the
feedback was hey so we look when to do a
whole spectrum of customers the the
slide that we earlier saw information
workers are their students and so on and
we said hey what's the most preferred
position and we were kind of observing
them and they were using the device and
we give me dummies and they came back
and said this position this position
this position and we couldn't find a
statistically significant data on what's
the right position to lock in is it
three is four and then we said as a team
hey what if we just made it continuous
continuous for friction it is not an
easy thing to do I'm sure you see it in
current laptops you have one it is a
full friction hinge but they but the
challenge with the surface device is the
center of gravity is on the top unlike a
traditional laptop because the weight of
the base helps you hold it and this is a
light a light stand so we had to design
something that had a torque curve which
gave us about 10 degrees free moments so
that it is easy for anybody just open it
and then I wish I could sketch somewhere
but the torque curve went something like
this you if it if the torque went on
this axis and the degrees you had to go
10 degrees flat and then the curve had
to go up and the curve would go down
like that so it's a it's a really
complicated thing to do it took about
seven engineers seven parts seven seven
months of effort on this across like
literally the supply chain for this
hinges across China so it is such a
complicated work to make it happen
so the funny thing is when you start
writing on this at this
it is totally fine but when you actually
take it backwards you want to make sure
that the torque is high enough to hold
the weight as well as the writing
pressure and the writing pressure
changes as you change this angle so it's
it's a super fun project that we had to
go solve finally this is how of course
many of you have it but those of you
don't have it this is a video that I
wanted to play and these are all the
angles at which we tested the pen and
how it works and how how we wanted to
make sure it can kind of beautiful
beautifully with all the pressure of
writing let's go the next one is so we
talked about the device how we there is
a close interaction between the device
in the pen and now we talk about what
are the different functions when we
design a pen there is the question are
we design this is a digital pen should
it make it a traditional pen just like
pilot Mont Blanc or anything else or
what else can be acted this is a memory
we can add can we write can we is the
one when you're using the pen should the
pen be a mouse or should we have two
both of them and how do you think about
the interaction paradigm so that's a
question we constantly answer I try to
answer and figure out whether it's a
mouse or a pen and if it's a pen if it
does justice writing or what features
can be added and then one of the things
that we ended up adding as a team is the
OneNote feature that dad will talk about
that's fascinating innovation how we
thought about it location airplane seats
I remember when we were doing the hinge
test one of the things I told the team
is hey we should be able to sit on an
airplane seat in economic class and
should be able to operate the hinge and
write on it so I actually called a
friend of mine Boeing he's a technical
fellow he shaped our succeeds and every
time we had prototypes made we sat on
that as a team and figure out okay does
it work if it fails we go back to the
drawing board and kind of tweak the talk
levels so it was a fun experiment but
this just goes to show how much we are
committed to hearing from our customers
understanding the pain and kind of
addressing them power consumption how do
we decide whether it is a rechargeable
battery versus a
Corde or a triple-a battery so there is
a lot of function so there is a writing
experience there is a Bluetooth module
that we'll talk about shortly in the pen
so there are a lot of functions in the
pen that draw power at certain point we
need to figure out when do we start
moving to a rechargeable battery and
there is a constant trade-off there are
benefits of recharge ability because a
rechargeable battery not only gives us
the ability to recharge in not having
the customer insert or buy a new battery
all the time but it also gives us the
ability to make the pen thinner for
example if you see some of the Samsung
pens they're really thin rechargeable
they can dock inside this dock inside
the device but one one thing that was
true not for us was we are designing a
pen for great writing experience not for
great storage but great writing
experience we wanted to make sure
artists and illustrators can hold the
pen for four or five hours in a day and
not be kind of tired so economics was
very fundamental to our design design
idea so the diameter of our pen is 9.1
millimeters and the the right range
ergonomic range is between eight point
five to about ten point five so we had
to play with between the right range and
make sure that the holding comfort is
great the other question is now that we
are not making the pen thinner how do
you store of course we had a clip that
you can you can actually store the pen
or you can or should be able to dock it
and we decided to go with the clip
because it as I said if you are trying
to create a natural user interface
you're saying hit pen is something that
somebody carries personally and carries
just like a pen there are other funny
things that happen as a part of the
exercise reliability is one one such
thing now when we define design the tip
how do we design how long the tip should
last it's it's a very difficult question
and people use it some people use it
once in a week some people never use it
and some people use it every day for
hours together so we have to find the
right curve in terms of usage patterns
and find out how do we get to you know
ideal would be close to Six Sigma but
where does the business trade-off happen
which should we ship them separate tips
or
you know how do we how do we design that
that's that's another challenge that we
face and our tips currently in the
market are doing really well we we had
some tips which were softer but we've
replaced with more longer-lasting tips
and that's that's a question we
constantly ask how do we make sure the
writing experience is great and it lasts
longer because more the friction the
less of the life the more is going to
kind of wear off so that's the problem
we get solved clip strength drop screen
impact how do you make sure people if
they're hitting they don't break the
screen so these these are some of the
challenges and in the end if you have
specific questions we can we can answer
those the next one yeah and then we do a
lot of innovation on software and that's
where Darryl my friend is going to talk
to you about it so my turn and I'm
Darryl Wilson and to give you an idea
what I do is I'm a software and firmware
p.m. in the surface coupe and I work on
both pen and touch and so what that
means to me is we want to make pen and
touch the experience that will make
people put away the MacBook like you had
and just use our device so I do want to
ask you do you have a surface pro as
well yeah gotcha so when you when you
use your Mac do you ever try and touch
the screen yeah so that's that's a
problem I've yeah we've heard those
complaints and also I'll say that much
and so yeah okay but so my point with
that is I I'm one of my sons has a Mac I
didn't buy it came from grandpa and
often times when we sit down to go to
work together on it I'll touch the
screen and I and I'm like oh there you
go dude you can't use this you need a
surface so I know for me using touch and
pen all the time is just automatic now
and I need that interaction and it makes
me more productive so
what I want to talk about a little bit
is is our our technologies and some of
our features so as we went from surface
pro to and had ideas for surface pro 3
we were thinking what can what scenarios
can we expand upon and and make this a
super valuable product and one of them
was the click with the pen and who hands
up anyone who's used to click with the
pen good seen it on commercials alright
so a little bit familiar with it we've
heard that feedback too so we'll
continue on here yeah it's a fun to
fidget with - okay so we do incorporate
this experience - we used our Bluetooth
technology in the pen so it has a active
digitizer on one side and bluetooth on
the other side to enable the scenarios
and so what we wanted to build was for
someone to have a thought and instantly
be able to click that button either so
you're not logged in or when you're
logged in and instantly created take
that thought down so you think of a
notebook what what do you have to do to
take a note in a notebook you open your
notebook you click your pen you start
writing so that's the type of experience
that we wanted to also get with the
surface pro 3 as we continue on we get
feedback like you've just mentioned and
will continue to improve the experience
so there's there's good things coming we
can't talk about all the stuff we're
going to do but there's definitely good
things coming so with the collaboration
with OneNote in Windows it was a it was
a great cross company effort it wasn't
very easy to do but it was we're very
happy with the feature and we continue
to work with our partners in Windows and
an office to continue making great
experiences
so when also when you think of pen it's
not just pen it's touch - so when you
put your hand on the screen you have to
make sure that we know the pen is
touching and that you don't
- you're not using your fingers so part
of that is palm rejection we work with
our partner in in Israel and trig and
also with Intel and we with osg which is
our windows partners and we continue to
improve that experience and and figure
out when you're touching it with your
palm and when you're writing and to make
sure that's a seamless experience so
there's good stuff going on in threshold
for that another item in that's coming
in threshold is direct ink it's does did
anyone see the build presentations
yesterday announced so one of the things
they had in build was a new browser
called Spartan which is I think the
official name is edge but one of the
great features in that is that is inking
they're using direct ink in Spartan edge
and what that allows you to do is to
have a consistent platform across
Windows that you can ink in different
applications and share that ink so in
Spartan you can annotate with pen and
you can change you can convert that to
text and you save that in that web page
so you save it as a favorite you go back
to that web page and it has your
annotations and your notes there and you
can share it off to different
applications - you can send that to a
friend the great thing about the direct
ink is it's a platform that allows
different application developers to use
that platform to quickly have inking in
their in their app that's consistent
across different apps so before people
would have to roll their own they'd have
to come up with their own ideas on how
to put menus up there how to get
different colors and highlighters etc
now that that's built into Windows and
we know that the success of an operating
system is how many people develop on it
we saw Apple do fantastic with their
their phones and their iPads because it
was a great application development
platform and this is what Windows
continues to drive to and is succeeding
in and enabling these different
scenarios
pressure curve so also considering how
different people use the pen so artists
maybe want a different pressure curve
you might not be aware but with our
surface pro 3 pen it's pressure
sensitive so you touch it lightly you
get a thin line you press hard to line
thickens so this enables different
people like artists using Adobe or if
you're taking notes is to control the
way that how hard you press what happens
as your ink comes out I've got a peak
around the corner so third-party
applications I talked about those a
little bit on what's to come but also we
work with third-party app developers
directly some people will we initiate
planning and roadmaps so that as we roll
out features there they're provided a
heads up and we develop those together
and some we see an opportunity where an
application is trying to do something
and we say hey we've got this technology
and api's we think you can do it quicker
and better and we directly contact them
and work work with them office in
Windows so I touched on that a little
bit I'm a little bit biased but we've
got some good stuff coming this year and
I'm really excited about it most nights
I pulled my hair out about it but I'm
really looking forward to it so of
course as part of the things we can't
talk about there's but there's some good
stuff coming and and it really depends
on the collaboration with our windows
partners with our n-trig who does our
our touch platform and intel intel's a
big part of as well so there's a lot of
moving pieces this years we bit off a
lot but it's going to be fantastic when
it's all comes public all right I'll
hand it back to the need thank you yeah
our teams are very closely tied at the
hip Dallas team taking care of all the
software side my team taking care of all
the hardware side but we are really not
different teams with just just one team
working together across Microsoft so
that's that's an exciting thing from
software we'll just shift to a little
bit more physics
physics at one o'clock in the afternoon
we will still do it so when we think
about function we think about what we
talked about what does the pen should do
the fundamental thing is the bench
should write and when we say how do we
create natural writing experiences
what's the natural user experience how
do you break it down so when people
write there are three things I mean
among other things like lighting and
kind of paper and pen and everything
among other things there are three
things that really happen
one when you touch the pen or pencil to
the paper you get a certain amount of
friction and then you get a tactile feel
on your hand and then there is a sound
associated with that friction these
three things constitute fundamentally in
terms of like getting the writing
experience into your brain so that's why
a lot of times when you write with
digital pens you don't feel that the
writing are you slipping so over like
tight since time immemorial that's been
ingrained into our DNA's and that's
something we are kind of trying to solve
how do we how do we create that
experience in a digital world
as opposed to an analogue world so there
is a lot of good that we do in terms of
optimizing the software optimizing the
pressure curves that Darrell talked
about how do we get the right chemicals
chemical ingredients in the in the tip
so that when it rubs against glass how
do you get that field so that's those
are some really cool investments that we
do tip friction we just talked about
briefly which is when the friction is
higher the life is shorter and how do
you make sure what's the trade-off how
do you make sure the customer is not
pained by not having a tip when he when
he or she really needs it
parallax is another interesting concept
when you write pen on paper you really
touch the surface when you write with a
digital pen what happens is there are
three layers so there is a glass layer
there is a digitizer layer if you have a
screen protector there is another one
and then there is the layer where the
capacitive layer of pen functions right
so there is a digitizer below so if you
look at the stack up it can it can vary
from few millimeters few microns to few
millimeters and depending on what
Solutions you pick so what happens is
when you touch your pen your before you
touch the disguiser you've already
touched the glass so your pen is about
your actual touch surface by a
millimeter or so and then when you look
at it the eye gets deceived am i
touching what am i touching it is very
confusing it's like you know like
looking at a fish through the water in
the lake exactly you're it's a good
example so how do you solve that problem
we can make the glass thinner that makes
the life of the device poorer if you if
you solve the parallax then whether you
should project the dot straight here or
you project dot perpendicular here how
do you how do you solve that and there
is a lot of algorithmic stuff that we do
in the entry ship that we ship today to
make that absolutely minimal as possible
to stare is that is something that adds
to the accuracy as well accurate yeah
accuracy we talked about again where you
touch is it exactly where you see that
it touches so there is there is accuracy
because what happens is in a capacitive
we will talk about that in the platform
a little bit but in the capacitive what
happens is there are transparent blind
conductive lines there is a hash and
then when the pen comes closer to it the
hash actually acts like antenna and pen
is like a radio so it takes up the
closest dot and it depends on the
refinement of those transparent
conductive lines or containers that have
that is in the digitizer that you can
get absolutely precise starts so it's
there is communication happening within
these two just like a radio
communication and then you have to find
the precise start as you're writing so
it's a it's a fascinating thing to solve
so we spend a lot of energy on making
sure that when you touch the pen it
actually touches where you intended to
touch platform there's a lot of
questions that we get on platform that
is there are really credible players in
the market that is walk home that is
Atmel that is intrigue there is a
doughnut there's so many players in the
market and each of them are great
solutions they are all picked based on
there are business decisions there are
technical constraints that each of us
each of these companies try to solve
fundamentally there are three kinds of
technologies one is electromagnetic in
the electromagnetic what happens is you
have the screen display and then below
that you have kind of playing our coils
it's think of it like a transformer so
one end of the transformer is below in
in the form of plainer coils and then
the other end of the transformer an
additional set of coils is in the pen so
as the pen approaches within about 15
millimeters it can identify our magnetic
signals and that's how the pen kind of
calibrates where it is reaching out and
then identifies the dots
that's electromagnetic and that is
passive it's like fake finger some of
the some of the pens that you see it's
like a fake finger yeah so basically you
use the same touch technology but kind
of fake the material to make it feel
like you you're actually touching you
the finger and the third one is active
capacity which is what we use that is
the intricate nology so in surface pro 2
we had Wacom which is the
electromagnetic and then we decided to
move to active capacitive purely because
it gives us better latency and better
performance in the in the scenarios that
we operate in we care about Wacom
operates and with some specific
audiences it's great for them so it's
purely based on what works for us each
of them are great technologies in
themselves so that's how we picked the
active capacity yes that is correct the
one that she's using it doesn't have
battery yes so yeah so battery enables
you to open up a new set of scenarios
that because you have power and with
power and bluetooth you can open up a
whole new set of scenarios there is a
lot of innovation work that is going to
come up in the next generation of pens
the teams are constantly working on it
I'll be killed if I talk about it so we
will stay there
I don't know who talked about it yes so
there is there is a lot of stuff yeah we
can have accelerometers GPS and
everything potential I'm not saying we
are going to do it but yeah so that
those are those are the things that we
think about so what did we finally build
this is just a kind of Explorer view of
the pen just so you know what are the
different components that go in there
are about 170 different components that
go into the pen that's amazing and all
into this little size so just like
Darrell mentioned we we had a front pen
which is what does the writing and the
arrays functions with a button and then
we have the backend which does the
Bluetooth which does communication with
the OS and enables OneNote and other
capabilities that's a couple years ago
too and they they said I'll be working
on the pen on the firmware part of the
Bluetooth I thought ah that's easy that
will get it done in a month or so that
was not the case you have to think about
it from end to end from
manufacturability servicing and customer
first used through through battery life
so it's even a tiny little thing like a
pen it's it's pretty complex and it
takes a lot of people thinking about a
lot of scenarios to to deliver it so
yeah complicated it's a very complex
ecosystem so where our customers using
it
hopefully my video works
features of Sipan is the fact that it
feels and it looks like the real plan
and it still is our silence is really
important wet feels in your hands
basically website you name it they all
wrote the same way and then we're
writing in a different pan on digital
paper there's nothing beautiful about
that continuity my name is Lawson Capua
and I am a doctorate student you think a
service hang has been a very
transformative experiences interacting
with the computer in a totally different
way I can actually hand write my notes
right directly onto the screen which
helps me remember them better and score
higher on my tests the pen is also great
because I can use it in Photoshop and
and illustrator as opposed to using the
mouse and the keyboard the ten gives me
much more control over what I'm doing on
screen my name is Seth one year
I'm an assistant professor at the
University of Washington I do fantastic
research space propulsion fusion energy
a fusion spacecraft would allow you to
go to Mars in a month instead of mine
so as a scientist I can worked it into
one note and recall all my notes as well
as together to write equations very very
quickly I had to put one in one very
portable computer desert pro 3 that
saved me enormous amount of time this is
product reading the set of pen allowed
me to go outside and compose whatever I
like total freedom to go any method to
like anything that's something this
unique then it's great to have to be
able to highlight a circle take notes
and have infinite number of colors as an
infinite number of highlighters so now I
just have one thing I have to bring the
comedic laugh one of the greatest orman
I need to talk to do flow of diagrams
and charts and paint very quickly and
the pen is the fastest way of doing it
it really feels like the evolution of
pen gives you that ability to think
musically the right actually
so that's it what we had to talk about
we want to save about 15 minutes for Q&amp;amp;A
any questions on your mind and then for
those of you are interested this is say
enlarged version of the hinge that we
developed we can have a this is just a
bigger version about 7 pieces that come
together friction levels materials
coatings everything and this is a
cross-section of the pen just for you to
see just in case you're interested what
goes inside sure absolutely
so on behalf of me thank you for this
opportunity
yeah so the native inking in the OS
level is that going to be integrated
into modern apps I'm not sure if they're
called modern apps anymore you'd be a
bit more specific on what's what sort of
things you're thinking about and so I am
RPGs doing I'm developing modern app
currently in Windows 8.1 and I'm looking
into the possibility of integrating the
more standard way of inking on the on
the application and I'm interested in
learning what the kinds of data I can
actually gather from that ink yeah such
as located location pressure data hover
data that kind of thing ok so I don't
know the answer to that question if you
send me an email
I'm on the bottom list there all right
follow up for you but specifically the
direct ink platform is available for for
modern apps ok in Windows 10 all right
thank you
since this recording will just give you
the mic Auto Union for corn I'm a PhD
student and as usual here's my episode
that I was developing a touch panel
occasional windows tablet and you know
obviously because of the palm rejection
it doesn't recognize my touch when
Penny's on hover so I should get down to
the OS level to hack the signal and then
we reverse-engineer the signal and no
extract out the signals up back to touch
plasma pen so it doesn't know it my
point here is the pen interaction itself
is not only about the pen but also about
OS level but also the application is
involved such as the my favorite feature
of the surface rated when you push the
button and I will not come out then what
i reconcile about this is it recurs i
cross-department show
coordination of those into play or
tension tension management so I want to
hear how you guys are doing with your
write the pen is a ecosystem in itself
so for example let's look at latency
latency is a function of what happens in
the pen what happens is the digitizer
and how much the application is tuned
for example OneNote is the most most
beautifully tuned for latency we have
today so we we have to do it at all
those levels and I don't know for the
operating system you have used Windows
10 or using Windows 8.1 okay so
hopefully with Windows 10 and the inking
investments that we're making there
should be some difference can't talk
about it
there's yeah so you'll hopefully be
happier but I can't speak of specifics
yeah we have to wait for some more time
to talk about that but we've heard that
feedback there's a lot of work that's
happening in in that space absolutely
well no one does ten is released
so I'm I'm a p.m. on the input platform
game okay
so just just to clarify so you what are
you like are you asking for both pen and
touch together
well III couldn't follow oh it's a cross
color Cross group collaboration question
okay we I don't know you but that's good
we are a big company as 130,000 people
independent in that we are constantly
working closely with office team with
the OneNote team with the operating
system team with the Bing team everybody
so every week I think from a software
perspective there's constant reviews in
terms of what hardware investments
making how does it impact the software
how to impact the applications so the
teams are crossing paths all the time
and we have a regular rhythm of reviews
to make sure when the customer gets an
experience is it's a kind of connected
experience and a lot of times like it is
not easy when you acquire a company like
Nokia you have technologies which is
completely new and certain points in
time we have to make a business decision
for the sake of integrating should we do
it or should we make it so that it's
it's a great customer experience so
there is a constant trade-off that
happens but no doubt we are one company
it just takes time to schedule people
and meet meet with each other but that's
a different thing but we we operate like
one company thank you for jumping in
okay just as a point of clarification so
the inking overlay is it strictly going
to be in the edge browser or is that
kind of the operating system why the
platforms available operating system
wide for applications that support it so
they have the ability to call those
platform api's
and I think you're probably the expert
on that that you can speak to it but in
in Spartan that's that's a specific app
that uses that platform so as you
mentioned the direct link is the new API
said so any application you could create
a universal Windows app and call in
those api's and you could do it it's
it's it's open since one of the most
important economic features from users
point of view is being able to write in
a more small precise manner that they
think reflects their range paper what do
you think the most important factors are
in terms of the hardware and software
and what not Hardware primarily to try
to support writing smaller in a more
precise way and in your own evaluations
how far off is the size of writing
comparable content on a tablet versus
the paper sure so definitely it's a
great question if you write on one note
today or let's say if you write an email
with handwriting if you try to write
with a pen the text is usually larger
and it's a combination of what happens
in the pen and largely on the software
side so be constantly working on it I
can't tell you how far we get from from
an experience perspective we are we are
far from they should be but how fear far
we are from solving it I can tell you
that but we are working on it as teams
to be working on it to make sure when
you write you can kind of calibrate the
size of the font to what you're writing
because I understand what your question
is which is when you write you feel like
hey why am i writing so big but if I'm
writing on paper I write small yeah
we're constantly working on it I have a
pen friction that's what I think of when
you want to write how you write on paper
yeah is having the pen friction on the
screen being as close as possible to a
pen on paper so for me that's part of it
the other piece is palm rejection too if
people are afraid that if they put their
palm
arrests on it and they hover and they
try and write when they hover their
writing is going to be different so the
better we make the palm rejection as
customers get used to understanding that
I can put my hand down and write how I
would put my hand down on a piece of
paper that'll get it closer to a pen on
paper experience yeah another quick
question I had was just if you're doing
any longitudinal studies looking at the
ergonomics of the pen and minimization
of repetitive stress in terms of
different pen
ergonomics or the friction or other
issues I'm also interested in that sure
yeah we we have not to be honest we have
not done repetitive stress on that
stress studies on how using pen it's a
big company I don't know if somebody's
doing it but I would love to know but
this is some so right now our our goal
is to make sure the pen can write
beautifully right right like natural
writing experience so that there is more
adoption with surface pro 3 we have seen
like huge uptake in pen usage once we
see that usage and we start what next
step would be we can start measuring how
people are using it and what what the
stress levels are yeah so it's there is
a curve that we need to kind of pass to
get to that level unfortunately many
question comments more of an account
question than I than a hardware question
but I'm a director of technology for a K
through 12 school and our some of our
teachers are using surface pro 3 s and I
thought the clicking the button going
right to OneNote you know even if you're
the computers locked was a really neat
feature
it requires having a Microsoft account
though so doing that for students
especially students under 13 shows a
little bit difficult from our
perspective if there was a way around
that or if it required an office 365
account instead of a instead of a
Microsoft account I'd be really good for
us sure yeah we'd take that feedback can
you send me an email
yeah
surface app it's just just one quick
note on it the names change to surface
app because we have something else come
now so yeah go to the store search on
surface out mmm exactly there so so I
find the palm rejection problem so
annoying what I would really love to do
is to be able to quickly turn touch off
entirely and turn it back on again later
and it's amazingly hard to do I've seen
registry hacks for doing it but I've not
seen a sort of like civilized so it's my
job that you don't want to do that
anymore if I'm still working here in
september/october then I've hopefully
succeeded and I don't send me to the
next place
but seriously great feedback do you have
do you find that you hit the windows
button at all or do you find you just
yeah which application are you using it
yeah so one thing over there is so
generally when when pen comes in touch
with surface pen takes over touches a
skill so when you hold your pen up in
your finger your your above what is
called the hover height and so
and down here I like like we need says I
can die was much but you know we are
aware of it we are working on it but
hopefully later
yeah thank you for that but for any of
this feedback I really would like so I
think Vanitas well Addis sent an email
to both of us I can't promise that will
specifically address what's going on but
this is a great forum to hear all your
everybody's feedback of what challenges
you face and I also hear it like to hear
what you like to great I was just gonna
come in on that too cuz you're looking
why am I using a surface pro 2 and
that's exactly the reason I I need my
pen to write when I want to write and I
don't want to have to sleep I don't want
have to worry about the battery dying I
don't want to have to worry about it me
clicking when I don't mean to click and
I I take all my notes in OneNote I've
been doing this for you know I don't
know how many years now 10 I don't know
a long time I don't know when OneNote
came out it's been a long time and when
I switched the surface pro 3 the pen
wasn't as reliable as my Wacom pen is
and I wound up switching back I got
frustrated with it and just I went
through three pins and I went back to my
my reliable walk home because if you
look at my pen I'm on a surface this
isn't a surface pen it's a Samsung pen
that I was able to change my nib out
because I didn't like the nibs it came
with with the Pens they were too hard
for me and I liked softer nibs so I
wanted a pen I could change my nib in to
either them work that's his butt on the
line for that yes yes just to be mean so
yeah if I'm if I'm working here in
September
both of if not I'd send you my resume
I'd won those that kind of a follow up
on the on the nib as far as the nibs go
you spoke about a spectrum of users
right you know some are casual and some
just may use it periodically in that
case it'll last forever and then there's
that other side of the spectrum with
artists and illustrate
maybe we're down really quickly and so
how did you find that compromise and of
you know I guess kind of finding some
kind of middle ground and then do you
see a future where there might be
interchangeable tips and absolutely yeah
yes the future is where we will have
options for tips or we will think about
getting that spectrum even better than
what we have today there is a lot of
work that's going on in terms of finding
the right material yeah I can talk more
about it but we are committed to getting
that right right now the the friction is
slightly lower because we want to have
the tip last longer as you can see
earlier we launched with a softer tip
which was great in terms of writing
experience but people people give us
feedback hey it's wearing out faster we
would like to have we like to see that
different and based on the kind of
volume of feedback we we went and fixed
that last awful August but we are
committed to getting that right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
