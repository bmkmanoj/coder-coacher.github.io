clay is a fabulous author some of you
might have read his book here comes
everybody or you might read things like
the New York Times wired the wall street
journal Harvard Business Review he he
often writes about collective action
internet society and you know new ways
that people interact online and really
you know aside from all of his awesome
honors clay is a good great old friend
of mine if I ever have any questions to
ask about you know we're social going or
you know what's happening around the
world that's really provocative and
thought-provoking long term in the
future the first person I always go to
his clay and that's why we thought you
guys might love hearing him talk to
close up faculty summit so with that um
welcome clay shirky thank you all thanks
very much I want to start start with a
story about the early days of the
internet which even though the
technology is considerably advanced from
there is still a story which I think
with I think a lot of resonance today
the internet in in something contiguous
with its current form came up in October
of 69 and after the initial idea of
packet switching and networking these
computers together the design documents
called for the development of two
applications telnet which was remote
access to computers so that you could
log into a computer held elsewhere and
do work on that computer as if you owned
it as if you had it in your own
environment an FTP File Transfer
Protocol which provided remote access to
data you could go get data off another
computer and bring it locally and the
designers of ARPANET as it was then
called got telnet and FTP working and
they distributed it to the researchers
who were attached to the network and the
result was pretty underwhelming actually
the not much use of either of those
applications it turns out that although
the logic of telnet was
other people can own computer so you
don't have to everybody actually wanted
to own their own computer people turned
out to be much more interested in their
own data than in remote data and so on
and so it looked a little bit like a an
interesting experiment but not much more
than that and then the third application
appeared this is not an application
specified the original design documents
it was not an application that anyone
had directed the people working on the
on ARPANET to build it was in fact the
port of a different application that had
been written on a multi-user system at
MIT called multics and Ray Tomlinson the
guy who ported it over in 1971 said
let's see how this thing we've got up at
MIT called electronic mail does on
ARPANET so a port an email over 1971 and
within three months email messages had
become 75% of the backbone traffic
across the entirety of the ARPANET it
turns out that remote access to machines
and remote access to data paled in
comparison in terms of people's desire
to use it to remote access to other
people so hold that thought this is a
crowdsourced camera right now the idea
of a camera is it captures a kind of an
objective view of whatever it's pointing
out in the idea of crowdsourcing in the
parallel without sourcing is that it
provides some sort of replicable way to
generate material over and over again
but that's not really the way this
camera works this is a descriptive
camera it was done by Matt Richardson
who was at the interactive
telecommunications program just
graduated in fact the descriptive camera
takes a picture as you would expect a
camera to do but instead of showing the
user the picture it uploads it to
mechanical turk on amazon and it says
hey for a buck 25 we'll we'll pay you a
buck 25 to describe this picture people
log in they describe the picture and
then when the camera prints out is a
little printer receipt printer of what
what was in the picture frame at the
time you click the button it takes
between three and six minutes and you
get stuff like this you get a building
and the caption reads this is a faded
picture of a dilapidated building it
seems to be run down and in the need of
repairs except repairs is spelled wrong
repairs so this is neither objective in
the way we expect cameras to be or
replicable in the way we expect hard
sourcing to be and what I love about
this is what the descriptive camera
tells us is that whenever you get human
beings involved things get a little bit
weird the systems you expect to behave
in a kind of normal or ordinary way
start to get bent once you start
applying human judgment so Facebook
famously the largest collection of human
attention and any application on the
planet recently launched graph search in
which you can search for people based on
their characteristics right and you can
of course dooset logic on graph search
which is show me the people with this
characteristic and that characteristic
and so a guy named Tom Scott decided he
was one of the early people given access
to graph search he would just he decided
he would look through and see what some
interesting graph Search's you could do
were so here's one where people who like
the virulent lee anti-gay group focus on
the family and also the actor Neil
Patrick Harris right here's a graph
search of people who like whoops ah the
the violently anti-immigrant British
political party the english defence
league and also like curry right these
are not categories these are not
overlaps that make any sense and it's
tempting to say whenever you get humans
involved in your data things go awry it
would be better to do without them right
we would have it we would have a better
stab at getting at something important
to real if we could just ignore stuff
like this we didn't have to worry about
when people had conflicting or
misapprehensions about what it was they
were liking but even that even that
impulse can't be supported over the long
haul because at the same time the humans
mess things up when we get them involved
in the data they're also we're also
essential to understanding
a lot of what we care about in the world
so if you think about neighborhoods
where is the neighborhood that is that
is a category that matters to people we
know things about neighborhoods we care
about neighborhoods we think of
ourselves as coming from neighborhoods
going to neighborhoods understanding
what a neighborhood is like and yet the
concept neighborhood isn't a hard-edged
fact it's a consensus delusion around
the maps of particular cities so guy
named Andy Woodruff went around Boston
just asking people what are the borders
of these neighborhoods so here's the
border of allston here's the border of
Brighton here's the borders of Chinatown
and in every one of these maps as you
can see the dark blue areas places where
there's broad agreement these are the
streets these are the blocks that are in
this neighborhood the teal part of the
map is where there's a little bit better
than 5050 agreement but not broad
agreement and then the light green stuff
is the place where there is some
agreement one in four to one and two
people say this is in this neighborhood
and you can see how various the edges of
the neighborhoods are when you go for
the consensus you in fact remarkably
Chinatown there's almost nothing that
people agree on of the total area that
Chinatown could occupy in Boston right
the places that are the centrally agreed
upon blocks are a tiny tiny fraction of
that so you simultaneously can't do
without neighborhoods as a way of
thinking about cities and you also can't
generate any kind of hard edged facts
about them you have to accept right that
when we're gathering human information
it's not just that the data is messy
that makes it sound like it's something
that can be easily cleaned up it's that
the mess is real right that we have to
be dealing when we're dealing with this
kind of data we have to be dealing with
these kind of conflicting and
overlapping edges doesn't just happen in
Boston if you look at the red line at
the center of the graph here that is
what people in London report is the
edges the borders of the neighborhood
called shoreditch which is a place where
many of the
city's startup internet businesses are
all of the other intersecting
neighborhoods have overlap with shortage
fairly dramatically so the amount of
area that is shortage and shortage alone
is again a tiny subset of the total area
that people call shortage that is shared
with other of these overlapping
neighborhoods right there's no way to
get around these kinds of problems Kate
Crawford who was a researcher at the
Northeast R&amp;amp;D lab Microsoft nerd talks
about Big Data and one of the things
that she is one of one of the messages
she constantly emphasizes that if you
have access to a large data set that's
not a shortcut for having access to the
truth you still have to ask yourself the
hard questions about how are we going to
construe this data as being meaning how
are we going to construe this data as
being something valuable something we
can work with and the message of all of
these maps going to need all of the
examples I'm putting up here are that
it's impossible to get human beings
involved without also getting human
beings involved that once you do
something whether it's a descriptive
camera or a map of London right you are
bringing in exactly the kind of
messiness that can't always be cleaned
up or washed away and you can take this
even further you can dispense with
existing neighborhood names this is a
project called live hood out of Carnegie
Mellon which says if people associate
with one another and they hang out in
places that where the self consistency
of those patterns is constitutive of a
neighborhood we don't need neighborhood
names we don't need Street borders we'll
just look at check-ins and we'll cluster
will take Foursquare check-ins and we'll
cluster this so that we can detect where
the neighborhoods are naturally
occurring so this is a place where
you've even even reversed the order
you're not just using humans to try and
detect the edges of existing
neighborhood names you're actually using
human input to try and develop the idea
of a neighborhood
full stop and those those kinds of
experiments are places where when you
bring people in the data together you
have to rethink what it is you know
about stuff like maps which seem like
hard-edged unambiguously labeled objects
but when you see the way people actually
use the city when people actually use
the space all that illusion of
hard-edged uniquely named entities
starts to break down so it's easy enough
to say for something like a city
collection of neighborhoods well yes
that's always messy Realtors among other
people have an incentive to sort of
change neighborhood names as as they go
along but there are places where you can
count on people just dealing in kind of
hard edged clearly defined entity and
surprisingly wherever you look whenever
humans are involved places where that
seems to be true even even in those
environments the human condition
reappears so this is this is a
screenshot from the bugzilla bug
database for a Firefox for the web
browser Firefox and this is bug number
330 884 and this is just a regular bug
reporting site people come in and say it
my software crashed under these
circumstances and the software engineers
come in and say either we've we've seen
this bug and we fix it or whatever bug
3308 it for jalou because it began this
way row so ah this user and her
then-fiance used the same windows
computer and one day when she was using
firefox and telling it to ignore saving
a login password for a particular site
it showed her all the rest of the sites
for which the user had opted out of
saving the password sites like jdate and
match.com and on down the list and then
she says
so this this is the bug report on
bugzilla and the Firefox engineers come
in this actually this is not this is not
a Firefox bug this is you guys not
understanding how Windows worked really
it depends on how on the conditions
under which this software was installed
and then the engineer goes on to say
so once you get used to the idea that
even bug reporting databases can be
sources of relationship advice right the
the idea that we can separate the messy
human world and the clean world of
managing data starts to break that right
and that's really something that we're
seeing over and over and over again
particularly in the current excitement
about Big Data machine learning the idea
that you can take a very large data set
and glean information from it in a way
that is relatively pure is exciting and
when it works it's great I don't mean
that it never works right anyone who's
seen the amazing wind visualization
recognizes that you're seeing something
that's generated by relatively neutral
relatively neutral objects not
completely neutral but relatively
neutral objects and then being
visualized in a way that is would be
would be seen for almost anyone making
that same visualization but in cases
like this where it seems like this is
software right we're dealing with
something which is hard edge bits and
bytes running on a computer and this
kind of material shows up in that
environment you see how hard it is to
separate the idea of clean data and
messy human life and how much when
humans get involved they make us
reconsider what we think we know about
the about the world that we're operating
it this is a problem that a lot that a
lot of industry suffer from which is
that our view of human behavior is often
at odds with actual human behavior now
the medium that I've the the rather the
industry that I've thought hardest about
is media and here we have a picture of
people watching the Super Bowl on
television but this is a special kind of
picture this is a picture of people
watching television as portrayed by
people who make television right this is
a screenshot of people watching
television on a sitcom right here is a
picture of actual people watching the
actual Super Bowl
and once once you see this once you
realize this is the difference between
TV's view of us of you and me and how we
behave versus our actual behavior you
see how big this gap is right the
context in which almost all information
that matters to the end user is produced
consumed regurgitated contextualized
operates in an environment in which we
are all connected to one another we are
all paying attention to one another we
are all altering our behavior as a
result of those feedback loops and those
feedback loops makes the kind of
cleanliness that's held out for a lot of
current data projects not only difficult
to get but often not worthwhile because
in fact dealing with the overlap of data
and the human world is a hard enough
problem that it needs a different a
different set of attempts it needs a
different set of approaches once you
realize that the human mess can't be
made simply to go away one of the places
where we can see the value of
approaching generating value one of the
places where we can see the value in
treating data as if it's something
embedded in a human context comes when
we take a large data sets and we expose
them to the individuals to the users
without knowing in advance what we're
going to find right we're actually
sharing the data becomes not just the
final gesture here user we made this for
you but actually becomes an opening
gesture and exploratory gesture to find
out what the data means in the first so
few years ago the Smithsonian tried this
they took several thousand of their
photographs that had been copyright
cleared there was in fact no copyright
on them because they were either
produced by the government themselves or
they had been produced prior to prior to
the current copyright deadline and then
just put them up on flickr they just put
them up on the photo-sharing service and
let people tag them because the
smithsonian didn't know in advance what
the users would make of these photos so
here are some of the tags they produce
this is in a sort of tag cloud format
the bigger
font obviously the more more important
it is Smithsonian Institution being the
largest tag for the obvious reason this
is just the A's from that tag list and
rendered as you had a very long skinny
browser this is the entire list in that
sort of same agate type they put on the
back of the pill bottle right this is a
huge amount of user generated data and
the interesting thing about this data
wasn't the volume but the variability
back to the tagline I want to call your
attention to three items on this list
cyanotype mustache and steampunk
cyanotype our users who care about the
physical substrate of the photo guy they
don't care about what's being
represented they don't care if it's if
it's a landscape or a portrait they
don't care if it's a picture of a horse
or a house they care about how the
picture was made these are historians of
photography or people interested in the
mechanisms of photography that is a way
of organizing these photographs that
cuts across things having to do with
content it is an alternate it is an
alternate organizational scheme that is
able to exist in parallel with questions
about content then mustache I'm just a
lot of pictures of people with mustaches
facial hair in the period that the
Smithsonian has copyright cleared photos
facial hair was was quite quite dramatic
but the Smithsonian no matter how many
people might be interested in going
through and looking for pictures of
people with interesting mustaches this
missoni would never say to any of its
catalogers you can't leave work until
you've catalog every picture with a
mustache in it right professionally
there is not enough professional
attention that can be brought to bear on
these photos to generate a list of
photographs that would be of interest to
people who only care about mustaches in
fact the only group large enough to
categorize everything is everybody and
then steampunk right steampunk is a form
of science fiction which says
essentially let's imagine that mid 20th
century innovations happened in the
mid-nineteenth century instead so we got
Babbage's computer we didn't get
touring's computer
if the Smithsonian would never pay
people to generate the photos taggle the
photos with mustaches they certainly
wouldn't do steampunk and yet why
shouldn't people get value out of being
able to identify photos that seem to
seem to line up with the Steampunk
aesthetic what people are interested in
is so much more various then could have
been generated by the raw data set of
these photos that the value to the
Smithsonian wasn't just getting cheap
catalog in fact the kind of catalog in
the Smithsonian got out of Flickr was
not compatible with their existing
systems the valued with the Smithsonian
was discovering what people cared about
and the metadata that came from exposing
the data to a really broad cross-section
of participants was the kind of thing
that could never be generated in house
and when you see that when you see that
happen you see how wide the range of
uses can be so one of the pictures they
put up they had a bunch of pictures of
fish so they put up a picture of a
putting wife wrath and write the first
comment on the pudding why Fras photo
was now your photo has been uploaded the
second comment was by someone who called
himself the physiologist and he said
this is a great picture of a putting
wife Raths we have a whole database for
people who study fish for scientists who
study fish we are going to use your
photo this myth Sonia didn't even know
that database existed they didn't have
to having exposed the data right they
got this use for free so the conditions
of data don't just include how big is it
right how how clean is it but also how
open is it how available is it for
people creating new kinds of value that
the hosting institution couldn't predict
and then just under the physiologist
post about having posted this photo to
fish base come to fabric designer said
hey I love to said put it on a purse
right and it's really tempting to go
through and say well the physiologist
with the fish base like that serious
scientific work but this
this thing with the purse is really
silly but there's no way to separate
serious and silly if you're going to
share like this and in fact one of the
things we're seeing over and over again
is the serious stuff and the silly stuff
gets all mixed up together and it's
really difficult to separate at least in
the early days while we're still getting
used to this new media now it's tempting
to think of that as being a function of
the internet right well of course you
get all this wall caps and the board at
work Network and so forth but in fact
this overlap of serious and silly in the
same medium this always happens I don't
mean it always happens when you put up
pictures of fish I mean it always
happens with media full stop it didn't
take long after the printing presses
invented before the first erotic novel
started to be produced right it did not
take long after the printing press was
invented before someone with it with a
commercial incentive to sell books said
to themselves hey you know what I bet
people would pay for right it took
another hundred and fifty years for
people to even think of the scientific
journal right so we we are used to the
idea that the printing press the sacred
printing press or at the source and sink
of the Western canonical tradition is a
very serious thing but in fact it isn't
and it never was it was serious and
silly all mixed up together right and
attempts now to say well these uses are
serious and those uses are silly in
addition to just being hard to do as
long as humans are involved actually
lead us to 2-under optimized for the
value we would get out of seeing how
people react to this data when we share
and the consequences of that could be
really enormous this is a slice of the
genetic sequence for the sudden acute
respiratory syndrome sars and when SARS
broke out in the middle of last decade
there was a push to sequence it right to
figure out what the genetic sequence was
so that a vaccine or so
sort of response could be developed and
the people who had the most incentive
right to deal with the SARS epidemic
with the Chinese they had the earliest
cases they're the most cases they had
the most samples therefore they also
have brilliant biologists and computer
scientists and no shortage of equipment
to bring to bear on a genetic sequencing
problem of enormous importance both to
that country end of the world and yet
the Tsar's the Tsar sequence was was
generated by a little outfit just north
of here in western in Western Canada
called the genome sciences the genome
sciences center the genome sciences
center did not have as much money as the
Chinese government the genome science
the Senate did not have as many
scientists they did not have as much
compute power how did a little shop like
that beat the people who had the
earliest earliest examples of SARS had
the most incentive to solve it and had
all of the resources needed this started
to be discussed as China's mischance
because they were at the forefront of
suffering from sighs but not at the
forefront of solving and a few months
after the SARS virus was sequenced a
clue as to what happened appeared in
something called the Yale global journal
in which one of the scientists in
Beijing who had worked on the Tsar's
problem issued a blistering critique of
their of their performance during the
SARS epidemic he said the problem was at
lack of samples the problem wasn't lack
of compute power the problem wasn't lack
of scientific muscle the problem was
that no one was allowed to share that
every time two institutions wanted to
share something we had to get permission
every time we wanted to move a sample we
had to get permission every time we
wanted to combine resources we had to
get permission Genome Sciences Center
beat the Chinese government because the
resource GSC had most of its disposal
was the ability to share
they could ask questions they could
answer questions they could trade
subsequences with other researchers they
could check things in and out of open
databases even the institutional framing
around big data is coming under some
pressure or some reconsideration it's
not as if we used to have small data and
now we have big data and we'll just deal
with it the same way in fact one of the
things we're seeing around organizations
dealing with very large very important
data set is if they can't share they're
actually stymied from working with the
thing that matters most and this is one
of the things that I think is going to
be the biggest biggest struggle as we
try to deal with all of the data that
the sensors in our pockets and the cloud
and all of the rest of it are producing
which is the institutional structures we
have had for dealing with data which
assumes that data is largely held in
house by one organization are now coming
under this kind of pressure and there
are places where we're seeing people
rethink how how we should be dealing
with the institutional structures and
from from first principle so this is
this is an example essentially in
parallel to the Czar's example but now
something that worked this is from Tim
Gower's weblog ours is a fields medal
winning mathematician who back in 2009
had a very provocative blog post that's
it is massively collaborative
mathematics possible would it be
possible to take on this most abstract
of problems in the same way that a
Wikipedia articles generated and the the
post went on to observe right to
critical things anybody anybody anywhere
who thought they had something to say
about the problem could jump in and you
would say something even if you thought
it might not it might be wrong but might
be likely to spark someone else's
someone else's ideas so this is in a way
a response to genome sciences center
versus the Chinese government this is a
way of saying we're going to rethink the
way we
deal with even these very abstract
problems around the collaborative
network we can also assemble using these
same tools so they launched something
called polymath when polymath is a blog
and a wiki and it works basically the
way that Gower's had proposed in his
massively collaborative mathematics post
and they would put up problems and they
would number them so here here's
polymath for which is a prime prime
number sieve and they submitted this
they done enough work another thought
well we've made some progress they
submitted it to the journal but they
observe a worked in the way that the
Gower's had suggested which is they just
talked out everything they thought might
work and then hashed out the different
strategies to use and when they got
somewhere they submitted it to the
Journal of mathematics of computation
and this was the reply from the Journal
of mathematics of computation the good
news was he asked the paper made
significant project in in the basic math
of prime number finding and then you can
see the suggestions made by the journal
editor to improve the paper and I like
proofreading as much as the next guy but
this is not actually adding to the
mathematical content of the work this is
really just readying it for publication
and then my favorite comment the paper
does not say who the authors are right
as if obviously a piece of intellectual
work must have an author because that's
the way the universe is but of course
it's not the way the universities and in
fact on the polymath blog they go
through this a yeah they accepted the
paper they wanted us to get rid of the
extra is now we have to make up a
pretend list of authors write to satisfy
the journal publishing process the one
thing they couldn't say was you're not
clear who the authors of this paper are
because it's not actually clear who the
authors of this paper are we've changed
the process enough that traditional
journals won't recognize so think how
much the journalist change from
philosophical transactions which I head
up on the screen a little while
to now journals scientific journals used
to be ways of increasing the radius and
the speed at which scientific
information would spread now their ways
of decreasing the radius in the speed
right and they're principally there as
stamps that appear after all the work
has been done because of course since
all the work was done in public most of
the relevant mathematicians are already
aware of the result right this is not in
fact disseminating these results it's
just giving you a place to lodge a
citation the Journal of the mathematics
of computation may as well be renamed
the Journal of icon has tenure because
its function has become essentially
validating at the end of the process so
when I say the institutional framing
around data right is is coming under
pressure Gower's and the polymath
project is what I mean there are
alternate ways of dealing with this
dealing with this profusion of data and
collaborative opportunities we have
which aren't just going to be our
current practice is updated they're
actually going to be fairly dramatic
here's another version of that same
process but now in a completely
different field this is rap genius rap
genius is there for annotating the
lyrics of rap so here are all of 50
Cent's 50 cent songs and you can go and
click on any one of these and say when
50 cent says this he means that right
it's just a way of adding in a sort of
explanatory layer at the outside you
know is essentially attached to these
lyrics but early on in the history of
rap genius people realized it says rap
lyrics on the front door but actually
this is just a generic tool for
annotating taxed so they put up the
Mayflower Compact and they started
annotating that instead right and then
somebody put up Barack Obama's 2013
inaugural speech and then they annotated
that and rap genius intern looked at
this and
and these people are putting this
existing tool into service in a new way
right and we're going to respond and so
they've launched news genius and here's
a page from news genius is an interview
with a twelve-year-old boy had recently
turned out in the streets of Cairo in
the in the aftermath of the june
thirtieth protest and those yellow lines
there are annotated parts of his his
speech his what he was saying to the
camera and then when you click on one of
those links you don't just get the
annotation you can also get additional
photos so rap genius has now decided to
learn from its own users right and to
develop a product that is it is much
more about journalism than it is about
than it is just about annotation and
this is what I mean about serious and
silly whatever you think of 50 Cent's
lyrical chops right the ability to learn
from the users that there are other uses
of this service and to change that
service to take advantage of that that's
the kind of thing that we're going to be
seeing a lot more right the the the idea
of data as a relatively pure thing that
can be taken out of the human sphere
appealing as that is and when that
happens as nice as it is is increasingly
running into the fact that when you get
humans involved you get mess like this
and instead of trying to contain the
mess when you try to learn from the mess
when you try to figure out what it is
people are trying to do with the tool
and change the tool accordingly you can
actually generate whole new categories
of applications as as rap genius's done
so back to the DARPA story I told at the
beginning it turned out in the earliest
days of the internet that we had grossly
overestimate and when i say we i just
mean people who care about networks i
was not I was not there at the time but
people are grossly overestimated the
value of connecting to machines and the
value of connecting to data relative to
the value of connecting to other human
beings one of the things that we see
over and over again whenever
things are aggregated whenever things
are networked is that for any given user
very often the most valuable thing at
the other end of the wire is not the CPU
with the disk it's the other user right
and every place that we're seeing these
networks expand we're seeing these kinds
of surprises from human adaptation
around this data so I'll put up one last
example and this is something that i
showed my students I I taught the class
for the design Expo from ITP from the
interactive telecommunications program
and in this class this is one of the
interfaces I showed because I think its
message around what we're wrestling with
in the overlap of many new data sources
and human use is really interesting this
is Richard Pope's bicycle barometer and
it is a small wireless device that has
as you can see two icons on a bicycle
and the symbol for the London
Underground the London tube and he takes
weather data on one side which is
obviously an enormous collection of
available sources of weather data and he
takes the information from Transport for
London about whether the tubes are
running on time whether there's
construction in his station he takes all
of that data and he crunches it down
into a single two valued system should I
take the subway today or should I take
my bike right and depending on the
weather and the condition of the tube
the barometer will simply move in one
direction or the other what I love about
this is that weather data on one side
and civic data around transport and the
other are two of the most highly worked
over sources of data and the value that
people have tried to create by creating
new interfaces of that data is
extraordinary and yet Pope is pointing
out is that no matter how much data you
have no matter how much compute power
you can throw at it often these things
come down to a single human being having
to make a simple decision the amount of
data in each of those categories weather
data and transit data could go up by an
order of magnitude and the interface
would not have to change because
every morning is going to have to make a
choice do I take my bike or do I ride
the subway right and this interface I
think reminds us that whenever you get
humans involved in the equation it's
going to change how you're dealing with
the data how you're dealing with its
creation how you're dealing with its
context how you're dealing with its
presentation and getting that right is
going to be a big part of the challenge
as the data of the world explodes around
us remembering that the data is changing
much faster than human nature and
bringing those two forces into some kind
of equilibrium becomes the design
challenge of the next decade thank you
very much thank you and I think Tony's
coming up yeah till you've there any
questions oh oh yes not appreciate your
point about the value of collaboration
in science and getting different people
to contribute and I also take your point
about how publishing journal papers is
maybe in the contradiction with that but
on the other hand faculty members and
researchers need it's kind of a fitness
signaling that you need a similarly a
fitness in some way and if you can't do
that and you collaborating constantly
then how do you how do people know what
your fitness is I'm not suggesting you
don't see I'm not suggesting you don't
need to fit in a signal in fact that's
exactly right i think i think that the
decay of the journal function from being
actually informing the relevant
community what the current science is to
just being a fitness signal is a problem
and one of the things we're seeing in
the programming community is the fitness
signals are moving to the places that
are hard to fake like what is your
github repository look like if you were
showing up as a programmer I think the
best thing for the sciences would be if
the fitness signal became tied more
closely to the actual work rather than
to the downstream validation by the
journals because in fact being able to
assemble the relevant community and have
the conversation is is what Fitness is I
mean advancing the scientific
conversation
through those kinds of contributions is
closer to being a real fitness signal
one of the one of the related stories of
the Tim gyrus thing is when Dick Lipton
the who runs the P does not equal NP
weblog the most you know the famously
most important problem in computer
science a couple years ago via a deal
alike our debt from from I don't know if
I'm pointing the right direction but HP
Labs whichever way the coast runs down
down in HP Labs popped up and said I
proved it P does not equal NP and lipton
brings the paper onto his blog and in
eight days in the comments on that blog
they hash out the paper and the
basically the the verdict comes back
this is interesting but it's got these
two fatal flaws and dealer like ours
back working out we don't know what the
result will be but that's the science
that's the fitness is the actual people
doing the actual work and it would be
better if either journals hued more
closely to that problem than then a lot
of the kind of you know publish 18
months after the fact stuff is or in
other cases if academics and in
particular tenure committees would
update their sense of what the fitness
signal is is measuring in the first list
and both of those are hard things I
don't mean to suggest that this will
happen overnight but I think it is worth
noting that that the the journals
original function of informing the
relevant communities largely faded away
leaving them only with the fitness
signal as their current rationale which
i think is not is not good for anybody I
was our question over here my question
is regarding the Smithsonian tagging
yeah how would we know that there isn't
just one or a handful of persons with
fanatically large interest in moustaches
and steampunk that with a lot of time on
their hand that went and did all of this
tagging that would buy us the data I
mean the tail end skewing the yeah so so
I'm virtually certain that that is the
case and in fact it is it is it is
almost invariably a signal of large
social systems you get a power-law
distribution with the obsessives at the
you know at the head end
if you do a social network map of
Wikipedia pick any two articles see
hukou added them pick any two editors
see what articles they co-edited you
start to get these clusters of
obsessives right so there's a group of
God I'm assuming there guys there's a
group of guys who edit all the articles
on the US highway system so when you
look at their user profiles like I
edited the article on US highway 28 on
the article on US Highway 31 and you
wish you know so and and they're the
people near the head end of those
distributions so what I think is really
interesting about what you said is that
it biases the data but i would say
biases against what which is to say if
it's a reflection of the human condition
that you have a large numbers that care
a little bit about a lot of things and
then you have a handful of people who
make the Star Trek articles are really
good right that those people are there
they're part of the community so so I
think our sense that that anything where
human beings are behaving way off the
bell curve is a bias is actually our
misrepresentation of human nature rather
than you know social life does not
produce a lot of Gaussian distributions
right it produces you know a million
power laws by the you know by the time
you're done with breakfast so I think
that I think the issue really becomes
where the places we're having the
mustache and steampunk obsessives harms
anyone else and if there are places
where that's happening because you're
you're doing some kind of ranked system
and and say contributing tax dollars to
it then you worry about it but if it's
really just what kind of value can we
get out of this if we give it to people
to comb over and pick out the stuff that
interests them why shouldn't the
obsessives be able to get their value
out of the system as well again this
this you know this gets back to the the
you know the point about the design of
the systems not being neutral you have
to decide how much of a feedback loop
you're providing the tag clouds might
might end up biasing people to think
steampunk is more popular than it is but
all of those design questions they don't
have
any obvious neutral way to be answered
which is to say we always have to ask
ourselves when the obsessives are there
and they're real people and their energy
is real energy are we designing a system
where their excitement about steampunk
is harming anyone else or not and I
think to the degree that we can say let
them go and if they creating value for a
small subset of users at zero cost to
anybody else that's that's actually I
think I think a kind of thing we'd like
to see from our sort of newly large and
open data sets but the problem that you
point to comes up when we actually have
feedback loops that cost other people
something because of the because of the
obsessive doing they're doing that work
oh yes ma'am hi I have a question I
should say hello thank you for your talk
Becky grenier from Georgia Tech so I've
been really curious about the use of
Amazon recommendation reviews as a
political vehicle yeah and so and I was
wondering do you think that's another
example in this genre about how when you
introduce data it you know to humans you
get all of human existence there is
there something you need else going on
with this and but those of you don't
know two examples are if you take a look
on amazon at the shoes that wendy davis
wore during her filibuster in taxes a
lot of the reviews are a more pertinent
to filibustering in taxes than to the
shoes and then also the reviews of any
binders on amazon completely went off
the charts after mitt romney's phrase
binders of women right and they're
really fascinating reading so i'm very
curious abyss your insights on this so
this shirt i don't know if you can see
it this is a three creeper moon so it's
the minecraft the default minecraft
monster but it is a riff on three wolf
moon which was a t-shirt that was sent
to the top of the Amazon charts because
someone went in and rota rota rota funny
review I do think that that's exactly I
do think that that's exactly an example
of this and other things are plainly
going on as well but people's
understanding of the system
it's it's really interesting they very
often start McLuhan said this first and
best the contents of the new medium are
the old media which always sounds gnomic
and impossible to interpret until you
read the paragraph right after where he
explains exactly what he meant which is
what what new scale does this introduced
into into life if there's if there's a
new medium coming along and plainly the
new scale that the web is introducing is
the scale of participation the number of
people who can say something in public
so an Amazon review is two things it is
it is essentially a kind of low-rent
amateur eyes diversion of a book review
section in a newspaper which is how it
started out and how people started using
it and then people started realizing hey
anything you type in here shows up on
the page when I hit submit right and
then it's off to the races and you get
stuff like the binders full of women and
Wendy Davis issues one of one of my
favorite if you go and look at the plane
mobile review the reviews for the play
mobile figurines around the airport
security station spectacular justjust
well worth reading as a document as as
essentially commentary on political
commentary and I think one of the most
interesting things is that Amazon makes
almost no attempt you know modulo hate
speech and and you know a handful of
edge cases makes no real attempt to rain
that stuff in Amazon understands that
actually letting users use that tool to
say things to one another that are
engaging and frankly bring people back
to amazon doesn't show up on the bottom
line the sales of binders themselves did
not shoot through the roof but the
comment area around binders full of
women did indeed put put a political
conversation directly into amazon
another place you can see this is
anytime a brand way you know i just i
promise that the only word of time i'll
say that word today decides that it's
going to have a social media campaign
McDonald's famously started started
something with mcdee stories and the
number of people who wanted to comment
on McDonald's either hiring practices or
the helpfulness of its food realized
this is just an open hashtag
Twitter and it just exploded skittles
skittles made the same mistake about six
months before and and I think the idea
that we can separate people into
consumers and citizens is a little bit
the same thing and I'm talking about if
you know there's data over here and
there's messy human life over there
people will come forward as citizens
anyplace there's a public environment
and amazon has become one of the
interesting spots for that kind of that
kind of public commentary and you know
there's just there's no way to make that
genie go back in the bottle without
without really destroying the thing that
made it interesting in the first place
and I think Amazon is to be commended
for not even trying right the the net is
rife with stories like like friends are
basically people trying to make people
stop using the system and kind of funny
and playful ways that's that's turned
out to be suboptimal relative to letting
the playful stuff from the serious stuff
go on side by side sure another I
thought of some other hand up and maybe
not all right thank you very much thank
you thank you thank you thanks very much
clay I particularly like the sharing
data in SARS making a difference and I
think microsoft needs to learn that
humans are messy and when you involve
humans I just like to comment on this
wonderful poster I didn't put it there
but that up the top there is a unitary
operator acting on a quantum ket vector
so just to show the quantum mechanics is
here no I really don't have to say
anything other than to thank just a few
people there's a lot of people like need
thanking but Harold Javed who was the
general chair Susan Jame and Stewart
tansley with the program chairs put
together a great program so I think we
should thank
and the other person i should mention is
is roman snitzer who organized the demo
fest which was great fun so can we give
Roman a hand too and there's a whole
host of people including the video
people behind and so on but can I just
pick out two people sitting in the front
Jen and Mariah who really made
everything work smoothly and can we give
them a round of applause please do well
that's it for another year except one of
the things that we I insisted on was to
have some beer after the event over the
hall over there and I'll join you for a
drink and the last bus to the hotel is
at seven thirty so you got two hours
