masa dough and I think the reason we
advise template was I think suburb
looking towards even further if the
teacher and almost the other way around
rub you can mail the intrusion of the
private and private addresses the public
sphere now we're talking about the
physicality of moving data collection
stuff here and around that intervals
hope itself among other things Kate I
thank you quite happy to do public
ownership son I think what I'm doing is
providing an example look what the world
could look like a component about others
ideas was just
yes lames kg-1 salamat designer i'm here
to present him a project today whirlwind
like reality and it's my own kind of
research by science projects and a very
short notes and it's the predator
insight into future city and the future
essence of special design as well and so
also at least the kind of change in
nature a public space I mean the project
based around or with reality which I
suppose most of you come across but
maybe haven't heard so much about
recently and I develop this project in
2009-2010 so it's really well mr. Gerard
we're starting to become publicly sort
of embraced and but I think really what
we've seen all this reality so far is
just the tip of the iceberg in terms of
what's possible and in terms of my kind
of grandiose thinking about what reality
I think it can be a sort of future of
our question evolution and the hope next
step that we take and but it's just
about how we adopt technology advisors
so the product is a research by design
project I developed during my masters of
architecture well that's cool of our
perch in London it's a rolling look at
the future ah studies and we might be
heading today I'm going to show you some
films and production images like these
ones for the project the products really
conceited propositional and provocative
but also sort of critical about the
courage of it is proposed biotechnology
and provide a kind of counterpoint to
this glossy
illogical videos to see produced by
people or like Microsoft and not clear
in my mother's so quickly we can use the
projector starts anticipate design
challenges and kind of play a new vision
into the crucian of cities so without
further ado
Oh
Oh God in the middle with you please
want me to test a baby good okay let's
get little totally from a dream
carefully pour only wanted to look you
will be completing for little children
some recipe suggestions to him
yes a little side you don't you to be
here for a while this promotes a very
mixed reaction with some people very
excited about potential and also some
people who kind of terrified about the
potential implications of it I've Garcia
really great and there's not enough
father and east bmore debate surrounding
these kind of areas and I can beat the
understand that they're kind of shot the
comes from because the home has always
been this little bit v private personal
space and by having said that it has
always been the kind of lucrative side
commedia relation and so I started with
radio TV and snap and so maybe this is
what we can look for tea and the next
film is a bit less cynical but also
maybe pushing rather from color
combination of as a private more the
other way around so privatization for
public this film was she made of 3d
learning hath was 44 48 aside to imagine
school Memphis is a 3d
yes
so I just want to walk you through so
it's the kind of ideas trying this
project and start with the interface
okay this is a thumb stole a locking
cesaria the actual kind of shot
photograph of my kitchen in the
production of the first film and the
black dots you see they're actually read
there at the standard on the table at
come like kitchen with the state is much
to look disclosure of my housemates and
but this was a necessary adaptation of
the environment that I had to make to be
able to actually I can close up all of
the others on in West production so I
analyze the footage afterwards and then
use the tracking data to be able to
understand 3d space and movement of the
camera but what I find interesting about
this is that there's a kind of layer
that the computer is reading off of it
and augmented reality also requires some
kind of analysis of the websphere the
input data to be able to understand the
environment so you have this kind of
thing as well like a QR code admin side
we're building and what I found
interesting about this is that you know
will look any more directly communities
with our environment it's going
environment is speaking to a device and
then the speaking to us so this kind of
media to Blair involved with in it and
that creates interesting situation
because suddenly because we're
experiencing our environments rushing
through a music device then we once I
dose objectives based on everybody can
read environments differently
so although we may be inhabiting the
same environment the way we the way it
looks to us in the way we use it might
be different from person to person and
you can already see this happening and
in terms of electro and mythology where
we might go into Photoshop and more
person using it for a nice ring another
place to be friends or you might be
playing gameboy on the bus or something
and everybody's using progress in the
States so this design things max in an
architecture which goes form follows
function which is a accident my offense
you had lived on the road but this is
kind of be coming unstuck now because
really we can start to apply the
function our own kind of subjective
theater Blair so when I was designing
the film yeah the person was obvious
problem was that of interface how do we
start to modulate interacting with our
environment and in the first film you
know though many different ways of
inputting a gesture but there was also
different keyboard on her as well and
the more I sort of thought about it more
ridiculous i thought this idea was that
we have is amazing and instead of using
and the huge amount of technological
prowess and multiple did the potential
of this film and yet we're still using
kind of the typewriter and so the second
film i started to look at the cockpit as
a model before
environments I find it particularly
interesting because it mapped out
special as our information functions to
spatial dimensions so you can start to
kind of locate things in your mind and
use your special memory to be able to
have much greater control over the day
again in the film I kind of manifested
as this which is a sort of subjective
laptop space that you can kind of
customize this or tweak to respond to
the things that you do the most I think
this is an example of something which
could be a new private space within the
Oklahoma City this is the the social
network sort of module in there I did it
because I want to show that we weren't
sort of bound my special constraints as
well in mixed reality but we could have
an almost complete virtual reality
within it also here you can sort of
start City think about use of three
dimensions of the environment to help
you understand information better so as
time masters things with well as their
axes and then also you can
over one corner of the room and work
colleagues over the other and you can
start to sort of use space to help
people understand information and then
finally there's this channel browser
which is this sort of three-dimensional
sculptural objects which change the
shape with every decision that you make
along with dishes and this is a decision
tree so the idea here that rather than
reading everything here you can start to
understand the shape of air and
therefore understand the decision that
is asking you to make this a problem as
well with our virtual reality but the
possibilities for the types of the
environment that you can create an
operative reality is so vast that you
start to ask yourself a question what is
ideal space but if we can have anything
well we want to be so I'll few people
and you know everyone has different
ideas dependent their own sensibilities
some people want to go back to nature
and be walking through a forest and
people want to live in a 18th century
château some people live in a modern
Spiller and but I found all of these
answers to be very sort of I don't know
that they kind of dishonest in a way
that we're just recreating other things
that we previously thought as ideal my
idea of final space is is this on the
left which is intensely personal space
the moment look like an ideal space
people you know this person has fills
their environment with and
that meaningful to them they've
customized their workspace and also that
desktop there as well and I'm sure they
have some completely idiosyncratic
filing system that nobody else
understand and that manifested itself in
the film is this kind of environment
where you can step things up the way you
want is filled with the things that are
beautiful to you so deal with the city
is a bit like the way you can't eat the
whole thing at once you have to assign
multiple layers accumulate in different
parts of the city you have to work out a
way to be able to to interact with that
and aggregate what you want to come to
define your worldview so that's what the
channel browse that you saw us auctions
into it and it allows you to kind of
choose which layers your interests and
the kind of your view of the city
becomes almost a reflection of yourself
it's almost like Marvin your personality
out into physical space michaelis
process aggregation but there's also an
opposite as well which is broadcast this
is one of the ocean drawings that I did
which is in a hot-air kind of map social
media and online homicides content unser
secure body and then one at rusted
itself in a recent installation i did in
collaboration with michael james out of
an this is a interactive installation
easily connect when you have all these
kind of keywords that drift down fully
through outer space this kind of thing
we're all about my base area is made
directly public right next to us you
desire it kind of scares from people as
well and but i think there's definitely
potential for exploration work with it
as well because despite the obvious kind
of issues with with privacy and also
could potentially usher in some new
Asian creative collaboration and
communication where instead of our
studies being filled with these kind of
cold or no spaces suddenly that we
filled with people we have a relation to
a new server late to us and by as well
show you something today so so I think
this is a kata me of broadcast and
aggregation is something which I find
increasingly useful at times to replace
these increasingly in one useful terms
of public and private and but it's
interesting to think as well what other
still atop our new kind of hybrid spaces
are emerging from this and one of the
things is towards the end of the last
time you saw these two people to the T
protagonist and a meeting each other at
a train station in that point I didn't
have time to composite the whole thing
but the idea was these two people's
subjective space it will start to merge
and you have a kind of hybrid space
between those two it was identities and
what's nice about that is that that
would be a completely unique space that
would only exist when you met the same
person in the same space and so I think
this is quite interesting thing to do I
like to explore some more there's
another potential hybrid space here and
this is the largest degree in the world
is the dallas cowboys stadium has anyone
seen it by chance normal bounds it and
yeah but mostly interested is because of
the inaugural game for this gigantic
screen they broadcast the lightning
below in the 3d so everybody is sitting
the audience a 3d glasses on and I was
looking
yeah I thought that was really funny
alive why would you do that why you came
when he's going to see that but i think
i realized i was missing the point
because the reason they were ghost games
like this it's not so they can season
you know tiny took us running around
Kadesh it's really to be in the crowd
and be in the event and you know feel
they brought of the crowd and the kind
of pistol nature head and what when the
real kind of understands why I think you
know you can imagine some amazing our
experiences where you have this huge
collection of a shared reality but you
can experience a certain times and these
events don't have to be you know in an
event space at a particular kind of
sporting event something like that they
can be you know spontaneous they can be
anywhere and they can just do these kind
of shared experiences which is a new
type of public space as well so yeah the
question who will design our future
cities I think are coming from an
architectural background that this is
going to be a split professional that
will have the infrastructure
requirements and the economics and
logistics are represented by one
profession and then also the virtual lab
which has the special qualities the
events and the experiences as a lot of
question we also have to consider
democratizing effects of digital media
itself and this is quite hear from
childbed pizza which is more cultural
heritage stored into form plus more
accessible to more people plus people
better equipped with more tools to a
creative useful collection equals
exponential growth in massive cultural
expression and he turned that cloud
culture now he was talking about things
like photography and video where as soon
as they were digitized to turn everybody
into a producer of content but I think
the school should be applied to state so
that a space can become an effective
form of media to be practiced because
seen by anybody so inclined
and so instead of the form of us that
he's being dictated by architects and
planners landowners you know suddenly
they can become created by the people
who actually live there which is sort of
crazy but shouldn't be human so I'm this
is the anatomy of the you or going to
city that I just want to walk you
through now another one you have the
content which is the sort of way that
you control and watch you lately
environment number two here you have the
local the field which one of your
location-based information on tools
inside that level three you have the
skin also post navigation their purpose
that's it effect which is something
which is the kind of virtual over late
early atmosphere very interesting new
kind of cultural formed emerges from
augmented reality and then finally have
the actual kind of built infrastructure
the awareness of a physical element of
it so I still have envisioned the
authenticity is the slope sprawling
dynamic liquid city which sort of
perhaps to you and is and these all the
layers together
so finally I want to just show you the
smart it's the things that really
familiar to anybody I was in here I I I
john baptist and Lahti that was written
in fact that was drawn in the 18th
century and inside even graphic
management it's a dinner so the most
ground poor footprint of all the
buildings on here I most interesting
about it he kind of zoom in is that you
can see well as the young in the kind of
arias blood cells in Rome where this is
the space in sight which is kind of
accessible to the public is open as well
so people often uses that to talk about
the relationship of pop in private space
so I just played to think about what
this nut would look like now in the
presence of CCTV and telephones video
shark these different militias which
answering our cities now I think it
would be impossible to draw in the same
way you know for us thought it would
probably have to be three-dimensional in
color moving and also different for
every single person who uses there so i
think we can no longer think of private
and public is universal special
conditions and we have to have a new
vocab arena which we could use to build
apprentice city so although the this
product is like in Savannah quality
stuff in volume I think it can use to
consider how we have a space today I'm
using here over the reality as a
starting point ready to start adjusting
the emotional ideas and trying to
anticipate all system design challenges
that we might have in the future and
plus I don't believe in technological
determinism and I think that is really
up to us how we adopt technology I think
videos and photos like this and are very
useful tools to start conversation
across the board so this is my contact
details you can steal my work on my
website occasional telecom and I'm also
studying a new brainy rushes to this
year day a kind of think tank and design
consultancy which is going to be by
using these kind of ideas to address a
variety of issues and this is really
nice I because the website that is kind
of cool for applications that you can
see so if you like to get involved or
help out in any way please
and give you something more about saying
yes he'll be right all right well I
wished have a couple of major questions
in a second I again I want to thank all
of the speakers they're really
interesting I no overlap between how we
conceive it was private but we can see
this public how that manifests itself in
the internal space of our homes how that
manifests in the public's Basin city so
Daniel Bryan anil dash root build each
mozilla remembering all the questions
living here yep questions and then we'll
move on to our next step in any
questions for people over there yeah
your your idea of the overlay take that
last point you're making about what we
could have terms of the mountains to
understand the world around
we understand what would be open to us
as we go based on medical parkway yeah I
yeah I think it was something about a
kind of database in some way of
accessing all the layers of content
which are available so you can sort of
search through that and of course with
the web there's a lot of work being done
by many people ahead and to look at how
we can organize this josh about data so
if we try and pry out into space when it
i think its shares many of the same
qualities but at the same time it loses
others and games others as well and the
desert that there was a character
supported by walter benjamin thunder and
century who is a person who just
experienced the city by walking and it
was kind of look at that and Andy sort
of water on Mulberry plum wine clothes
and and that was kind of what they did
with their life but I think that we
could look to quite return of that way
people could walk through the city and
has the experience different layers and
one of the things you see in sort of
cities today's I'm branches in China
towns and cities because what you have
is the end he kind of locals like urban
fabric which has been overlaid with with
another sort of almost virtual layer of
orientation so the landing to look its
brief and shop sighs things like that
which giveth kind of local character
Krishna sore but I'm here I mean I just
been very like short stab at how
tormenta basically to trying to browse
the mercial that you saw and but I
imagine this is issues problem of one
really doing this is asking the question
rather than that providing any salt
solution
