machine learning and perception group
who's involved with applying mainly
machine learning techniques to some of
the you know state-of-the-art technology
and computers gaming I'm particularly
interested in the computer vision based
appliances i would say being an intern
at Microsoft provides you with a very
unique research experience I think you
have a lot of outstanding researchers
who are here to provide provide you very
good supervision and guidance on your
challenging projects within the limited
internship period and it's a unique
experience in that aspect I'll say at
the beginning I was slightly scared
because there were so many high-profile
researchers however they are very
interested in the topics that you talk
about and they are generally there to
listen and give a a constructive advice
so actually during the inter the final
internship talk I wasn't so scared as
much as I was initially
each year microsoft research helps
hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
