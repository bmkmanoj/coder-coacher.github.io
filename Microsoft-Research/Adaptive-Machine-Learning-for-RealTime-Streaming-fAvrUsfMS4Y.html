machine learning in a streaming
environment and that's a big problem
that's applicable to a wide range of
issues in manufacturing all the way down
to data centers today we're going to
talk about a particular issue for
chipset manufacturer so in chips up
Manufacturing's there are two important
aspects one we're dealing with millions
of events per second streaming through
the factory floor to time to insight is
critical at the beginning of a process a
wafer like this may cost $30 by the time
it's fully processed four weeks later
it'll cost upwards of a thousand dollars
identifying bad wafers early in the
process is critical so an expert will
train a machine learning algorithm
offline by identifying good boy runs and
bad wafer runs once the algorithm has
learned then all this training is moved
to run against real live data and what
we see as in this graph is that the
recognition of bad wafer goes
immediately up and we want to tell the
algorithm how to be even smarter we're
gonna train it online while the factory
process is happening and I look at what
the algorithm is telling me I'm gonna
pick it one example which the algorithm
a determined was a good way for run and
I can see that there's a little dip
right there after the first plateau I'm
an expert and I know that indicates a
bad wafer so I'm gonna go and tell the
algorithm this is actually a bad wafer
I'd click on bad and I train it on this
screen which represents a dashboard of
multiple processes going on we have four
different kinds of machines each
corresponding to different kind of
machine learning 3 is the current state
of affairs with no machine learning and
what we see is that at the end of the
process four weeks later a full 15
percent of the wafers that make it
through our defective wafers we wanted
to reduce that percentages if we look at
Machine 2 which has static offline
machine learning we've reduced it to
roughly 5 percent if we look at Machine
1 which has a combination of offline
machine learning and adaptive machine
learning
we've reduced it all the way down to 1%
so there's been a very effective
prototype we've cut down time to insight
from weeks to minutes but this type of
solution is widely applicable beyond
chipset manufacturing
actually it's applicable all the way
from monitoring autonomous guided
vehicles in a car manufacturing plant
all the way to data centers and
telemetry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
