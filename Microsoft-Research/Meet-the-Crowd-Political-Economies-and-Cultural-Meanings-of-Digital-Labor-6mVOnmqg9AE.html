hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
so I'm really I'm really excited to be
in this session because as a chance for
us to talk about work I'm very very
excited about and we have some expertise
not just on the panel but also in the
audience with you so we will try the
format of our of our panel will be to
have each speaker hold to 10 minutes so
that we have plenty of time for for
discussion so if you see me doing this
to them you should all help me and make
this gesture so that they'll that
they'll leave the stage the context for
this is we really wanted to start a
conversation to think about what would
it mean for crowdsourcing to take
seriously the premise that humans are
such a core part of human computation
but arguably they're not visible to us
often in the system and perhaps in some
ways we ask them to remain silent
because for many for many systems the
goal is that they're making our
automation seamless and to feel as
though it is fully automated as opposed
to send me on it automated with some
some help so for this panel we're going
to have different speakers speak to
different areas of crowdsourcing to
think through this question not just the
epics but also the pragmatics of what it
means to take advantage of the
opportunities of workers who are coming
to these systems for different
motivations maybe they're volunteering
maybe they are seeking employment but to
really think through their motivations
and how we might get a better sense of
that I'm going to have each of the
speakers come up one by one or first
speaker is going to be rajesh patel i'll
have them introduce themselves and i'll
put a i'll put their deck up so we'll do
a little a little bit of jumping back
and forth but I'll pass I'll pass this
on to Rajesh now and bring up his deck
ok
alright thank you merry and good often
good afternoon to everyone I am very
excited to be here and to share
something and also learn along the way
as I as Mary said I'm rajesh patel i
work in bank and microsoft and i work on
building platforms for machine learning
and big data one of my passion is to
create platform to enable users improve
their productivity by tan x and also i
have dreamed that anything you can
outsource can the cloud source so our
business need what are our business need
we need repeated high quality high
volume data every day and here a high
quality high volume and timely is very
important because we rely on this data
to train our machine learning algorithm
or measure the algorithm and also we
have many business cases for example
training the voice model or training the
search algorithm and these are some of
the examples that we use also survey or
being AV and side by side so when Mary
asked me that okay you know to be part
take participation in this panel i
created this slide deck to stimulate
some thoughts so this is not a
exhaustive list but along the way I
would like to stimulate some thoughts in
little bit some areas and also where we
touch crowd as well as what we think
next future is so learning few nuggets
we'll talk about worker and you know
what is important for worker from worker
perspective what is important from task
owner perspective what is important as
well as from platform developers like me
what is important we'll cover on what is
important from work out perspective so
let me cover what is important from
requester perspective what we see every
day so Rick crowdsourcing of in order
for crowdsourcing to be successful you
need to eat rate you
a task and you need to design your hit a
poor task design such a way that is very
suitable for this virtual work force or
work force on in the cloud so
crowdsourcing UI design is an art today
because you need to get a couple of
iteration to get it right so and one
thing what we have observed is hit up
hit em owner at a schooner do not want
to care about or do not want to invest
or may not have expertise or interest to
learn how to design task what they care
about is give me data so that I can go
off and and to fine tune my machine
learning model give me data so that I
can go off and do analysis so this is
very important point which I have seen
most of people miss that task owner do
not care about how do i create or UI or
what are the processes but they care
about data give me data give a good
quality data which i can trust right
this is important from platform
perspective things which which are
important is trust worker quality and we
can trust the data and we will talk
about marketplace dynamics today as well
as performance and scalability of
platform is very important as you scale
your platform to this massively are many
workers on internet how you scale at the
same time what is the performance on
worker side as well as what is the
performance on the task owner side as
they are simultaneously of uploading
millions of task and security privacy as
well as legal implications about payment
co employment are some of the issues
from platform perspective so what is
important is circle of trust
crowdsourcing many people come to me and
ask that oh I'm I'm putting my work on
internet or crowd giving it to crowd
will they give me good quality work
because fundamentally you and I are a
trained or as we grew up we had a
concept crowd
crowd means it is a group of people they
all are same there is no quality concept
will they give me work a good quality
work or not so these are the questions
people ask and they they don't have a
trust on worker from worker perspective
since we call them crowd there is no
name they have a trust issue that should
I trust you as a task owner will you
give me you know my payment if I am
willing to put my work but will you give
me payment how platform will behave will
it will it give me accurate hours his
billing information is accurate will I
be cheated how do I associate myself
what is my sense of pride if i work as a
in a crowd because crowd has no name
right so there is a trust then from at a
schooner perspective i as i mentioned
that task owner we traditionally we are
not trained to trust crowd because crowd
has no name no shape no expectation no
SLA so how do you trust crowd how do you
build trust into crowds work so that
crowd will provide you quality results
from platform perspective you want to
see that I want to trust crowd as well
as I want to trust task owner because I
want to trust crowd so that they don't
game the system when I asked information
of self-reported profile they they enter
the right profile or accurate profile
how do I validate self-reported
information by a user on internet there
is no unique ID or any identification
across multiple platform across multiple
nations there is no ID a worker can game
the system they can create another
account and then they can game the
system again if you disable in one it is
a constant it is like a virus scanner I
call it that spam detection is like a
virus scanner human are very smart you
need to constantly reinvent the
mechanism to you know fix the hole in
the spam detection so
so how from a platform perspective build
a trust with worker as well as with a
schooner so in this so traditionally we
all are trained to design a work or
consider work so when when you have a
work in mind you have a person in mind
so for example when I have a work in
mind I have a mat in mind there okay you
know what I'm going to give this work to
Matt and this matt is going to I'm going
to train Matt and Matt is going to do
this work like this right so there is a
trust there right and traditionally as
work increases all higher multiple
people local people physical resources
and that's how we are all a trained
right with Matt there is a face there is
a reputation there is a loyalty there is
a profile which is authenticated which
is accurate which I trust in or
historically i groom to have a trust in
them but as task increases and I want to
scale I want to increase my agility
right I'm going to you we are all well
connected than ever before i am going to
utilize the resource is an expert in
internet so how do i do that so we use
cloud folks in the cloud and notice that
i am not using crowd world because i
don't want to make them anonymous right
now all these faces in the cloud are
anonymous and there is no association
and there is no advantage which which i
get with matt you know we always say oh
I want to put a name with the face I
want to do face-to-face meeting because
traditionally we are all trained to
create work and conceive work and think
about work for a physical resources this
is different this is about thinking a
work for a virtual resources and that's
where majority of task on or fail to
understand and device design the
processes and techniques to get the high
quality work right but in the cloud
there can be mad as well right and and I
have experience working with matt so why
not i work with matt in cloud why I call
it crowd right that's that's the
paradigm shift right
and there can be Joe which I always work
with and that then everything's changes
start changing and your effort change in
and quality changes is another point I
want to try a share with you which I
have seen and people come to me is I've
seen on the platform worthless wandering
of workers because traditionally over
the last hundred years of
industrialization we are trained when
somebody has created task for us they
have created roadmap for us right but in
crowdsourcing or cloud sourcing if you
give access to me in a marketplace there
are n possibilities so when if I leave
you in a desert how many directions you
have to go there are n directions you
have right and most of the people will
try small small direction and they will
fail and they will able to get tired
because oh I don't know what to do they
will they will try every task if you see
any any platform out there most of the
majority of worker will try small every
task very small small but as you know as
you have learned Rolling Stone do not
get gather moss similarly they don't
gather any expertise and and then they
give up right so they try multiple
option there is no road map there is no
signs of shelter there is no shine sense
of guidance so there is no way out for
me this is not the work for me because
I'm a crowd because I'm a faceless and
some time because of this they do random
actions because I'm I have no face I am
a crowd I have nothing to lose and I can
so I can I can try I can spam right I
can behave unpredictable many times or
some people but some people find their
way as well but so i will show you in
the next site but what do we need as a
platform is a stickiness of users or or
workers right we want them to work long
hours we want them to work as per the
task owners guide line and
we want them to provide quality
judgments or quality we call it judgment
or quality input right that's the
intention so there are many type of
worker you cannot call crowd because
crowd has a No Name no face no color but
there if you want to do a better task
assignment you have to understand what
kind of type of workers are there some
workers who and who has figured it out
in a in a direction so they will come
and work on one particular task and they
are consistent single task worker there
are some worker who are consistent but
they like to do multiple task right
there is no good or bay you know bad
method some some some people say oh I
want one worker to work only one work on
one task so that they built the mental
muscle and they built the accuracy and
there are some research which suggests
well I i do want worker to work on
multiple tasks so there is a context
switching so there is a avoidance of
fatigue but there are there are it's a
it's based on the worker choice there
are different kind of workers and
different they have different way of
working style and they have different
choices the raspa roddick workers and
transient worker who come and go and
they try multiple task and then they go
so another point I want to make here in
marketplace dynamics is there is a
delicate balance as it as a platform
owner as you grow your marketplace there
is a delicate balance between number of
workers and then number of task those
who have curated or groom marketplace
they will know the challenge that when
you are bringing or making a marketplace
you these are very delicate balance
because if you have many number of task
but less worker your task will star so
there is immediately response of the
task owner is to increase price but in
an enterprise environment if you
increase if you keep increasing the
price then it will cascade the whole
price and your enterprise lose if you
increase the number of workers but there
is a less task what happens worker do
not feel that its value of my time and
and there is no worth of my time I there
is no good earning potential there is
they will go away good quality people
will go away at the same time another
thing may happen which that there are
more workers less toss so people try to
rush and there is a quality suffers so
marketplace dynamics is very critical
and very sensitive subject you have to
balance we constantly balance number of
workers and number of tasks so that we
create the healthy marketplace I many
people ask me the how many workers you
have or you know we have 10,000 workers
we have hundred thousand workers we have
million task million workers number of
worker really don't care in a matter
here how many active worker you have how
many worker provides good good quality
and how many workers provide or follow
the guideline and provide the quality so
future there are seven plus billion
people in the world we have tremendous
opportunity to to tap into this
massively growing well connected well
connected resource pool so that any task
you have there is expert out there and
you can you can assign so opportunity I
see is that matching the people skill
with the task and then at a scale high
scale and that's a opportunity and
research area I I would like to you know
give it to you it would be wonderful to
have people earn money without
employment that would be another
opportunity but imagine a world where
any task you have you do not need to
leave comfort of your home image in a
world in order to do task you don't need
to leave a comfort of your home so you
know we don't need to reinvent the wheel
over last where we are today is is
because what we did in past and what we
learned in passed right over the 100
years has taught us something so we do
not need to reinvent the well we just
need to fill the gap between physical
world and virtual world
how task will be done in future right
how how we how we distribute the task
today in a physical world how we work
with matt today or joe today which you
know already and how i can work tomorrow
with matt and joe in the cloud right go
beyond micro task micro task when i
think about micro task faq factory
connotation comes to mind that okay if
you want a repetitive same kind of task
and if you want worker and worker not to
think about then it's like a factory
assembly line system but task there are
many tasks and if you want to really
realize the potential of this well
connected three billion people then you
need to go beyond micro task anything
that you can outsource granby cloud
source and that that i believe in that
and join to contribute next we have
matt's lease
how about window top of you full screen
thanks
hello so working great well thanks Mary
for inviting me to be here I'll be
talking about some things that I think
are sort of off the beaten track at
least for what's commonly talked about
for crowd work so to start with for
anyone who wasn't at the second session
yesterday we heard Jeff how she and Eric
talked about a lot of the new kinds of
really exciting innovative applications
that crowd work is empowering
specifically micro crowd work so for
example here you might be over at your
friend's house or at target and you see
a chair that looks pretty cool and you
wonder well you know I could go buy it
here at Target but i wonder if amazon
has it cheaper so imagine you could just
take a picture of that chair regardless
of the lighting conditions the angle the
scale whether things are partially
occluding it and figure out whether
amazon has that chair in stock so this
is something which machine vision can't
do right now but machine vision coupled
with crowds can do so suddenly that
means that instead of you know being
bounded in building or intelligent
application by what the best state of
the air state-of-the-art AI can do today
suddenly you were bounded only by human
competency you might have to pay more
you might have to wait longer but
something there's a whole new very
creative exciting design space for
building these kinds of applications for
customers and so this is driven all
kinds of really exciting research in all
fields of intelligence sort of system
design as well as a lot of startups and
applications but what we talked about a
lot less are the people behind this I'm
a computer scientist by training most of
the work I do is in the statistics of
how to sort of ensure that we collect
this dot this data from crowds
effectively affordably cheaply but who
are actually the crowds behind this well
we just talked about you know there's
challenges of matching appropriate
workers to work they do and actually one
of my graduate students is here on
internship this summer hyun-joon and so
you know that's the sort of thing I
would normally think about but who are
the crowd behind all this work well
there were some surveys that were done a
couple years ago about mechanical turk
workers in particular
we know a bit about their distribution
in America and India we know a bit about
their their education levels and
economics it's really only in the last
year or so that we started to see some
real ethnographic work of trying to
understand working conditions some of
you might have heard of there is a
nonprofit called sama source they
actually have political refugees or
displaced persons who are sort of have
nowhere to go no chance to earn income
they've set up computer labs and these
people are doing mechanical turk tasks
the United Nations and you see here with
support by Microsoft and others are also
doing some of the things of setting up
computer labs so you have a very diverse
ecosystem of people out there who are
actually doing this kind of work and a
lot of what makes sort of the micro task
work stuff work is because this is an
invisible crowd it scales it's often
anonymous you don't know who's doing it
but these are kind of some of the people
behind it now there's been a lot of
discussion about do we have digital
sweatshops do we have digital slaves out
there doing this work when you think
that people are just doing this because
they're bored and they're trying to kill
time or because that this is just extra
flash cash they're doing instead of
watching a TV show then you don't worry
so much about pay but we've seen that
there is increasing we're particularly
in developing nations where this is
being done for primary income and you
can see here it certainly is a group for
which this money is actually empowering
as well as the opportunity to take a
little bit of agency in terms of their
life conditions so let me turn back and
talk about some of the other kinds of
tasks that crowdsourcing is enabling so
when you have any new technology it can
be used to do great good and it can be
used for things there may be less good
here's sort of a questionable case so if
you're a popular social network you
probably have terms of use describing
what kinds of imagery can be posted that
are appropriate and maybe it's not
acceptable for your customers to have to
flag inappropriate images so instead
what you do is you in some sense
outsource those jobs to the third world
so your job is to look at this kind of
imagery and flag it as appropriate or
not and this is something there was a
Gawker story that ran about this two
years ago well on one hand this is
exactly what human computation is great
at right human computation is saying
where is machine vision letting me down
and
I can use crowds to perform those tasks
for me but on the other hand this is
exactly the kind of task we don't want
people having to do right because people
are the ones who are likely to be
emotionally or effectively affected by
this kind of work so we have this
catch-22 that the very kind of task
people are know that the human
computation is creating are the kinds of
tasks we really don't maybe want people
to be doing and this is particularly in
the case if you think about now you
combine what the best AI and the crowd
work can do so the AI is filtering out
all the images you're pretty confident
or fine and all the crowd worker is
seeing is all the images that are
borderline and there are cases of people
for instance seeing images of people
committing suicide and uploading that
there's also all kinds of other stuff
you know solving CAPTCHAs SEO account
creation cyber crime and now a new age
of cyber warfare where again these are
you know what people are being involved
in to do tasks behind the scene now
who's doing the work in many cases right
it's fine we have people who are doing
this tumor in the spare income or kill
time but a lot of the problems with this
unknown workforce is we don't know who's
doing the work or it could be at risk
populations so there's cases we know of
Chinese prisoners doing gold farming
online this could be refugees as we just
talked about on one hand and powering on
one hand you might feel differently
about political refugees doing your work
children you know we just don't know
very much often about who's doing the
work online we talk a lot about how to
wake how to make work more efficient by
sort of abstracting the micro task away
from the overall task which the work is
being done so you can think of the Ford
factory model for producing a car you
try to have somebody just produce the
headlight and not worry about the
context but that's completely at odds
with helping people understand how their
work is being used in the context of the
overall work product it will be produced
so in some sense we have an inherent
tension between trying to not make
people aware of the overall task and
people might feel differently let's say
about labeling image if they knew
labeling images if they knew their
training machine vision that will be
used system that we use for the military
or maybe to detect people who are
protesters over in Syria just because
the task is chosen online we often
assume the task is freely chosen and
therefore the person is ms making a
willful
cision we just don't really know a lot
about this and in general we know that
in sort of throughout human history
whenever there is increasing amounts of
money at stake that there will be
certain populations who are imposed to
do work by others and there's really
nice talk at the Microsoft faculty
summit two years ago about from Robert
sim talking about how in general all
this fraud online is just really part of
organized crime and sometimes this is
just one more component in the larger
picture so we really don't need to think
about sort of on its own so there's been
increasing discussion or awareness in
the ACM for thinking about you know
crowdsourcing is one hand is great you
know we're enabling blind people to see
what's the can of food in front of them
we're creating all these innovative
applications but at the same time what
are sort of the costs that we may not be
seeing as well that are harder to detect
and I admit I just found out this last
year the ACM the Association for
Computing Machinery even has a code of
ethics isn't that may be a problem that
that wasn't in my training but you know
so you read here one of the things they
talk about is with the advanta
outsourcing and offshoring financial and
economic imperatives these are often
related to ethical issues concerning
exploitation I can't tell you how many
crowdsourcing papers i read that are
talking about how cheaply we got the
data and how great this is with no
discussion about sort of the ethical
implications of this kind of work
another thing computer scientists might
hope we heard somebody say yesterday was
that the law would fix everything so
being in the information school I had
the opportunity to work with a lawyer
and my real concern was we and
intelligent systems are building a huge
scaffolding of work on this assumption
that will continue to have this kind of
cheap plentiful data to build our
systems but this is all basically
predicated on the fact that these people
are independent contractors not
employees and therefore not subject to
minimum wage laws so we went through and
we looked at some of this stuff and saw
some reasons why there might be
questions about this and actually since
then now there's litigation class action
litigation in the courts that's still
pending the parties came to agreement
and the judges rejected it so it's still
back out right now so there's a lot of
questions also about legally what's
going on here and as usual we have
technol
LG sort of ahead of the law and I don't
think I don't think just also just
because it legal it's ethical that's
something that also came up in the
lunchtime discussion yesterday so when
people have talked a lot about how much
to pay it's often covered issues of
again what how much do i need to pay to
get quality how much do i need to pay to
get my work done fast and less about how
much do i need to pay to not only
provide a living wage potentially but to
make sure that this is a sustainable
market of work that we can continue to
count on the power intelligent systems
going forward and syd in winter who will
be talking have written a paper where
they talked about you know doing human
subject studies it's unclear in a global
market with human subjects research what
is fair pay that you should provide your
participants people have said well gosh
you know we're not paying minimum wage
you should just pay nothing because if
you pay nothing therefore there's no pay
on the table so in that case you have a
volunteer system or you gamify work and
then you take the work products and you
monetize them and you give participants
who pray provided that data nothing so
it's paying nothing really better than
paying something it's not clear right
now so you know what I've tried to do a
lot for the last year or two is really
just try to find information to help
people think about this a little better
and promote sort of dissemination and
discussion about it but I think a lot of
this is that you know people will behave
in ways that are sort of self-maximizing
and so we should try to work harder on
finding win-win solutions where it's in
your own best interest to act a certain
way so for example if you think about
what happened with music stealing and
itunes right itunes made it fast cheap
and easy to actually buy music legally
so can we make it fast cheap and easy to
figure out what are appropriate wages to
pay crowd workers so we did we wrote a
little API where you can very quickly go
and call our API to find out given an IP
address what's the appropriate minimum
wage region and that in that region of
the world make it quick and easy to
figure out what appropriate pay would be
so very short time here so I had the
great honor to work with a number of
people on a paper talking about a lot of
these issues and others so if you're
interested I refer you to this
and one issue we heard talked on touch
on briefly yesterday just to say is I
think there's a great future in the
intersection of online education and
crowd work so we don't want people in
clothing factories in Haiti or clothing
factories in Bangladesh that are going
to be collapsing that are dead end jobs
we want to provide economic ladders such
that people who can come in and do these
kind of entry-level jobs but then climb
up to other areas and this is one thing
we talked about in this paper among a
lot of these other issues so with that
I'm going to wrap up and refer anyone
who's interested particularly in issues
of ethics and crowd work to take a look
at this great site and blog that six
silberman has set up and join our
conversation online thank you
our next speakers winter Mason I'm
kidding hear me now okay so that was a
really nice Matt I like that what Matt
was really talking about is something
that's a little bit immediate like what
we need to think about right now in
order to address the issue of Ithaca
ethics and and human workers like in
crowd work right now what I'm going to
talk about is a little bit closer to
what Rajesh was talking about which is
sort of a longer-term vision with
respect to the future of crowdsourcing
and work and so what I want to start
with is this question of what kind of
work can be crowd-sourced so this is the
the like I just came up with a quick
list of crowd sourcing platforms that
are commonly used or often talked about
these days so Mechanical Turk has this
like standard format of micro tasks
anonymous workers elance and odesk is
maybe a little bit more has more of that
reputation system more of that like
here's Matt here's Joe type of work
right where you've actually got profiles
and and some understanding of the person
all of those both of those are very
online but you also have these things
that are moving into the physical world
still crowdsourcing like TaskRabbit gig
walk and Jarrah formally or Jonah
formally text eagle and of course I also
appreciated that you mentioned gold
farming is one way of actual crowd work
like this is something that is actually
done but I want to argue that there's
actually another kind of crowd sourcing
that is currently being done that is
just actually considered typical labor
right which is this right so here you
actually have a situation in the real
world where you have an effectively
anonymous workers that you hire and you
pull from a crowd right and you get them
to do work right in fact what I want to
argue today and where I want to sort of
nudge the discussion a little bit is
that the lines but between what we have
been conceiving is crowdsourcing
actually or blurrier
and are more like actually a traditional
labor than we generally give it credit
for so in this interest I started
thinking okay I went to the Bureau of
Labor Standards has this classification
system for different types of work in
the country and so I just sort of went
through this list and sort of put this
is not exhaustive but I went through and
put some things and said okay well what
is crowdsourcing what is not crowdsource
right so currently in the crowd source
category you have things service so you
actually see people doing like on odesk
and elance doing sort of administrative
work where they're actually maybe
answering phone calls or that sort of
thing of course technology work that's a
lot of what we see people doing maybe
like top coder is a great example where
they're doing web programming and that
sort of thing management of course we
research in science that's what a lot of
us are doing you also have Galaxy Zoo as
an example of that arts and design you
see this with 99 designs in these
crowdsource design platforms in the
crowd not crowd-sourced of course you
have some ones that really seem like it
would be very hard to actually
crowdsource right so manufacturing
agriculture construction forestry mining
you know textiles real estate banking
health care education leisure tourism
right so this is this is like not
exhaustive but I tried to capture most
of the categories in the ILS in the
Bureau of Labor Standards classification
I don't want to argue that like at least
in the near future I'm you could
actually see this section of industries
also moving over to this section where
these types of industries are also
starting to be crowd-sourced so you have
apps like Trulia and Zillow for real
estate right well you can imagine that
people are actually starting to do the
real straight real estate transactions
online and only the very last leg is
done in person where you're going to see
the house banking of course you have a
lot of online banking that's going on
you have simple Bank simple which is
effectively entirely online and and you
can see how these different industries
might actually take advantage of the
sorts of things that crowdsourcing the
advantages that crowd
sourcing has and so in this in this
interest so in a paper that I have with
more Naaman and Ronnie teodoro and and
others where we were looking at
specifically physical crowdsourcing
things right and so we came up with this
sort of task dimensions that were
relevant to to the kinds of things that
we were studying and so one dimension
was between was on tax complete ask
complexity or the expertise that was
required and I think this this one is a
very important one one that definitely
applies in regular work right so how
much task complexity is required or how
much expertise is required to do the job
that you have is actually probably a
reasonable determinant of how much pay
you're going to get right there's
different skills and the level of skill
required is definitely one of the key
factors in in pay one thing that is not
usually thought about in traditional
jobs but of course is thought about a
lot in crowdsourcing is this physical
versus virtual dimension where you know
Mechanical Turk and fancy hands are very
much on the end and odesk would also be
in that top left corner top left corner
are very you know virtual it's online
all of the work is actually done online
and then you have ones that are very
physical so TaskRabbit and gig walk you
actually have the job to go out and take
a picture of prices on the shelf or to
pick up some laundry or something to
that effect I want to argue that there
are some other important task dimensions
when you start to broaden the concept
outside of crowd sourcing and into
traditional labor things like
coordination requirements so it's not
just that you as an individual worker
has have skills there's many many jobs
in the real world and and in jobs that
could potentially be crowd-sourced that
require coordination between workers
right so this is why we have
organizations this is why we have
organizational structure is because once
you get to a certain size once you get
to a certain task complexity you
actually need to have organization in
order to get the work done effectively
but there's also other really
interesting constraints that we don't
normally think about so when we're
putting tasks on Mechanical Turk
one of the things you know a lot of
times you see people saying oh you need
to be a native us worker one of the
reason is that you know people generally
think oh you I get better quality work
there but it could just be that there's
a big mismatch between sort of the
expectations of the task requester and
the expectations of the worker right so
you know maybe it's just uh there's
linguistic problems they don't
understand the instructions because it's
not their first language maybe or maybe
there's cultural constraints where you
are asking them to do something that you
just assume everybody knows because it's
part of your culture but as soon as
you're crossing cultural boundaries
that's not reasonable and then maybe you
have Geographic constraints if you're
doing one of these physical things like
TaskRabbit or gig walk another important
thing is technology requirements this is
another assumption we have when we're
doing tasks on Mechanical Turk we assume
that they have a computer and that they
have computer literacy right but when
you start to talk about the types of
crowdsourcing such as text Eagle John
ajara whatever it is they're it's like
the only expectation is that they have a
flip phone right and so understanding
sort of the the technology requirements
and these are important when you start
to think how can we how can we take
advantage of the of the benefits of
crowdsourcing and move it into a
standard typical labor so what are some
of these benefits oh okay so what are
some of these benefits you have the fact
that you can for the from the worker
side they can very easily there's very
little friction going from job to job
right so on Mechanical Turk one of the
benefits and one of the reasons that one
of the things that factors into the
ethical considerations of work on
Mechanical Turk is that it is assumed
that when you're doing a particular task
it is very easy for you to just stop
doing that one task task and start doing
another right learning considerations
aside and you can see this in the at
least one of the types of workers that
Rajesh had you actually see people that
really are going from different types of
tasks giving variety and presumably that
transition is very smooth when you're
talking about real labor that transition
is very rough we there is such a there's
a thing called
friction unemployment frictional
unemployment which is essentially that
those people that are between jobs right
and so that is there's always some
period there's almost always some period
between jobs in which people are
unemployed and that's because there is
this friction moving from one job to
another another benefit from the task
requester side from the person that is
getting the work done is that you can
grab that there is a pool of people
there's always work available there's
less seeking you know you don't have to
in mechanical turk type test you don't
have to worry about the matching and
that sort of thing and I think that
there's some hope that regular jobs can
start to have this feature where if
there is better matching you can get
there so what I wanted to think about is
well how can you crowdsource any job
what is what is actually crowdsource
about and so you know one of the first
things that I think about because this
is how I started researching
crowdsourcing is about incentives and
and we're talking about online work of
course you can do things like
gamification you can have badges that
get people to participate and you know
foursquare has done this to great
success where there's no pay involved
but they get a lot of data collected and
this data is monetizable and just
because people get to be mayor of their
local starbucks or whatever right
similarly I mean similar to that concept
you know you have the mayor and so you
have these elite you can have
leaderboards you know galaxies you or
whatever could have something or how
many galaxies have you labeled and are
you in the top ten what one that's off
that's now increasingly mentioned and i
think is very important is the community
building right so people on Mechanical
Turk you know the core users the really
active users on Mechanical Turk
definitely feel like they're part of a
community you can also say this about
the contributors on Wikipedia they
definitely feel like they're part of a
community right and of course you also
see the traditional just money right and
money is how like most labor is dealt
with that is
probably always going to be the way that
most labor happens but it's worth
noticing that the things that we're
seeing in the volunteer work and
volunteer crowdsourcing is leveraging
these these non-financial incentives and
there's good reason to believe that
there's at least some exchange ability
in terms of compensation so you might be
able to pay somebody less if the task is
actually enjoyable and it would be
interesting to see whether those sorts
of trade-offs actually could get shifted
into the real world perhaps academia is
so enjoyable that people are willing to
not earn as much so this is a figure
from Matt's organic I actually think
that maybe Rajesh is figures would have
been better for this because my point
here is simply that so this is matt
talking about the difference between a
traditional survey versus his wiki
survey which is an excellent paper i
highly recommend it the work is great
but the idea is that when you look at
the contributions on for instance
wikipedia and on Mechanical Turk you see
this very like long tailed distribution
where a lot of people contribute very
lightly you know they just have one
little edit on a page and that's
essentially all that they ever have done
on Wikipedia and then you have a small
core of people that have done lots of
that just it's their lifeblood it's what
they do their part of that community and
they really love it right and so Matt
specifically this little gray square in
the corner is sort of what is actually
accomplished through traditional surveys
where you're just asking everybody to
fill out 100 you know 50 questions and
that's what you ask of everybody so
you're not able to take advantage of the
full tale I would argue that that that
long tail is actually something that
probably applies in the real physical
world when you look at the the community
of model train builders right very
clearly you have this like distribution
of interest where you've got a very
small set is willing to spend hours and
hours and hours on building model train
sets right and so if we could actually
take real-world jobs and start to modify
them so that we can capture these types
of contributions we might be able to
improve the efficiency of labor in many
many different markets this these three
points I think are very important in
terms of you know how how do you
actually ensure that market is working
and that you have
like that you're able to crowdsource
these jobs this is thanks to Alex Pesach
bitch and so one and a lot of these were
mentioned by Rajesh but number one you
have to have sufficient numbers of
workers and job you have to have enough
so that the workers know when they come
there's going to be a job available for
them and when the people come to get
work done they know that there's going
to be somebody there to do the work it's
also important to be able to easily find
that match if everybody and this is sort
of my vision is that you have like a
single market place for all jobs right
and if you had that right it's still
very then you have so many jobs it's
going to be very difficult to find it
and so you have to have a good mechanism
for finding a match between the workers
and the jobs and then of course you need
to have safety in the market you need to
be sure that there is an enforced
reputation system on both sides probably
insurance when you win in the real labor
market there are these sorts of
protections that the government provides
and when things are good and and so it's
it's something that would be like very
good to have and something that would be
necessary if you want to really bring a
real labor into this sort of crowd
sourcing type environment and then just
three other things that I think are sort
of important for this you need to have a
legal framework and support and I think
this sort of applies to the current
situation as Matt was talking and also
to this sort of long-term vision that
I'm describing here um you also need to
have if you really want this to be a
global marketplace then you really need
to start having these effective language
and cultural bridges mechanisms by which
people can sort of address potential
linguistic or cultural differences and
find a way to resolve them and then of
course I think it's very important to
think about access opportunities and if
you are actually to construct this kind
of labor market to ensure that it is not
unfairly biased against any particular
group that every group has equal access
because in terms of the ethics that's
something that's going to be very
important so that's all I have to say
thank you
will be Sid Sri
okay can everybody hear me yeah okay so
it's getting late in the afternoon and
it's about that time where I used to get
a little sleepy so I'll start this off
I'm just going to tease myself and I'll
tell a little story so my name is Sid
Sri and I'm a computer scientist and
what I do what I've been doing since
about 08 09 and part many in conjunction
with winter is I try to figure out what
can I learn about humanity by
crowdsourcing so how can we take
psychological behavioral economical
experiments and put them on
crowdsourcing sites so the participants
are our subjects and the experiment is
the task that's what I did from about 08
through through now and I still do it
and it was about all i did until until I
met Mary about a year and a half ago
Mary came up to me and she said Sid I
heard you do a lot of crowdsourcing I
want to do an ethnography of crowd
workers and I said Mary that sounds
awesome let's do it by the way what's in
ethnography so we've been at it for
about a year year and a half now and I
think I can answer that question
although i'm not entirely sure so so
what I'm going to talk about today is
just our progress so far okay piece of
the progress not not all of it so as
many of you know many of you many people
in this room have done crowd sourcing
for a while so this is kind of how
crowdsourcing works this is a kind of a
high level picture I have up here what
happens is a requester puts a task on a
crowdsourcing platform a platform could
be mechanical turk you hrs gig walk what
have you and then a worker comes and
does that task and the point I'm making
with that little diagram is that the API
mediates the interaction between the
worker and the requester okay so now
again Mary came out to me she said she
wants to do an ethnography so sure what
she wants to figure out who are the
crowd workers and why do they do crowd
work so what she does is she circumvents
the API gets in their living room and
interviews and doesn't just interview
once but does so over time maybe for a
year okay I mean she's not in her living
room every day but you know what I mean
um just move in with them but uh
but that so that's what she does and
then what I do is I am the requester and
I'm trying to figure out what can I
learn about these crowd workers by using
the API sometimes by just using it
vanilla ways and sometimes by kind of
poking holes through it and that's what
I'm going to talk to you about today is
these two approaches what we've learned
and how they come together okay so as
many of you know crowdsourcing and what
I'm talking my crowd sourcing in this
moment what I'm especially talking about
micro test micro tasks are work for pay
but not a whole lot more so if you think
about the job a job and what I mean to
say job I mean the kind of job that
everyone in this room kind of has the
API crowdsourcing it generally leaves
out a lot of what makes a job a job so
for example there's no advancement in
most largely speaking there's no
advancement in crowdsourcing there's no
employer reputation there's no larger
organization the workers are a part of
workers to generally don't have benefits
often don't have leadership there's they
get very little or no recognition
because it's usually anonymous there's
no identity like I said it's anonymous
they don't have colleagues they can't
collaborate this API that mediates this
interaction strips a lot of this away
one thing though that Mary and I
observed is that workers and platforms
are slowly starting to put some of this
stuff back in okay so mobile works is a
crowdsourcing site and they allow
workers to become managers that is to
say they allow workers to manage other
workers Mechanical Turk has a version us
a similar but different version of this
called masters leadership some some
crowdsourcing sites a leadership has
emerged among the workers for example
spam girl she started Turk our nation
which is a forum for mechanical turk
workers and she is a de facto leader of
that community gig walk has has these
two individuals who they have a tumblr
site for onboarding new gig walkers oh
by the way if you didn't know gig or gig
walk is a mobile crowdsourcing platform
where people are often paid to go take
pictures of things like businesses for
example and they have an a site to help
workers on board get advice back best
practices etc
and then Lily irani and six Silberman at
UCSD started Turk opticon so that
workers could keep an eye on the
reputation of the requesters before they
actually do their work and what I'm
going to talk more about today as
workers are starting to put
collaboration back into crowdsourcing
forms of sprung up they collaborate on
these forums they share tasks with each
other they often collaborate on these
tasks they work on these tasks together
and like I said that's what I'm going to
talk more about now so like I told you
Mary gets into these people's living
rooms interviews and what I've pulled
out here is a few quotes from some of
these interviews and to protect
anonymity I changed all the names to
famous Bollywood stars because all of
these all of these are quotes come from
interviewing Indian Indian workers so
the first so the point I'm making on the
slide is workers talk to each other they
teach each other and they collaborate
with each other so the first quote I
taught Mechanical Turk to my friends my
friends aishwarya and priya are eating
or earning well Salman Khan is my guru
in EM turek and and there's like I could
have put like 10 other quotes on here
let me this is really really common for
them to teach each other now on on to
collaboration if we are not here and the
the worker the the interviewer
interviewee was talking about if we are
not here sharing tasks talking with each
other and sharing tasks then M Turk
would also not be here he viewed sharing
task is so important that M Turk
wouldn't be around if they didn't do it
and if I'm and then there's two
childhood friends one of them said if
I'm working and find a good hit then I
call my friend and tell him about it so
when I personally would have never
thought to measure workers collaborating
if Mary hadn't gone there and interview
them just it would never even occurred
to me ok so so this is the point I'm
making there's there's requesters on one
side of the AP on the other side there's
there's workers but there's edges
between the workers and those edges can
what are those edges mean like I said
they're talking to each other they're
teaching each other and they're
collaborating why is this important why
does this matter it could be that if a
worker so winter and I are friends you
know most the time so if he
it could be that if he does a task and
you know and it's a lucrative task he
sends it to me so if winter does a task
I'm more likely to do the test then some
other random workers so workers aren't
independent so we decided to go out and
try to measure this so what we did was
we built a hit a very very simple hit I
won't give you the details you could do
it in under 30 seconds and it paid a
quarter and we read it run for five
weeks and on the x-axis is the days as
time went on and the y-axis is the
number of workers who did our hip and
this is a stacked bar plot the black
parts of the bars indicate how many
workers came to our hit from an online
forum so after they did the hit we just
had a little pull down menu how did you
hear about this hit one option was
online forum and the light blue parts of
these bars were just from searching
Mechanical Turk and what you can see is
that first off it's very bursty there's
these huge spikes at the beginning and
it just a random times and what's
driving these spikes it's posting to the
forums it's about about more than fifty
percent of the traffic came from workers
posting this sit this this hit on on the
forums so there really are sharing these
their tasks and it really matters a lot
so popping up a level what I'm saying is
crowdsourcing is a little bit less like
the top which is how I thought about it
when I first started doing it on the top
I have a picture of like Rajesh was
saying a large crowd faceless crowd
majin his crowd of workers and it's more
like tapping into networks of workers
and these workers are individuals they
have things that they're good at and bad
at and these differ and workers have
preferences for tasks as I've shown here
and preferences for requesters so what
am I trying to say crowdsourcing strips
away much of what makes a job a job
maybe perhaps to increase quality
usability and enjoy ability we need to
restore some of these aspects and
workers and platforms have already
started to do this and now just as a
final point that i'll make that we can
talk about more in the discussion part
is is the fact that the api strips away
all about the work in pay
is that entirely bad and I'll give you
two examples which indicate maybe it's
not entirely bad the first is culturally
it can be difficult for women in India
in India to work outside the home so
what Mary and her team have found out is
that women are using crowd work to
contribute financially to their houses
but work inside the home and because the
API no one knows their women right
because the API is anonymous no one owes
their women similarly in various parts
of India Muslims are discriminated
against it can be hard for them to find
a job but on a crowdsourcing site
because of the API no one knows they're
Muslim so it's much easier than for them
to do crowd work the last thing I'd like
to say is this is a very large project
with quite a few people Mary and Rajesh
are two of my great collaborators Sara
Kingsley extremely talented intern grad
student at u mass Amherst show up in
deep t help us a lot with the interviews
in India this project would not go
without them and Kate's been on the
ground in boston helping mary out a lot
and if you want to hear more about this
project there's a demo at right after
this session in the hood room and sarah
just made a awesome demo for that so
