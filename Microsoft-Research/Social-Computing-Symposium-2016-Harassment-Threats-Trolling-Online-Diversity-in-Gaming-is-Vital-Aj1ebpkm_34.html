my name is Tania to pass i started the
hashtag i need diverse games on twitter
in october 2014 and i literally was mad
about video games at like six in the
morning that's how all of this started
so a little bit about me i I've been a
gamer for a long time and I had that
kind of wakening of there are not people
who look like me in games at least not
people who actually make it to the end
of the story or you know our part of the
story they're not just background filler
and at the time I throw out the hashtag
there was the conversation about being
unable to animate women kind of coming
across my social media again and seeing
other places where I didn't get to exist
in gaming is not a cheap hobby and if
I'm going to drop 60 70 bucks on a title
plus the amount on a console I would
like to exist in these digital
landscapes ok so I'm not going to read
slides at you I hate that when people do
that to me and talks I'm just going to
read this and then the rest of it you
know if you have questions things were
bolted for talking points so I want to
talk about why it's more than a buzzword
because a lot of people just dismiss
diversity when you bring it up in any
context especially in technology that oh
you're just doing it for money it's a
buzzword people like you don't care
about technology and representation
which is a lie so in this talk I'm
defining it as a goal where x games will
reflect the world around us where games
have very characters and who are fully
realized not simply flat stereotypes and
tropes they can exist without
controversy hatred for the game players
or its makers for purchase for choosing
to portray a non-homogeneous world to
play in feel free to tweet you know
either my personal twitter which is up
there or the ID diverse games twitter
and i have cards later so there was
actually a census done about characters
in the game's not people playing them
and unsurprisingly it was majority found
to be white characters so this is one of
the things i came across and planning
not just this talk but other places i've
used the slide where you know if you
don't get to see yourself it affects you
you know I'm
have no shame and telling my age I'm
gonna be 43 in April I don't get to see
myself a lot you know from playing
street fighter in the arcade up till now
so you know this is something that
really touched me because I get to exist
or at least I should and i am going to
tie this back to harassment I'm not just
randomly going on about this so I looked
at this slide and I honestly couldn't
tell many of the characters apart and
that kind of bothered me a lot it's true
I I can kind of tell who nathan drake is
only because of all the buzz about the
next game but you know these are
characters that are starring in games
you know there's not a lot of women who
look like me i know there's not women
who look exactly like me starring in
games so the other slides you know we're
kind of just filler but one reason i
want to talk about diversity so much and
do talk about it and thus get harassed
is because you know how many people ever
played The Witcher 3 okay so just you
okay well besides you and me so I love
and I say this with the caveat I love
the game it's very well written I
enjoyed it it made me laugh and cry but
the minute I did any kind of critique
about it or just said it's a very white
game I immediately get flooded with but
but polish mythology and Slavic history
but there are dwarves with a Scottish
accent in this game so yeah seriously
there dwarves a sequel to Scottish
accent in his game so the succubus is
like the only brown person you see in
this game and notice she is not human
and I don't remember if you get to kill
her or not but you know again the brown
chick doesn't get to live very long I'll
provide the slides if people want links
this but I just threw links into you
articles talking about the witcher 3 and
specifically i'm leaving us out of the
conversation leaving us out of video
games sydney fossil is actually a local
writer and it's done a lot of great
articles as well and then you know I had
to put myself in there because
historical accuracy is one of the things
that will make me like see red when
people try to give that as an excuse
for why brown people don't get to exist
in video games who's played rust well I
have like no gamer folks and okay okay
well I tried it it wasn't my jam but I
wonderly see what all the buzz was about
and for those that don't know rust
totally randomizes your character and
this is your race your genital sides and
now your gender like it's based off your
steam profile and people flipped out
they just totally lost it and you would
think that a game where you have the
option to turn it off or you have the
option to you know immerse yourself in
another reality would not be such a big
deal but people like return the game
this was one of the first games that
have been released when steam started
the whole refund process and the quote
that I have up there is that I'm a white
guy and I don't want to take the chance
of playing a black character that's
lovely but that is an incredibly
privileged thing to say because I don't
get to take this off this is me all day
every day till I die I will go quickly
and this is just something I had up
there as an example so you know these
are just points I often bring up on how
to better diversify gaming stop using
excuse of you know historical accuracy
because Griffin's and things like that
don't get to exist in Poland along with
this is inaccurate diversify your team's
to persuade your content because without
that diversification we're going to just
keep seeing 99% of games coming out with
a white male lead and nothing will ever
change so quickly how's this time
harassment I get to block over a hundred
thousand people or i should say it
counts because i don't think they're all
actual people on twitter simply because
i asked for more diversity I can't use
twitter anymore without blocking tools
and I have three block BOTS running at
all times on both my personal account
and on the I need verse games account
and this is now a matter of course I
can't go back to not having it I written
articles I can't read those articles and
oh I can read the article is just not
comments because as an eel will tell us
later talking
don't read the comments I I twitch
stream I don't get on camera because I
legit fear being swatted and again this
is just asking for people like me in a
game and then I worried now about
boosting someone else because you never
know if I boost someone's project will
that bring unwanted harassment to their
door and then finally what can what can
we change and these are just thoughts
that i had about how to make it
specifically twitter better because you
can block someone they can still at you
later they can still reply to change
with you i would really love it if it
was like facebook where if I block you I
no longer exist you can't find me you
can't tweet me you can't reply to me and
then my take on how we get it to happen
is understand that a lot are the same
fret because the Internet is real a lot
of the friends I've made a lot of the
interactions I've had our be the
internet and then lastly shift our
culture to realize there is a person
that is going to see those hurtful words
they're going to see what you said and
they're going to have an emotional
reaction because no one should have to
fear just looking at its social because
in the end of the day Twitter is a tool
that we all use and none of us should
have to fear going on to it so that was
my very quick explanation about how
diversity and me being harassed I
together do we
one quick question i'm doing a breakout
afterward about emotional self care yes
no Mon yell something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
