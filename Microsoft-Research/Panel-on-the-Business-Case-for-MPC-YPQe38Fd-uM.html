hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
alright so we're going to get started
for the second panel so the FEMA the
panel is on the business case for npc so
we have three panelists this time we
have Xavier salido from trustworthy
computing and Microsoft we have Vlad
Kalashnikov from Bell Labs and Florian
Kirschbaum from ASAP okay so yeah so the
theme of this panel is going to be the
business case for npc so we want to kind
of you know get a sense of what are the
killer apps for npc and we're where we
headed with this technology and so I
guess I'll just see how I get started
with with the questions so the first
question is probably the most obvious
question which David talked a little bit
about today which is what are the curve
applications for MPC hey so or if you
don't know what the cool application is
what characteristics or web feature is a
okay so out you won't shake it at dawn I
don't have the final answer to the
question but so so I've been trying to
popularize essence secure computation
MPC in SP for now almost seven eight
years and differently from what David
said where he said that you need to have
a new application I don't think that
that's necessarily the case so into in
the beginning it was very much like
we're not gonna pay for any security or
privacy this is not not well not hire on
at least we're not gonna pay for this
and with the the wider adoption of cloud
computing this actually changed so the
cloud providers they very much feel the
need I think that in the business
sectors I have I hope I don't have to
explain who ACP is so we're we're
selling to two companies and they are
very reluctant to put their data into
the cloud because they
suddenly get very dependent on the cloud
provider and that makes them very much
afraid and the cloud providers losing
lots and lots of business because people
say well you know I already gave you
this data and now if I give you this
data also that would be that would
really in danger my really liability for
me that I would endanger me I can't do
that so so you're not getting this and
they date they are looking for solutions
to that and they're they're actually
quite a number of successful security
startups which provide more or less less
secure our talk solutions so these kind
of things that they are doing very well
and at some point of time if you go if
you had the discussion today we need
million user applications if you go to
even lower than that if you if you go to
do more than one you have you have to
actually have two keys and if you have
two keys you rule out more or less a lot
of homework achsah Lucian's and then
you're back to secure computation and so
there there there is a potential I think
there's still a long way to go but but I
do think that I let me say it like that
lk always has this picture where he says
you know you have some technology and
it's continuously improving but the
barrier it has to cross is also
increasing so actually you never
actually make the threshold and the
technology will always stay below so
what would you actually have to have is
you have to make a big jump is complete
different kind of view point in order to
make it so I'm I am at the point of time
where I say if secure accommodation
doesn't make it with cloud computing
it's not looking particularly good so
likes animation I I working trustworthy
computing group I have to say that I'm
coming at this from a slightly different
angle on two counts the first one is I
don't focus on security I focus on
privacy and as you're probably aware of
privacy is a land that so far has been
relegated to lawyers I'm not a lawyer
how to get that out at the second thing
is I I'm not
searcher I my background has been mostly
in consulting services out there with
large and enterprise customers so those
two factors have colored my view of FM
bc if we ask the question what are the
killer applications I find it very very
hard to come up with a clear-cut answer
and i believe to understand why that is
the case we need to understand who are
the competitors of NBC and the
comparators of npc it might surprise you
or it might not but the computers are
lawyers why because the majority of
companies out there think they don't
have a problem either we don't have a
security problem or we're not willing to
invest in our security problem or ah we
are covered and when I say we I'm
talking about any company out there we
are covered by what our lawyers tell us
you have to think that when we talk
about laws regulators tend to legislate
towards objectives this is what we want
to happen as opposed to this is how it
has to happen and when you do that then
you start seeing in laws these land with
this language that talks about best
efforts or reasonable efforts and once
you get into a courtroom almost anything
can look like a best effort or a
reasonable effort unless you've been
outlandishly are careless and lawyers
focus on that so companies believe
really believe that they don't have a
problem and because they believe that
they don't have a problem when it comes
to securing privacy then ah they don't
pay as much attention to this type of
technology what the solution to that is
probably and in our experience our is
focusing on other benefits of MPC
are namely economic benefits efficiency
benefits that's what I think it's going
to turn the tables around for MPC and
yes oh by the way there are significant
security and privacy benefits to go with
that but cases in which just the
security and privacy benefits will be
able to justify the investment in MPC i
I'm not saying that there aren't any out
there and saying it's going to be very
very hard to find them so i wanted to
mention one application that i saw that
seemed people seem to be interested it's
not clear how good it isn't that's a
web-based email so I saw that was in the
internally in the company level and
there were discussions about this and so
if you have a web based server and then
you encrypt your data so you get
encrypted email and then they can search
for it to you know get you whatever you
want but it's all encrypted over there
so the solutions that people use our
order preserving encryption and is that
that doesn't really give a good privacy
guarantee in this in this setting but if
it can be done properly then that could
be something something a killer app may
be okay so that's even worse right so
that's a resume we're very much so a lot
of much there is a there is a company
email and the personal email personally
know people don't care or they trust
hopefully I'm value the IP over your
research so so this this so this example
is okay maybe that you can be motivated
by the actual application but so later I
think there will be questions but my
belief is that really something that you
know something that you will see the use
of NPCs has to come from very strong
pressure from legislation that you
cannot do this way like you know medical
records things like that so you cannot
deploy the system unless this happens
right and only then people will say okay
let's play million dollars or and then
make something that will pass the
legislation and even that it would be
just enough so that the lawyers will say
okay now it means the threshold that is
set by appropriate body so are you so
definitely legislation and regulation
would help or the bumhole so that the
people who write the legislation in
relation don't know what's possible so
part of the challenge maybe is are so
kind of making the technology more more
well-known and a little bit more
mainstream so that people know that it's
even possible to do these things and so
that we can then so I know that people
in Bell Labs they talked to European
bureaucracy to to explain maybe what is
possible but also at the at the high
level it's not it's not that hard to
understand you say well if you
location-based service use you you can
make a requirement that the service
provider so I'm talking more about is a
phone company right service provider
will not know where you are but the
answer requests right so that that's the
case for MVC so if you you can say it in
a human understandable words and/or in
legalese appropriately and then stop to
keep the people to to do it right
so I there's there's the thing that that
we ran up against multiple times and not
just in the case of NPC a lot of the
more innovative technologies out out
there just throw another example
differential privacy if you're familiar
with it about a year ago r Vinay
Rhiannon over at at Princeton published
a couple of articles in I treat actively
security and privacy and I have the
reverence here the articles were
entitled what happened to the crypto
dream and I if you read those articles
it's just a couple of them and over
eight page total but I think he's he's
he's a spot on on some of the issues
here the people that are going to have
to adopt MPC are not consumers the
people that are going to have to adopt
MPC are going to be companies okay
either because they provide services to
consumers or because they do business to
business commerce or whatever but it is
going to be companies that is going to
be there are going to be adopting these
things and within those companies ah
there will be a technical decision maker
particularly now in the age of the cloud
and and with all the stuff about the NSA
and gchq and and and so on and so forth
and and and I want to stress the fact
that this is that I'm not talking about
some theoretical stuff here I'm talking
about real life situations in which we
at Microsoft Iran have ran into and that
is our when you start talking about
these new technologies that imply the
use of cryptography in a way that is not
the popularized way it's not about
hashing is not about encrypting is not
about signing is not about pki it's
about proofs of knowledge and blind
signatures and MPC and all that good
stuff when you start talking about that
then you get the ID staffs from these
companies asking questions
and then you run into a significant
problem which which Narayana correctly
pointed out which is how do you explain
these black magic like technologies to
people who are not used to thinking
about them okay it is really really hard
it is really really hard to get to
convince them that this that this stuff
actually works and then we run into the
second problem once you convince them
all this could actually work you run
into the second problem which is
something we've been telling people I
mean us researchers us from the privacy
point of view something that we've been
telling people for a long time which is
ah crypto is not for amateurs you may
get the theory right but the
implementation completely wrong or the
other way around or whatever combination
you have so once you get them to accept
the idea that these black magic like
technologies are really really possible
and they could actually become a
solution then getting them to adopt
those technologies becomes also very
very hard because of the very high bar
that there is for people to properly
implementing these technologies so i
would agree education is key and by
education i don't just mean a bunch of
grad students over at several
universities I mean the bulk of the
people that are working on secure
software development out there there are
some questions maybe
which is there truth the aspects are you
probably true with bitcoins right i mean
how many of the bitcoin user is no
Krypto and also adopting bitcoins has a
different it has an economic motivation
as opposed to I mean you don't need to
convince someone to use the bitcoins so
I mean it doesn't sort of come in your
argument for promoting npc how does the
president dr. so as researchers we have
different goals so one goal would be
that you know the public adopts you know
some technology and underlying is npc
another one is to get companies you know
like we were like microsoft to take
these technologies and implement them
and throw them into products make you
know more privacy preserving solutions
and so that's where i think what have
you is you need to take a look at the
whole problem and the and the incentives
which is by the way the argument that
not an inmate makes I so the incentives
here are what we talked about in the
previous question the company's believe
that they have a security problem not
necessarily a privacy problem no we're
making money okay so that's that's the
set is a set of incentives and then you
move on to our what you were saying it
is very easy for people out there to
adopt Bitcoin a you have incentives the
clear monetary incentive is there be you
have companies out there that are
selling you appliances to mine bitcoin
you buy your black box and you can start
mining Bitcoin and the connection
between your investment and your return
on investment is very very direct and
very very obvious even to someone that
knows nothing about technology in the
case of MPC we're talking about first
convincing the people that will have to
implement the thing okay and and there
the connection between the in sent the
investment and the return on investment
is not as obvious and once you convince
them that is a good idea it's a good
idea then you have the problem that it
is you mr. I
administrator or mr. IT developer that
is going to have to be developing this
thing and the whole future of the by the
way the whole future of your company
depends on on you doing the proper
implementation ah that's hard let'em may
be more optimistic perspective and based
on three things that other hope it's a
one is companies that wants to a dog
another is when it's new things and this
is actually what's going to
more than trying to add into existing
kings and and the fact that we need to
get the word out i think the word
actually uses getting out i'm involved
actually three projects two of them i
can't say anything about that these are
actually what I said small things but
actually being built one is a more
experimental project at RSA that there
they have a new fraud detection type
thing that uses authentication
information from different customers and
combined them together to try and work
out whether someone is logging in
possibly the affordability and this is
something new that they want to deploy
but they're concerned very much that
their customers will not want to give
all of their authentication information
RSA because actually if you look at that
information it's actually very very
sensitive has a lot of location other
information and so as an enabler for
them to actually deploy this product
they are we're building a prototype
sending orders but whatever is the
confrontation for them to try and see if
that we were going to enable for a new
product so I think that's very
interesting personally that they knew
about it they induced what they're
interested in trying to do it and
I think that we actually we are actually
succeeding slowly but it's the bullet is
just starting so I think that is a very
good point I just want to underscore to
fax a I'm not saying that it's
impossible my job actually eighty
percent of my time is just its
technology transfer so I I believe it is
possible the argument I'm trying to make
here is a we have to understand that
we're not going to be selling MPC on the
security and privacy benefits alone and
B we have to acknowledge the fact that
there is that uphill battle education
battle the example you're giving is very
good but it's our essay those people no
Krypto that's that's their business
which doesn't necessarily happen with
with with everyone else I want to make a
comment or two because I thought about
this actually there are applications
which currently are not being done
because of security reasons which you
could enable with privacy and still I do
not believe that this is going to be the
killer app so so I have been trying to
push in sa PS a supply chain management
so you heard the talk by Thomas we were
the guys doing supply chain management I
can show I can make it very easy
calculation you're going to save this
much money if you do this and people do
not care establishing a new product is
much more difficult than taking an
existing product and adding a feature so
I think that for for getting MPC out
it's because its machinery security
right it's much better to add a security
layer to add privacy then to say i have
a new product that is now being able
because putting out new products I mean
this is a security product so it might
be a little bit different but putting
out new products is much much harder
than actually taking an existing product
and making it secure
so I just wanted to um so um David
brought up this very insightful point
yesterday I think perhaps on a one way
to see the deployment path is you know
there are these new applications coming
out like genomic applications may be
storing our financial data in the cloud
and those applications are extremely
privacy sensitive like for instance your
genomic data if the customer has a data
breach then you're just genomic data can
get me and that pretty much encodes
everything about you so and conceivably
if these applications are going to be on
you know put into the crowd you may need
a higher security than what is out there
today okay so that's one view about how
this can potentially get deployed maybe
we should think about new applications
which are just and to privacy and
sensitive for today's crowd so we can
think about what new things we can
enable and another thing is um let's say
for today's and popular services out
there may be in the webmail social
network or something if you can offer a
privacy preservative preserving version
of that and if users have the choice
like let's say you have ways to monetize
and still be profitable and despite the
additional cost and you know
cost of appreciation for the added
security suppose you can do that if
users had a choice then maybe they were
opting to the more secure version oil is
a subset of them with up opting to the
more secure version and perhaps that's a
way to drive you know existing companies
to in order not to maybe lose their
market share or something they would and
perhaps also add security features to
their existing services and and although
in spite of everything I said I think
another key question is whether if your
competition is the solution so we
definitely need more security but is
like genomic financial applications and
but there are other alternative
technology this is the point i fried up
yesterday there's like secure how where
and there are many different solutions
so which one will in the end you know be
the optimal security and cost trade-off
and that is the part that's not clear to
me also secure flowers where works in
some settings and sometimes it doesn't
work you have you know cell phone users
maybe it's harder to give a secure
hardware to ensure them so they will
compute but you know maybe in the future
you can sell a box that is somehow
everybody agrees that it's safe and then
two companies can put their data in that
box and out comes the out right so this
way through this box will replace an pc
but for for large for expensive
functions but so the hope is I think
that we should hope that many useful
functions are cheap enough that you
don't need to bother with the box so
fine you have 10,000 overhead but if the
function is small then it doesn't matter
actually today uses place a fair amount
of trust in the hammer that they compute
on like you know I use my mobile phone I
use my laptop and maybe the processor is
produced by Intel so even though I don't
have to trust the crowd I do have to
trust like the high we're on my local
computer right well it gives me the
guard key data whatever the service I
don't care as long as my client is and
and honest and you know so you will hear
the smart like smart card like thing on
the phone right so some some protected
environment that's what you're talking
about right so if you have like secure
factors that can for instance encrypt
data then I think in order to achieve
some of the goat that the Cure
computation is aiming to achieve you can
have and potentially faceted solutions
in practice if the hell we're offered
you don't it's it's about the marketing
story it's really about the markings on
your marketing story is you have your
key you have control over your key the
key stays with you and you encrypt and
send it to the cloud and you're done and
that story cells if you say well you
know the guy over there he has some put
something into his hardware and you can
trust that piece right why don't you
trust a guy in the first place right
it's a very simple marketing story it
might it might not be true in the real
case you can probably make calculations
that the adres just as secure but it's
really the marketing story that you can
say well you know there is some crypto
guy there is somebody you know he got a
touring award and he said if you if you
encrypt and send it to the cloud it's
secure and that sells and that may I do
think that that can make a difference
the question is I also wanted to make
another point about legislation actually
please do not hope the legislation is
going to help you because the delicious
later have the problem right now they
have to make the laws for governing the
cloth right now if they would make a lot
to say you have to use MPC the world
would be in huge trouble because we are
not ready in nowhere near ready right
and so this is this is a there are lots
of lots of steps to be taken right and
be careful what you wish for it is so so
maybe some smaller solutions in the
first place some startups that doing
some interesting things might be the
right way to go so actually just want to
comment this one really cool thing get a
really quick on the talk earlier today
on the share mind this is
example of how legislation helps promote
the NPC because it was forbidden for
them to see the data to computes any
statistics on the data because the
privacy office I forgot the name would
they said you couldn't do it and they
had to use highly sanitized data nearly
useless but if they use MPC that same
office said that it is okay to computer
on that data so there's a huge
difference in functionality that you see
and you know this is an example this is
not an overarching legislation that says
you must use MPC what does that mean
even write what they say is that okay
now I'll you know here is clear case you
don't see the private data so it's okay
to go and there is a lot of examples of
legislation that actually makes life
hard for implementers but presumably to
help so you know anything with medical
records is a big deal and it's not
really useful for our community because
the laws there are very you know many
thousands pages of you know what needs
to be done in before we read it forget
about it it's not it's not interesting
to think about it but you know the
concept is there that you know something
the government or you know people
consider this is private and so deal
with it and then if its stated cleanly
then our community can help fold yeah so
this actually segues into another
question which is you know which parts
of the world are more predisposed to
adopt MPC right does Europe stronger
privacy laws make it a better target for
possibly deploying or having startups
based on NPC is sort of geography
something that you should be we should
be thinking about oh sorry so they're
good news which parts of the world are
more predisposed to adopt MPC does
europe's stronger privacy laws make it a
better target for selling npc is that
something that we should be thinking
about should we be developing solutions
for the European market because we have
a better chance of the plunger to
mention one thing that fits here is a is
a very interesting example that in
netherlands i think they deployed smart
meters with maybe three years
oh and they collected everything because
they wanted to see everything and people
really didn't like it and it was a big
noise in the media and they had to roll
back entire whatever that face of
deployment so you know it was it was
very very expensive and they had to roll
it back because people are more educated
I guess in Europe about the privacy and
so that happened what is the from gets
educated they it wasn't too long ago in
Germany eastern Germany they do it they
know what happens we're on your privacy
right walking what a government can do
ok that's why I think the year oh this
wasn't government this was electric
don't if you company more aware as a
privacycookies recent is shown that when
I was I think that's what it is but now
there's history in the United States
right with you come it's actually yeah
well and people are talking about it all
the time so it may be there will be
change this turns out to be songs
escalation I think pigs you all talking
about lawyers and companies but if
there's big pressure from the people
either with this kind of privacy
violation or just for some totally new
app that will be so cool and so us and
then I'd be willing to sell myself so so
a very good example is how much you know
there's the shopping carts right that
you know they give it to you and you get
a discount here and there on your orange
juice right but like nobody thinks twice
about you know nobody no majority of
people and this shopping there's they
collect everything all about your habits
right and so this tells me that most
people really don't worry about you
already do which by definition people
are willing to do with our privacy you
know your shopping exactly that's my
point but people don't care about
private these things but there might be
something new and
like giving all your genomic data makes
23 any is there something if you get
another guy thinking about it for free
give everything yeah yeah it's very hard
to convince people to value the pictures
on the internet well facebook shows you
that that's also find something like so
I I would severely challenged the notion
that people don't care about privacy I I
mean people over an industry have been
saying that for 10 20 30 years and there
have been multiple studies that show
that that is not the case now I say that
and it kind of contradicts the obvious
which is people are still going out
there and giving away their data and and
even I which I can zoom to be myself
with privacy Z lord I give information
away and and and it's very very simple
ah eh what am I getting in return and be
what is the perceived risk based on what
I'm doing and the fact is that the
majority of people out there I'm talking
about the ninety-nine percent have no
clue about what the risks are because
even the privacy professionals even
people like me that spend a hundred
percent of our working lives thinking
about this is thought really don't know
how far this problem reaches I don't
know what companies other companies out
there are doing with my data and again I
read about this all the time I think
about this all the time I talked to
other people that ridden think about
this all the time so it's very hard for
Joe anybody out there to really have a
clue of what the risks are so I would
challenge that now your entire email
your entire phone conversations were
lost i think people are upset about it
no is it just i had also been on dos
santos because google knows it and
there's the imbalance and then the
solution would be regulation and the
regulation going to ask okay so what's
this doing and you somebody's son comes
in oil is 10,000 times slower it says
google we can't pay for this and the
discussion is done so this the power
imbalance in the consumer market is too
high in order to regulate for something
like a secure computation which yeah and
that takes us back to the original
question which is are the laws in Europe
such that they would facilitate the
introduction of MPC I don't know I I
mean I do know that the laws in Europe
have forced Microsoft to make changes
for a specific countries not for all of
Europe are with the specific products
and that is true whether those laws
would push us in the direction of
adopting MPC at any point in time I'm
skeptic however I do think that there
are other things in the European
environment that are likely to force the
adoption of NPC which is the unique
characteristics economic characteristics
of the European Union and the best
argument that I can make to support the
statement I just made is is probably a
case study is probably very well known
to you which is the the sugar beet
market in Denmark if you take a look at
that it is the very specific situation
of that market in Denmark that actually
forced the adoption of MPC the primary
considerations are not security and
privacy are the reality of the market
and the nature of the needs of the
players in the market and if we look at
it from that way i would say yes it is
much more likely that this type of
solution will be first adopted in the
european union than this in the united
states
so so you can ask why so much stuff is
not the case but because so the example
of sorry III didn't hear the example of
the shoe could be the sugar beet
marketing der mark is an example you
have a if i recall correctly example is
a state-owned monopoly that are controls
the options of should repeat now the
concern here of the people producing the
sugar beet was that this entity had so
much power of the market that it could
sway prices and that it could force some
of the farmers to get out of the
business or to sell at a cheaper rate or
whatever so the only solution that they
could come up with in which every single
party would trust the in solution was by
using an npc application that would
allow people to submit their bids
selling and buying bids and okay so you
look at that I get but the question is
why is that more common in Europe than
in the US I'm not saying that it's more
common in Europe I'm saying in general
the environment in Europe is conducive
to that type of situation why because in
the u.s. you don't have the complex
systems of production quotas in the case
of farming production quotas that are
assigned to the different countries and
in each country each the market is
managed by a different entity it's all
very complex that's I think one of the
areas were a npc could shine but but I
would assume that that like like
monopoly marketing monopoly is that
distinguish picture that you probably
have I mean I don't want to mention the
building we're sitting in here so so
there are definitely monopoly market in
the US as well they would be just as a
mean evil I'm so I'm not a US citizen
I'm not making any judgments about the
the politics or social reality in either
Europe of the u.s. I'm completely
agnostic about that I just look at the
facts what's out there and what I think
would be conducive to the eruption of
the of NBC in the US
there are horrific monopolies but that's
a completely different conversation much
time those I want to another question
which is what other research communities
have been successful at impacting the
real world and industry why were there
successful what can we learn from them
and so some examples are so things like
in the sugary systems MapReduce and
Hadoop the database community in general
I think has had quite some the database
research community has quite some impact
on an industry information retrieval
obviously research and I know there's
other kind of security related community
that I've tried to have an impact like
differential privacy has been trying to
kind of get some some adoption so can we
learn anything from most communities and
what have they done right my guess is
they have a need thing you know they
have something that people actually
physically need that is very clear and
obvious to everybody so they take what
they produce and they use it so you know
optimizing something supply chain it's
you know you can see the money and so of
course you want to pay for this then pc
don't see the money so that's its I
think it's fundamentally different from
this perspective so why did the red
Krypton
yeah well so this and why it doesn't
like the MPC in emphysema yeah because
you have to protect against the guy on
the wire right obviously because the so
the security people pay for security a
little you know they don't want to about
the kind of half right but so that
protects you against the guy on the wire
but if you're talking to your bank you
know who wants to to make sure that bank
where you cannot cheat you know your
system ventures a very safe vertical my
way widely expected to happen now in
fact I think it's you know we had more
exposure with a head before this more
interesting than before next time these
things just I completely agree with that
assessment I you have to keep in mind
that in in the case of what I would call
traditional crypto basic crypto ah they
need hassle had already been established
before even the technologies were there
I mean there was a need for banks to
communicate securely between themselves
and communications links were born and
maybe they were point-to-point and and
and they thought that I was enough at
some point that stopped being enough and
banks started to look for other measures
and that was what begun to open the door
the transition had to be moving from
specific enterprise markets like banks
to general adoption by the public and it
was the existence of the Internet of the
internet that made the need very very
explicit but you're right it took time
and and that I I know I'm I've come
across very very negative I am NOT I
truly believe that MPC will be adopted I
don't think it's going to happen
overnight I don't think it's going to
happen through legislation it might
happen I think the probabilities are low
I don't think it's going to happen
through a magic bullet app I think it's
going to happen just like the adoption
of many other technologies that
were far-reaching enough which is it's
going to happen through hard work and
dedication and and we need to look for
those opportunities and we need to
educate people and we need to create the
spaces were the opportunities and the
technology can come together and we need
to work together to work to create the
opportunities where education can happen
I think that that is what is going to
change this whenever we want to talk
about a pc and adults and via a pc we
talk about MPC we talk about individual
people believe in embassy or not but
there is some another angle to view it
maybe ma I has an individual person i'm
not that much careful about my data but
when i get my data to microsoft its it
becomes more important for microsoft to
to make it private to believe it's
private because for example yourself or
Google or other companies have huge
amount of data from individual people
and if they lose the privacy of this
huge amount of data it can be a mess and
why we never talk about this aspect or
maybe you can I know your view of
privacy in this aspect so why do we
never talk about the consequences
consequences of revealing huge amount of
data are not just individual
you have huge amounts of data in review
here in the US unsa oh it's happening
right now yes but I think you're talking
about brother even for other private
companies when you lose huge amount of
data oh you mean to data breaches oh the
consequences are huge ah again I I think
that one of the week so it's not that
companies don't worry about this some
companies do some companies don't and
some companies start worrying after they
self of the data breaches yeah now the
problem with the data breach again is
that your average person out there in
the wild as they say ah really has no
clue of what sorts of risk he/she is
exposed to why because I data breaches
are very very insidious in the chi in
the sense that a lot of stuff can be
happening to you and you don't know your
identity might be stolen and you might
add but the identity theft might be so
good that you never actually find out
about it you suffer you paid the price
but you never notice that's possible in
other cases people notice after a long
time and and in other cases the use of
the information that those nefarious
parties might be making it can be
completely obscure again you're still
paying the price but you don't know
think of us me as an individual kind of
price I'm talking about for example
Marcus I'm as it
compare the price because of the linkage
it some price at you your company must
maintain a lot the leakage of private
information the company there you have
the databases on some marketing and
stuff for people that you know but for
example as you let other company
comments oldest private information that
you have is huge nah no no there is a
significant there there is he a yearly
serving without buy it by a company
called Ponemon ah consulting i think and
and they've been doing this yearly
service I think for the last 15 or 20
years and every year the average cost of
a data breach they do a survey of the
companies that have suffered the data
breaches and and they talk to them about
what the direct costs of these bridges
are and so on and so forth and and every
year the average cost of these breaches
goes up and and the numbers are
horrendous and there have been cases of
companies that have almost disappeared
because of these breaches a spear
motivation for private companies to
apply npc at this on their own data
right there on those eyes it's it has
valued it has valuable I I think it is
the motivation yes I've actually spoken
quite a few companies recently
commissioned which is that the right to
that issue so that the figure or the
more technologically aware smarter
companies that's what they buy I spoke
to for example a small Hospital that's
also a university in medicine somewhere
in the US and I spoke to the chief
security officer and he said well we
don't even encrypt our data but I at
least have I have proof that i've told
my managers many times that we need to
be that that's like that so there was a
lot of really sensitive data out there
which isn't even being encrypted and the
recipient of you talking about and it's
incredibly diverse about whether they're
some / said to me yes if you you if you
had this available now we take it at
someone has said that you know I wish I
could get my managers to even agreed we
should encrypt other device and
so we're already at a time I'm gonna ask
one last question and I just want the
panelists bound to this question because
we're over time so I mean all the
panelists here were in industry and all
have tried to promote NPC to their
respective companies so one question is
you know what have been the biggest
objections or roadblocks that you run
into you know just out of curiosity and
yeah which ones which ones were the
biggest that they the biggest objections
on roblox are a we've had to justify the
NPC primarily on economic grounds rather
than security and privacy ah be I would
say it is very hard sometimes to put
these these technologies in a context
that is enticing enough for the business
and what I mean by that is this you can
explain what the technology does and we
in fact this and saying is a witness to
this we've been to many many internal
forums and and presented about MPC and
explain these are the scenarios in which
you could use MPC and interestingly
enough the people don't seem to get it
is only until you talk to someone whose
immediate need is very clearly present
in his mind or her mind that when we saw
a reaction there's there was one person
specifically to whom I had talked about
MPC several times and for whom MPC had
not clicked and one day in a coffee shop
it clicked and things started to move
really really fast after that so again
education keep trying and focus not only
on the security and privacy benefits
think about what are the economics and
the efficiencies that can be gained yeah
I did try to promote a secure
computation and the main objection was
costs
and talking to engineers when they so
the function there was was kind of
expensive the overhead was was hives
some location-based privacy or I forgot
exactly what it was but it was
significant it wasn't like a tiny
portion that you can you know over pay
whatever you want and you know with
engineers in a scalable industry they
count every cent and when they see that
you know the overheads that we talk
without any problem they're horrified
and it doesn't go much farther than that
so you know it it needs to be an
application that privacy is important
and the cost is small that it shouldn't
be noticeable and I wasn't even talking
about implementation cause they had no
idea that you know they have to hire
bundchen you guys to you know to
implement it was just you know what's
the length of messages you need to send
at that level already it was it was a
showstopper the costs so so I can it's
very similar to work obvious that you
have to have someone who has a clear
problem and then you have to essentially
claim i solve that problem and if you
have a good marketing story they will
not question you how you solve it can if
you say I encrypted and you keep the key
the solution is fine and but the problem
has to be it has to be a clear and
present problem and economic reasons
might not be the ones that are actually
driving it so I said in supply chain
management the economic reasons are they
are obvious right everybody knows them
and there they are they still people she
was not messing so why were they pushing
burg if you could sort of damage after
it did questions you have to convince
the customer to do something different
and you're making money with the product
right now so in your case it was just a
matter it was just it was just inertia
they just you could prove that they
would save money but they were just kind
of like well you just don't feel like
doing anything you and this business
risk you have to establish a new product
way too much risk we have a product
right now it doesn't do that it we can't
do that we know we can't do that
we can do yeah we can do a little bit of
hand waving and that that will why do I
care to solve the problem right and that
is a establishing a new product is much
much harder than then actually adding a
featured written if somebody has
somebody is making money right now and
he sees now okay for some for something
I stopped seeing stops the money stops
coming in for security reasons most
problem Lonnie stops coming in then you
have a chance and then you have to be
fast I agree for sure yeah all right so
that's it for the panel we had a bunch
more questions but we're pretty behind
so we're supposed to have break from 22
to 15 so we're just going to have a
five-minute break or I guess seven
minute break we'll be back in 2 15 for
the next session each year microsoft
