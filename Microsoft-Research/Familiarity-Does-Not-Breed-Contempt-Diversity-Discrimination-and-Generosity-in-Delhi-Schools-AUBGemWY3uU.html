take it away yeah you know Justin's from
the side of the family that has the nice
hair right so it's a great pleasure to
be here today and I'm excited excited to
talk about my work on how mixing rich
and poor kids together in schools in
India changes social behaviors I'm
particularly excited to be presenting to
a diverse audience but you know forgive
me if if there's anything at all that I
say that that isn't clear particularly
to the non economist in the room you
know stop me and in general stop me for
questions at any time I'm not going to
plan to leave 10 minutes at the end for
Q&amp;amp;A okay alright so this research is is
motivated by two broad observations the
first is that schools appear to be
segregated across income or economic
lines in many countries to different
degrees and a lot of research has
understandably examined what effects
that has on disparities and academic
achievement but we know relatively
little about how that might matter for
social behaviors think of intergroup
attitudes discrimination interactions
you know these are things that might
matter a lot in unequal diverse or
polarized countries like India or the
United States second and more broadly in
some sense even economists have now come
to understand that social preferences
concerns about fairness these things are
important in the economy and you know in
explaining human behavior but we know
relatively little about how these
preferences or our attitudes are shaped
and in particular could they be affected
by lifetime experiences and therefore
even by policy and motivated in these
two quite broad ways I'm going to answer
the much narrower question which is how
does being mixed with poor kids in yours
kohl's change the social behaviors of
RIT students and in particular how does
it change their pro-social behavior and
generosity towards others and their
fairness preferences perhaps in a deeper
sense but also does it change their
willingness to socialize with or to
discriminate against the poor and if
there are effects on these social
outcomes do they come at some cost to
the academic achievement of these rich
students yeah I'm wondering if you are
mixing mostly poor students with a few
rich students from because I the worse I
yeah Collective busing on both sides my
elementary school a few poor students
were bused in and then junior high I was
bused to a poor neighborhood and very
different absolutely I think very
different outcomes absolutely so what
I'm studying is the effect on you know
rich kids when there are majority so
there's about eighty percent of the
population and then there's about twenty
percent of poor kids brought in yeah
alright let me give you a bird's eye
view of the empirical strategy I'm going
to utilize an admissions a change in
policy in Delhi in 2007 which forced
private schools to start saving twenty
percent of their seats for poor kids
with full scholarships ah right yeah so
these are highly regulated private
schools and and this includes quite
elite private schools which is what I'm
going to focus on think think of schools
where the typical rich kids attending
are above the 95th percentile of the
income distribution yeah so there's some
correlation between these things even in
cities however this was you know this
this the admissions policy here was
strictly along income lines and so it's
not it's not quite like rural India
where those things are very highly
correlated I'm going to use two types of
variation in the mixing of rich and poor
students so you know what we call
identification strategies where one is
going to use variation across classrooms
and whether or not there are any poor
kids so that's going to be comparing
within schools across cohorts which are
or aren't affected by the policy change
and then within a given
or across schools which are affected or
not affected but a second strategy
instead is going to look within the
classroom so if you're in an integrated
classroom do you or do you not have poor
study group partners and that's going to
use the fact that some of these schools
assigned study group partners by
alphabetic order of first day right so
that's going to say what's the effect of
personally interacting with sitting next
to for an hour a day you know a poor kid
if you're a rich kid so you know the the
policy had a particular definition so
that was a whole family earning at
market exchange rates about 2,000 u.s.
dollars a year for purchasing power
parity x 3 so these are you know that
I'll show you I'll show you a bit more
about this in a little bit so these are
not necessarily the poorest of the poor
in India but they're from homes where
where the family makes one tenth of what
the rich kids make society drivers are
small merchants haces factory so not not
not not small well ok so maybe some
small merchants but more drivers factory
workers domestic help so that that's
what you want to think of for the poor
kids so they were I'll tell you a lot
about this in just a few minutes ok so
so you know that's the variation in the
mixing of rich and poor students but
what am I actually measuring what are
the outcomes so a lot of the work in
this paper went into you know measuring
these social behaviors which is not
something you easily find in existing
data sets so I conducted extensive
fieldwork to measure these outcomes for
about 2,000 students and 14 elite
private schools in Delhi and I measured
pro-social behavior and generosity first
by collecting administrative data from
these schools on student participation
in optional volunteering events at
school but I also invite these students
into the lab as it were to play dictator
games where I give them some money and
they have the chance to share it with
others and it's a way to at least in
this somewhat abstract lab setting
directly observe their generosity in an
incentivized way how do I measure
discrimination by
rich against the poor so I observe how
students choose teammates for an
incentivized sports contests and I'm
going to look at do you pick
high-ability poor kids or not you know
do you discriminate against the poor
even when they're high ability and I'm
going to also directly licit your
willingness to socialize with the poor
outside of school by inviting students
to attend playdates with poor kids and
then and then you know figuring out
whether they're willing to attend those
yeah to use charities is a way of
filling out students know so you don't
have that these are young kids I'm
actually I haven't told you yet but I'm
working with kids who are still in
elementary school I mean is there still
a kind of I don't want to say
professionalization towards college that
would suggest to them that volunteering
is something that they know so it
doesn't matter for admissions in any
college in India and then my second
question is the willingness to attend
playdates you're inviting them how do
they see you do they see you as an
administrator who is asking them to
attend something yeah so uh you know how
this thing is motivated is as an
opportunity to make new friends in your
neighborhood so the invitation is to
attend a play date hosted by a
neighborhood school that mostly serves
poor children and it's presented them by
their school teachers so so I saw I'm
there as well so so I have to get in a
permission from the parents and things
like that so so they know that this is
not this is the first time this is
happening but they're also told that
there's a pot you know possibility if
there's good you know a good demand for
this that you'll do this they'll do this
every year and the schools are kind of
supporting this you know this
opportunity to expose their students to
two people from a different social
background yeah okay and finally I also
study more classical sort of economics
or labor or education economics outcomes
effects on test scores but also report
from teachers on disciplinary
infractions by students so one concern
was that these poor kids will come into
these schools and they'll ruin
discipline so you know I'm measuring
that directly let me give you the main
result yeah
you what year was the regulation change
in 2007 and what are you performing this
2011 in 2012 yes so it's a few years so
the kids I'm going to be studying would
have been exposed rich kids who have
been you know in the same classrooms as
poor kids for four to five years kind of
choice of which schools were affected by
this and which not based off land
distribution 50 years prior but what
about selection my parents into school
said I'll talk I'll talk a lot about I
think even though he's being super super
nice about questions I think we're uh
cuz we won't get to all the good stuff
pretend it's not you David it's me I'm i
lapped you know it's a big concern you
know I I'll talk about it in the slides
and of course it's in the paper as well
yeah no no I I know so i gave a talk at
MIT yesterday and you know by now they'd
asked me about 120 questions so so this
is this is fine i'm not i'm not saying
that's a good thing i'm not saying that
was a good thing uh alright let me give
you a preview of the main results i find
that having poor classmates and
interacting with them personally by
being assigned to the same study group
both these things tend to make these
wealthy students could unquote nicer
they become more pro-social and generous
that is they volunteer more for
charities at school they give more in
these dictator games and intriguingly
they become more generous towards poor
kids but also towards other rich kids so
it's not just that they become more
charitable towards the poor and that
appears to be partly driven by the fact
that they're choosing more equitable or
sort of equal distributions of monetary
payoffs in this economic lab okay they
also discriminate less against the poor
and become a more willing to socialize
with them so they choose poor teammates
more often for a sports contests and
they become more willing to attend
playdates with poor children and i find
that that these changes these striking
changes and social behaviors commit
overall mild effects you know mile
negative effects on learning and
discipline you know you might argue
about whether it's a zero or a slight
negative effect let me let me skip the
related literature except to say that
there are people in this room that I've
worked on it which makes it particularly
exciting for me to be here I so just a
few things about the empirical setting
this project is set in Delhi so you know
Delhi is in India country with high and
rising inequality delhi delhi within
india has three million school-aged
children who attend three types of
schools i'm going to focus on the job
you know in this job market paper on
elite private schools there are about
200 of them where you know less than
three percent sorry a lot of more
inequality so so one would be you know
the most unequal you could possibly get
yeah you know these numbers are kind of
disputed so I wouldn't believe too much
the comparisons between countries but
okay so you know less than less than
five percent maybe three percent of the
population sends its kids to these elite
private schools and so the kids here are
going to be you know the future titans
of industry the top bureaucrats of India
politicians and and so I'm going to be
studying how the social preferences and
behaviors of really Elite elite kids who
you know you'd expect are going to sort
of in the future be manning the levers
of power and Indian society how they are
affected by being exposed to poor
children and you might expect that
they're you know I'm going to be
studying that it could be that if I was
studying less elite rich kids things
might be different which I think would
be an interesting thing to explore so
let's say a little bit about these elite
private schools they're expensive so the
annual tuition there is essentially
unaffordable for for the median
household in Delhi the schools are very
selective they accept typically it or
two to eight percent of applicants but
they have strictly regulated admissions
criteria so they have to be very
explicit about how they rank candidates
and they have a point system for the
neighborhoods you live in crucially a
lot of points for having older siblings
in the same school so essentially if you
have an older sibling in this schooling
and you're now three between three and
four years old and trying to start
preschool you're guaranteed admission
you're almost guaranteed admission to
the school year older sibling attends
that had that's true both before and
after the policy change and will help me
deal yes oh I don't know I mean I don't
know if it's a regulation that they
dislike I think they're perfectly happy
with it but it is it is something you
know the government of Delhi actually
has a lot each time the schools change
their admissions criteria they need to
get permission from the government so
these are highly regulated private
schools yeah so the fact that you know
there are these young yeah no they're
all highly regulated but you would
imagine there's more attention paid to
regulating these schools just because
they sort of loom larger in the public
consciousness so the fact that that you
know younger siblings receive a lot of
preference is actually going to help me
deal with some of the selection concerns
essentially before and after the policy
change if you can identify who the
younger siblings work we're now applying
to schools are there going to be they're
going to be the same kid you know
something yeah ok so the policy change
happened in 2007 and it said twenty
percent of new admissions need to be
poor kids the schools which were subject
to it where schools which had received
land from the government at subsidized
rates on average about 40 years ago in
my sample and that's only 90 well I mean
that's ninety percent of elite private
schools but they remain another ten
percent at which weren't which hadn't
received land from the government that
subsidize which I'll talk more about
them they're very helpful for me as a
control group okay the policy required a
question that no fees be charged to
these poor children although the
government chipped in with a partial
subsidy to the private schools that that
subsidy was a lot less than what the
schools would normally charge a fee
paying student the policy also required
that these poor kids be integrated into
the same classrooms as the rich kids and
that's important all right so you can't
admit them but then stick them in a
separate classroom here's a sense of how
radical this policy is what I've plotted
here is the is the CDF of you know of
the household income distribution in
Delhi so the rich kids in my sample you
know from survey evidence that i'm
collecting now are all from well above
the 95th percentile of the income
distribution in the US the 95th
percentile is around two hundred
thousand dollars a year okay the
eligibility cutoff for the poor kids was
a hundred thousand rupees a year which
is around the 40
5th percentile in the US that's around
40k and the average poor kid who's in my
sample who benefits from the policy
changes from the 25th percentile in the
US that's around 23,000 dollars right so
so you're you're integrating kids from
really very different parts of society
twenty-three thousand dollars my
roommates a hotel yeah yeah yeah yeah I
think so right so in India and here in
the US it's about a 10 tenfold
difference in in in household income the
percentiles salary in the US or is this
25th percentile in the u.s. is 23 that's
exactly so this is the so this is not
come market exchange rates or purchasing
power parity from the rupee's this is a
you know you can exactly exactly yeah
okay alright so in 2013 actually 20 now
is going to be 2014 this policy is being
extended to every private school in
India and is in fact is going to be
unconditional on having received any
subsidy so it's a new federal law that
every private school starting this year
or they have a few years maybe to figure
out how they're going to do it have to
save twenty five percent of their seats
for poor kids and not charge them any
money okay so yeah so the so in Delhi
that's what it was and that's why that's
what my second paper sort of uses but
but but but different states in India
will have the right to determine
selection processes you know
independently as they decide how to roll
out the policy change okay so India has
400 million children under the age of 15
actually just two days ago this number
changed at thirty-five percent so
thirty-five percent of Indian kids now
attend private schools you know the
thirty percent number was from three
years ago so you can judge how how fast
the sort of rate of increases so so it's
so you know 100 million kids are already
in private schools in India and that
number is growing okay so this could
potentially lead to pretty large scale
changes in social behaviors all right
let me talk now about identification
normally I spend a large part of the
talk on this I'll try to I'll try to
spend a little less because honestly i
think the graphs and pictures i'll show
you at the end will convince you of a
lot of the results but but please do
stop me if something is less than clear
so i'm trying to identify the causal
effect of having poor classmates I and
therefore I need exogenous variation in
having poor class and I'm going to use
two strategies the first as I mentioned
is this variation across classrooms and
the other is going to be variation in
your exposure to our interactions with a
poor kid within the classroom let me
give you a ha you know one half of the
ye of the first part the variation
across classrooms what I've plotted here
on the y-axis is the number of poor
students in these private schools on the
x axis is the grade they're in when I
visit them first in 2011 what do you
find this sort of sharp drop so in
fourth grade and above it's basically
all rich kids in third grade and below
there are a bunch of poor kids so I do
have siblings so I don't always have
Paris but let me so why do we why do we
have this first well it's because the
policy started in 2007 it's an
admissions quota so only four new
admissions which add these elite schools
all happen pretty much at the preschool
level so so these kids are pure in the
war in third grade when I visit them
joined preschool in in 2007 yeah Adams
can you say that a little louder some
what's the transmission mechanism so I
mean you're talking about identification
but what are you identifying great is
not sorry uh so so I'm not sure exactly
how to interpret that question when
people say what's the mechanism they
mean many different things you said also
what the outcomes are so of course I'll
talk about the outcomes in great detail
soon what I'm going to show you is that
the fact that that personal interactions
between rich and poor kids which I'm
which I'm getting by having exogenously
to peer groups is a an important driver
of the overall result that i'm going to
estimate so that seems to be in
ortant in terms of the underlying
psychological mechanism of what's really
changing for these rich kids and why
their social behaviors seem to be
different let me circle back to that
towards the end of the talk I think
there are a couple of different things
going on and to be honest I'm not going
to shed a great deal of light on it I'm
mostly going to be saying changes and
behavior and then i'll do some
speculation at the end about what the
psychological mechanism could be that i
think is most plausible with the overall
pattern of results is that is that it
was that was was that was one of those
the questions you were asking yes okay
yeah but please please please come back
to it later yeah okay so so you can
imagine already that one of the things
I'm going to be doing is comparing rich
kids who are in grid 2 and 3 and
therefore have a bunch of poor
classmates with rich kids in grades 4
and 5 who don't have poor classmates but
that's not all I also as one of you
already brought up have variation across
schools and this is not randomized
variation it wasn't an experiment ah but
there are three types of elite private
schools the first is what i'm calling
treatment schools you know this is about
ninety percent of you know this is
basically most of by far almost all of
these elite private schools they were
subject to the policy change in 2007 and
they complied immediately but then there
are these delayed treatment schools
these are schools that were told by the
government you're subject to the policy
change but they didn't they chose not to
comply on the first year either because
their admissions process was already too
advanced or because they hope that the
the policy would be overturned in the
courts but the court then you know
upheld the policy and the following year
they were forced to comply so I'm not
going to say these two types of schools
are the same on average but what's going
to happen in these schools in the delay
treatment schools is that jump that I
showed you is going to be shifted over
by one year right and then finally there
are control schools which were just not
subject to the deli policy at all until
this nationwide rollout now that's
because they had not received land at
subsidized rates from the state
government instead they had received it
from the federal government or from
private charitable foundations both of
which owned a fair amount of land in
Delhi so in these schools it's going to
be rich kids all the way through right
in grades two through five yeah
no so you don't find one one thing
that's important is the integration is
only happening in the new admitted
cohort so if you were already in one of
these fancy schools you're never going
to have poor kids brought into your
classrooms they'll only join the next
cohort and essentially the way these
schools work is it's so hard to get
admitted to any of these schools at a
grade other than preschool because you
know essentially no one's dropping out
and there are no vacancies created that
it's basically almost impossible to
transfer between schools you know where
parents not as much as you would think
but you know partially the thing is the
parents have no choice like it's very
hard to where would you send your kid if
more than ninety percent of these
schools are subject to the policy change
okay so you know what's the sample for
this sort of strategy it's 14 schools
within that nine of them are treatment
schools and have kind of oversampled
these delayed treatment and control
schools or to delay treatment schools
three controlled schools and within them
I'm going to get students from grades
two through five why those grades well
those are the grades that kind of span
that jump right in the in the presence
of poor kids and about two thousand
randomly selected students there yeah
therefore much more students in the
treatment schools or to correct for them
so that you have the same number of
students who are treated enough so I do
need to correct for that in some sense i
definitely have much more students in
the treatment schools you know and
that's you know that may not be
necessarily optimal in terms of power
but yeah we can we can maybe talk to
talk more about what that would mean for
statistical power ok so i'll i mean i'll
spare you I think the regression except
I just say that I'm going to control for
school fixed effects so the average
levels of these outcomes in the
different schools grade or cohort fixed
effects so the average level outcome in
grade 2 and grade 3 and grade 4 across
different schools but you might think
age might matter for these things and
then I'm just going to say is 0-1
variation in was your cohort in your
school subject to the policy and
therefore do you have a bunch of you
know do you have twenty percent poor
classrooms okay so some issues already
came up with
selection so you might think that
there's this policy change where you
know that ten percent of schools are not
subject to it in the first year so if
you are for example a poor parent a rich
parent who really doesn't want his kids
sitting next to a poor kid you might try
extra hard to get into one of those
control schools as it turns out I find
no increase in applications or
acceptance rates at the control schools
relative to the treatment schools ah but
I also have this ability to find a
smaller sample of kids who are going to
be less selected these are these younger
siblings who both before and after the
policy change we're going to be admitted
to this lead private school yeah they
were aware very little so when the
policy was first implemented it was just
you know it was done a month and a half
or it was announced like a couple months
before admissions season so it was just
it was very it was very rapid
implementation and I think people just
didn't know all that much about it I
think that's why you don't see more
applications to the control schools so
we shouldn't see too much surprised that
there isn't a lot of low back from this
because it sounds like parents may may
have been too late to have ya done
anything yeah it look like changes an
application at er yeah you may also
worry there's another issue with
selection year which is just
mechanically these fancy schools have to
become more selective with rich kids
twenty percent of their seats are now
going to poor kids so maybe they're
selecting better rich kids now right
they're only getting tall choosing the
top eighty percent of what they were
choosing before you know again I can use
this this subsample of the siblings
which we think might be less selected at
least on their baseline ability but note
that these kids are between three and
four years of age the schools are not
allowed to test them or interview them
right there are no pre-existing test
score measures so it's probably quite
hard for them to do a good job selecting
on ability although they are selecting
on you know parent demographics for kids
how should have match the neighborhoods
in which they grow up I mean I've been
to India so I know a little bit about
but I have no idea who earns how much
and what sort of so what should have a
lot of the poor kids in my sample how
many children sleep in one bed for
movement
is sort of no great great yeah the house
is there sort of so what is sort of
psycho so a lot of the poor kids in this
sample come from you know these things
which are actually officially classified
as as slums so that means you know
they're they're almost all none of these
are not sort of street kids living on
the street they're not even kids living
in some sort of completely temporary
structure so they're living in homes you
know built with bricks and concrete they
often don't have a water connection in
their home but may have like a shared
you know share tap that multiple homes
will will will use for water supply so
these are pretty poor people but they're
not the poorest of the poor even with in
Delhi so you can imagine that might have
fun toilet but they have a bucket which
they used to take a shower and it's
exactly exactly and you know there's
variation so some of the some of the
pork which is some of the poor poor kids
who qualify are from you know are better
off than that and their father will own
a motorcycle or you know something like
that okay so you know some of these
things came up there aren't many
transfers or there isn't much drop out
class sizes change a little bit but not
that much there's unlikely to be a lot
of spill overs between different cohort
between different grades within the
classroom because in Delhi you spend all
your time in your classroom you don't
kind of move across school the way you
do in the US you know between different
classrooms you don't have a common
dining area so you know if you grant me
the strategy this identification
strategy it's going to capture the
effect of having you know a bunch of
poor classmates but it's not really
telling you anything about the
mechanisms of why you might see a change
it could be because of your personal
interactions with poor kids it could be
because teachers do something different
now and maybe curriculum changes
therefore i have this second strategy
which instead exploits the exhaustion
asst assignment of students to study
groups within the classroom which
happens by alphabetic order of first
name okay uh what is that you know it
sort of particularly helpful to me that
some schools use this policy and other
schools instead frequently reshuffle
these study groups and these are study
groups in which you spend on average an
hour a day you know working on a craft
project
together working on reading
comprehension or math problems and some
schools you know assign assign them
alphabetically and some just makes you
so they aren't and they needn't quite be
because what I'm using in my strategy is
if your name is John it really matters
if the if there's a poor kid called
Joseph or you know and if there's
someone called Josh in between the two
of you I may have gotten the ordering
wrong but but I've got to use variation
is the poor kids name right above yours
or a little bit further away right and
because I have the schools which don't
use alphabetic assignment there I can
look the Cedars having a name right next
to a rich or poor kid in an
alphabetically sorted list does that
predict the outcomes and as it turns out
that it does it okay but you know yours
here's a graph to kind of tell you you
know show you the first stage of the IV
regression here but I'm plotting on the
y-axis is the share of rich kids who
have at least one poor study partner and
on the left are the schools which don't
use alphabetic order they shuffle the
group's regularly and so you know the
the dark bar is is for rich kids whose
you know whose name right above and
right below there are other rich Kidz
only and the light bar is is a click
above them or below them or both there's
a poor kid and in the schools which
don't use alphabetic order sure enough
that doesn't predict whether you have
poor study partners but in the schools
that do there's a big effect right so so
in the light bar that means there's a
poor kid with the name right above or
right below yours and that means you're
very very likely to have at least one
poor study pot so so it's important it's
important that they use first name which
is not about cost its last name and
that's the reason so in my college and
Indian many schools in India first name
is used to sort of short students
because that's not about cost yeah yeah
and the fact that even so having a name
that tends to be right next to a rich or
poor kid might predict something about
you maybe it means you're more like a
poor kid in some way or you know more
like them that's something that I'll be
able to pick up in these schools right
ok so I'll spare you the regression and
and move to talking I think you know I
still have half an hour to go so so I'm
happy to stop now to take any questions
that you might have or I can start
talking to you about
the outcome measures okay alright so the
first thing i tried you know i'm
studying is is generosity and pro-social
behavior and and let me tell you but
about about how I measure this using
dictator games so if you're not familiar
with dictator games what you're doing in
these things is you give these kids you
know you give the person playing the
game some money and you give them the
option of sharing some of that with a
recipient okay so I'm giving the kids 10
rupees which they can exchange for candy
later if they if they so please have 10
pieces of candy and I'm having them play
this game twice where the order of the
games is randomized and they're
separated by a bunch of other tasks the
difference is in one game they're
playing with a poor kid and this is not
the poor kid integrated into their
classrooms right there wouldn't be a
fair comparison there for the control
group instead it's a poor kid at another
school someone they don't personally
know and may never you know will will
will likely never meet all their told is
there told the name of the school shown
photographs of the school the school
yard having kids playing there and
essentially you know the variation and
the types of schools and facilities is
so enormous then when you see this and
in debriefing these kids get that
they're playing with a poor kid they're
playing with someone not quite like them
in the other game they're playing with a
rich kid they don't know so this is a
rich kid at another school that's like
there's right and they're in the
debriefing there get that they're
playing with someone that's a lot more
like ah let me show you the result so
they're they're in there they're in a in
a room in their school so a separate
experimental session they're not
face-to-face with those kids or anything
they're just told who the recipie know
the recipient will be from this school
so they're also not making the decisions
face to face with me or any research
assistant they're indicating the
decisions they prefer on a decision
sheet which then gets kind of folded
stuffed in an envelope their name isn't
on it only a serial number kind of goes
somewhere else and then comes back to
them so we do what we can to preserve
anonymity here and you're saying they're
doing this as individuals walking in a
room or
they co present with other young people
know they're they're making individual
decisions passing any students when they
leave this room no well no well I mean
yes yes so they are so but but but the
money the payoffs that's given to them
is in a sealed envelope which they if
they wish can could you know open it and
buy candy but they don't have to is
there a way that they might be seeing
them encountering them in the setting
where yes so they are seeing other
participants but then they can't see
what the other participants are choosing
yeah so just friends our singer other
rich kid from their school yeah your
aunt poor kid from their school jealous
what the game was sure let me tell you
very quickly again so essentially you
give these kids 10 rupees and you give
them a chance to decide how much of that
they'd like to share with the recipient
who's either a poor kid they don't know
or a rich kid they don't and is that
don't share that keeps the money they
keep all the money yeah yeah and it's
not like the dollar splitting or
something where the other person has to
accept no no so this is there's no
strategic behavior here you you get to
decide you're the dictator okay let me
show you let me start it kind of pieced
together the result using the variation
at the classroom level for how much you
give to a poor kid you don't know what
I'm plotting on the y-axis is the
percent of your endowment of these no 10
rupees that you shared with a poor kid
on the x axis is the grade you're in and
the solid green line i'm showing you now
is for the is for rich kids and control
schools right so these are the schools
where it's all rich kids throughout that
they have no poor classmates you see
maybe some evidence of a trend over age
or time but you know nothing nothing
super strike let me add in now the
treatment schools so what's going on
here they look a lot like the control
schools in some grades and quite
different than them in others when it
actually lines up with the experiment
because it's precisely in grades two and
three that the treatment school kids are
actually treated by having poor
classmates whereas in grade four and
five this is before they joined before
the policy change they don't have any
poor class weds yes in all cases of
course i'm only going to show you the
outcomes for you know that the choice is
made by rich kids yeah so it's only in
the treated
that the treatment school kids are
actually being more generous to the poor
and finally let me add in the delay
treatment schools right this kind of
lines up perfectly to because in grid
grid 3 the delay treatment schools are
not treated right because they respond
to your lid so this is suggesting that
having poor classmates makes you more
generous towards the poor in this
dictator game setting yeah so poor
classmates give less than rich class
mates in some sense you might think the
stakes loom much larger for them so 10
rupees is more money to them than it is
to to a rich kid so yeah so one thing
that's not going on here in any of the
results is that you have these poor kids
brought into your classroom and they are
more generous or they care more about
inequality themselves or they
discriminate less against you know so
it's not that that's you know it's not
just that there are kids brought into
your classroom or different than you and
you adopt their habits or their
behaviors that doesn't seem to be what's
going on it's I don't the poor kids are
not more generous than the rich kids
right okay so you know they give about
the same on average to the rich they
give maybe a little bit less and and i'm
going to show you sort of the you know
the effexor so you'll see that in just a
sec okay yeah they're giving about
twenty five percent of the endowment on
average to poor kids okay so one
question is is this effect driven by
personal interaction so is the mechanism
you know spending time with the poor kid
as opposed to your teacher telling you
here you should be more generous you
know now that there are poor kids in the
classroom so here's the yours yours
yours the you know what your recognizes
the reduced form of the IV regression so
what do you find well in the schools
which don't use alphabetic order having
a name right next to a poor kid doesn't
seem to matter for how generous you are
to the poor but in the schools which do
use it you're more generous if you have
a name that's right next to a poor kid
okay and when you do the IV regression
of course that's going to kind of blow
up these estimates because you know this
is just having a name next to a poor kid
i'm going to use
do you actually have a study partner
who's poor okay let me Oh let us know
okay let me show you these results in a
regression I'll probably only do that
for this you know for this set of
results and then you know you can you
can you can look at the other results
you know in the paper so the first
column here is is the sort of difference
in difference the variation at the
classroom level thing I showed you where
what you know this is for this full
sample of rich kids it says that being
in a treated classroom that is having
poor classmates makes you give 12
percentage points more right to a poor
kid that's on a base of about twenty
seven percentage points giving so it's a
large effect about point four or five
standard deviation increase in your
generosity to the poor you know the
second column is using this restricted
subsample of the younger siblings right
that we think might be less selected and
we get a very similar point estimate
there right we suggest that selection is
not a big part of the story at least on
average and here's the here's the effect
the IV effect of having a poor study
partner here I find that having a poor
study partner makes you give seven
percentage points more on average okay
an instrumented for using this
alphabetic order right so so that's the
result on your generosity towards the
poor yeah because you might see them
it's
yes I guess I could separate that out
I've been thinking of it Morris oh that
that could be spill overs across grades
which would bias my results towards zero
right and so I'm under estimating
effects my sense is that you basically
you may see them but you spend no time
with anyone not from your grid even
within your grade you spend all your
time in your assigned classroom in you
know so there's just not much into it's
not like us schools where you it is from
what I can tell from the movies you kind
of go from English English class the
history class and then you have a common
lunch area where you know a lot of
social dynamics play out instead you
spend all day in your classroom of 35 to
40 kids usually you even eat lunch with
them just stay there yeah you sit in
your seat and you stay there hi so okay
how about your generosity to uh to to
other rich kids okay no I have plenty of
time ready Oh excellent ah so this is
something I didn't have a strong prior
on right you could imagine I mean when I
was designing the thing I thought well
maybe once your integrated with poor
kids you know you're this is forced
integration you will get really
polarized and you'll start to dislike
the poor more and you'll start to like
you know affiliate more with other rich
kids or what could go in the opposite
direction I wasn't sure as it turns out
i find that you become more generous to
other rich kids as well so it's a
slightly smaller effect ah but having
poor classmates makes you give more to a
rich kid you don't know which i think is
quite puzzling and i'll say a little bit
more about what i think is going on in a
minute you see that in this in this
study group thing to having a poor study
partner or having a name right next to a
poor kid makes you give more to other
rich kids so what might be going on well
you get a hint by looking at the
distributions of giving so you know you
could give zero ten percent twenty
percent etc of your endowment up top
I've plotted the distribution of givings
for rich kids who have poor classmates
there in treated classrooms and below
rich kids who don't have poor classmates
I'll make your life a little easier by
differencing these out what you see is 0
as I should I should clarify also this
is how generous you are to a rich kid
you don't know okay so this is the
puzzling one right why are you more
generous to rich people well you're
choosing much more the equal split of
the PI right which suggested to me that
what might be going on is being exposed
to poor kids in this very intense way in
your school's just makes you think
differently or feel differently about
inequality or or what's what's a fair
outcome and of course this is with not
with earned money right so this is money
that they've just been given so it's not
clear that you know so things might be
different if these kids were having to
work to earn their money and then maybe
they wouldn't split the pile equally
yeah so overall the increase in giving
is not different uh across male and
female students so yes so I think this
even this is good so basically because
so much of the action is here that must
mean that the increase in 5050 is also
not there yeah okay in fact I remember
the result no it's it seems to be
equally driven by male and female
students there yeah women were much more
towards the towards the center and the
men were much more extreme in either
giving nothing or a long so I room I
don't remember I don't think I see much
of that in the sample I don't remember
exactly the baseline comparison of men
and of boys and girls but in terms of
the increase in generosity and the
increase in choosing 5050 that's not DIF
different across bicycles how they were
college students here no college trips
right different from Cape you were going
to be the twenty percent maybe getting
it because there's twenty percent rich
not poor kids in the schools that
they're giving to so not definitely
giving it to rich kids or side well oh
yes yes so exactly so even though in
fact they are only giving it to rich
kids because they're playing with a rich
kid in a control school they may not
know that they may think oh there's a
twenty percent chance that the person
I'm giving to is is a poor kid but the
effects on the giving to the rich kids
are not twenty percent of the effects on
the giving to the poor kids
and moreover in the debriefing at least
you know there's you know it is the
direction is right they think this is a
kid like that something about how honest
i thought this experiment was this was
very unique to them today really think
this was going to happen so i think they
did think it was going to happen so one
of the benefits and this was intentional
for me of choosing to do this project is
working with kids who this is maybe
self-serving but i really did do a lot
of pilot work to try to kind of
determine this is in some ways they're
kind of in a sweet spot they're there
they're sophisticated enough that they
can make social judgments and figure out
who's rich and who's poor very quickly
they're also honest enough that they'll
tell me things like oh god you know that
that kid is poor and he's smelly you
know so oh sorry I didn't say yes so the
kids in my sample when I first visited
were between the ages of 7 and 13 so
these are quite young children and as
Christian said they're prepubescent
which means even in terms of society
never mind in terms of biology you don't
see as much of a differentiation of men
and women as you would have these
college age kids yeah yeah probably true
yes absolutely yes oh no this is for
real so it goes to cancel keep the money
i would be tempted maybe if these were
very large stakes experiments but you
know you know i can always buy candy for
myself yeah so one for the yes 14 so
they were practice rounds up front just
to kind of make them understand how the
decision she twerked so that happened a
couple of times until people seem to be
clear about what would happen you know
but then but then this is just playing
it once you know there's no feedback of
course right so this is not something
where you make a choice and then someone
else makes a decision and then you learn
the outcome yeah yeah you know having
interacted with
yeah so I could try to do that so I
haven't done that you know essentially
it's you've been exposed for either four
years or three years or maybe it's five
and four I forget so I could I could
look to see if there's a difference
there I don't know if I may not be able
to separate that out from some cohort
effect as well right so I have to impose
some additional assumptions there yeah
so I I don't know the answer it could be
that you don't need all these years of
exposure it could be that even you know
a month of exposure is enough to change
things and I wouldn't know so I think
it's going to be I think it's going to
be three years yeah or maybe for three
years yeah yeah all right so you know
there are some more things I can do to
dig deeper at this you know inequality
aversion I find suggestive evidence you
know well I'm actually not so seriously
I think quite strong evidence that you
can see more off in the paper that you
know when I make you choose between
things like if you're the first person
do you choose five five or six one so
will you give up one rupee to help the
other person out by four and come out
equal or even will you when you when you
when i asked you to decide how to other
people should split the pie should it be
44 or 83 should it be 44 or 12 0 right
so so more equal outcomes versus
outcomes where the sum of payoffs is
bigger right I find systematically that
these kids become more likely to pick
the more equal outcome okay which sort
of which sort of you know it's
consistent with the increase in this
5050 giving in the lab so let me let me
say also that you know there are reasons
to be careful and skeptical about about
some of these things playing dictator
games with children they've not done
this before maybe there are strong
experimenter demand effects so one thing
I also have is pro-social behavior in a
very natural field setting which is
students have a choice a couple times a
year to choose to volunteer for a
charity which aids destitute children
elsewhere and this is a choice today you
know they have some experience making
right I'm not I collect data from the
schools and
participation in these events and I find
that they become more likely to
volunteer if they have poor classmates
in school or if they've had poor study
partners okay now let's talk about
discrimination and social interactions
how do I measure rich kids
discriminating against poor kids you
know it's something that's that's hard
to observe but there are you know
experiments studying discrimination so
inspired by some of those I design a
sports contest where I'm inviting
students from two elite private schools
so a much smaller sample then before not
not the 14 schools with 2,000 students
but instead just two schools with about
three hundred and forty students one of
the schools is a treatment school the
other is a control school right they're
both elite schools and I invite atletic
poor students from a public school to
join the join the event as well okay
this whole thing is held on the
sidelines of a sport office of an annual
sports meet where you know that the
subjects are essentially you know so
essentially the skinny geeks like me who
weren't sort of competing you know for
it for their school would still be
dragged to kind of go and stand there on
the sidelines during your schools and
here they were given a chance to
participate in some sports activities
themselves and the key decision they
must speak is is choosing a teammate to
run a relay race with okay and I'm going
to create a trade-off right I've invited
these athletic poor kids so I'm going to
create a trade-off between picking
someone who's high ability versus
picking someone who's socially from a
similar group to you and I'm going to
require that these kids spend some time
with their teammates right not just in
the race they need to spend more time
hanging out with the team that's sort of
capturing the kinds of labor market
settings where when you hire a colleague
or an employee you need to spend some
time with them as well right oh there
are other jobs where that's not true and
you might see discrimination even there
ok what's the design of the experiment
well the first stage is randomization
where students are randomized to
different sessions where the stakes for
winning the relay race are varied it's
either 50 200 or 500 rupees 500 rupees
is ten dollars at market exchange rates
it's approximately one month worth of
allowance for these kids so the stakes
for them are quite
substantial right this is going to
provide me variation and how costly it
is for you to discriminate yes for the
rich kids yeah so it this is much more
for the poor kids yes yes and there's a
stage where the kids have to interact
across their their school lines of with
kids from other schools just so that
they can place which is the school for
poor kids and which is the school for
rich kids because kids are all wearing
uniforms it's really easy to kind of
identify with school anyone belongs to
okay this this is instead of the crucial
stage stage to wear wear you wear
ability is revealed and then you make
your choices how did that happen well
you're watching a two-person race it's
typically you know a rich kid in a poor
kid competing against each other just in
a sprint it's not a relay race you see
how fast they are right and then you
choose which one of them you'd like to
have as your teammate okay i'm going to
call it discrimination if you pick the
slower runner so you could discriminate
against a fast poor kid you could also
discriminate against a fast rich kid as
it turns out i find that no one
discriminates against a fast rich kid he
or she always gets paid okay what are
the results oh crap sorry that's more so
you know then your choices are actually
you know you're randomly picked in order
and your choices are implemented the
race is the relay race is held you get
the prizes as promised and then there's
this important fourth stage where you
have to spend time this is strictly
enforced you have to spend time oh yeah
sorry so what I mean there is if you end
up in a team with with person X that
doesn't necessarily mean you chose
person acts it could be that someone
else chose the person you want it they
were randomly picked to have their
choice implemented before you and so you
end up with someone that you you know
you wouldn't have chosen so this is a
little bit helpful because you might
think look kids really don't want to
reveal that they're they're
discriminating so you know at the same
time I don't want to make too much of
this if you're Beijing and you see you
know a ending up with me you should
update upwards that a chose B or
depending on your prior but okay all
right so you know there's this important
social interaction stage where you had
to spend time one
one with your chosen timid yeah yeah I
think so no so I guess what I'm going to
guess guess here is you know your
believe you you believe that this school
is rich kids and poor kids so as it no
as it turns out it's true one of my
school's if one of my fancy schools is a
treatment school so in two of the four
grades that are in the experiment twenty
percent of the kids are poor but I don't
think that's you know my guess is that's
not something that control school kids
are are guessing i choose you then we
win the race no sorry five hundred
rupees each yeah okay so importantly
this social interaction stage was
pre-announced you knew that you were
making a choice not just for a race but
to hang out with this person later too
if I had bought power and in fact when I
go back to the field I'm going to be
interested in switching off this thing
so randomly randomizing whether or not
you need to also hang out with your
teammate because you could imagine and
there is evidence that people
discriminate even when there isn't any
need to spend time with you right so
that would be interesting to turn off
but I don't have that yeah here here are
the results what I'm plotting on the
y-axis is the share of RIT students
discriminating against the port remember
you can only discriminate against a poor
kid if he was faster in the first place
okay on the x-axis is the prize for
winning the race right that the randomly
assigned stakes for there is the solid
green line is for rich kids who are in
control classrooms that is they've never
had a poor classmate and the dashed red
line is for rich kids who do have poor
classmates okay what do I find well when
the stakes are really high a whole
month's worth of allowance there's very
little discrimination against fast poor
kids they get bit write it as the stakes
go down that you see discrimination a
lot of discrimination against the poor
but less so if you've been exposed to
them growing up right and I'm calling
this sort of a quasi demand curve for
discrimination because I have variation
in something that's like though like
that like the price forgive me yes I
have any colonists
I mean careful to say quasi because it's
not exactly a price here you need to
know the probability to perceive
probabilities are winning the races with
different partners okay you can see
something it's much noisier because of
the smaller sample but something's
sounds like a great title okay and the
x-axis is again the grade you're in on
the y-axis is your probability of
discriminating and it's noisier but you
sort of see that in the treatment school
you discriminate less only in the
treated grids right you can see this in
a regression the only thing I'll point
out here is is you discriminate 12
percentage points less if you have poor
classmates and that's about equal to the
effect of increasing the stakes from 50
to 200 rupees or three dollar increase
in sticks right so I can kind of do a
comparison of how big you know Oh
discrimination went down by half and a
totally made up experiment what does
that mean you know I can say well that's
equal to this change in the price right
and I can I can instruct early estimate
a really simple model to go from the
quasi demand to the true demand but i'll
spare you the details on that the final
thing that I want to talk to you about
is is is measuring social interaction so
when I have these results on reductions
in discrimination a key thing that I
suspect is going on is that you're more
willing to hang out with or more happy
to socialize with a poor kid and that's
why you know that crucial fourth stage
where you have to spend time with your
teammate that that's you know my guess
is that that's what's driving the
reduction in discrimination against the
poor but I also test taste for social
interaction directly by inviting kids to
attend these play dates okay there's
some weird things about this experiment
which which I'm happy to talk about you
know afterwards but it's motivated to
these kids as an opportunity to make new
friends in your neighborhood again
you're told about the school you're
shown pictures of those schools you get
that these are poor kids and I'm going
to elicit your sort of willingness to
play which the economist of the room
might find funny by by using an
incentive compatible mechanism to
perfect perfect you know I'm is actually
going to figure out how much do i need
to bribe you to go on this
okay and what I find is at each on the
x-axis is the incentive for attending
the plated on the y-axis is a share of
rich kids who agree to do it but i find
this for each of these price levels
you're more willing to accept the
invitation to go on the planet if you've
had poor classmates okay ah let me say a
little bit about you know about the test
car stuff you know I've shown you things
that I'm going to claim our sort of
positive effects on social behaviors
perhaps references does this come at the
cost of academic outcomes we care about
that a lot for Public Policy turns out
you know not so much no overall effect
on test scores but some evidence of a
negative effect on English language
learning so you know I don't want to
spin the results mild effects on
discipline I find a big increase in in
your likelihood of being cited for
swearing so using inappropriate language
in the school if you have poor
classmates and particularly study
partners ah you know which you might
think is a bad thing or you might think
you know these kids are learning
something but no effects aren't kind of
more violent or disruptive behavior so
let me let me summarize a bit and then
and then talk a little bit maybe about
some of the questions on mechanisms etc
I've shown you that having poor
classmates you know makes wealthy
students more pro-social and generous
less likely to discriminate against the
poor more willing to socialize and comes
with sort of some negative but overall
arguably sort of mild or zero effects on
on on academic outcomes circling back to
the motivations I began with that
segregation affects social behaviors I
think emphatically my answer is yes and
so the fact that it's hard to measure
these social behaviors don't mean that
they don't exist and they're not
important it's not clear how to compare
them with an effect on test scores what
shapes social preferences social
behaviors well one answer from my paper
is that peers at school seem to matter
and perhaps more generally exposure to
diversity matters personal interactions
seem to be a big part of the story
because I have these two different
identification strategy that can look to
see how big is the effect of having a
poor study partner I can scale that by
the number of poor study partners people
have the number of people who have poor
study partners I can say that it seems
explain a lot of the overall effect at
the classroom level and I can't or I
don't want to over-interpret this it's
likely an underestimate of the
importance of interactions because
surely you're interacting with poor kids
even when they're not in your study
group okay yeah ah renters are going to
say ok yes yes so i don't know i'll get
