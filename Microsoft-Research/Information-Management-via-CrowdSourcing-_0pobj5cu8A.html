I'm gonna be speaking in English arm
since that's what was been requested let
me just say a couple of words in Spanish
and maybe school plan for our landing
Lester creo que es mejor para los que no
habla espanol cabin inglis SI quien
habla conmigo en espanol encantado
despues de la platica hey so I'll switch
back to english and it's a great honor
and a pleasure to be here I always
appreciate Microsoft's invitation to
participate in these events it's been
wonderful great location everything is
fine so I'm going to talk a little bit
about some of the research that we're
doing in our in our info lab in our
group at Stanford and the topic is a
crowdsourcing so I understand that Peter
um already said a few words about
crowdsourcing I had to step out for a
minute while he was giving his talk but
just briefly crowdsourcing refers to
using common people out there to help
solve problems that computers have a
harder time solving and it's definitely
not a new idea back in the Wild West the
the sheriff's were using crowdsourcing
they were asking people out there to
help out with the task they had a reward
for the when the task was completed so
so it's an old idea that that's been
around but it's become very popular
these days because of computer networks
and number of people that are that are
that are using computers um so um there
are two common terms that you might hear
that two related terms one is wisdom of
the crowds which also is related to the
crowd but has to do more with taking
what the crowd is already doing like
typing in queer
to bing for example and analyzing them
to learn what the intentions what the
thoughts of people are but I'm gonna be
talking more about actually going out
and asking people to participate in an
activity for pay for instance another
term that I put more as a joke there is
cloud computing the similarity between
crowdsourcing and cloud computing is
that they're both buzzwords and they're
both rather vague and basically whatever
you're doing these days can be put under
crowdsourcing or cloud computing in a
sense but but don't confuse the terms
for my talk okay so i understand that
peter also had a little experiment this
morning for you on and i'm going to have
since since we have a crowd here this is
ideal for crowdsourcing and it's also
very similar to what Peter said its dots
it's actually in a test we're using with
our in our research so that's why I
selected it but there's a key difference
Peter didn't get anybody to answer his
question I understand but he forgot one
important aspect which is rewarding the
people that participate having
incentives so a failure here has
volunteered and I have some cash here
that we're actually going to pay people
so we're going to take the bag and I
want to failure to help me find five or
seven volunteers maybe some of the
students who need money more and and and
you're going to be paid five cents a
nickel so each one so I'll give them out
to five or seven people raise your hand
if you want to participate in this
experiment yeah don't forget that you're
getting the money right so don't take
the money and that don't do the work
which already is a problem that you see
with crowdsourcing right how do we get
people to do the real work and not just
take the money if we have some
volunteers over here so while you're
getting the money oh and this is
typically what their sites like a
mechanical turk for example where you go
and you get small tasks and you get paid
two three cents in my case I'm offering
five cents for this particular task and
you can do many tasks and there are
actually people all over the world that
are making a living working on tasks
that are that are generated in this
fashion okay so do we have five or seven
people yeah that's that's why it doesn't
have to be exact
okay now I'm not checking if you have I
know there's a lot of non Mexicans here
I'm maybe I'm supposed to check if they
have the right a visa work visa for this
I don't know if I'm going to get into
trouble for this or not but anyway we
have raise your hand if you're if you're
working okay so how many just hey wait a
second we have only 30 or okay okay good
good okay so i'm going to show you a
number of dots and you're going to have
a limited amount of time why am I
limiting the time bill because people
that work on crowdsourcing do tasks
relatively fast because they want to do
more tasks so i'm simulating that
environment so you'll see a number of
dots and you have to tell me if there
are more than 45 dots or fewer than 45
dots why is that an interesting question
well perhaps you are a mall a shopping
mall and you want to find out what are
the peak times a number of people so
you're showing people photographs of the
mall and people are supposed to count
how many customers are in the mall at
that time so these are not photograph
these are dots but it's sort of the same
idea their cases where people can
analyze an image faster and better than
the computer and that's what you're
doing here for us okay so here's the
question so take a look at it the people
that are working for us and okay so are
the people that are paid the five cents
raise your hand if you think there were
more than 45 dots okay we have one two
three four dots and now how many you
think there were what did you say those
are the less than 45 no more than 45 for
and less than 45 or 45 well less than or
equal to 0 so we have to okay so you're
beginning to see what the issue is the
crowd is not perfect right people have
different opinions sometimes it's a
subjective question sometimes it's not
like here but because of the rush or the
difficulty of the question you might not
have the right answer so one of the
things you have to start doing and
crowdsourcing is asking multiple people
and the question now is what do we do do
i do I take the majority or the average
how do i combine the answers of people
now there might be some people that are
just lazy out there or spammers are
called that are just doing this to cheat
me out of my five cents
do I detect people do I look at their
pattern how they're operating do I look
at the response time if they're
answering too quickly maybe I should not
take into account their their answers or
I should weigh them less that the other
answers are the people that disagreed
the two or three that disagreed with the
majority maybe I should fire you and you
shouldn't work anymore for me or maybe I
should give you three chances and if in
those chances you still disagree with
the majority then I can fire you all of
these questions are things that people
are looking at in this a wide area of
crowdsourcing so I have another question
just to to see if we still get this
agreement so the same question but now
different set of dots Oh failure can you
hire five more workers for me please yes
okie 10 he wants T watts of work to do
oh the guy with a microphone not just
kidding no every kit works ok someone
else you do ok and a failure you get to
save they get to change whatever
leftovers for you ok if they don't work
correctly ah someone is yeah okay okay
ladies so Lucy and I wide a nice pay
five cents you could do a larger plug
someone is dollars yeah ha no less ok so
that's it ready ok thank you I'll
feather you've done a great job my
assistant thank you ok so uh here you go
more than 45 dots take a look ok so how
many people said there were more than 40
50 I guess people that are not paid are
also voting or do we go out this many
coins her anyway how many go said less
than 45 there fewer ok three so maybe we
should believe the majority right i
would guess but in these tests you never
know i mean the computer doesn't
generally know what the answer is we
have to rely on the crowd so that's the
type of questions we are we want to
address in crowdsourcing ok so there's a
lot of interest in crowdsourcing these
days um here are the names of some of
the companies that we know of
that are in the crowd sourcing space
there are lots and probably we missed a
whole bunch of them Sir lots of small
startups slightly larger startups ah
they do all type of work i mentioned
mechanical turk which is part of Amazon
where they do micro tasks little tasks
for pennies at a time there's companies
like odesk where it's bigger task you
actually hire somebody to write a
program for you or to write an essay for
instance there are companies that go to
the crowd out there they don't know who
they're hiring their companies that
actually hire people in the Philippines
for example they have an outfit that
hires people and then their crowd is a
controlled crowd that they use for their
work so they can vet the people that are
working for them on so they're very many
different scenarios some of them provide
more of an advising service if you want
to do crowdsourcing then they tell you
how to use Mechanical Turk how to use
crowd flower and so on some of them
build platforms somebody some of them
build the actual marketplaces where you
do the work like Mechanical Turk so
there's a wide spectrum of things um
what do the companies do they're all
sorts of applications for example a
company like Microsoft and Bing wants to
know how well their search engine is
doing so they want to constantly be
evaluating the relevance of their
results so they might ask the crowd in
some context either wild crowd or people
that they hire to do this to evaluate
how well the rankings are the results
relevant or is the order incorrect for
what they're showing and they take the
input from from the crowd on other
companies want to offer products for
example we know of a company that's
trying to see if their price is
competitive with the price of other
companies so they asked people ok here's
this product go and find it on the web
and tell us what prices you find it at
and then they can match their price with
what other companies are offering or we
know people that in Haiti after the
earthquake we're trying to match for
example photos of missing people with
photos of survivors of the quake but
again asking people to see if they can
match them up to try to find the missing
people so there's a wide spectrum of
applications companies are using this
quite a bit and that's why it's such an
interesting area for us researchers to
look at so speaking of researchers
there's a lot of sort of academic
projects I've listed the icons from a
number of universities that are doing
research in crowdsourcing Stanford
included among all those again I'm
probably missing a lot of universities
so that's basically the the problem area
and now I'm going to be focusing on on
the research and specifically some of
the research that we're doing at
Stanford but before I get started our
research let me just say a few words
about crowdsourcing research on there's
a lot of different aspects like in the
in my little cartoon that I have there
which is the the blind men looking at
the elephant and everybody sees a
different part of the elephant and
thinks that they're looking at a
different object so crowdsourcing is is
the same thing so there are many
different aspects for example there are
people that are interested in the human
computer interaction what's the best way
to present the problem to people to get
the input back from people very
important problems in that aspect of
software systems if I want to be issuing
tasks like the one I was giving you what
type of software infrastructure what can
I use to issue the tasks to collect the
results to keep statistics on the work
and so on so it's a lot of computer
systems work that's going on on the
human side there's a lot of psychology
issues like how much reward the people
do a need to do good work if I pay ten
cents instead of five cents will you
become more accurate in my tasks for
example that's more of a psychological
question than a computer science
question again all very important parts
of the puzzle machine learning people
there are many aspects too mushy of that
where machine learning can help in
crowdsourcing or you can use
crowdsourcing to obtain training sets
for your machine learning that can go
both ways with machine learning and
finally information management which is
I'm a database management person at
heart so that's sort of the aspect that
I'm going to talk about so let's focus
on that aspect but of course keep in
mind that all the other aspects i
mentioned are equally or more important
than
the data management site but that's sort
of my corner so that's what I'm going to
talk about today and specifically I'm
going to focus on two aspects of the
research in information management that
we are pursuing at Stanford one is
looking at the crowd as a source of
information if I want to find a good
restaurant in cancun or even in this
hotel they have so many good restaurants
I can ask you for the information right
so you're a source of information just
like I have the web I might have a
traditional database I have the crowd
that can provide information so the
second part is I'm going to briefly tell
you about one direction we're following
on the other side is viewing the crowd
as an information processor that was my
experiment that I did initially asking
you to analyze an image give me an
answer for it for instance so that's the
first part of the work that i'm going to
describe so keep in mind that in both of
these areas as i described our research
and and as you think of research in this
area there at least three different
dimensions of the challenges and there
there there you can't get everything at
once so one of the issues is the
accuracy of the results we noticed that
people wouldn't agree on the answers to
my question so um you have to think
about how accurate are the answers that
are being produced by by by the crowd
there's also the cost how much money am
I going to pay people for to do the work
and obviously there's a trade-off the
more people I pay or the more money I
pay each person maybe my accuracy will
improve there's also the third dimension
which is the latency it takes time to
set up a task depending on the market
place that you're using so you need to
understand how to get the tasks out how
to collect the answers and again there's
some trade-offs if I go out in parallel
and ask a lot of tasks that's going to
cost me money more money maybe it's
going to prove my accuracy but it's
going to reduce my latency if I do it
one at a time it might cost less and I
might still get the same accuracy after
a lot of questions but the response time
is going to be much lower so so that's
that's just a trade-off that you have to
decide on okay so
Oh think I'm just going to skip this by
the way however how i doing on time I
didn't notice when now we got started
comment 20 minutes okay perfect okay so
20 minutes okay so I'm going to talk
about on the viewing people as as
processing sources processing engines
for example I'm going to talk about one
very simple problem that we've been
analyzing now some of you might be
puzzled why I pick such a simple problem
I mean it's sort of a trivial problem
but you'll be surprised that even this
simple problem has some interesting
aspects to it and I think it helps us
understand the harder problems that you
might be facing with crowdsourcing so
the problem i have is very simple you
have a set of images or items and you
want to apply a predicate like are there
more than 45 people in this image for
example or is this the image of a car or
whatever question your predicate and
then you want to just have a filter data
set where you've classified each object
yes or no so I'm just assuming a simple
boolean predicate yes no as the output
and the predicate however is not a
computer predicate it's something that
is going to be evaluated by the crowd
just like we did here and I want to see
here I'm showing different responses and
as I hinted at one obvious thing is to
just use a majority right say okay the
majority says yes then it's yes but if
you think of it there are a lot more
choices that you could implement in just
that simple decision of how do I decide
when to stop point to not ask more
questions so one of the insights that my
graduate student Aditya had was to view
the problem in the following way think
of this space of scenarios and the
horizontal axis tells you how many
people have answered no in this case to
the questions and the vertical axis
tells you how many people have answered
yes ok so as you operate your decision
for one item you're going to move in
this in this space um and your policy
can be viewed as a set of colored dots
on that space that tell you what to do
in each situation so the example i
illustrate here the green dots mean
I haven't decided so continue asking
questions the blue dots this decision is
passed I call it pass to differentiate
from yes so yes it's what one person
says passes the decision that you make
in the system as you're filtering the
the objects okay so in this particular
strategy if you get let's see four yeses
and and and either zero one or two or
three knows you're still going to say
yes if you get for knows so in other
words the first four votes you get in
one direction or the other you're going
to say pass or fail based on that and
and and and that's your strategy okay so
this is one example I can actually get
rid of the dots and just represent it as
two curves one blue curve that tells me
where I'm going to say pass and then one
red curve where I'm going to say no and
the meeting point I call the decision
point that's sort of the point in the
middle where you switch from yes to no
now this doesn't cover all the policies
but it covers all the ones that sort of
makes sense you could think of weird
ones but but this sort of it makes sense
but even this policies that could be
described with these two curves are
there many different things you could do
here so for example here is one where I
say well instead of having the decision
point of the corner let me move it a
little bit over why well maybe because I
know that it's it's more likely I know
might not know something about the
Apriori distribution of my objects and I
might know that it they're more failed
so maybe i will say fail more easily for
examples i might bias my result by
moving by ruling that curve um here is
the majority one that I showed you
earlier that i showed you that I
described earlier right just so the line
is I always stop at four questions and
then whichever has the majority of
questions that's the way I decide right
so that's sort of the obvious simple one
but it's just one of many solutions
here's another one where I say I'm going
to wait until at least I have two more
of one type than of the other right so I
continue at some point I'm going to give
up because I don't want to just spend
infinite resources
at some point I'm just going to cut it
off and I have to make a decision okay
so that's another strategy that might be
good I'll just continue asking questions
until I get two in favor in one
direction or the other or I run out of
money and then I have to stop and decide
one way or the other okay so many
different choices and furthermore there
are some interesting questions look at
this policy that I showed you there on
this one I mean it's okay but you can
very quickly see that it doesn't really
make sense because once I've gotten into
this region over here it's all going to
be read anyway so why am I asking
questions up here I think I have a point
do I have a pointer here you know why am
I asking questions here if I know I'm
going to say fail anyway so I'm just
wasting my money and and people's time
so i can replace that by that policy so
you can already see that they're sort of
like a algebra of shapes you have these
shapes and some shapes dominate other
shapes in terms that they're always
better than then and then the other so
there's a lot of interesting things you
can do there then of course you want to
decide of the shapes that make sense
which one is better so suppose I show
you those two shapes which one should
use in your system well now we need to
evaluate both of them both wheels make
sense and we've come up i'm not going to
bore you with all the details but i'm
just then to describe briefly there's a
methodical way of evaluating how
expensive a strategy is the expected
cost on the average how many how many
dollars am I going to spend to answer
questions and also the expected error
over all possible scenarios what's the
quality of the results that I'm going to
get so then you can compare your
strategies and ask questions like I want
to find the one that minimizes the
expected cost but giving me some
guaranteed level of correctness of the
answers or many other sort of
optimization questions that you can ask
okay so that was just the motivation for
the work we've done there's a lot of
additional details you can read and we
have a sigma paper that goes into a lot
of detail here
but let me move on and just talk about
some of the I'll skip this there's a lot
of extensions again as I said earlier I
started with a very simple problem just
to sort of motivate the issues um you
can also you can think for example I
mentioned one of the extensions
probabilistic strategies the strategies
I described there are deterministic my
head blue and red dots that you always
did the same thing when you got to that
point in the grid but you have a
probabilistic strategy where you get
there you flip a coin with ninety
percent probability also i'll say pass
with ten percent probability i'll
continue asking questions for example it
turns out very surprising that the
probabilistic strategies are better you
can find strategies that are better than
the deterministic one so if you want the
best performance for the lowest cost you
should use a probabilistic strategy for
example that's something that I hadn't
thought of when we started doing this
work okay then in addition there are
different types of algorithms that we've
been studying right I sort of show you
the simplest type of algorithm you can
think of and but there are other
algorithms like finding the max the best
image of a group of images sorting
things using the crowd doing entity
resolution for example trying to find
out what object mass matches other
objects using people to help you to
guide you and so on so we're exploring a
number of different algorithm its
algorithms for this okay let me stop
here I know ask questions I mean I like
questions so if people have any
questions at this one because now I'm
going to switch to just like three men
five minutes if I still have time yeah
10 ok so I'm going to switch topics but
if people have questions or comments
about this I'll be happy to take them
yes I mean they may be individual
they're much more knowledgeable about
the subject then oh there's absolutely
yellow I mean are you a Republican or
something I was a great point yes that
was the simple model where yes each
worker was independent of the other
workers and I model but the slide I had
skipped tells us some of the extensions
we're looking at right so what happens
when workers have different abilities
for instance or how do i track as i said
earlier in my experiment you want to
keep track of who's a good worker
who's a bad worker how do I do that
effectively and and what's the accuracy
of those estimates is but if I say
you're a bad work or how confident am I
that you're a bad worker and what's the
strategy do i fire you do I give an
incentive do I pay more to the workers
that did better there's a lot of
interesting questions so by my simple
the analysis of the simple strategy was
just to sort of wet your appetite and
get you interested there's lots of
extensions that are needed and we're
working on and a lot of people are
working on there's other things here
that that you can see as current topics
okay any other questions okay well you
might have a few minutes at the end so
let me move on just tell you about the
other side of the research that we're
doing this will be even briefer um
remember the idea now here is that we're
going to view the crowd as sources of
information so what we'd like to do our
vision since we're database people is to
build a database that can go to
traditional databases or the web or the
people as necessary so we'd like to
build a database system that's smart
enough to know where to go and get the
stuff that needs but the characteristics
of this store this data source is very
different than from this source and from
this source so the techniques have to be
different so here is our vision for this
database system it's going to have a
conceptual schema that the users are
going to see an actual schema that's the
materialized view if you want and then
you have the the system underneath so
let me illustrate just with one example
how the system works just again to give
you the flavor and the idea of what
we're building we actually have a
prototype and if there's experimental
results for it and so on but let's take
the example I mentioned earlier you want
to find restaurants that are that are
good so this is the view that the users
have so this is what we'd like to
provide the users of the system of view
that they have restaurants and ratings
and the type of food that those
restaurants serve so the user does not
know about the crowd or where the data
is they just have that view but
underneath we're going to divide that
data
into segments depending on how we get
the data so we have the anchor column
which is the sort of the keys of the
records think of in that way that it can
be generalized it was thinking of those
keys and then the other tables are built
that way because we're providing what we
call fetch rules these are rules for
going to a crowdsourcing source and
getting information so for example this
fetch rule is saying that you can go and
ask a person tell them a restaurant name
and they will tell you what they serve
at that restaurant okay so that tells us
what there's a functionality of the
people that you have now you can
actually have multiple fetch rules per
segment here you can also in this
example say I could go and ask people
French restaurant water French
restaurants that you know of so
depending on your application you can go
either way so you have multiple fetch
rules for each of these segments then
these blue segments are what's
materialize these are the answers that
you are getting from users as you go and
get the data from the crowd you also
need some way to resolve it because you
know for example the view up there each
you have to combine the the attributes
here into one number so for example the
the shep anees california restaurant has
4.9 and and and that we need to average
these numbers to generate that that
value right so in addition to the fetch
rules we're telling the system how to
cleanse the data in database terminology
okay so those are the key components and
then the logical view again is like you
collect data from the crowd here in
these tables you fetch then you resolve
and then you join the tables and create
what the user wants but what the system
needs to do is just the opposite right
because it's not going to do any of this
until it has a query so it's just like
materialized views like like querying
views so the query will come in you'll
tell me Oh get me French restaurants
that have this rating and the system
will say at runtime oh I might already
have some in my database but if not I'm
going to go ask people for
or their opinion of restaurants so
dynamically the system is going to
decide where to get the data and ask
people cleanse the data and we'll stop
when it has enough answers for you so
that's sort of the vision that we and
other university or following for this
sort of data crowd database system okay
they're obviously a lot of interesting
challenges here for those of you do
databases there's a query optimization
is one of the hardest aspects of
traditional databases here it becomes
harder because you have new operators
like a fetch operator resolve operator
so your query optimizer nASA has to deal
with how do i order these operators um
we have to deal with extensions to the
query language so for example you notice
in the query there's this at least eight
because since the crowd is infinite
there's no limit to how many restaurant
names were going to get from the crowd
so you have to give some guidance i want
at least eight french restaurants with
rating of four so then that drives the
system to ask questions until it has
enough data to satisfy the query so that
also has to be introduced into the query
plan and the query optimizer has to
understand all the complexities of
dealing with people and at the same time
the traditional data sources ok we have
a prototype we have I'm not going to go
into the experimental results but there
are all sorts of interesting
observations that we have even with our
preliminary system showing for example
how this little graph just tries to show
that depending on the type of threat
rules you have sometimes your questions
if you don't have enough power in what
you can ask people then the question can
end up taking a long time this shows how
long you have to run to get these number
of tuples this is a real live experiment
on Mechanical Turk where we're
collecting data from from people if you
have people that are more powerful that
can do better types of queries then
these are the different colored
scenarios with different query
optimization strategies and you can see
that they provide different results
basically this graph here is just to
show you that there are results you can
read in our
paper if you are interested okay so um
to conclude and maybe we have a little
time for questions I think crowdsourcing
is an exciting new area there is a lot
of interest from small companies right
now honestly I don't know if it's going
to be a huge commercial success in the
future but that's not really what's
driving us it's just there's lots of
very interesting questions and there's
potential to provide the end users where
their corporations like Microsoft or
yourselves with higher quality more
diverse data than we can get from
today's computer systems so we'll take
that stance acre so it n MOS tiempo para
para prevalent fascist ago we have a
little bit of time for questions so
maybe could have the lights up so I can
see who's asking the question I'm una
pregunta yes over here you can ask in
Spanish or in English and I'll translate
or I'll try to translate one of the big
challenges I imagine here is the
response time of the system right
because you're used to have your
response like licking a couple of I
don't know milliseconds with a
traditional database system first here
you might need to wait a couple of
minutes or days maybe right exactly so
how how to deal with that for instance
the user could say give me whatever
answers you have in one minute I don't
want to wait for longer than that or how
do you cope with the time issue it's
wide open I mean anything is possible
yes on now in some scenarios I think
it'll be fine to wait a few days so
these queries are going to be more like
analysis questions right so you are in
the company and want to know who in the
company might have these abilities to
help me in this project right it's a
type of thing you would traditionally do
by asking your friends and it would take
days to find out so if you're going to
the crowd which and that in a company
scenario would be your employees or the
people that are participating in the in
the company's Facebook then it's okay it
takes a couple of days it's faster than
it would have taken you by doing it
manually yourself yeah in other
scenarios maybe us you want fast to
respond
and then it may be this type of system
will not be appropriate for that but
whatever your scenario they're still
interesting challenges how can we speed
up the the execution for example in the
database context that I showed you there
if I have multiple fetch rules right
then i showed you in that graph i went
over quickly that depending on which
fetch rule i utilize i can get the
answers faster than in other cases right
so if somebody wants say chinese
restaurants then should I first ask the
user is okay give me names of Chinese
restaurants or should I ask them here's
a restaurant it's a Chinese the response
time is different how do I decide which
one will give me the fastest response
for my query hard problem I don't know
the answer but that's that's that's a
great research area I think yes back
there yes please oh I sorry you have the
microphone here sorry you got beaten
that's his way already in espanol and
minimal attention a similitude que
tienen como esta este structure ando el
modelo de les que medida de datos es muy
similar a lo que se utiliza gasps knocks
treason el tema de arid FM triples
cuando el más cuando se Paris to meta
data en presencia de tous am pensado en
until I sonaba Sato's no relational
novice a tous en manteca para más en
esta información que creo que podría
ser una forma más mess eficiente de
hacer esas busca da sequences okay so
the question was why did we go with a
vanilla relational model why not RDF or
XML or whatever you like and yes we
thought about it actually our group has
done work in semi-structured data in the
past we just felt that it was hard
enough with relational that we didn't
want to throw too many things into the
problem yet so it was easier to just use
the traditional database relational
model it's not that we don't like the
others yes it might be but very natural
but we had our hands full with this
that's the main motivation and yes I was
wondering the relation of this kind of
data gathering
in comparison with the actual poles
actual poles poles so for instance if I
want to know who's gonna vote for
whatever part in Mexico yes yeah could I
use something like this and how do you
deal with it with the interest of the
participant how surely in other in other
subjects as well I mean the bias of the
interest of the participants is
important so how do you deal with that
yes great questions as you began ixia
mean I don't have the answers to all
these very good questions because this
is I think it's a new topic and and
we're just sort of getting started
that's very good I hadn't thought of
that aspect of soda using it as a
polling system but in principle it could
be right because that's what polling
agencies do that somebody comes and says
we want to get this type of information
and they form a pole and they go out and
do it so why not sort of odd to me
automate the process you define your
schema you define the Federals and then
on the fly you could do like mini polls
you could just here's what I want to
know and then you could call people and
give them resolution rules for how to
combine the results I think it's a great
example of how to deal with biases
another great question I don't know but
I guess your your resolution rules would
have to take that into account right in
our system I'm just making this up as
I'm going along uh-huh that your
resolution rule is fairly um you can be
any any program so you can just code
something up it says okay look at their
party affiliation look what they said
and somehow way their vote by by their
party affiliation or something so you
could do something like that but I love
it it's a great great example do we have
I mean do we have time for questions
more had one more also in relation with
these people as processors yeah it what
do you think is the important is there
any of the topology of the social
network and each people's or each
person's position in it sorry can you be
so yay with people as processors you do
you consider it important their position
in the social network on the forum and
the topology of the network itself okay
another good question so the question
was what about the social network in in
the filtering example that I showed you
we there was no social network right
each worker was independent but actually
there's a company that came by to talk
to us
in the bay area that was doing
crowdsourcing on on linkedin and taking
into account the social structure so the
idea is that you wanted to rate linkedin
profiles ought to see who was better
suited for a job but their idea was that
which is I think what you're saying is
that if you asking two people to compare
to LinkedIn profiles if you're somehow
associated you know those people then
you're a better person to judge if was
better for example for the task so they
were looking at using the social
structure to sort of give tasks to the
appropriate people who might provide
better input so it's definitely a
portent direction we haven't studied at
ourselves in our research and maybe
later on I'll remember the name of the
company and I can give it to you if you
want to get in touch with them but right
now I'm blanking out on the name of the
company ok so I think I said which I has
a hectare thank you very much yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
