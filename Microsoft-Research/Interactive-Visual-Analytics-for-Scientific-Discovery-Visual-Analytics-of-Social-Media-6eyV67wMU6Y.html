okay so first I say the how much time I
left so it's a 20 minutes and the
previously I thought have maybe 30 40 so
I just cut some with heroes so I the
social media I don't need to convince
you is so popular so among the 20 were
the most popular website more than half
of them social media so in the social
media are some common research issues
first you go to a social media you first
need to figure out all these people and
what their relationships and as a second
okay you go to social media you already
want to spread out some information and
you want for mo something you want to
know how this information is diffused in
the social media and third one you go
the arrows there are multiple topics and
people compete for attention so you want
to know how this is the the this army is
called topic commutation happened so the
outline and I want to talk about three
works so first about the people's sites
relationship in a social network and set
in the information diffusion and third
one is a topic computation so this first
work is it's just a presented for months
ago in at a euro base 13 so what is the
motivation so motivation once you go to
a new community and you want to figure
out what is their relationship for
example this conference we have a waste
people we have a database people and we
are not meeting in all that familiar
with database people so what do we do it
we can plow their collaboration network
it is two people call the papers and we
draw a little graph they have edge
connection so among this graph then the
people may have different interests you
collaborative paper than in this paper
then be shared interest but they may
have some other interest right for
example in this graph okay you have this
red node is a researcher green node
another researcher so their interest
research interest is in the right one is
there some kind of overlap so then you
want to figure out okay for this kind of
large work
and there is a two I mean research
problems why it's called homophily
effect that means okay is two birds of a
feather flock together so that means
okay people you have this I mean called
the paper a lot of people just just
slamming their neighbors in the several
network whether they really share I mean
a lot of interest so in Chinese is
called we late using into thing right we
want to figure out the weather is true
or not and the second one figure out
okay if their shares I'm coming interest
and what's very interest is shared and
where whether each one have some kind of
unique interest so you try to use
visualization to solve this problem and
we just talked about how we do this okay
it's at first okay with how about this
is in the sewer Network how you figure
out okay what is there I mean interests
share the interest in your social
network so what we can do is there is a
simple solution for example if in this
kind of graph right if your x-axis is a
distance then y axis is a basically is
the overlap of the interest then for
each person you can figure out on the
super net was there other people there
super distance to him or her all you can
figure out the reissue I have a bunch of
research interests Oh use just for
example in Weibo tater you follow
someone then we can figure out what
their overlap of their interest than for
all these other people in the sooner you
can plot in this kind of a scatter plot
the of that with to some handle
aggregation so we use is called a
histogram to draw it so x axis a
distance but it's decent one season two
and maybe it is a 3 to 5 and y axis is
okay how many how many number people in
this distance okay what is
distance to people number of decent
people in this local network now we do
this candle restock this kind of a
shaded block to show what is the sheer
the interest maybe eighty percent of
interest they are basically the shared
and maybe sixty percent so it's
different she gives block shows how much
interest they are shared so then of that
we turn them into a glyph to a small
graph and they can be easily recognized
so once we plot this can drop into a
social network that can find something
interesting stuff right so if you look
at this one red one and this is a blue
one their ship is quite different right
so this blue one okay they have is a
peek at the beginning that means okay
there are decent one they have shared a
lot of common interest like all the army
just very close friends they share a lot
of interest if it isn't far away that it
don't have much thing to share but this
is a red one if you think oh they have a
to peak or multiple peak the other means
okay some people is they have some lot
of shared interest with their I mean not
even their friends then this one can
clearly identify these two different
groups so once you enhance the social
network with this kind of a graph for
example for yourself like I usually
found ok weather ok among my friends
whether I really shared out with my
friends or is someone ok I don't even
know but they share a lot of interest
with me it was just a look at this kind
of clip can tell you a lot a lot of
information right so it's 445 these
people for example sheeana me maybe have
eighty percent we share interest then
close maybe we have over 50 then for
Daniel maybe I'm just a subset of his
research interests so so this one can
tell you I mean something about this a
certain area collaboration and said then
that you want to know if for example we
know okay these people we shared eighty
percent of interest of sixty percent so
what is interested research topic and
what they are unique interest if not
just two people you may have multiple
people how you compare them so we
combine with a solution so how we do
this first okay with all the people you
are interested
now we cut it there I mean topics okay
they are interests for example research
interests than each one for example you
are interesting tree in graph I mean
pipeline architecture now we plot all
the than one into this use you into this
kind of a 2d layout so they have some
kind of decent right for example the
tree and graph are closer and is a tree
and the pipeline have this just far away
so you can compute some distance then we
can use multidimensional scaling to pass
them all this interesting to a tutti
plan then this distance tell you how
close the topics they are okay this is
the first step right so second step okay
we draw this user the kernel density
estimation to draw a contour map so this
is a kind of counter med and basically
tell you you this kind of a shaded shape
to tell you how close this is the
interest this topics are okay then for
each person if you are interesting some
topics do i use a line to connect all
these topics right so can you use a line
to collect all this topic so we use what
we do it you submitting the minimum
spanning tree to connect all the
interest shared by one person for Graham
this is one person is all in the
interest we can use the line to draw it
then you can clearly say okay this is
interest then there is a cluster tree
graph here article this is a cluster
then there is also is a one branch is go
to something quite a unique okay then
you have a multiple persons than each
one you have a line then you can draw
them you into this kind of countable map
so you have a green line you have herb a
purple we have read instead of three
persons that you can easily do a
comparison so if you think how this kind
of design is design is everything about
this quite intuitive right because every
people is familiar with this candle tree
map so the tree map each tree in okay
some train to share some kind of
this right in this is kind of in this
candle farming location they all go to
this candle for location but some train
to go to just all the only this wrinkle
to this candle location so this in
visualization we call the metal base to
design so uses kind of metaphor if we
explain this to other people that if I
nearly understand okay this is a this is
the design so we just show some kind of
example this is from the info bees
proceedings from 1997 2002 now we got
the titles gather the author's abstract
then from that one we extract the key
words from the keyword to figure out
their distance that you this MDS use
counter map to plot them okay then we
enhance them with some with this clip we
show these different authors that will
conceal carry some authors they have
co-authorship and then we share the
interest and someone okay is not like
this one so what do we do it will pick
up three authors that we draw them into
this kind of contour map now what do you
say okay issue i represent author then
what's their research interest then you
can very intuitively be aiming a
perceived right for example in this kind
of area all three lines pass through
these topics that means these three
authors are all interests this should
share the interest by these three
authors but this blue blue one ok this
is the unique interest by this this blue
guy right so this is only his this blue
line pass through these topics but other
one not so by this way is you can
usually figure out in a social network
and what's there I mean share the
interest and what this interest are so
this is the first topic just use the
example to show you how to do this so I
think maybe I Scott escape this is
whisper because I talked about this
before so i just have the
how about another one so how about the
topic of competition on social media is
just a presented two weeks ago at a
infobase conference so what is topics
but the thing about on social media that
people promote different topics then
this topic will compete for people's
attention right so this is called a
diffusion of multiple topics just like a
wee boy line every day you have a top
100 we bought off 100 tweets but is one
getting another one will be kicked out
so this is a basic is basically there
were some I mean again so in this
diffusion of multiple topics there are
two issues first is the interaction so
whether it's people get distracted away
from some topics when something more
eye-catching is happening and the second
one is the influence so how this is the
key players is like opinion leaders like
in charging we voices this valley right
how they affect the interactions by
district holder recruiting the public
attention for some topics so this is
this is the two issues we want to
address so there are three I mean
different concept first concept is
called agenda setting so it basically
basically say how the ability of the
news media like that even use paper to
influence the ceiling say of topics on
the public agenda so how this can do for
news media is always just key players to
influence okay if they publish something
whether this one will get a lot of
attention and second why is the call the
topic commutation as I mentioned so
addiction of in any new topic on the
public agenda kames at the cost of other
topics so this one is become a headline
the other one will be kick out so this
is a call the topic competition and
third why is called the two-step
information flow so the info in the
communication filled it to various
studied always verify the same thing so
the information is just propagate
through some key players and just like a
newspaper media or like this is a big a
toffee or whatever is either so this
information reach the masses where
some kind of key players so this is
called a two-step information flow so
you now visualization we want to address
these three issues so at first we our
system is combined its quantitative
modeling and interactive visualization
so you have this candle topics and you
also want to figure out how this for
example news media how this is a key
player influence other people then also
we need to figure out okay how the
hotness of each topic right so we want
to use this content on detective
modeling method from communication field
to compute what to computer is firstly
the topping competitiveness so how
competitive the topic is and secondly
each opinion leader groups in the
influence on each topic and third is
called the topic transition trend of
each opinion leader group so this is
from this is a computational side from
quantitative modeling side from the
visualization side want to fig out the
dynamic relationship between topics and
opinion leader groups and also this is a
textual content of the post so what they
exactly what is top out about this topic
so what do we do is we build a system so
this is system this is a pipe neural
system so we have we used Twitter as an
example so you have a collection with
tweets now you how you can do some kind
of a text research then you have this is
at am serious stream of tweets so text
search basically to some filtering and
you just filter some kind of topics and
of that you have this competitive mode
we measure to get you this is a topic
transition analysis copy of commutation
analysis then in the visualization part
we have work a two major visualization
wine is called at hamline visualization
another is called work out so it firstly
show this kind of the top of your
commutation model so how you you see how
what is the change of a public
tension on certain topic so in the
communication feel the model something
like this you have a recruiting effect
you have a distracting in fact for
example Microsoft de sense if if for
example I'm a big player iming in
Twitter or someone I basically broadcast
ok there are Microsoft the e science is
cut is going on ok everyone should
attend it so this will is called the
recruiting effect so I just recruit
people's attention if I said ok these
two days is the best time to go to I
mean gridwall to see these four leaves
and then this is called I mean the
distraction in fact just distract the
people's attention from this event so
they have some kind of model to switch
topics on which clear recruiting people
to for this topic which one try too
distracting it none of that you can have
this measured for you should each topic
so after the output of its analysis and
modeling step what you have is a topic
of competitiveness of each topic and
also the opinion opinion leader groups
the influence our inch topic also the
topic transitions trend so you know
visualize deep inside our design still
based on some metaphors call this one
this time is called the river so we know
we all know the vaporizer a big river
you have a small River and the big river
you really is more wide and the small
rivers narrow right so what do we do it
each topic here this device is a topic
so each strip is the topic than the
width of the topic of this trip
basically represent the competitive of
each topic that we can clearly see okay
this is a defense and international
issues okay here at the Tucson tell cut
a lot of attention this is a very
competitive and this horse race and you
see it's very narrow is not as much
attention it's not very competitive and
secondly each key player and we group
them into three different category wines
from media like in York Times secondly
the political figures just like Obama's
White House and third one's a grassroots
just
some I mean a blogger or something like
that independent bloggers always treats
layer okay what they are I mean
recruiting effects we encode this uses
different the line right you see this
red is the green that is the blue then
each one representing the category the
same theme see if this guy have this
play designed recruiting efforts on this
topic we just draw a line on the strip
of that topic and the width of the line
in code how much effort he put to
recruit people for this topic now you
can clearly see for example this is in
the top there I have a cig climbing blue
one that means the political figures at
this time period put a lot of effort to
promote to recruit people on this
defense international issues and also we
have this this word cloud quiche okay
when you go to the treats and what
exactly it how bout give you some kind
of most frequently frequently appear the
keywords okay now we just because of
damages quickly go to the case study so
this is shows example is 2012 with the
US presidential elections so you see
here at the two 2012 at the 212 then you
see this is the have this is the six
different topics and also you can see
this kind of effort for the influence of
key players of this is on the different
topic like you have a thick blue one and
this is blue and it put a lot of efforts
to recruit people on these low social
relationships and if you open their
tweets now you can see the keywords the
condition at that time maybe the u.s. I
mean party convention so if you could
choose I mean later then you will see a
lot of blue line this blue line is
besides grassroots if some independent
blockers then you will see they put a
lot of effort to promote various issues
then like the defense international
issues the economy and also this is a
warfare I mean society something like
that you can see okay how much effort
over each
group play I mean recruit people on this
topic and whether it's taught whether
this topic is competitiveness it really
increased for some cases you see the yes
right so there is a linear correlation
between the sickness of land and the
sickness of these background strips and
also you can see this kind of transition
so for example this is the right one it
shows media so media the Tucson I mean
made i mean july the basically promote
multiple topics but the end of but the
later july july or june july right the
only how about this is one issue is
focused on why issues is it just emerged
this into wine i mean big issue on
Alyssa it's called the law I mean social
relationship so because of limited
hammer can do not have time to show you
the video and so I just do the
conclusion so we show some key issues in
social media and to talk about the two I
mean with urgent designs and also some
guidance and the suggestion I learned
from this work so one is a metaphor
based visual design is much easier for
people understand so all this river all
this I mean all this route this is the
river and this is a metro map it's much
easier than parallel coordinates for
people to understand and second it's all
this one we have some kind of
computational measures so for we should
Bureau analytic system you really need a
integration place so now is 559 I and
exactly on time okay so one minute for
question thank you so much question
I think it's a yes I'm some kind of
video but this is how it's played we
still how time to pick up to take
questions
yeah it shows how the system works so
you had exam I mean this is a the system
the right side show all these twists and
then you can basically select a time
frame time step and then pick up a topic
then you can see okay which group is now
promoting this topic now what exactly
they are talking about
and you see here this is a medium
recruit audience so this is all this i
mean the the yellow line that you know k
now they put over a lot of efforts to
talk about certain issue then try to get
people's attention
yeah so I think we people are just
hungry so we need to go to the bar said
6 10 retro okay I mean I could we have a
question here and my professor Chi
thanks for talking and I have questions
that in the previous set of religion
project I've seen that the people from
different social coercion network
because they may cooperate of because
they are common in chester and they may
also compete and for the in the same
area because they may don't know each
other so is it possible to combine the
later commutation model for previous pop
for this in darwin yeah i think this may
be a good idea but for this i mean the
top accommodation model there are two
issues first weather is really a
zero-sum that means okay my paper
cuttings and clouds kick-out oh maybe
it's just a win-win for example it's
because this close paper cutting that's
guide people the attention that my paper
also can easily get in so that is
actually is a need more study to see
whether it's a zero-sum always been me
but it is a good idea to combine them
into this kind of collaboration work
let's say okay whether it's one guy's
paper can't publish that all the people
have similar interests also there are
publication is the increase oh just one
that started publish or otherwise right
so this is I think it's a good idea to
combine this one okay the combine is to
work
so it may be our next you for his paper
yeah so let's thank y me again for this
great talk and dinner announcement there
is a staff outside that that all yeah we
all take a shuttle bus to the restaurant
soup before please follow him to the
shuttle bus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
