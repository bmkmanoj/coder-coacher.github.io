co-founder of mini chat and having
practiced this talk so please be aware
of that and i'll try to do my best to
entertain you and to give you as much
info about boxes we have learned over
the past 10 months so what we learned
from building 150,000 but what does it
mean just a brief outline I'm going to
tell you what do we do then five things
that we've learned and then if you have
any questions we can I can answer those
so what is many chat and where do these
hundred thousand BOTS come from so many
chat is a visual bought builder it
allows you to anyone to create a bot
without coding and we started before
everybody was talking about bots in the
sense of this week of opening of
platforms when kick opened up and
messenger opened up actually telegram
messenger opened up in July 2015 and
since that time we embraced that one of
the first teams to embrace that and
built out a bot to create bots so what
how it would work is you would give us
as as a user you would give us your API
token and then we would manage the board
for you and you would use our visual
interface to configure how the body
responds and and to do broadcast to
through the bots so launch 10 months ago
this is the growth of the number of the
bots created and today we are sending
over 600 million messages every month
that's on telegram and just two weeks
ago we've expanded to facebook Messenger
happy to announce and to brag that
reached number one on product hunt so
get into the actual interesting stuff
and not about that's about what where
we've been so what we've learned from
building those bots and from what users
are behave how users are behaving
they're so content consumption inside
BOTS works and this is was one of the
main discoveries that for us personally
because when we think about messaging
apps we tend to think that they're
really private and personal and that
people wouldn't want to subscribe to
actually things that would push them and
somehow maybe distract them from their
friend friend communication from what
we've learned is that right now there is
a 50-percent retention rate in terms of
subscriptions so we have over 12 million
subscriptions to the bots that were
created on our platform and six million
of those are still active which means
that the person who is receiving the
messages haven't deleted the bots or
mutated with a command it's as you might
imagine it's really easy to delete the
bots you just swipe and you just press
one button so if the bud distracts you
too much you just do that the retention
rate that we are seeing with the bots on
telegram is really astonishing to us and
we think it proves one of the main
points that people are willing to dilute
this channel of friend to friend
communication with something that is not
coming from France that is coming from
new sources bloggers businesses anything
that they're interested in the other
thing is one of the stats that we've
gathered this bots on our platform are
typically sending three four messages
per day but that's that's important that
doesn't mean that they are doing three
to four pushes a day because one message
can be sent in one burst so you get like
four messages at the same time it's
really important because if you get a
lot of push
patients in different times of the day
it really subtracts from your experience
if you're doing like if you but you can
send even 10 messages it doesn't matter
you can send them in 20 messages a day
if you do it in one burst because for a
person it's one distraction so that's
one of the things that was important the
second thing is like what are the actual
use cases for the boss that are created
in our platform it's not an LP it's not
a I it's really simple you can think of
this when you think about a web sites
that were used that were that were being
built in the late 90s up or early to
that uh 2,000 um yeah so there were
these were static websites with static
content and people were using those and
webmasters were creating those just to
showcase what they have like it could be
wallpapers jokes anything music their
executive of like actual programs that
they use so this is the state of bots
that was on telegram for the last year
or so and we created a platform that
made it really easy for those people for
anyone to create a bot to get
subscribers and to broadcast messages
that's one of the main use cases it's it
look it works just like email works you
gather to subscribers and you broadcast
messages or the second use case is to
create a Content catalog and this is the
way you create them you create a menu
and I'm going to show you how it
actually were actually works inside
there and these two use cases were like
the dominant ones actually this was
really interesting a lot of people
wanted to create those simpler BOTS not
like the ones and you were talking about
the conversation about the AI versus the
buttons at the first and we are like
living proof that you don't need a I all
of the time to create these experiences
and that inside this messenger it is
just an interface and if you're creating
a something simple in terms of function
users will gladly use buttons instead of
typing text I'm not saying that sex is
not like valuable there like a lot of
cases where you need that I'm just
saying that don't forget about the
buttons and visual interfaces they're
not going away anywhere so broadcast
subscribe get content it was proven on
telegram we chat has a big platform it
opened up the platform three years ago
and since that time they have I don't
know how you're familiar with reach out
but they have two types of accounts and
one of those accounts is actually a
subscription account so they actually
created in a separate type of account
just for broadcasting and it has
different types of restrictions based on
based on that a type of account line the
same thing viber public chats you just
subscribe to those things and you get
content so content consumption is really
essentially now kick and Facebook are
also going in the same direction and
catalog the user asks for content
manually what are the most like used
contents videos music wallpapers and
actually one of the main things on what
that we saw on telegram was adult
content actually a lot of subscribers on
that type of content one of the most
popular BOTS until apple banned those so
yeah if you're thinking about grove so
use case how you can download apps rabat
let me walk you through like I know that
not a lot of people in the US are
familiar with telegram and I just want
to show you how rich can a platform be
if the API allows it so like if we're
thinking about kick and Facebook going
like further and skype and all the other
platforms we can we can see something
from this so don't try to read this this
is
uzbekistan ian language it doesn't
matter just watch the red arrows so you
go inside the bot you press the start
button then you get this menu and this
bot was built on our platform so what we
allow the people to do is to create this
type of menu and specify how it is laid
out and then you can see that there is a
a button that's called Android apps
which you can press actually and when
you press that you get a selection of
like types of Android apps that you can
download and you can say like okay
messengers and you just get the apks and
you can download them right there no
need to go to Google store or anywhere
so like I hope that this content is a
like legal otherwise saligram would have
major problems but like whatever yeah so
let me show you another one listen to
music through bots totally also told
illegal so you go inside this also whose
biggest alia Bhatt you press Start and
then you have like this another menu and
you can press the am / 3 button and you
can select from Snoop Dogg or justin
bieber and of course it's Justin Bieber
so and you get the actual tracks the
actual mp3's and the most important
thing you actually can listen to them
inside telegram this is this is how it
works so yeah this is how Cadillacs work
the Third's interesting thing that we've
learned from doing Watson telegram is
that the open rates and the CTRs are
really high so
but not for this audience okay so yeah
the open rates and ctrs are really high
and the like right now if you talk to
developers and ask them what is the open
rate on your BOTS or like the content
BOTS those people won't be able to
answer your questions because the
messaging platforms don't tell you
actually there is no api to get that
information right now but you can use a
proxy for that and on telegram there are
things that are called channels and
channels are essentially a it's it's
it's a thing that you can subscribe to
that can send you messages and that's
the only thing that I it can do so it's
like a really simple bot but that is
managed through telegram and I'm calling
it the bud because I use a really like
broad definition of the words BOTS by an
entity in the messaging space in the
mess is in the messaging app that is not
your friend for example and that is not
as somehow in some way automated so what
we see from these is that they see the
open rates are actually fifty to ninety
percent so if we compare the open rates
to email which are twenty to thirty
percent right now we see that this can
be a massive and really interesting
marketing channel for businesses right
now because it's going to get saturated
in a few years like in one or two years
is going to get down to the same
percentages I think but right now the
savvy marketers are going to embrace
that and to use that and leverage that
and the ctrs are somewhere around five
to seven percent it's the data is is you
have it to take it with a grain of salt
but like if if it's a link inside a
message those are the CTR raise that
you would expect from a message if you
sent it to your audience and for for
facebook Messenger if you can send a
structured card with a button and those
buttons get the CTR rates like about
twice as high so it's it's really
interesting also in that regard the next
like how it was counted so you can see
this is a an account that was sending a
message that's linking to some kind of a
YouTube video and it's a channel about
linux so it has about 2,000 subscribers
and and they this particular message get
thousands and 200 views so you get that
open rate or like this is one of the
channels that sends you funny pictures
and it has about 3,000 subscribers and
that particular message got to in two
thousand six hundred views so yeah
pretty pretty good right now it's hard
to get those subscribers though so it's
not like on facebook where you can just
send out and buy your audience right now
there is really it's really hard to get
those subscribers but if you get them
you own them and that's the beautiful
part so those subscribers are really
valuable it's not like fans on Facebook
it's it's those people you get inside
their messaging app the most used app on
their phone and that's that is really
valuable so um yeah 11 another example
of thirteen thousand subscribers 707
seventeen thousand views and open rate
that's higher than one hundred percent
of what the how is it possible how
can i how they can be be more views than
the members and the answer is that a
telegram is really interesting in terms
of bought virality and how you can get
bots in like how you can get people to
know about your butt and that's one of
the topics that we've been exploring in
our discussion with our group and it's
really interesting because other
platforms are not building those tools
right now and it's really hard for Bob
developers to get the like general
audience to know about their BOTS so
there are we think about two forces that
help bud discovery on Saligram right now
which are not available currently on kik
or on facebook messenger and those are a
message attribution and group chats so
how message tribution works is that when
you send a message to somebody when you
forward a message from a bot to somebody
else that message gets tagged with the
bots name so it's really a and it links
back to the bot so if you're getting
something if you if you if you've got
some interesting information from a bot
and you want to forward it like a news
article or a picture or anything else
that you want to share it links back to
the bot this helps the bot pro and the
other thing is rip chats and group chats
were really valuable in terms like early
on when the bots were only starting to
spreading out its it's the way that you
can get like a lot of people to know
about your bot just by adding it to the
group you have to be really like really
careful with that because like groups
won't be the bot has to be valuable to
the group but the ability to bring a bar
to the group should be there and like as
blood developers we should talk to the
platform developers to the developers of
kick to the developers at Facebook to
say that we need those tools to grow our
audiences because without those we are
left only with our own audiences and
with the bots doors and the bots doors
are like not really that good
at promoting the but the bad stories are
not like app stores where people go to
for every search where people go for
every update and where people go to just
see like hey is there anything
interesting that i can download yet
unfortunately for the bots it's not like
hey what's interesting but can I talk to
today so yeah so how does so how does it
look like so this is a picture from the
previous slide I've sent it to my friend
lana del rey and it gets a it's gets
tagged by a clickable link that links
back to the bot and this is a group that
can have up to 5,000 people and you can
add the bar to the group and all members
can see it so yeah this is a really
great way to grow this the last thing is
bass plays best place for ads it's an
end of interaction don't push them it's
really invasive wait for the interaction
to happen and then provide value and
only after that you can place something
like an ad or promotion so going to skip
this this is this are the takeaways and
yeah sure sure so thank you very much
and if you have any questions
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
