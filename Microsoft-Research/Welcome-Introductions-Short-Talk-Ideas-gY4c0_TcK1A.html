hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading

lectures freely available
you
welcome to the 2014 social computing
symposium and most of you at this point
if you haven't met me you've at least
got an inbox full of emails from me
regarding all the various details of the
event we are delighted to have you here
how many of you for how many of you is
this the first time you've been to this
event all right so this is one of the
really nice things about the event is
that this is not the same people every
year saying the same things and it means
that almost everybody here is is new to
some piece of what we're going to be
doing when I talk to people who who sort
of ask who's going to be there and I you
know I tell them there are a couple of
things first of all we try to balance
this event about half and half people
who are practitioners and Industry and
people who are in academia or research
but but in almost every case is people
who are living in interstitial spaces
between those almost nobody here fits
neatly into one of those boxes and
that's not accidental that's what we're
looking for in terms of interplay the
other thing that we do is there there's
two basic requirements when we invite
people here the first is some of the
other organizing committee has to think
that you're one of the most interesting
most intelligent people working in the
space that you're in which is awesome
hey everybody here is smart and
interesting but the other piece in some
ways is actually more important which is
we don't invite assholes okay that
that's that sort of a core requirement
and use you can be particularly assured
than anybody who's here for the second
time or more his has proven that we were
not wrong in that assessment in some
ways so and by that I mean there
everybody here really is interested in
hearing from other people no matter how
good they are what they do they're here
because they want to learn stuff from
other people we do these talks yeah but
the talks are really just the glue to
get you all together and talking to each
other and making connections
there's going to be lots and lots of
social time lots of time to interact to
have conversations around the things
that we hear everybody who's talking has
been told you should not be talking for
more than 10 minutes i'm going to
reiterate that now so that they can hear
me say that so that they all know that
you know that they're not supposed to be
talking for more than 10 minutes because
you know none of us are good at that and
so we're going to try to keep that that
underweight we're going to do
introductions this morning but before we
do that I want to say thank you to some
of the people you see all the emails for
me you don't hear about all of the
amazing work that people are doing to
make it look like I'm doing all this
work so a lot of you met Sarah who is
out of the front desk if there are
logistical issues or things that don't
seem to be working right she's your
go-to person if you ask me i'm just
going to go ask her so you can you're
welcome to cut me out of that loop if
it's helpful there's Lily back there
who's our patron saint without whom this
event would not be happening there's the
whole list of people that you saw on the
organizing committee I'm not going to
try to list them all off because I'm not
going to remember them and then I'll
embarrass myself with somebody but we've
got a great group of people who did the
heavy lifting in terms of finding the
people to talk on the various areas
we've got MSR tech people here who are
doing the recording now when you checked
in you should have been asked to fill
out a form a release form on the
recording please please do that we've
put all of these online you may have
noticed when you registered for the
event that there was a link to the
videos from past events we keep this
small so that people can have meaningful
conversations in a sense of community
while they're here but we want these
talks to be able to get out to other
people that said almost every year we've
got one or two people who say you know I
want to talk I want to talk with this
group I don't really want that put up
online so for example I did an audience
choice talk a couple of years ago where
I talked about homeschooling my kids and
I said I didn't want that one put up
online not because I have a problem with
what I'm talking about but because I
have teenage boys and they
really didn't want me talking about them
on the internet okay I get that so
signing the release form does not mean
we will automatically put up anything
that you say or anything that you do
even after the fact if you go oh you
know what I shouldn't have said that and
I really wish it wasn't on camera we can
we can make sure that stuff doesn't go
online just let us know but it would
help enormously making my life easier
and Sarah's life easier if you could
sign in the form that would help us a
lot so if you haven't done that already
do that a little later their logistical
things there are restrooms down both of
these hallways if you if you need that
we will be doing breakout sessions later
and I'll point out the various rooms
that will be using for all of that and
now what we're going to do is our usual
introductions thing except i sent you an
email I know yeah I sent you a lot of
emails so you may not remember all of
them but one of them said you know come
prepared to pitch a short talk a
five-minute talk and tonight at the
torch club we're going to do these
audience choice talks and so I'm going
to pass this around and or actually
you've got one back there excellent so
we're going to start actually going to
start with the nail and what what I'd
like you to do is just say who you are
where you're from and then if you were
going to talk to us for five minutes
tonight what would you talk about I
would encourage you all to have
something available to write with I did
put post-it notes and pens on the table
or you could use your computer that
you'll need the post-it notes and pens
for when you vote for your top three
actually I'll give you five top-five
that you would like to hear tonight and
then after all the introductions are
done I'll ask you to turn those in will
have sarah &amp;amp; stacey collate them and by
lunchtime will let you know who's going
to be talking before dinner tonight okay

started hello

town there that I just hang on him for
about three weeks I'm John Resig I work
at a con Academy here in Brooklyn I'm

my head has been entirely on the talk
I'm supposed to give tomorrow about that
but I could probably do five minutes on
what it's like transitioning from
academia to hardware startup land I'm
Larsa Dean I'm from Hughes labs of
microsoft research
I would love to get a conversation going
around the area i'm not working in but
when i'm fascinated with which is how
social networking allows us to create
trust relationships with strangers which
enable new businesses like lyft air B&amp;amp;B

lot hi my name is Dimitri Williams I'm a
professor at USC i also have a startup
called ninja metrics where we just
learned how to measure influence among
people not in the score but in units and
I'd love to talk about what it means and
what cool things you guys think we could
do with it hi I'm Hillary Mason I'm
currently a data scientist in residence
at accel partners if you want to know
what that means you can ask me later if
I had to something I'd love to talk
about is I've been reading a lot of
writing from the very early days of
computer science as a field and there
was the sentiment at that time that the
purpose of computing was to augment
human cognition and we've sort of lost
that and so that's something I would
love to discuss I'm Gina an F I'm at the
University of Washington and Central
European University in Budapest and I
could talk about why disruption is the
wrong way to think about technology
looking at very old industries like
health care and construction
hi I'm Sylvia lindner for used to irvine
and fudan university in Shanghai I'm

about that and the hi I'm Ann light and
Northumbria University I work in the
area of designing social contexts I'm
talking later about sharing and shopping

it might be more of an interactive
session than a talk about enrolling
space and using drama with communities
hi my name is Hugo Leo I'm a taste
researcher I work at ebay research with
Elizabeth and we research brands and the
cycle of trend-setting I'm talking later
on today in the afternoon session about

trend-setting and I can also do a
five-minute talk on minimum viable
lifestyle so hi there Sebastian
Sebastian dating i'm currently at

of that it's really weird and really
interesting hi i'm millena agafea I'm a

erect the berkeley institute of design
and the invention lab i'm going to talk
tomorrow morning about how to take a
cross-section of Berkeley students and
get them from an idea to a working
wirelessly connected hardware product
that they can then you know throw over
the wall to Brady and Amanda and people
on that side that's really going to be
my focus I could
also talk tonight about how we're trying
to start a hands-on design program for a

will be speculative hi everyone my name
is Kate Crawford I'm a professor type
and based at Microsoft Research and at
MIT I'm going to be talking in about
half an hour about a big data ethics and
politics which is something I talk a lot

photography I'm Rena k well I'm with Oh
Microsoft Research fuse labs I to talk
for five minutes it'd probably about
bicycling and traveling I'm Ben Shapiro
from Tufts University and computer
science and education and I thought I
might talk about how we are building
tools to connect social computing to
engineering and engineering education so
I brought some prototypes and my
thinking was my talk would get you
excited and we could play at the bar
after and build cool stuff I'm Nathan
Matthias I'm a PhD student at the MIT
Media Lab Center for civic media and
I'll be facilitating during the Civic
session and I'd love to talk to you
about the festival of learning which is
this amazing today event we organize

Zuckerman I direct the Center for civic
media over at MIT I'll be part of the
civic media session tomorrow my favorite
Mongolian sumo wrestler is out of this
year's tournament with an ankle injury
so I have nothing to talk about but if I
were if I were forced to I would talk to
you about power sharing electrical power
sharing in the developing world and why
embedding mobile phone hardware into
appliances is the future hi I'm Steven

talk about the NSA where I visited last
year I'm Katie London formerly area
code games formerly Zynga and currently
at MSR as a researcher based here in New
York and also here at ITP as an adjunct
teaching humanizing data prototyping I
guess for a talk I could either talk
about I know if you guys heard that
today in an attempt to reduce traffic
fatalities de Blasio announced that auto

people so i guess i could talk about
taking humans out of the loop but i'd
rather if you come see me if you want to

this chat I made that blew up in France
in parts of north america called meets
faces which uses animated gifs with
real-time chat and is highly addictive
hi I'm gilad luton I do data science at
beta works here in New York City and if
I had five minutes with the mic I could
talk about a little obsession of mine
which is numerology and finding the
optimal length of a BuzzFeed article hi
I'm Tom Laird McConnell I'm with
microsoft research and lately I've been
rather obsessed I got an accordion for
Christmas and so I've been playing every
second I can and so given an opportunity
with the mic I'm going to talk about
accordions well I helped give them the
opportunity that Mike your play the
accordion is what I hope we can change
that they're really easy to find all
over town yay
yes I do absolutely okay I'm Sonny
Bateson I find accordions among other
things but I'm delighted to be here and
I'm actually just launching something
called the red thread which is uh hi
clay um it's so good to see so many
faces here and I'm most interested in in
the ways in which people connect and the
ways in which we connect around those
threads that are most interesting to us
to explore and that's what I will be
exploring hi I'm John de Matos I'm the
community manager for tech projects and
product design projects at Kickstarter
my boss one's called me a Sherpa which
is the best title anybody can ever call
you of course and I'm going to lead a
breakout session tomorrow about like
when if and how project backers are
affecting product development during
kickstarter projects good morning my
name is Tim Juan I'm the human partner
of a law office called robot robot and
Wang based out in San Francisco we're
working on the automation of legal
services in the past I was working on
experiments having to do with using
swarms of socializing bots to try to
shape social behavior I guess if I had
five minutes to give a talk I gave a
talk about designing a paper and pencil
old school role-playing game based on
Andrew Ross Sorkin is too big to fail
and or how the startup economy shapes
urban policy is something I've been
working on lately I'm Benjamin Mako hill
and I am at the University of Washington
and the department of communication and
if given the opportunity to talk I would
like to talk about features in
technology hardware and software which
are designed to be so bad that people
will pay to have them turned off
I am David Sasaki i work at Omidyar
Network and if Andres Mondrian and is
willing to help me out we could talk
about the 10 funniest memes from Mexican
social media hi my name is Alex Chung
I'm from beta works I'm currently the
founder of giphy the world's largest
gift search engine and your friendly
search engine and if i was to speak i
would speak about why gifts are popular
right now versus before from a social
technological and linguistic point of
view hey I'm John borthwick also from
beta woods and gosh every yet i'm here i
always think okay what have I learned to
the last year so just something very
recent I yesterday I had to sit down and
write a short post essay about how to
make a good cup of tea which is not as
simple as people think and and I figured
out i learned that there's actually five
tastes I was thought there was four but
there's this sort of mystery taste that
was discovered about a hundred years ago
and and so that was kind of intriguing
so I could talk about tea for about five
minutes hi I'm Tricia Wong I'm a
sociologist and I have a foot in
academia and fellow Berkman this year
and also fellow here at NYU thanks to
clay and also my other foot is in
consulting companies to be more people
centered and I'm not giving a talk today
cuz I just finished my dissertation of
seven years which is about yes I know so
excited but it's about strangers and how
what youth are doing online which is
talking to strangers most time so
Laura's I would love to hear your talk
but I would like to propose for Lily to
give a talk about how she met her son on
Facebook very interesting story if you
haven't heard yet you have to hear it
hmm ok that was a secret I'm kidding um
actually I wasn't going to give a talk
but um
this is the 10th year that we've done
this and I only know that because last
year we thought it was the 10th year and
then we had a little argument and we
said no actually the 9th year whatever
but I I guess the thing that I've been
thinking about is happiness and how to
surround yourself with people that make
you the best view sir I don't know so hi
I'm yet see chennai anthropologist at UC
santa cruz and i'll be speaking tomorrow
about the regulatory environment in
china particular with regard to food
safety i primarily do work on food and
medicine hand if given five minutes so i
talk about genetically modified foods in
china hi I'm Aaron Smith I'm a current
student here at ITP in a former intern
with the fuse labs and unfortunately I'm
not going to be around this evening give
a talk but if you want to chat with me
about sustainable building construction
and mycelium structures I could do that
i'm brian butler from university of
maryland's I school and I occasionally
wander over the business school and I'm
going to be talking tomorrow about food
and I guess the tag I'd put on in social
computing is large lobsters and victim
Commodore 64's the talk I could give
tomorrow let's see up to my cooking is
the differences in thinking how you have
to change how you think about your house
when you move from an 1890s house to a
1990s house and what changes and what
doesn't in the way we've built our
houses or not built them very well and
I'm Brian Keegan I'm a computational
social scientist at Northeastern
University a postdoc there we're comin a
bizarre and we work on like we using
social media predict elections and some
other fun things around that I'm
interested in the topic of how might we
use sort of historical long data like
data from the 1800s or before and
understand networks and sort of like
historical networks and what that might
say about how we structure society now
or how we might structure society
otherwise
that there we go do we have anybody who
came in while all that was going on that
that I should I should now call out no
okay so here's the deal what me well
okay so if I was going to give a talk
tonight I would talk about what it's
like to try for 10 years to pull
together a whole interesting group of
people in what the what the mechanics
and challenges are of trying to run an
event like this so I pulled that one
totally out of my ass so yeah it is that
so here's the deal last year we asked
you to put down five names I'm still
asking for five names but last year a
lot of people just said things like the
guy who said he'd talk about um that's
really hard for Sarah Kucera wasn't in
the room and doesn't know who the guy
who said that was right so if you don't
know the name go find it out okay get up
out of your seat or ask somebody at the
table do you know what her name is so
that you actually put names down so that
Sarah can actually collate these for us
so i'm going to give you about 10
minutes to do this so that you have time
to ask the questions right the actual
names down and then when you're done um
it when I call everybody back I'll just
collect them at that point so we don't
have to you don't have to take them
anywhere just hold on to them once
you've got them each year microsoft
research helps hundreds of influential
speakers from around the world including
leading scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
