you
thank you for coming thank you for
coming I'm very glad that Marjorie's
kobuk was willing to come over here and
give her presentation today major is
coming from the University of Missouri
and she where she is leading the center
of Elder Care and Rehabilitation
technology I won't cover all of your
background but I just wanted to say that
I'm amazed by the fact that she's
actually trying to use technology for
the benefit of people and and successful
in that so and this is what we're going
to hear about today so thank you very
much okay thank you well thank you for
having me and I hope that this is
recording correctly so I'm going to
share with you some of the work that
we're doing at the University of
Missouri and this is very collaborative
work includes a number of people across
many different disciplines that I'm
going to give you a list at the end
shows you a lot of the different people
involved I've also included in here
links to papers and we have a website
which i'm going to give you as well at
the end and so if you want to go back
and look at some of the details that
those are available so here's an outline
I wasn't sure whether I'm going to
actually be able to get to all of these
things depending on how many questions
we have but I want to first give you a
little bit of a motivation of how we got
started in this and then i'll step you
through sort of a broad overview of some
of the different aspects of the problem
that we've been looking at so to start
with we have a facility in Columbia
Missouri where I live called Tiger place
it's named after the University of
Missouri mascot we're all kind of Tiger
crazy in Columbia Missouri and about 10
years ago i had a nursing colleague and
nursing professor wander across campus
gave a talk in the college of
engineering looking for collaborators
now at that time they were
interested in developing this new
facility called Tiger place and they
were working with an architect they were
exploring different possibilities and
and Marilyn this is Marilyn Rance Mike
my nursing professor colleague knew that
she wanted technology to be part of this
facility but she didn't know what it
should look like and so she came looking
for some new ideas so Tiger place ended
up opening in 2004 it's actually a very
interesting partnership between a
private corporation it is it was built
and is operated by America incorporated
which is a Missouri company but there's
a partnership with the University in
particular the nursing school went out
and found Americare as a partner the
nursing school operates a home health
agency and employees the clinical staff
at Tiger place which has some great
advantages for us in terms of doing
research it was really set up to be
become a bit of alert a living
laboratory if you will as a result of
that so Tiger place now has 54
apartments and it really was designed
for Aging in Place from the very
beginning in fact it required two rounds
of state legislation in the state of
Missouri in order to allow Tiger place
to open in its current configuration and
really be a true Aging in Place kind of
facility so there's fifty four
apartments people can stay there through
the end of life if they need services
the services are brought into them so we
have about 65 residents in a one-time
Tiger place which span this elderly
population age almost everybody has at
least one chronic illness and there's a
great number of them that have multiple
chronic illnesses and so part of the
issue there at Tiger place becomes one
of how do you manage this instance of
all these chronic conditions there are
some cognitive problems there are
certainly lots of physical problems we
try to keep the residents as socially
active
as possible so there's lots of
activities for them to do so as we were
working with our clinical partners we
eventually came to use this graph as
kind of a motivation for what it was we
wanted to accomplish with the technology
our nursing partners have told us that
if you look at a typical trajectory as a
person ages you'll see this sort of red
stair-step fashion where somebody will
go along on a plateau for a time until
something dramatic happens and they drop
down pretty dramatically to another
level lower level until the next big
thing happens and they drop down again
and our hypothesis was that if we could
go in with a well if we could first of
all detect that decline the beginning
the very beginning of that decline or
even better yet predict when that
decline was likely to occur that we
would have a small window of opportunity
at which an intervention could be
offered and we could then change
literally change that trajectory of
functional decline to look to something
closer like this dotted green line some
people call this squaring the life curve
well so we looked at this and as an
engineering view what we want to do is
optimize the area under the curve and in
order to do that we need feedback and so
this is eventually came to develop this
idea of monitoring systems in the home
so we want to assess some behavioral
patterns using this in home sensing this
includes assessing gate and activity
patterns recognizing when those patterns
change so that we can use that then as a
sign of early health decline and then we
now have an automated Health Alert
system in place where we send out health
alerts this actually be ends up being
used as a clinical decision support
system and I'll show you how that works
so ultimately if you can in fact
square this life curve it gives you a
higher quality of life and also has the
potential of saving a huge amount of
money so everybody benefits so here's
our goal keeping older adults function
functionally active even if it means
playing polka music this happens to be
my mom and dad by the way my father just
turned 91 my mother's 88 they really do
play polka music but they've they've
lived together for over 65 years and as
a result they know each other very well
and they know when one one of them
experiences health problems or
experiences changes that might relate to
health problems and so this just
happened recently with my mother where
my father noticed some problem and he
convinced her to go and see the doctor
and she was able to correct a very small
problem before it became a huge problem
and she was able to she ended up
spending one night in the hospital but
she came home early after that so they
were able to fix this problem but of
course not everybody has the benefit of
living with somebody for 65 plus years
and so we'd like to have the the sensors
in place to be able to do this
effectively we probably can't do it as
well as my father can but we can
certainly do some things that will
identify some changes so I'm going to
show you how these health alerts get
used as a clinical decision support
system so here's the system that we have
in place at Tiger place and when we
started this we were using pretty simple
sensors passive infrared motion sensors
a bed sensor that is a little bit clunky
but gives you some information a chair
sensor is in a bed sensor can be
deployed on the chairs recliner chairs
for people that sometimes spend a lot of
their evening or their nighttime in a
recliner chair we have a stove
temperature sensor as well we have an
electronic health record that
we've developed as well that includes
some additional health assessments that
are not generally included in in this
population so we have a system that will
process the sensor data and recognize
when there are pattern changes and it
will generate an alert the alerts are
sent in the form of email to the
clinical staff and we rely on the
clinicians then to interpret the
clinical relevance of this alert and
they then do the nursing care
coordination effort and we also ask them
to rate the clinical relevance of the
alert and those are used then as
feedback into the system to give us
ground truth on what constitutes a
clinically relevant Health Alert so
here's some pictures of the sensors
deployed and Tiger place as i said we
use very simple off-the-shelf passive
infrared motion sensors you can see here
a picture of the pneumatic bed sensor
that we've been using since 2005 it's a
simple pneumatic strip that lies on top
of the mattress captures low normal and
high pulse rate and respiration rate and
also gives you bed restlessness this is
a typical network in Tiger place Tiger
place has different apartment sizes this
is what a one-bedroom apartment looks
like has about a dozen motion sensors
one bed sensor stove temperature sensor
and then a computer that logs this so
we've been logging data in Tiger place
now since October of 2005 with an
average installation time of about two
years if you really want to see the
longevity and how this affects how the
sensor data correlates to medical
conditions you really have to have them
deployed over a fairly long period of
time so you can begin to see those
changes we have one individual in fact
who's had a sensor network installed in
his home since november of 2005 so he is
our star participant we have lots and
lots of data on him and we and we've
seen some interest in cases of him
because we've seen him go through
knee replacement surgery and the
rehabilitation associated with that
we've seen him go through back surgery
and the rehab for that now he just had
knee replacement surgery on the other
knee and so we're going to see the rehab
associated with that so here is what an
email alert looks like now when we
started this out we couldn't find any
other work in which this had been done
or anybody specifically to tell us a
ground truth on what constitutes a good
clinically relevant Health Alert and so
we purposely cast this algorithm to be
very wide and give us it's very simple
algorithm uses some very simple
statistical parameters on on each
individual parameter which actually
correlates very nicely to the sensor
events that are captured and we wanted
to make sure that we captured all of the
events or at least most of them as much
as possible recognizing that they were
going to be a lot of false alarms and
now as I said we're also having the
clinicians give us a rating of whether
or not these alerts are actually good
from a clinical perspective and we
wanted to have a ground truth database
that had some good clinically relevant
alerts and some poor clinically relevant
alerts so that we could then use that to
go back and refine the the algorithms so
this is a very simple algorithm that
generates these alerts you'll see that
there's a link in here to a sensor
interface it's a web-based interface
that makes it very easy for the
clinicians to use they simply click on
that link and it pops up a window that
gives them the sensor data and the
context of what else is going on and
they can zoom in and zoom out and look
at different parameters and that helps
them then assess whether or not that has
some clinical relevance and of course
the clinicians also have access to the
electronic health record as well so this
is one
the displays that is in that interactive
web interface and this in fact is one
that was related to a Health Alert so
the way this system is set up each
column represents one day and you'll see
the hours of the day range from midnight
at the top to 11 p.m. at night and each
one of those red lines correlates to a
bathroom visit so in this crime you'll
see that this particular individual did
not have a pattern of using the bathroom
in the early morning hours you know
between midnight and 7 a.m. and then
suddenly develop this pattern of of more
bathroom visits in fact there was a
bathroom alert that was was generated
and it turned out that this individual
in fact had a urinary tract infection so
the clinicians were able to get the
person assessed identified that there
really was a urinary tract infection and
be able to get this person the right
kind of treatment so that that was
addressed very quickly so it turns out
that something that might be seemingly
as simple as urinary tract infection can
end up becoming quite complicated for
elderly people and it can present in
very interesting ways if it's not
treated very early which can then
complicate the DIA of the ultimate
diagnosis of it so it can actually give
people cognitive symptoms for cognitive
decline dementia symptoms if it can if
it progresses to a certain extent so
it's important to get these kinds of
situations recognized early and treated
early so that they can be resolved while
the problem is really small so that's an
example of a case that was caught so the
second link that's shown in here then is
the link that the clinicians click on to
provide feedback and they're asked to
give a rating one through five of
whether or not that's a good clinically
relevant alert versus a poor clinically
relevant alert
I said we use that for future refinement
of the algorithms so yes so they alert
this message says that this increase in
bed rest and less when they click on the
on the
let URL they will see the same graph
that you just shown us Wow no they see
the one that has to do with that I'm
sorry the one I showed you doesn't
correlate to this alert but no they
would show they would they would see a
different graph but but the one that I
showed you here is one of the things
that they can see in that sensor
web-based interface to the relevant
graph to the to the specific toys that
they just now get access to the to the
sensor data and they now try to dig what
is oh yes that they there is a kind of a
default position that we give them that
is based on the day that the alert was
generated and the time period over which
the alert was generated so we have when
we did this study initially we had
alerts being detected based on a 24 hour
period and then just looking at the
nighttime hours and then looking at the
daytime hours and so the the system is
designed to pop up the appropriate time
window but then it relies on the
clinicians to dig a little bit further
and see what other features of what
other parameters they want to look at
and as I said you can zoom in and you
can zoom out and look at different time
periods if you want to see it in a
larger context the clinicians so the the
web interface was developed iteratively
with feedback from the clinicians and a
lot of the way we set this up was driven
directly by what they said they wanted
so for instance that the default is a
two-week window because that's what they
said they wanted yeah and then example
what is before
fire
well the way the algorithm is set up it
uses both the the mean of the previous
14 days as well as the standard
deviation and there was actually if you
go farther back in this particular
individual there were one or two
nighttime bathroom visits and so that
that's just the way that this parameter
happens to be set up
as I said it's a very simple algorithm
okay so we did this study as a
prospective study for one year this was
funded by the NIH and we looked at we
actually ran it as a test with an
intervention group in which there was a
set of people that this was a relatively
small group of people was about 20
people in each group but it was written
written as a controlled experiment where
we had people receiving the health
alerts and then a control group that
were not getting any health alerts and
we were able to show that we had in fact
statistically significant differences in
the health outcomes between this control
group and the intervention group now I
said here that they showed up after year
and in fact some of these differences
showed up after six months which I felt
i found was particularly stunning I
might also point out that the residents
a tiger plays because of the fact of the
way this nursing care coordination is
delivered the all of the residents a
tiger place get really really good care
probably better than they would get
anywhere else and so it was stunning to
me to see that we could add this really
simple algorithm with relatively simple
sensors and that we could still see a
and a statistically significant
difference in the health outcomes
between this control group that's
already getting really really good care
versus the ones that we just added this
other little piece on top of with the
technology so it showed up in this case
on the gait parameters and also in the
grip strength this is some of the
experiments that we did for actually
doing the measurements to assess the
clinical outcomes but one thing yes
staff and the patients the residents
know who's in the control
yes they do yeah I don't think that that
affects the treatment though but yes
they do know the stuff is the same stuff
the treating told me yes medical stuff
is the same and there's some stuff yeah
that's right the only difference whether
they get this automatic alerts or not
yes that's correct yeah and in fact at
the end of this one year study it was
the nurses that said we believe in this
so much that we want to put this in
place for all of the tiger place
residents that have sensor networks
installed now as a matter of a practical
thing we we only run about 25 or so
sensor networks at any one time because
we're doing this you know on a
university research group so the
logistics of that is about what we can
manage but it but we could in fact do it
with everybody and the clinicians would
be happy with that they really like the
clinical alerts but but what we found is
that in fact because we had cast this
very wide net that about half of those
health alerts were false alarms now in
part that's because we started out we
were over time we were tweaking the
algorithm a little bit and when we
started out we really had a lot of false
alarms and we were able to reduce that a
little bit but overall about half of
them were false alarms but nonetheless
we were able then to use that database
that we collected to refine the alert
algorithms and see what we could do so
one of the things that we wanted to look
at that sort of an obvious thing is
instead of looking at a single parameter
one by one what happened if we looked at
a multi dimensional feature vector and
so this is one of the things we started
to look at in fact i'm going to show you
here a couple of examples that was done
by one of my master students where we
wanted to look at the difference between
doing domain knowledge only versus
something that involved training data
and so we looked at a fuzzy pattern tree
which did not involve any training and
then an SVM that does use training data
and and in the end after looking at this
we at doing some feature selection
and so forth we ended up using these six
features which turned out to be quite
significant in fact a lot of them have
to do with nighttime activity this turns
out to be a very promising way of
looking at this as well so here's what
that six dimensional feature space looks
like as a pca reduction now this was
another hypothesis that we had was that
these normal days the non alert days
would sort of form a cluster in this
feature space and that the abnormal day
is the ones that would justify an alert
would in fact be outliers to this
cluster and that's kind of what that
looks like although you can see it's not
completely that way there's some some
red normal days they're kind of a little
bit outside but that's kind of what
we've got so we set up this fuzzy
pattern tree to look like this except
that the or operators here we're using a
jager operator such that if you had a
little bit of a change here and a little
bit of a change here a little bit of
change here that it created a cumulative
effect that would generate an alert so
it's not Justin or the way it's listed
here and then we also did a svm and
here's the results that we got
interestingly almost exactly the same
results between this domain knowledge
only no training involved system versus
the SVM was there a question it was a
question about the slide on the points
how they look in the
see a space and says how do you select
the normal day
I think they're a lot more normal
well so this is based on the feedback
that we got from the clinicians and the
ratings so when I'm showing you here out
of all these health alerts that were
generated some of them the nurses said
were not clinically relevant and so
those are the ones that show up is the
normal days these are actually the false
positive days versus the coupons for
across individuals yes okay so these are
all things that the original log would
have fired on and then you yes that's
right yeah that's right yeah so as I
said about half of them originally were
false alarms so we got up to
classification right here of about
eighty five percent I think this is
still a very simplistic look at this and
there's a lot more that we can do oops
did something just fall off oh sorry I
thought I lost my microphone so I think
there's a lot more that can be done here
this was sort of a first stab to show
that that in fact is makes sense and we
have some other things that we're
working on next to be able to refine
this further let me show you another
picture here which is taken from one of
the retrospective analysis using the bed
sensor data so I mentioned that this bed
sensor produces these low normal and
high pulse and respiration rates and and
this is an example of an individual that
had an ER visit at the end here that
shown and then a hospitalization and in
fact this is a ninety six year old woman
that ended up dying very soon after she
went into the hospital but you can see
the changes in the sensor data patterns
leading up to that hospitalization ER
visit we went back retrospectively and
ran the alert algorithm and what we saw
is that we actually would have generated
an alert 40 days before that emergency
room visit so I you know who knows
whether we could have done anything to
have changed the ultimate outcome but in
fact we would have generated an alert 40
days before that ER
is it so it shows the the potential for
capturing this kind of physiological
data and in particular bed sensor data
so what I'm going to show you next then
is our take on a different bed sensor
something that captures in fact
quantitative sensing quantitative pulse
and respiration so this is built by one
of our grad students who went to a
hardware store came back with twenty
dollars worth of supplies and put
together this hydraulic bed sensor which
is basically a tube of water it actually
works better if you put it underneath
the mattress which is nice it's very
non-invasive and this is the kind of
signal that you get from this hydraulic
bed transducer so it captures the
superposition of the respiration and the
ballista cardiogram so you may be
familiar with the electrocardiogram that
ballista cardiogram is the mechanical
effect of the electrical pulse of the
heartbeat so it's literally the
mechanical effect of the blood flow as
it's pulsing through your body and it
kind of mirrors that electrocardiogram
signal and we've got several different
algorithms for processing out the pulse
data i'm going to show you one of them
in particular here we've done a little
bit of modifications to it will now come
up with this design that's actually a
four transducer design that's located
like this across the bed so the sensor
in fact hits you and the idea is that it
would hit you about your upper torso
area and there's four of them so that as
you roll around at night you know it
increases your chances of being on one
but in fact you actually can sometimes
get really good signals out of all of
them so here's an example that's taken
from one study where you can see the
filtered reading now we've now filtered
out the respiration so that you're
seeing just the ballistic cardiogram
effect
and you can see the ballista cardiogram
the characteristic ballista cardiogram
signal that you get from this so this is
what the ballista cardiogram looks like
and they actually call this as a i j k l
now so it's labeled somewhat similar or
analogous to the electrocardiogram but
this main peak is called the J peak and
so this particular algorithm then is
designed to try to identify the jay peak
of that signal after the respiration has
been filtered out and we extract some
features from each of the peak you can
see the features that are run there we
then run a clustering algorithm on it
looking for two clusters the idea is
that the smaller cluster would contain
the jay peak and the larger cluster
would contain the rest of the peaks and
you see there's there's a several small
Peaks involved in there but there's only
ideally only one large peak oops
and here's an example of some heartbeats
detected using that algorithm the ground
choose is captured using a finger sensor
so you can see what that looks like and
then the little circles up on top show
the jay peak that has been detected
using that algorithm there's other ways
of processing this of course we have one
algorithm that operates in the frequency
domain and just captures the actual
pulse rate but the nice thing about this
is that by identifying each individual
peak or each individual heartbeat you
also get this beat to beat interval and
you can see what the distribution looks
like and you can see here what you get
as a beat to beat interval basis on the
hydraulic bad sensor versus the ground
truth system and so we're in the process
of now of incorporating that a hydraulic
bed sensor into our health alert system
so that that can become this additional
more finely grained data to capture for
health data in fact we've just finished
installing 15 systems in Cedar Falls
Iowa in a 100 year old building which is
assisted living and we're getting we're
in the process of finalizing a design of
an embedded system for this hydraulic
bed sensor but that's going to be
installed there as well so let me give
you a couple of case studies from Tiger
place I have a colleague who is very
interested in seeing how this can be
applied to cognitive problems and other
mental health problems such as
depression and so I'm going to show you
a couple of instances of that and it
uses what we call this motion density
map and this is set up as that previous
bathroom visit map is set up where each
column represents one day and then you
have the vertical access going from
midnight to 11pm and here the color
shows the density of the motion sensor
readings so the motion sensors that we
use
will generate an event about every seven
seconds if there's continuous motion in
the room and in the area of detection
and that can be used as an artifact to
determine a sedentary kind of pattern
versus a more active what we might call
puttering kind of style and so you
actually get a measure then by
processing as a density number of events
per unit time you get it a measure of
how sedentary or active a particular
individual is that's based on the color
the black here indicates the time away
from home which is also captured and so
for a healthy individual you'd like to
see virtually no activity at night which
indicates that they're sleeping really
well and then a healthy individual
usually will have a pretty consistent
time will their wake up and the
consistent time that they go to bed here
you see the black regions that coincide
to eating in the common dining area so
breakfast this individual does his own
lunches this corresponds to the evening
meal and then Tiger place has a movie
theater and so the the evening hours are
probably when this individual goes out
watches move a movie in the movie
theater so here's a couple of examples
then of capturing this kind of data for
depression and dementia so this
particular individual had depression and
dementia both you can see what this
pattern looks like in July and and then
as this exacerbation of these mental
health conditions occurred the
individual withdrew and you can see
what's really particularly stunning here
that's basically stopped leaving the
apartment but the individual is
ultimately treated and then sort of
returned back to what was a more normal
case for that individual
here's another example that also was
depression again you can see although
this person had depression it was
managed by a geriatric psychiatrist then
there there was some personal additional
personal losses in this for this
particular person and this person
stopped eating stopped going out you can
see a pretty dramatic change and then
ultimately after intervention was able
to get back to a more normal life
pattern we also have a computational
algorithm for capturing the actual
pattern changes so there's some
individual features that you can capture
from this but we also process it using
image texture features to try and
capture the overall pattern of this as
well and that is also then can be used
to determine health changes so let me
also then jump to an area that you might
all appreciate because this one uses the
Kinect we have now in ten apartments a
tiger place we have gait analysis
systems we have a couple of grants that
are running concurrently that are
looking at vision data acoustic data
radar data when the Kinect became
available we all jumped on that went out
I mean everybody of course in academia
went out bought a bunch of connects it
started using them so this is being used
now in ten apartments for extracting
gait analysis information and although
it's not yet tied into the Health Alert
System i'm going to show you the kind of
gate data that we can capture from it
now we're doing this in this main living
area for these the people at Tiger place
and as a result of that we have a fairly
large area that we're trying to cover
some of these apartments span 25 30 feet
across and so we're not using the SDK
and we're not capturing the skeletal
model we're just processing data on the
depth imagery directly you can see some
examples of the segments
to person that's been pulled out of here
as the foreground and then we project
that into a 3d space to make a 3d model
of a person as they walk around and
we're capturing the gait parameters
directly from that so this is a picture
of a Kinect installed in one of the
tiger place apartments we have it
installed up close to the ceiling over
the front door we did some testing in
the lab to show that we got a little bit
better results if we had the person
walking towards and away from the Kinect
as opposed to walking laterally and so
we set this up to try and optimize our
walk so that they would be mostly
towards we have a long span towards and
away from the Kinect we've set this up
in tigard place so that the cabinets
above the refrigerator are all outfitted
with network ports and power and so
that's where we put the computer and
then we have a nice little conduit that
goes around here that hides the cable so
that it looks pretty discreet people in
Tiger place are kind of particular about
how their apartments look and we found
that if you want to put this in their
home it has to look nice otherwise
they're not willing to do this and in
fact the study here calls for these
systems to be in place for two years so
we can imagine if you know somebody came
to you and said I wanted to install
something in your home for two years
you'd want it to look nice too right so
here's a depiction of how the gate
parameters are estimated for the Kinect
system we use the lower part of the body
the legs and we're looking at capturing
these walks whenever possible so that
you can see here this correlation
coefficient that is captured as a person
walks so 1 sot one side of this like the
the peak here corresponds to the left
step and this corresponds to the right
step and I'll direct you to this paper
here if you want to look at some more
details
because these are running in the home
and it's very unstructured environment
we have to do some kind of a
segmentation on the actual walks and so
we pull out of all of this data of
somebody walking around we pull out
individual walk sequences based on the
straightness of the walk some minimal
walking speed as well as the number of
steps so that we can actually get what
are useful stride information so we get
from each walk a timestamp the centroid
of the person of this this segmented
person and then if we can possibly get
this dried data will get that as well
but you'll see here what happens is
because of occlusions we can't always
get this the individual stride data
these apartments are very cluttered you
know people have lots of stuff that they
want to keep in their home and they're
not going to just push it aside right
with you two if you install something in
their home you have to fit your thing
into their particular configuration so
in some cases we can get all four
parameters where we can actually get the
stride time as well as a stride length
in some cases we cannot and so we've
we've figured out how to deal with that
on the cases that we can't get all four
parameters so we in order to extract
trends of people remember we're looking
for changes in these patterns over time
we take a two step process here where we
first try and estimate a model of a
particular person's gait pattern which
represents here actually the height the
walking speed the stride time in the
stride length and so we do this model
estimation by fitting a gaussian mixture
model with the number of residents over
this 4d data that we capture so what's
shown here is a depiction that this of
course only shows two dimensions of
walking speed in the height for
are a resident that has a couple that
lives there and you see what happens is
that you typically would get for a two
resident environment you would get two
clusters one for each resident in fact
this particular couple has grandchildren
that come over and visit a lot and you
can see these these all these short
people our grandchildren and you get a
bunch of outliers as well that represent
other walks but what we're really trying
to do is capture what turns out to be
the center of these clusters one for
each of the resident and then that also
does a nice job of being able to deal
with a multi resident environment so we
then try to capture these trends of
these models over time I think I'm going
to point you to this paper and we're
going to gloss over some of this because
I see we're kind of running low on time
let me show you some examples this is a
single resident apartment again you have
lots of visitors that are shown here as
the outliers but you can see kind of a
depiction of the gate pattern that's
that's been modeled here and you can see
in here that these small black dots are
the walks that don't have any stride
data whereas the the blue and green dots
are the ones that have the stride data
but you can kind of see how this this
mode finding algorithm works here's an
example of that two resident apartment
again this makes it a little bit easier
because the wife happens to be much
shorter than the husband that isn't
always the case but if you look at this
in four-dimensional space that it
increases your air possibility of being
able to separate out these multiple
clusters so this is data that was
acquired over a seven-month period and
you can see there were lots of walks
that were captured during this time
period
so to estimate the trends we use a
sliding window with a step size of one
day and we compute the contribution of
each walk by looking at the likelihood
that it was from the resident we also
reduce the short walk the impact of the
short walks as you can see here and you
end up with something that looks like
this so this is the the trends for about
six months of that one case the first
one that I showed you now you can do
this over a different number of days you
can see the kind of noise that you get
if you do it over a two-day window
versus a 14-day window this is a
particularly interesting case because
this is an instance where this resident
was in the hospital due to surgery
during required surgery came back then
on at the end of October and you can see
where this is picking this up now the
first part of November with doing
intensive physical therapy and as a
result this gait pattern was changing
and you can see what's happening here
the the stride time is going down which
is good the speed is going up which is
also good as this person was getting
better and rehabilitating was showing an
increasing pattern that's better than
the other way around so this shows the
second case with the two residents and
this I did this just for the 14 day
window so in case in fact this first one
is the husband and this is the wife the
husband here in fact was eventually
diagnosed with cognitive problems and
what you see here is a decreasing speed
and a decreasing stride length so taking
shorter shorter steps which is
consistent with somebody who is
beginning to have cognitive problems
this is something that's kind of
interesting that that in fact looking at
gate changes will capture not only
physical problems but also cognitive
problems and that's exactly what we're
seeing here the wife in fact has
Parkinson's and interestingly enough
over this time period you do not see
much of a change you know she was
undergoing some treatment and apparently
it was pretty effective during that time
period so um yes you have a question
about this one I'm the president there
is on the right side to what the end of
the period seems if there is something
fun did you know what this corresponds
to I don't know what that corresponds to
your right this does seem like this is a
little bit of a bump here and I'd have
to take a closer look to see it's
possible that he was getting some sort
of therapy I don't know
okay well so let me just go to the last
area here that I wanted to cover we've
also been very interested in doing fall
detection because of course being able
to detect Falls very early and get
people treatment very early get them
help or get them up off of the floor and
so forth early also speaks to being able
to minimize the health risks and damages
so we've been looking at a number of
different non wearable detection modes
acoustic PIR radar vision also the
Kinect what I'm going to show you here
is some work that we've been doing with
acoustic arrays one of the problems that
you have when you try to do fall
detection for elderly people's you know
you don't want the elderly people to
fall we certainly don't want to ask them
to fall and so we bring in stunt actors
and we have the stunt actors fall but we
also want to detect them we want to
capture what would be realistic Falls
and so we have a whole protocol set up
where we actually train stunt actors on
how to fall like elderly people and
there's 21 different types of Falls this
in fact is my colleague Maryland ramps
who is training Adrian how to fall off
of a chair so that she looks like an
elderly person fall we give the stunt
actors mats though actually they don't
need them but we feel like we need to
give them maps so this is an example of
an acoustic array system that we've been
looking at it's a circular array of
eight microphones you can see it's it's
obviously designed by a grad student
nonetheless it works even though it
seems to be somewhat aesthetically
challenged but so the idea behind this
circular array is that we want to detect
these the location of the sound because
well 11 justification for doing that is
to use beamforming to improve the
acoustic process
sing but the other reason for it is to
be able to detect whether or not the
sound source came from the ground level
or whether it came from above the ground
level so if the source is from the
ground level it increases your chances
of that being from a fall as opposed to
being above the ground level and in
addition to that there is a acoustic
signature of a person falling down
compared to an inanimate object falling
down so again we have stunt actors that
come in and do these Falls initially
these were done in the lab and so this
is this is a list of all the different
Falls you can see that are part of our
suite of false some from a standing
position some from a sitting position
some from a lying down position and then
there's a bunch of different non fall
activities that we did to have the other
class and in this case involved making a
lot of noises that we could then look at
you know compare against a real fall so
we also wanted to add noise into the
environment to try and get to something
that looked a little bit more realistic
so i'm going to show you two cases here
where we looked at adding background
white noise only and then another case
where we added this white noise as well
as a TV interference and and we did this
using first of all a single microphone
without any kind of beamforming or
height taken into account we also did it
using beamforming and then we did it
with the beamforming and the source
height to be able to prune out these
extra problems so here's what the ROC
curve looks like and of course if you
look at this with the so-called clean
rate here you get very good results this
is in the lab of course but you can see
that in fact the best result here is the
beamforming with the height affect
nearly perfect results when you add in
the
EV interference it's not quite as good
although it still is pretty good there's
always the question of how good is good
enough if you're really going to deploy
this in a home setting and then there's
another example here where we actually
had stunt actors going into the targa
place apartments and we had set up the
the acoustic array system in there and
you can see what that system looks like
in fact interestingly enough we had
trained this system with matt with falls
that were performed in the lab on the
mattress and then tested them using the
stunt after data and Tiger place and got
got reasonably good results out of that
so here's our yes Oh mandate not to have
a person under test wearing
oh so why why did we constrain ourselves
to non wearable systems as a rescue like
this it's a lot of mentally invasive as
you can get so did you mandate it that
they would not
I have to wear it yeah so this is this
is an interesting question that we were
having this discussion earlier today
when i first got involved with this
because of the fact that this came from
our clinical partners it was really the
nurses that said let's not put sensors
on people they were quite adamant about
that they really didn't think that the
population that this population our
target population would be interested in
wearing stuff the problem is that this
kind of bears out with other other work
that we've done is that they're happy to
comply as long as they're feeling well
and as soon as they're not feeling well
then they don't want to be bothered one
of my clinical partners happens to be a
family medicine md put it this way she
said when somebody gets to be 80
something they do what they want and
when they get to be 90 something they do
it with an attitude you know they're
going to do what they want and you can't
coerce coerce them so we just decided we
were going to see how far we could get
with totally non wearable systems and
certainly you know a lot of people end
up experiencing Falls when they get up
in the middle of the night to use the
bathroom and they're unlikely to have
something on some wearable system on
during that time period so we wanted to
see how far we could get with totally
non wearable systems
and just I definitely agree with
the water club basically
the this company that developed
something which looks like a band-aid
which sheds all the electronics and all
the power and you can put it on for
about a week we just stick it somewhere
your buddy
this sounds like something that might
work because you know you don't have to
put it on go to sleep but even if it's
something like the watch you can't
imagine someone where it get bullets
so I guess to answer your question it
was sort of a mandate to us by our
clinical partners to look at totally non
wearable systems and so that's what we
focused on I get some grief about that
from time to time from other people in
any rate this shows some of the
individuals that have been involved with
this research over the years and I've
tried to highlight the ones that are
particularly contributed to this work if
you want to go back and try and pick out
their papers Eric stone is the one who
has been involved with the Kinect work
Dane Guevara is the one who did the
early illness alerts was set and David
worked on the bed sensor shuang I worked
on the motion density maps and Yuna Lee
is one who's worked on the acoustic
system but it's quite a
multidisciplinary group of people we
certainly couldn't do this work without
our clinical partners and they've
they've kept us honest in terms of being
able to do something that that certainly
respects that our target population as
well as something that would be useful
for them and so we've tried to make this
really driven by the actual problems
that and challenges that this target
population has so I'd like to
acknowledge our funding agencies much of
this work has been funded by the
National Science Foundation and NIH and
arc and there's the website if you're
interested in picking out some of the
papers most of them are online or
they're at places that like I Triple E
explore where you can readily get them
so thank you very much here's our
mission I'll end with mom and dad they
also garden so thank you very much
so are there other questions have you
thought about remote temperature sensing
um yeah so we were talking about that
this morning we've not looked at that
but I can see where that might be useful
do and what would you suggest as being a
technology sensing technology for being
able to capture that I talked about this
in one of the options might be an IR
camera let's say above the bed where
your head tends to be in a certain area
and then during the night it would
recruit your body temperature at a time
when you're not active yeah and actually
i might note that that the way our bed
sensor works in capturing pulse and
respiration it's very difficult to
capture that while the person is moving
around so because the restlessness ends
up showing up as a very high amplitude
noise and so in fact we also captured
pulse and respiration basically when a
person still but I can see where
temperature would be useful
did you another question related yeah so
some patients I assume were diabetic it
might be doing glucose tests during the
day and things like that do you take any
of this extra information that you might
have on some patients and try to add it
to the database well so this would be an
obvious thing to do would be to add in
data coming from the electronic health
record we have not yet gotten to that
point I do have a colleague of mine who
is now looking at this problem like a
data mining problem and so he's
literally looking at the the electronic
health record data which is really the
medical record data that the nurses have
access to as well as our sensor data and
looking for correlations that way and
certainly you could if you had medical
records you could incorporate that into
this general health alert system or you
could use that as a context we've not
gone there yet but you're right that's
the next obvious thing to do there's
another question
yeah in your clinical study did you
measure the effect of being in the
treatment or control group on the amount
of attention that the individuals
received from the nursing and medical
staff
you mean did the control group or did
the intervention group just get more
attention in terms of time compared to
the control group something like that
were the other way around I don't know
what maybe it could go either way I'm
just curious whether or not I you have
measures on on dad um I don't know that
we actually captured it in those terms
like the number of the amount of time
that they spent with each individual's
you know one might expect that they
would maybe spend more time with the
intervention group because of the fact
that they're getting these alerts and if
it looks if something looks suspicious
then they need to go take a closer look
for this individual which would maybe
necessitate them spending more time with
that individual I don't think that that
parameter was ever pulled out though
that I recall yes the question so in the
over the years you've assembled a lot of
interesting data than elearning rolled
like to play with but it is patient data
so there is some privacy issues
so how easy or difficult is it for you
to share data physically yes I get this
question all the time of course it would
certainly push this work forward if we
in fact could distribute it to the
machine learning community I'm reluctant
to do that because so far we're doing
this in relatively small numbers and up
until very recently it's all been done
the tiger plays at one facility and so
it would not be difficult even without
actual identifying data like names and
so forth it wouldn't be difficult to
make those correlations and so I'm
reluctant to distribute it we had talked
about being able to distribute it in
fact I actually have a proposal in
review that would would allow us to do
that because we would do some processing
to the data change the dates and and try
and scramble some things so that it
becomes harder to try and identify it
the other thing that that we can do now
that we've got this database on the
clinically relevant the words we instead
of distributing actual medical record
data we can distribute sort of a by in a
binary fashion does that alert
constitute a clinically relevant alert
versus not a clinically relevant alert
in fact it's a scale from one to five so
you could get some measure of the
significance of it from a health
perspective without really releasing
actual health data so that's what my
plan is to do if that proposal gets
funded will have the ability to put that
in a form that we hope will be at least
harder to identify at least I would feel
more comfortable releasing that then in
its current form
but yes we have lots of data I'm running
out of server space its way so then it
at this facility and Cedar Falls we've
got motion sensors we've got connects
and now we're going to have the bed
sensor as well so we are just collecting
a ridiculous amount of data so thanks to
