hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
so today we have well someone who really
doesn't need all that much of an
introductions and she's been here at MSR
doing a postdoc for the last year and a
half actively collaborating with folks
in the room so this is a moon moon de
choudhry and moon moon as i said is
doing a postdoc here right now she's
about a year and a half in she's really
just a pioneer I think in the field of
computational social science bringing
her background in computer science and
just a really strong curiosity and
interest in social science questions
since she's been here she's been
focusing on topics in the health domain
and I think that's mainly what we're
gonna hear about today but is interested
in lots of other domains as well I think
we'll see just a glimpse of that in your
future direction slide so please welcome
lumen thank you Scott and good morning
everyone I'm very excited to be
presenting here today and the topic of
my talk is going to be how we can mine
and analyze social behavior online from
different platforms and make a
difference positively on our health and
wellness so we are truly living in an
information era today whether it is
seeking information about our favorite
celebrity or our topic of interest all
it is sharing information with our
friends and family about small and big
happenings in our lives in fact one in
six people in the world today is an
active user of facebook as we constantly
usher into these really information rich
environments online presents in some
ways becoming a part of us so much so
that it is impacting the way we frame
our relationships and the manner in
which we interact act or express emotion
given all these huge explosion of data
that we are seeing around us there are
several new challenges and opportunities
to computer scientists for example how
do we share such huge large scale data
how to restore them and how do we build
models and methods in order to make
sense
of them on the other hand to social
scientists the web is providing a whole
new tool that is proof is enabling them
analyze people and their activities and
an unprecedented scale which was not
possible before in the midst of these
two mature disciplines a new domain has
been emerging and that's called
computational social science as you
would have imagined computational social
science combines computer science and
social science into improving our
understanding of people and their
behavior in the last several years a
growing body of work has been emerging
in this area looking at various facets
of human activity and behavior for
example what kind of social and
information rules do we play online or
how do we socially influence each other
how we form groups how network structure
evolves over time or how do we measure
the strength of our ties as manifested
on these platforms from an application
perspective researchers are constantly
interested to investigate how these
platforms are impacting a number of
different real-world phenomena and
contexts for example take the example of
crisis citizen journalism urban
informatics emotional expression during
political events or information
diffusion in the context of viral
marketing my research in this area has
been at the intersection of these three
domains social sciences data mining and
human could be reaction particularly my
broad interest lies in making sense of
people's behavior as expressed on the
different social platforms to give you
some examples in my PhD dissertation I
looked at questions involving how people
share information in the context of
interpersonal communication on these
networks how they form groups as a
result of such communication that
happens online and how do the
characteristics of share artifacts such
as media objects like images and videos
change or evolve over time in their
characteristics due to the communication
that happens around them in order to
answer each of these questions I often
resort to data mining tools and
techniques for example what kind of
predictive models can be built to answer
those questions
and what kind of analytic insights can
be gathered that can tell us more about
people's behavior online my end goal is
often to make a difference to the end
user which could be a single user or a
set of users for example improving
search and relevance for the end user or
to generally improve and streamline
their social experience online so how do
we characterize social behavior online
after all Mikey hypothesis is that there
are three core aspects to it the first
aspect being emotion so what are these
emotions after all psychology literature
defines emotions to be
psychophysiological reflections of our
state of mind in response to implicit
stimulii for example biochemical
reactions in our brain are explicit
stimulii for example our social or
psychological environment the second
core aspect of our behavior which is
also true online are our social
interactions which is a manner in which
we express our emotions our feelings how
we express our thoughts and form ties
and build bonds with other people around
us and the third part third core aspect
of online behavior is language language
acts as a vehicle or a medium that we
often use in order to express our
emotions or whether it is to form social
ties with other individuals online so
beyond elucidating core aspects of human
behavior through the three up three
things that we discussed emotion
language and social interaction we can
certainly begin to identify normal
patterns of human behavior among people
another key aspect that we can begin to
begin to mind and analyze from such data
are anomalies in people's our
populations behavior in other words to
say concerns or issues that may arise in
people's behavior over time and that's
the set sets the stage for this talk I'm
as I mentioned earlier I'm going to be
talking about how we can analyze and
mind our social behavior online and how
it can make a difference to health and
wellness of ourselves or our popular
and so forth and that is what this is
going going to be the structure of this
talk I'm going to be addressing the
question that I posed earlier at three
different scales starting from the micro
scale of the individual going to
organizations and finally to populations
which is the micro scale let us start
with the individual scale analysis and
mining of human behavior and let's see
what we can say about people's health
and wellness on that scale a core aspect
and a very common perception of use of
social media is that people resort to
these tools in order to share their
thoughts and feelings around really big
global happenings around us for example
the earthquakes in haiti or for example
the recent elections in the US another
fundamental aspect of these websites
which is actually not talked about so
much is that people use these tools in
order to express really personal
happenings in their lives for example
the birth of a child in the family moved
to a new place getting a new job or even
traumatic experiences such as meeting
with an accident or the death of a loved
one in the family people use all these
tools are to share their positive
experiences because they want to share
their joy with your friends family and
audiences where some people may even
choose to share the negative experiences
on these tools because they are hardly
looking for coping mechanisms by
connecting with people with similar
experiences are to receive social and
emotional support from others in a sense
what we are saying is that these social
media tools are kind of acting as a
window onto understanding people's
behavior around these big life events in
this particular talk i'm going to show
you the example of one big life event
that characterizes a lot of our lives
and that's the birth of a child looking
at Twitter data we are going to examine
how Twitter postings of new mothers can
reveal the kinds of behavioral changes
that these mothers are typically undergo
in the postpartum period compared to
prenatal period and why is that research
interesting this research can lead to
the design and deployment
of low-cost and privacy-preserving
systems and tools that new mothers can
use in order to keep track of their
behavior or to generally improve their
post part of health and wellness for
getting started on the actual work the
prime challenge is how do we
automatically identify these new mothers
right which leads that leads us to the
question of how do we even identify
automatically both events on Twitter for
that purpose we created an ensemble of
several different key phrases which
typically catcher as birth announcements
as found on online newspapers and you
can see some examples of that on the
table on the slide we went to the
Twitter firehose stream look for these
key phrases and different postings and
came up with a candidate set of posts
whose authors subset of which are likely
to be new mothers of course we own we
are only focusing on the female
population so we're an agenda classifier
on top of that in order to extract the
female users out of that show I just
want any how well do the kinds of
languages and traditional papers
actually translate
to Twitter because the police
opportunities are very different than
traditional for mobile
actually the birth announcements are
exactly the same I mean because they're
usually the online newspaper
announcements are short and dimensioned
the weight of the baby the height of the
baby and you know so-and-so was born to
so and so uncertain date with
grandparents so and so it's a very
structured thing that we notice it's
true on Twitter as well are you doing a
check various patterns on Twitter that
might be might be missing like maybe
some new sort of slang or abbreviation
Missouri answer refer to these terms
that might not be caught by dad ah I
haven't I mean anecdotal experience will
say that there is much slang and
especially bottom ends because it's kind
of a serious thing people don't want to
use slangs and that kind of stuff so
didn't spot those kind of things but
there are certain things that Twitter
specific for example it's a boy or girl
no one really uses that in a formal
birth announcement in a newspaper but
that's something we discovered from
Twitter but of course I must say that
this is not one hundred percent coverage
there are certainly phrases which we
have not captured and that's kind of
part of future work ok so we brand their
gender classifier and came up with a set
of users who are female users but of
course there would be noise even in that
because it could be non mothers who are
posting about the birth of a child in
the family and therefore we adopted a
crowd sourcing strategy on amazon's
mechanical turk we showed the particular
birth event posting to if every crowd
worker and in order to give them some
context we also showed them a set of
kenpo strings before and after that
childbirth posting in ordered so that
they can figure out if it's really a
mother or not we also gave them showed
them several other cues such as if there
was a picture of the person present on
the twitter profile and if there was a
profile description however we refrain
from showing any real name that was
reported on the on twitter or the
twitter user ID for privacy reasons this
exercise gave us a set of 85 users who
are validated to be new mothers we again
went back to twitter fire hose and
collected all of their postings over a
five-month p
did before the birth of the child and
another five month period after the
birth of the chat given all these
postings yeah image surprised 85 seems
like a small number it's over to come to
be rigorous but but in so if I just
strikes me as many fewer mothers that I
would have imagined posting it as which
one period do you have a sense for why
that that's because we wanted to focus
on a really high precision set of
mothers for whom we could actually go
and validate that there truly mothers
because it's the first work of this
nature we truly wanted to be sure that
these are new mothers are not include
knives and especially because we wanted
to come up with an automated mechanism
we wanted to see how good this automated
mechanism is if you want to expand out
later that were Twitter firehose based
on those phrases over a two-month period
in two thousand eleven candidates from
others were sent to the Turner's like uh
oh I see um i think it was around 500
okay so how do we measure the behavior
of these new mothers given the postings
that we have derived for their prenatal
and postnatal periods we define four
categories of of measures the first one
being activity it had measures such as
volume which is the average normalized
levels of posting over any given day
replies which is a proxy to social
interaction of the mothers the question
number of questions that they asked the
links that the share which is a signal
to their information sharing behavior
and so forth we had enough two measures
of ego network a number of in links and
out links which correspond to the number
of followers and followers on Twitter we
had four measures of emotion positive
effect and negative effect which were
derived using the popular cycling
district lexicon call loop and we had
two other measures of emotion activation
and dominance which correspond to the
intensity and controlling power of
emotion respectively and they were
derived using the a new lexicon the
fourth set of measures was around
linguistic style and linguistic styles
are particularly interesting because
they reflect people's behavior and the
way they they express language in the
context of their social and
psychological environment we again used
Luke in order to derive 22 different
linguistic markers that are typically
found in English language for example
pronoun use function words certainty
inhibition quantifiers and so forth let
us start with our empirical study to
start with we wanted to see these
mothers on an aggregated manner how did
the change in their behavior and
postpartum compared to prenatal each of
these charts that you see here
corresponds to a measure that we just
discussed earlier we also wanted to get
a sense of how these mothers are
different from the average Twitter user
and for that we define a set of users
which we call the background go hard
it's a set of randomly sampled 50,000
users from Twitter who made postings on
the same time period however did not
have any evidence of giving buzz to a
child in the time period that we study
so here
so here the red line corresponds to the
mothers and the green ones correspond to
the background cohort what we notice
that is that these mothers are showing
differences which are statistically
significant in the postpartum period
compared to prenatal for example volume
seems to go down and so does positive
effect negative effect goes up use a
first-person pronoun goes up whereas
activation and dominance go down
together however that doesn't seem to be
the case with the month with the
background cohort yeah cover the women
have just given childbirth their
timelines are allied to the date of the
childbirth and what is the background I
might oblige me it's the same timeline
that we considered for the mothers like
five months on left of the blue line and
five months on the right and the
background cohort we looked at their
postings in the same 10-month period but
these all women who gave birth from the
same day like the timelines are aligned
before number chopper yeah yeah well we
basically flat in all of his manager
I look at something like volume yeah
there's increase the green line that's
definitely moving around yes so there is
we actually I would have pointed that
out anyways that speakers in general if
you look at Twitter the volume of
posting is always going up in general
people are always using it norm yeah
it's yeah it's it's a general trend on
on Twitter however if you look at some
of the other ones which are not
dependent upon volume they kind of have
a flat trend okay so this slide tells us
that mothers in general change a lot
however the question really is some
mother's probably change more than
others right and being able to identify
and track the behavior of those mothers
can have a lot of implications in their
health and wellness for that purpose we
moved on to individual level comparison
these two heat maps that you see here
correspond to two measures positive
effect and activation it's the RGB scale
which means that blue is the smallest
value red as the highest and the yellows
and greens on anything in the middle and
the white line corresponds to the chant
time of childbirth anything on the
rioters postpartum anything on the left
is prenatal it turns out that our
conjecture is true in fact for some
mother's we notice that their positivity
and activation both go down in the
postpartum period we wanted to quantify
these changes in these mothers
statistically and see that if these
small set of mothers are truly different
from the rest for that purpose we
computed effect sizes using Co hence T
and this table summarizes the number of
mothers with small medium and large
effect size changes across the different
dimensions of behavior behavioral
measures that we consider here if you
notice we have bought a quarter of the
mothers who show large effect size
changes in terms of activity which is
probably intuitive because after
childbirth it's a very busy time for the
mothers so intuitively they are so
overwhelmed with the new
responsibilities that they are not
having enough time to go to social media
and do postings however if you see the
number of my
who show large effect size change for
emotion that's a relatively smaller
number we were curious about the set and
we went and look for their trends across
the all the different categories of
measures becomes the day here and it
turns out that these 12 mothers actually
show large effect size changes across
all the measures that we have considered
in this study what are these mother's
post about yeah the numbers there are
they the numbers of number of mothers
who first had a small effect on
productivity
small effects exchange a few if ya
should the Rose Sunday 85 yeah they
don't they don't because we consider the
threshold even for the small effect size
changes so some people were not
satisfying that that threshold yeah
otherwise they should sound route 85
okay so what kind of postings do these
mothers with large effect size changes
me we wanted to take a look at that
qualitatively and we notice that these
mothers are actually posting about
feeling lost about loneliness they also
complain about insomnia and the even
youself derogatory phrases such as worst
mother horrible monster mother and so
forth however if you look at the
postings that these mothers with small
effect size changes are making that's
not the case in fact they seem to be
pretty excited about this new change in
their lives and they seemed to be
turning to social media platforms in
order to gather information about
different questions they might be having
around bringing up a newborn we wanted
to quantify these differences in the
postings in a linguistic on an honor on
a quantitative manner based on the
language that these mothers using the
postings what we did was we extracted
uni grams or single words from all of
the postings of these mothers of the
three cohorts mothers with large effect
size change small effect size change and
the background cohort and we looked at
for each unit on the degree of change in
postpartum compared to prenatal period
so it turns out that for more than a
quarter of the uni grams for the mothers
with large effect size changes they show
statistically significant change in
postpartum that number seems to be much
lower compared for the mothers mothers
with small effect size change and
actually really low for the background
go hard so what are some of these top
changing uni grams that is reported in
the table below and over here we see
that for the mothers with large effect
size changes a lot of these words are
actually emotional in nature and if you
look carefully the positive emotion
words seem to be going down and usage
whereas the negative emotion ones seem
to go up in usage however that is not
the case with the other two cohorts that
we are studying
based on that we finally framed a
technique which we call the greedy
differencing analysis the goal of this
technique was to identify the span of
language that would make these mothers
different from the rest in terms of
these unigram usage what we'd what this
particular technique does it's starting
from the top change including ramp for
the mothers with large effect size
changes it eliminates one unigram at a
time and at every iteration it computes
the language distance using a standard
similarity metric like Euclidean
distance with the mothers with small
effect size change and the background
cohort we had two very interesting
findings on this exercise we found that
with the elimination of a little over
one percent of the Uni grams the models
with large effect size changes become
similar in their language use to the
mothers with small effect size change
and with the elimination of a little
under eleven percent of the Uni grams
they become similar in the language used
to you the background go hard this
exercise tells us that there are there
is a lot of discriminatory power in the
language used by the mothers as well as
the range of behavioral measures that we
saw earlier in being able to forecast
and know in advance which mothers are
likely to show more changes than others
in the future and this led us to this
question which is if what if we could
predict these kind of changes in advance
for that purpose we came up with a
prediction set up first of all we
expanded our data collection and then we
came up with a binary classification
framework which is a supervised learning
framework and it predicts the labels are
across two classes of mothers the first
one being models showing extreme changes
along a certain behavioral measures
beyond a certain threshold and the
others and a set of mothers who don't we
used five volt cross-validation for the
purpose we particularly we represented
each mother as a vector of the different
behavioral measures that we saw earlier
we eliminated feature interaction and
redundancy with principal component
analysis and then we chose the support
vector machine classifier with a radial
basis Cornell in order to predict the
labels of the mothers across the two
classes
we train our first model using prenatal
data alone we consider three months of
prenatal later before the reported child
birth of the mothers and our data set
and try to predict their directionality
of change that is for example their
volume would go up or down three months
into the future after childbirth the
performance of the model is reported in
the table we notice that we are doing
pretty well we have more than seventy
one percent accuracy for predicting
extreme changing mothers with a
reasonably high accuracy and recall
across the various measures we notice
that the Linguistics tells perform
particularly well for example pronoun
use yes in the offline world are doctors
able to predict discussion before
they've actually as far as I mean my
reading of the clinical literature says
that doctors can provide warnings like
soft warnings if the mother had a
history of depression in the past
because prepartum depression is actually
the best predictor of postpartum
depression exactly so this is kind of
capturing if they were evidence of
depression vulnerability in the in the
prenatal period and if you look at the
other measures for emotion we notice
that we are doing pretty good we have
pretty good results for negative effect
and activation the performance of this
model is shown in the ROC curve that you
see on the left but as you can see
there's a lot of room for improvement
right and we wanted to explore how we
can improve the performance of this
model we wanted to investigate that the
initial couple of weeks of behavior of
these mothers right after childbirth
probably have a lot of signals and q's
there which we could leverage together
with the prenatal data in being able to
predict what is going to happen three
months from from that point in time so
we trained another model which uses the
prenatal data and an optimal training
window depending upon what measure it is
of one to two weeks
after the reported childbirth and gives
what the performance of the model goes
up and up to eighty percent and as you
can find that from the ROC curve on the
right side of the screen as well so what
are the implications of this research we
have been able to identify a set of
fourteen to fifteen percent mothers for
whom we see very extreme change in their
behavior for example their volume of
posting goes down negativity goes up
positivity goes down and sodas
activation which is the intensity of
emotion and dominance the controlling
power of emotion also goes down the use
of first-person pronoun seems to go up
whereas that of third and second and
third person pronouns seem to go down
and actually a lot of these changes they
are not instantaneous they are actually
pretty consistent over a long period of
time in the postpartum period and we
also saw that how we can make use of
prenatal data in making a prediction of
these changes ahead of time if we look
at psycholinguistic literature it will
tell us that these kind of markers that
we observed of behavioural change they
are actually known to be associated with
depression or other kinds of mood and
affective disorders and people the
second interesting finding is that the
fourteen to fifteen percent mothers that
we identified showing these extreme
changes they seemed to align with the
reported statistics of postpartum
depression which is an underreported
health concern found in some mothers in
the United States this research gives us
hope that possibly we can use social
media tools and the kind of behavior
remind from social media in the
development of unobtrusive grab
diagnostic markers of behavioral
disorders particularly postpartum
depression in case but hopefully in the
future for other kinds of disorder as
well and that that led us to the thought
that maybe it can be extended to other
affective disorders such as depression
PTSD that a lot of the troops experience
when they're back from deployment
seasonal affective disorder of course we
live in Seattle so we have to study that
elderly depression
teen suicide and so forth I'm going to
take the example of one particular
mental illness which is pretty common
among people across the range of mood
disorders and that's major depressive
disorder a challenge in this kind of
research
teen suicide for example so are you
posing that this method
just monitor the general prep Elizabeth
conditions were like Google Flu Trends
or are you actually proposing with teen
suicide seems to apply that you would
presumably sort of honor that as we
would actually want to intervene it I'm
not prevent the activity so do you think
that that is actually feasible given the
nature of Twitter and the somewhat
anonymous a journalist accounts like how
would one actually go about if you
observe through method like this someone
who's at risk how would you actually
track that person down and identify them
are there practical and ethical problems
were doing that so actually I I'll cover
most of it throughout the talk but very
quickly there are many ways to intervene
I'll show one demo of one tool that
could make that happen so you could do
interventions in two levels one is the
level of the person you give them soft
intervention cues that they can use to
modify their behavior or you in forum
for teens you inform their parents or
other responsible people who can
intervene and take an action the other
level is to talk to doctors and
hospitals and people who are already
known to be at risk of of these
conditions the doctors could intervene
and and help them this from there
because most people I don't reveal their
true contact information or I
Twitter councils house on a personal
level it has to be opt-in like if
someone would opt in to volunteer in
this kind of a program where their
Twitter feeds could be analyzed their
public in nature anyway the ones that we
have seen here so there isn't as much of
the ethical conduct iva see concern
however there is an ethical concern and
that's what I'm saying opt-in if someone
option to choose the twitter handle
hopefully they're okay with this kind of
handles which is completely anonymous
and automated by the way i can return to
those questions to our sign of the top
so a challenge in this kind of research
involving mood disorders is it has a
little bit too what what mary was was
asking about is how do we have gold
standard labels or ground for data on
people who are actually suffering from
clinical depression for that purpose in
this work we resorted to crowdsourcing
arm technique we went on to amazon's
mechanical turk and we asked the crowd
workers to take a survey which is the
standard depression evaluation cycle
psychometric survey that a lot of the
psychiatrists use and then we also ask
them a few questions about the
depression history of that was present
finally we asked them if they would like
to opt in and share that twitter
username on on the on the cast that they
were taking and we found around forty
percent response rate and they were made
aware that this is only going to be used
for research purposes in an anonymous
manner and these were the owners of
public profiles on twitter give it we
obtained a set of little under of 500
people in this manner we went on to
twitter using the twitter handle and we
collected all of their postings over a
one-year period dating back from the
reported onset of depression if it was
present and if it wasn't it we just went
back for the one year from the time that
took the survey so what are some of the
differences in behavior across these two
cohorts we summarize that in this slide
on the left side of this slide we
studied the diurnal patterns of postings
of the depression class and the non
pression class for the non depression
class will notice that it's actually
pretty intuitive as we go through the
day the volume of posting generally
increases whereas for the depression
class we notice that the peaks of
activity actually happened late in the
night and early in the morning and
throughout the day the volume of
activity is actually pretty low if we
look at clinical litters a clinical
literature it will tell us that actually
eight out of 10 people suffering from
depression also have symptoms of
insomnia and nighttime internet activity
is a common common feature of those
kinds of individuals we have similar
differences on a range of other measures
as well for example volume it seems to
be monotonically going down over the
one-year period before the reported
onset of depression for the depression
class and so the do the replies whereas
the negative effect and and use of
depression language which i'll come back
to very soon seemed to go up over the
one-year period before the onset of
depression however that these things
don't don't seem to be the case for the
other cohort let us look at from of the
kinds of language that these the users
of the depression class Hugh's we
categorize them across various themes it
seems that these users actually talked
quite a bit about their symptoms for
example fatigue imbalance mood swings
nervousness and so forth they seem to be
using social media as a discourse tool
in order to express their emotions
discuss about coping mechanisms or
connect with other people with similar
experiences the in fact have pretty
detailed information about treatment as
well and they seem to be talking about
antidepressant dosage levels like very
accurate ones like 150 milligrams 40
milligrams and so forth medication
psychotherapy information and so forth
and finally they broadly talk about
relationships and lives in general with
the focus on talking about about the
religious involvement
representative the sample
you have because I guess I wonder are
the people who are willing to share
information on Mechanical Turk about
their mental health history perhaps
people who are also more likely to be
very public in discussing these kinds of
things
like Twitter that's possible however one
thing that I should mention is when we
asked people to take the depression
survey we just mentioned that it's a
general survey it's not a depression
server because we did not want to creep
people out and then people who completed
that beyond a certain threshold which
meant that they were probably having
depression we showed them the next page
which was a set of specific
self-reported questions so no they were
not given the information that this is
that in openly inviting people to share
information of their depressed we did
not do that so I guess there's less of a
bias but it's possible that it says some
bias I guess I'm sure you talked about
the reported date of onset of depression
which implied that that was last on the
second page yes but so were the people
who squirt that they were depressed on
the survey but then in the self-report
part didn't self-report is having a date
of diagnosis and wait how did you truly
did we did not consider those data
points does seem like they like people
who might have different but there are
people chose other methods to avoid not
participating in it which is when they
answered everything but they did not
provide us a Twitter handle which is the
actually the rest of the almost the rest
of the sixty percent of the population
so they were certainly people like that
and we still paid them because it was
not a restriction for them to take the
survey people test
having depression to self-disclose had
right different types of language use
Twitter that might represent that might
be harder to detect right a lot of those
people actually didn't even share the
Twitter handles so it was probably
difficult for us to go back and check
that but that's a very good point I
Muradin what kind of language these
people just before the onset of the
depression did you worry about to come
this is before the onset the one he
appeared before the reported awesome oh
so they're talking about opposition and
drugs and that's just before the author
yeah actually some people do like just
before the answer they are actually
thinking about if there are
antidepressants that other people might
be suggesting to them based on their
symptoms so yeah yep diagnosis before
they know they
on well sometimes this is what the sad I
mean this is the date they knew that
they have depression that's probably
their diagnosis onset might be different
like sometimes people don't even know
what the answer is so that's a little
difficult to find find out okay so like
it it for the new mothers for this case
that's also we wanted to see if we could
actually predict the time based on these
these social media postings and the
different behavioral measures whether or
not which people are likely to be
depression vulnerable we came up with a
number of different features based on
the different behavioral measures that
we had particularly once which would
take into account the trends of the year
long period of postings so we treated
each behavioral measure as a time series
signal and over that we computed the
mean frequency the variance momentum
which is a rate of change over time and
the entropy which is which is the degree
of uncertainty or volatility in the time
series signal often measured again we
trained a support vector machine model
on that we obtained a fairly good
accuracy of little over seventy percent
and the performance of that model is
shown in this ROC curve we notice that
the depression terms are performing are
pretty well and so are the linguistic
styles so tying it all together the
initial study about the new mothers and
then the latter study about major
depression and individuals I believe
that this research can lead to the
design and deployment of new kinds of
smart intervention techniques and early
warning systems which could be given to
individuals in a completely private
manner for example a smartphone
application in order to enable them
reflect on their behavior and through
subtle interventions enable them make a
positive impact and their lives I'm
going to demo quickly a tool on that
light called moon Frizzles a lot of you
have already seen that during tech fest
last week and the goal of moon phrases
is it
it looks like this and the goal of moon
phrases is to enable people reflect on
one of the goals is to enable people
reflect on their behavior over time so
we look at the Twitter postings of a
user like like we have Oh up there and
use an analogy of the lunar phases in
order to visualize the trends of their
emotionality over time so what that
means is if the moon is more illuminated
on a certain day the person was more
positive the orange moons that we see
reflect that the postings volume was
high which was more than three postings
and people can even click on a certain
moon and see what kind of postings that
the made on a certain day and evaluate
what led to a positive effect or a
negative effect for that person on that
certain day the nice thing about this
tool is that it provides a very subtle
intervention mechanism in enabling
people reflect on their behavior over
time for example identify episodes where
they were very positive or where they
were very negative with that thought I
will move on to the next part of of this
presentation which is the organizational
part how ya ask question about about the
moon phases so you mentioned that there
are lots of different kinds of signals
that you could detect into the Twitter
signal that might be indicator
depression like the day insomnia for
example have you thought about how to
package together all those different
signals
whether that is understandable right I
mean we are still working out the
details on that about what kind of
signals we can show if it's a SAR
smartphone app that will be useful to
the people at what kind of interventions
we should make one Frizzles the very
initial very preliminary tool that just
shows the emotionality and linguistic
style usage and we wanted to do a user
study and see what kind of reports we
get back from people about what signals
are useful but those are great points
eventually we want to incorporate all of
that into the tool so moving on to the
second part I will go through this very
quickly it's about how we can analyze in
mind behavior at the level of
normalization and what it tells us about
health and wellness so the emotional
health of an organization or the
effective climate is very important
because organization it's related to the
organizational outcomes and its
operational procedure organizations
often want to know how their employees
are feeling in general around different
changes in company policies for example
product releases and so forth are
generally what are the factors behind
their joy and satisfaction success and
failure and so forth with that goal in
mind we leverage an enterprise microblog
which is a twitter-like tool called
office talk that was adopted by people
at microsoft we collected several
hundred thousand postings over close to
a year period and looked at the kinds of
effect of positivity and negativity that
is expressed by people through those
postings I'll highlight two main
findings of the work on the top picture
there we noticed that across the
organizational hierarchy individuals
tend to make some some kind of effective
accommodation that is the adapt or
change their positivity and negativity
when they're interacting with someone of
a different status level particularly
individuals with higher status seem to
be more positive and less negative
compared to their baseline levels of
effective effective expression on the
microblog he also noticed that in
we'll show a kind of strong
dissatisfaction towards after ours work
as is shown in this plot where we see
that positive effect actually shows a
sharp drop after the end of the typical
work day putting it together the
implications of this work lie in the
design of some kind of an effective
dashboard yeah
is it I just want to interpret the size
of it is it that the people who are
posting it you know seven to nine p.m.
is it that the people who are happy are
not posting or that they're still
posting but now they're posting negative
more negative than positive like is it
that people become more negative in the
evening or is it that only the negative
people oh you mean like do the same
people who become we actually know that
these are aggregated volumes so it's not
clear if it's the same person or a
different person but that's a great
point okay so microsoft recently
acquired Yammer and in that light it
seems particularly interesting in
putting together something we can call
an effective dashboard a tool that these
organizations or the HR management can
use in order to explore completely
anonymously and an aggregated fashion
the transient of emotion of the
employees within the company there is
also an opportunity to make a similar
kind of tools at the individual level
where individuals it could connect to
individuals various social feeds within
the workplace and it could tell them
about their stress and anxiety levels in
in the day-to-day course of work and
thereby help them make an impact on
health and wellness and finally the
third part of the stop which is going to
be about how we can mine and analyze
behavior at the level of the population
and what it means for health and
wellness in that scale there's been
quite a bit of talk and research on that
space so Google Flu Trends we all are
aware of it what Google does is it takes
into account and such queries around flu
and comes up with a measure which shows
the vulnerability of different regions
of the world to flu within a short
period of time into the future can we do
something similar on that light which is
macroscopic population trend of mood
disorders and populations that is
particularly important because affective
disorders are a very very serious
challenge and public health more than
300 million people in the world today
are affected by depression and it is
also responsible for
the more than 30,000 suicides that
happen in the US every year on that
light we moved on to Twitter and try to
first begin with an understanding of how
we can model the effect of large
populations we notice an interesting
culture on twitter twitter which is that
people use mood words as hashtags at the
ends of the postings which kind of
serves as a supervisory signal
reflecting their emotion in the context
of the tweet so the examples that we see
over here express a variety of different
emotions like grumpy excited lazy and so
forth using this exercise this one is a
phenomenon that we observe we we went
through an exercise in which we use
crowdsourcing techniques and a number of
inputs from psychology literature to
come up with more than 200 moves which
are shared on Twitter in this way so how
do we represent of the characteristics
of human behavior at scale using these
modes we moved on to a psychometric
instrument that is popular in psychology
literature that's the circumflex model
circumflex model represents a motion
along two perpendicular axis the first
one being the unpleasant chasm scale
which is the valence or positivity
negativity and the calm and activated
scale which is the intensity of an
emotion we plotted all the 200 moves
that we obtained from Twitter on that
circumplex and we notice a fairly equal
distribution across the four quadrants
next we wanted to see what how can we
characterize people's social behavior at
scale using this kind of a psychometric
instrument I would highlight the main
findings on the slide on the top so
complex that we see here it shows the
usage levels of the different modes so
the bigger the squares are the more use
that particular mode is we notice that
it's no longer equally distributed
across the four quadrants in fact people
on Twitter seem to be expressing more
negative and low intensity moods than
others with a little bit of high usage
of very high valence and very high
activation modes we overlay the same
circumplex this time using based on
people's social activity which is the
number of postings to make on
and it turns out from the circumflex
below that individuals who are more
socially active tend to express more
positive emotion which is shown by a
greater number of larger squares on the
right side of the circle and the other
given these findings can we
automatically identify the effect in any
arbitrary post this gave rise to our
second research question in which we
developed an effect classifier which
would detect in any arbitrary tweet one
of a variety of different affective
states that a person likely is
experiencing this is the performance of
the classifier the precision recall
curve we noticed that we are doing
pretty good and for a number of
different more valent states for example
joviality fatigue serenity and so forth
now that we know how to model the effect
of large populations how can we leverage
these findings in coming up with an
index just like Google Flu does flu
trans do which would measure the
depression levels and large populations
we call this repression index to be
social media depression index and what
it does is that it's given by the
standardized difference of the volumes
of depression indicator forced to the
volume of force which are not depression
indicator we wanted to know how good
after all is this is this index in terms
of actually capturing depression levels
in large populations we obtained actual
data on depression statistics from the
Centers for Disease Control and the
National Institutes of mental health and
the heat map that you see on the left
left side of the slide it shows the
levels of depression in the 50 states of
the u.s. we have a similar figure on the
right side however here the depression
levels are given by our measure which is
the social media depression index
visually we see that there is quite a
bit of correspondence across the two
maps and on quantifying it statistically
a least square regression fit gives a
correlation of more than point five
which is pretty high if you wanted to
explore more fine-grained and know
attributes of population scale killed
scale depression which is not given by
CDC data sometimes on one hand we notice
that women tend to be more depressed
almost as twice compared to make a
better man a fact which is also
supported by CDC data we notice that
over the course of it did for both men
and women depression seems to be higher
late in the night and early in the
morning than during the day and finally
we also observed that there is a
seasonal component depression which is
that in the in cities in the US with
more extreme weather conditions with
extreme more more extreme variations and
climate the depression rate seems to be
higher in the winter than it is during
the wind during the summer weaving all
the pieces of work together I want to
highlight the potential that we have in
using these postings and and fine grain
activities of naturalistic data that
people post and share on different
social media platforms and how we can
make sense of that and make an impact in
people's lives at multiple scales in
terms of their health and wellness and
the opportunities are not just limited
to health care health and wellness are
very important attributes in in in terms
of social political and economic
prosperity and I'm going to take the
examples of three different domains
where these findings and these kinds of
methodologies can be extended for
gaining other insights into other kinds
of real-world issues the first one is
finance and economics in a previous work
of mine we looked at the commenting
pattern on blogs around tech companies
and try to use them as predictors of
stock market movement for those
companies obtained from Nasdaq going on
those lines in one another more current
work we are working with a capital
markets group at microsoft and putting
together what we call a social media
aware trading strategy which would
derive a bunch of different signals from
social media and use them to make
predictions of the S&amp;amp;P index over time
we also notice that the kinds of signals
that we obtain from
social media tend to be indicated of
broad macroeconomic indicators as given
by the michigan consumer confidence
index the other domain is that of
politics and we are increasingly aware
of the important role played by social
media during the elections in 2008 and
actually more so a few months back on
those lines being put together and
elections 2012 page back in November a
piece of this tool used the effect of
classifier that I discussed earlier in
revealing how people were feeling along
the two presidential candidates and more
recently being also put together the
State of the Union page which again made
use of the effect classifier that we
talked about earlier in revealing
people's sentiments around a variety of
different political issues and the third
a third domain that I'm going to be
talking about where these kinds of
methods and and insights can be useful
is that of journalism are together with
colleagues at Rutgers University we put
together a tool which we call the
sorcerer or seriously rapid source
review it was a tool that journalists
could use in order to discover relevant
and useful information around breaking
news events so this would mean the
tornadoes that happen in Joplin a few
years back a key aspect of this research
was that it was a we built the first of
its kind I witness classifier what it
means is that we looked at the postings
and the social behavior of individuals
who were involved in a certain breaking
news event and we made a forecast of
whether or not that person was actually
on the ground they're having a
first-hand experience of the event and
the journalists that we talked to found
that piece of information to be
extremely useful and something which is
not provided by our current state of the
art as we move towards the end of the
stock I want to reflect and think about
the variety of possibilities that we
have in terms of making use making sense
of the behavior based on naturalistic
data obtained from different social
platforms today in the future I hope to
be working towards how we can leverage
these findings tools and methods and
insights into bill
a healthy and sustainable society with
the terabytes and petabytes of
information that are being generated
every day I hope you'll be walking
towards how we can make the world a
better place to live in by leveraging
these findings for example it is whether
it is healthful living becoming more
responsible individuals socially and
economically are moving towards striving
towards a more sustainable future I
believe that the breadcrumbs of
information that we can arrive from
these platforms about people's
activities has a lot to offer I'm going
to highlight four different domains and
kinds of questions that I'm interested
to answer in that light in the future
the first one being public health
engineering from what I've been doing
before I'm broadly interested in under
what conditions in a network can we make
people adopt healthy behaviors it leads
to several other questions for example
what are effective models of disease
spread in these networks and social
media how can we will predictive models
that would tell us fine-grained
information about mental health seeking
behavior risk of suicide or health risk
behavior or how do we design effective
feedback techniques or persuasive
technologies and that we could give to
people which they can use to make a
difference to their health and balance
the second domain is that of environment
and with a lad I'm interested in how we
can make use of people's activities
online and under what conditions we can
encourage people adopt sustainable
living within that our questions of
interest include how we can mine
information related to sustainable
health and sustainable living from
social media what are the models of
influence that we can use in order to
encourage people adopt those behaviors
and how does this kind of a behavior
actually propagate in networks on social
media the third domain is that of urban
planning are generally urban informatics
and within that I'm interested in
exploring what IBM calls its March
cities are more generally safe for urban
neighborhoods with increased safety
decreased social isolation and increased
mobility which gives rise to the
questions such as how do we model
mobility of individuals based on social
geo temporal
that is shared online and what are the
in what are the implications of that
kind of mining of data in terms of city
infrastructure for example traffic
management public transport systems and
so forth and finally a domain which is
very close to my heart that is education
and how we can leverage our findings and
insights about people's behavior on
online networks into encouraging kids
find education more fun on that line I'm
really amazed by how kids find these
massive online multi-player games to be
so sticky and I believe that the social
paradigm we have underlying those kind
of systems can probably be leveraged in
order to adopt the pedagogy technique of
learning through playing and making
education more fun to kids in the future
beyond all these domains I want to
highlight and bring reference of Harry
Sheldon who was a cycle historian and a
prominent character in Isaac's Isaac
Asimov's famous foundation series and a
typical ad and a characteristic
attribute of Harry Sheldon was that he
could make pretty good forecasting and
predictions about lot sorts of people
into the future broadly my future
research is geared towards building a
general model of behavior of this kind
where we can leverage the social geo
temporal and other naturalistic data
that is constantly being shared online
and make inferences about real world
phenomenon and real world issues and
contacts and so forth however unlike a
CEO of science fiction stories probably
a crystal ball which is an Oracle and
tells us everything about the future is
probably not possible right because the
mat underlying these complex social
systems is very sensitive to the initial
conditions and the errors that we made
to start with are likely to snowball and
lead to wildly different outcomes if we
are looking at really long-term
processes however I believe that seven
years from now we can think of something
like a social weather forecasting model
that would take all this humongous data
around people's activities behavior
emotion language and so forth around a
certain specific domain and
make predictions and forecasting with a
certain degree of confidence of
short-term into the future and I would
really look forward to that happening in
the future finally I would acknowledge
all my quarters collaborators and
everyone else else who has supported me
in various ways in Microsoft and
otherwise and with not on come to an end
of the talk I would be glad to take any
questions yeah this entry based off of
people's public twitter name
and it seems like that's a very narrow
section population so kind of how you
get out of just the people who are
privacy and sensitive kind of social
media level mounts
I mean I guess things are changing
people are constantly using these kind
of tools twitter is public but Facebook
actually has a greater population in
terms of if you are talking of
representation it will also depend upon
the kinds of tools and techniques we
build in order to intervene and make an
impact so at the personal level it could
be opt-in or it could be someone who is
okay with with sharing or if the sharing
process is extremely private that no one
else sees that people might be okay with
that that would take care of the
representation issued to a certain
extent and we can go to larger
populations where things are not public
and then there is the other option of
looking at collective scale trends which
can be aggregated and therefore
completely anonymous and say
governmental agencies can make use of it
aggregating the people who choose to
have a better glue then if you're
aggregating you can look for other
sources of data like search which shall
definitely our general web views which
has way more penetration than Twitter
have there been sort of count studies a
Twitter and answer them to classified
what is that
who are between clusters it has a good
yeah Hugh has a bunch of different he
keeps on doing surveys on that it's
about eight percent of u.s. population
the ethnicity distributions are a little
bit skewed in terms of the actual
distribution of ethnicity in the u.s.
there are differences that I think there
are more women on Twitter ah that's I
think pew does have data on that but I'm
put I'm personally not aware but when we
did the student droids blacks Hispanics
they might need it we're just you mean
the more blacks Hispanics I'm provide
quite a lot more on
oh so it's slightly skewed so it's not
the perfect representative sample but
you can think of it as a modern-day pew
right they know the right way to sample
people they go out and sample people and
then those guys are asked to opt in and
share their social feeds that can be
Twitter or something else and then you
kind of in some sense carved or sampling
and representation issue in some way and
still get enough naturalistic data to
make inferences with fair more of
confidence myers-briggs
there are a bunch of for legal status
perverts to introverts like to get on
Twitter first I never post on Twitter
but I don't know how to generalize from
ya know I think there is a there's a
there's been a bunch of personality work
around social media use I think you'll
find all kinds of all the big five
dimensions of people there but certain
personality dimension has a
characteristic behavior like I think
people who are extroverted to like more
posts so comment more on Facebook stuff
like that actually trying to do some
sort of a match study of twitter users
with similar putting users because for
instance but you I think you important
that active Twitter users tend to be
more positive low activity Twitter users
tend to be more negative and you assume
that non Twitter users are credibly
depressed or relation here yeah that's
right yeah that's a great point i think
this year in cscw there was a paper on
these are the folks from michigan who
looked at facebook users and non
facebook users so people are certainly
looking and those kind of things though
not quite from the effect angle yeah I
know for the one of the Twitter studies
use the hashtag
get the sediment have you looked at
whether or not you can get some of that
just from the natural language
processing so that's what the classifier
does so it trains on those hashtagged
postings and generalizes it so now if
you input any arbitrary Twitter post it
will tell you the distribution oh yeah
yeah so coming back to gina's point
again if you wanted to get a more
broader sample applying something
email yeah I have I mean but practically
making that happen unless people opt in
to share their email feeds that may be a
little too sensitive I guess and there
are other kind streams of data that can
be combined for sure like search or web
browsing behavior and I've been pretty
much a lot most people use a search
engine that has pretty good penetration
in the population and then kind of using
the social feeds in conjunction wherever
available in order to improve the
predictions and the for castings yeah
the offline world who are more positive
into more popular did you find the same
thing
on Twitter like for people who used more
positive emotions in their tweets did
they have larger sets of followers they
did but then I think the challenges to
draw a correction of causality in a name
it's purely correlational I mean because
this is observational data it's hard to
say what causes what but there's
suddenly a correlation I didn't show
that here but it's on the paper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
