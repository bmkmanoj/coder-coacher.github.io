Sciences Redman imagine if you could
take a regular webcam and use it to make
rich 3d scans of the world around you
the data could be used as input to 3d
printers in augmented reality games
essentially any scenario that would
otherwise require custom depth camera
Hardware so together with my colleague
Christopher Freeman an interactive 3d
technologies Cambridge we have developed
a system that we call Moana fusion which
enables us to make detailed 3d
reconstructions of the world using just
commodity webcams hi I'm Christopher and
here I'm holding a regular Microsoft
webcam that has been in the market for
several years without any modification
whatsoever and that can point is at the
scene to obtain a rich 3d reconstruction
in real time that shows up on the screen
there and behind me it works by tracking
the 3d position of the camera and
together with the live I'm RGB input
stream we are able to obtain a depth map
for every frame and every depth map is
integrated into a 3d model so this means
that every depth map actually improves
the 3d model over time so what we see
here is on the top left the live video
feed from Christoph's web camera and
even though there is no Kinect camera in
this room we're getting a dense depth
map every frame and on top of it by
utilizing the camera pose information
and this depth map we get a very
detailed 3d reconstruction there is seen
in this viewport and as Christophe zooms
in and out of the same you can notice
the details that the scene is capturing
for instance you can see the tiger being
richly reconstructed against the shoe
and because it's a color web camera we
can easily overlay the color information
on top of the 3d surface information to
get a visually pleasing and very rich 3d
data this you can send right away to
your 3d printer and you can use it in
augmented reality games what we have
enabled is easy to use software
framework that will plug into anyone's
camera and will enable you to build rich
3d models of the world around you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
