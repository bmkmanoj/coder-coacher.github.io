every year to make techfest happen
between our researchers and our program
managers and all the support staff it's
really an event that the entire division
as a whole gets involved and gets behind
when we first started tech best I
actually wondered whether whether we
would even get very many employees to
come the first year I was just
flabbergasted so many people showed up
tech fest is important for microsoft
research because it's a jumping off
point for great conversations
each year we get about 300 technology
demo proposals submitted from there we
spend the next couple of months looking
at what's happening across all of our
different labs could really find the
best of the best and in the end we pick
about 150 of them to bring to redmond
and to put into the show floor the
importance of doing state-of-the-art
research is white pearl for continued
l-dopa company sometimes lean back its
immediate and sometimes impact is over
the long term I always get excited when
I you know go around to the different
booths I get a chance to see the
research project and and there's always
something that surprises me there's
always something new that I didn't even
know we were working we treat technology
transfer much more as a social process
then as a logistical and mechanical and
process based one in the end we try to
balance out really amazing technology
but also really looking for what are the
things that will change people's mind
the other thing is that people just
simply couldn't imagine it's possible to
do and now it's possible to do it's
really valuable for us to be able to
have our researchers interact with our
employees to really give them a sense of
what we're doing but also to learn from
the employees or what's important what
are they working on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
