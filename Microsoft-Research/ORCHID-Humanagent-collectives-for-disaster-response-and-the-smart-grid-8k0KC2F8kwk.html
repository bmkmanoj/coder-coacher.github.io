hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in

academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
so high it's my great pleasure to
introduce alex rogers from the
university of southampton we've done
some pioneering work in generally AI and
autonomous multi-agent systems and today
he'll be talking about human agent
collectives yeah okay thank you for
inviting me yeah so so what I want to
talk about is it's a project that's sort
of kicked off about a year ago in
Southampton it's on human aging
collectives and it's a it's a sort of
combination of some AI and some human
interaction and from the discussions
I've had some this morning it seems to
be lots of sort of commonalities between
some of the work you're doing so it's
sort of a quite interesting sort of see
whether we're we're things sort of fit
into this sort of space so the project
is relatively largest EPSRC funded
program grant so with sort of extra
contributions is perhaps of 10 million
it's three academic universities so
Southampton so we do Nick Jennings and I
do sort of decentralized coordination
agent based systems Luke Moreau does
provenance and we took talk a little bit
about that in a second Oxford this steve
roberts and information engineering so
bayesian machine learning and then
nottingham tom modern who does
human-computer interaction so the
essence of the projects which are would
talk about some of the aims in second is
it's just try and sort of this
interaction trying to build systems in
which humans and software entities
interact and increasingly we sort of
sort of seeing more and more of these so
you think of sort of applications like
crowdsourcing any sort of machine
learning application where you're
getting input from people or you're
automating some process and people are
part of that process we're interested in
what are the the fundamental principles
that you need to sort bear in mind if
you're going to build those systems so
machine learning human computer
interaction the agent based computing in
terms of handling incentives handling
individual preferences and how to put
all those together into it
system and the key thing is we'd like to
try and sort of do some of the science
source or try and do some of the sort of
the underpinning theory but then also
sort of demonstrate these within some
particular application domains so the
project has a has a number of
applications will so as a number of
application domains many of them sort of
map onto things that I know that you're
sort of interested in here so the first
one is smart grid so the smart grid is
very sort of interesting application I'm
going to show you some of the work we've
done in in home heating optimization and
for us really the the interest is that
these are systems where potentially you
can automate a lot of the process but
people are at the core of them so if
you're automating a home heating system
you're coming down to one of the human
comfort preferences of the householder
there's lots of preferences in here in
terms of car use we've looked at sort of
pricing models for for add electric
vehicle charging so that you've got to
handle the incentives of the individuals
you've got the questions where if you
ask someone Wendy when do you want to
use your car and you're going to have
some sort of pricing mechanism based on
that how can you incentivize them to
give you the correct information and if
you've got the correct information how
can you optimize the system using that
so so the smart grid is very interesting
setting where explicitly it's
decentralized and you have a lot of
individual in self interested
stakeholders and in everyone in there no
I'm I have some interested in how stable
the grid is but what I really want to
know is that my things inside my house
but operate when they when they when I
want them to and I may have some global
interest about the carbon emissions but
there's lots of individual and specific
self interest that has to be balanced at
the same time another sort of key area
very interested in is disaster response
so devout disaster response and you sort
of see that the pattern here these are
all things and people interacting took a
long time to get graphics to try and
sort of put all these things together
and so disaster response we're really
interested in coordinating lots of
resources making sense of lots of
disparate information sources and
crucially taking account of lots of
these information sources are going to
be people so disastrous panse when we
started working in this
years ago in a different project and
disaster response is a lot about cord
autonomously coordinating response
allocating resources increasingly it's
become much more about making sense of
real-time data that you're getting from
the crowd so disaster response things
like you shaheedi where you've got
people on the ground with smartphones
giving you information about the state
of the world how can you sort of process
that in real time and make sense a bit
so disastrous sponsors is very
interesting sort of crowdsourcing
element where you're crowdsourcing
information in real-time and you need to
sort try and make sense of it and at the
same time do resource coordination and
then the last angle which is sort of
very interesting i'm i'm going to look
at some show some examples of both of
these bits of work and talk very briefly
about about this 12 citizen science is
this of the nice idea that actually lots
of the computation tasks that we'd like
to do on a computer actually quite hard
to do on a computer but potentially
relatively easy to do for people if we
can sort of farm them out to people so
here we're working with the the Galaxy
Zoo Zooniverse people they take imagery
from the Hubble telescope it's imagery
of galaxies what they like to do is try
and sort of classify those galaxies most
simply into is this a spiral galaxy or
is it just a just a sort of shapeless
blob surprisingly it's very hard to get
an algorithm to do that but actually
it's relatively easy for people to do
that and some people are better at it
than others and what you'd like to do is
sort of farm those tasks out to people
spot to with the good ones gets their
aggregate opinions back build them
together so that you get a good idea of
your best classification of what this
galaxy is and then crucially actually
sort of at do some active sampling ask
the person the question you know spot
the who's going to be who's the person
who's best qualified to answer this
question and actually rather than sort
of randomly assign tasks to people
actually actively select ok who's the
best person to to answer this task and
present them with the problem so it's a
citizen science is very interesting a
spectrum and there's a lot here there's
a lot of works are actually trying to
trying to build probabilistic models of
the humans so if we know more about the
human how can we how can we
make best use of them as some sort of
human computation resource can we model
how well they perform and then also we
like to have actually have a sort of
a-what week orders of accountable
information infrastructure how do we
keep track of all of this if we've got
we're farming out questions to people
people are making decisions on the basis
you know and not maybe not the best
informed decisions they are citizen
scientists they're not professional
scientists how can we keep track of all
of that and actually sort of backtrack
we discover that someone is sort of
giving us on some information that is
discovered later to be to be false how
can we backtrack and discover what
decisions we made on the basis of it so
this is sort of most evident in in terms
of citizen science but actually also in
disaster response so if we get some new
information how can we look at all the
decisions we've made on the basis of
some old prior our prior state of
knowledge and actually backtrack figure
out which decision which decisions we've
made need to be a need to be sort of
recast so that's the setting and what I
want to do try and do in the in the talk
is sort of really sort of it in much
more detail sub describes some work that
we've done in these first two and sort
of touch very briefly on on here and
really sort of talk about some of the
applications a bit more so some of the a
lot of work we do is sort of algorithmic
well you know we publish that sort of
triple AI each guy nips ICML those sort
of algorithmic sort of machine learning
type conferences and what I want to show
here is sort of how we're trying to sort
take some of that and sort of build it
into into the interest into applications
so the first one I'm going to talk about
is the smart grid and the focus here is
really around home heating so you're
going to do anything around sort of
reducing carbon emissions in the UK
there's a few sort of headline things to
try and tackle one is transport which is
probably about forty forty percent of UK
missions and the other one is sort of
domestic heating so domestic heating is
surprisingly twenty-seven percent of UK
co2 emissions so it's a it's a very
significant part of emissions and it's
typically it's a thing that's very
poorly understood by consumers and the
information flows a very poor so most
people have very little understanding of
what their thermostat is doing and their
only real sort of connection with how
much anything is costing is when they
get their bill
sort of every three months and it's very
hard for them to actually sort of
understand the linkage between the two
and actually no you know what could they
do what actionable difference could they
make you know that we're all told just
turn your thermostat down but that will
save you X but how do we know that can
we can we spot homes which are poorly
insulated and actually I'd by someone
give them specific information that if
you insulate your home and bring it up
to average you will save X on the basis
of the of the data that we've seen so
what we'd like to try and do is improve
these information flows and crucially
this is sort of becoming sort of more
person and so one of the key aims to one
of the key drivers of reducing co2
emissions is try and Electrify heating a
transport so everyone sort of a familiar
with electrifying transport so we have
electric vehicles and an electric
vehicle is significantly more more
energy efficient than a carbon internal
combustion engine but heating is another
sort of key area which there's a move to
try and electrify using sort of air or
ground source heat pumps these are like
fridges that run backwards so rather
than actually burning fossil fuels in
your condensed boiler you'll have an air
source heat pump which sort of looked
works like a like a fridge for an air
conditioner backwards and we're sort of
take the heat out of the air and the
challenge with these things is that the
the heat output from them is very much
lower than we're used to with a heating
system so you come home to a cold house
it's very easy to turn your heating on
full you get sort of 15 kilowatts of
heat instantly in the house warms up
very quickly it's not clear that these
things will produce anything like that
so there's going to have to be much more
sort of a coordination some scheduling
aspect to them they'll have to sort of
preempt you your return to the house and
understand how long it's going to take
your house to warm up and and preheat
accordingly so that so these drives are
sort of pushing it away from this baby
spots of heating systems that we have
now towards something that just needs a
little bit more sort of coordination and
scheduling so what we've been trying to
do is trying to look at okay what's the
state of the art now and could we
provide some system now that will look
at an existing heating system and try
and predict what the consequences of
using that heating system are so what
we'd like to be able to do is
actually provide some feedback to
somewhere not change the boiler or
anything now but actually provide
feedback to them if they turn the
thermostat down by X degrees they're
going to save a certain amount of money
if they change the way that they're
scheduling their timer or not using it
in the middle of the day how much effect
but it have so in order to do that we
need to there's a few things that we
need to predict so so one of them is
ronita some predict external parameters
so what is it that is external to the
homeless that's driving the the the cost
of the heating and the two things that
we look at here we're going to be from
the external layer temperature and also
the carbon intensity of the grid so
where most of the work we've done is
with we all sort of gas boilers at the
moment but it's electrified actually the
carbon intensity of the grid is
something that will actually still
change in real time so being able to
schedule around that is sort of quite
interesting we'd like to learn something
about the thermal properties of the home
and we'll look at some approaches to
doing that and one of the key things
that we're really interested in is how
can we combine a statistical model and a
physical model so we know something
about something about physics of our
home leaks heat to the outside we have
some observations that we can get from
sensors how can we combine a statistical
model in a and a and a suitably sort of
parameterize physical model and then
once we've got those how can we sell
predicting and optimizer heating fitness
we'll talk about a few of those then
sorts of show a demo of of that sort of
working in a in a simulated environment
and then talk about how we're how we're
trying to do that for real okay so the
first thing in some predicting
environmental parameters so as soon as
when you sort of start to talk about
predicting heating performance with
people very quickly you're you hear this
thing I will add you know my house is in
a microclimate everyone claims that
their house is in some sort of
microclimate that isn't captured by the
weather forecasts that you get online so
one of the first things we looked at
doing was okay well where the forecasts
are clearly useful so if you if you've
got a statistical record of your house
over the last week you know that's going
to tell you something about what the
weather is going to be tomorrow tomorrow
but clearly there's some there should be
some input some useful information in a
weather forecast so the first thing we
looked at is how could we sort of
combine those two things together
so if we have some local observations
from my own sensor and I have an online
weather forecast how can I sort of put
the two together so this is some real
data from my home and you can sort of
see so this is one day plotted against
the previous day so you know they're
there is some correlation so a nice sort
of straight line would mean that days
are nicely sort of predictable what
happened at five o'clock yesterday is a
good predictor of what happens tomorrow
at five o'clock and it's not bad you can
sort of see here is a diagonal up here
this is the weather forecast data so
it's you can sort of see the the the
rounding which is you the weather
forecast is rounded offered at hold
degree C units and again there's some
sort of diagonal so there's clearly a
correlation between the what the
forecast says and what actually happens
but it's not absolutely perfect okay so
the first thing that we've been looking
at is sort of how can we combine these
things together so how can we combine a
sensor set of sense of observations and
also another time series which we
believe to be correlated and crucially
another time serious which we have a
forecast for so the second time series
can be anything at all and when we look
at the carb intensity that sort of turns
out to be really useful so but for that
for the external temperature we've
basically got our historic observations
from our sensor at the home and what
we'd like to do is sort of predict
what's going to happen tomorrow or for
the rest of the day what we've got is a
an online where the history so we can
look at what was the temperature but
that crucially that temperature is at
the local weather center so this is this
is my home is in the new forest and the
local weather sensor sent center is in
brockenhurst is in southampton so have a
an observation of the temperature at
southampton which is some degree
correlated with the temperature at my
home but then crucially I have a
prediction for this okay so I have a
prediction for one thing which I believe
to be correlated to the time series that
i really want to predict and there's a
number of ways that you combine these
together sort of one way that we've been
looking at which is sort of turns out to
be really nice is using multi output
gaussian process so a gaussian process
allows you to parameterize features of
time series but at a very high level so
basically we we
we make some quite high level
assumptions about these time series one
is that it's smooth so there's some
correlation one measurement in time is
in some way correlated with a with the
next measurement in time there's some
correlation length that defines how
smooth it is and also there's some
typically some daily periodicity so five
o'clock today we will tell me something
about five o'clock tomorrow it looks
somewhat like five o'clock yesterday so
there there's some daily periodicity and
this the strength of that periodicity we
don't really know so you might be in a
nice stable regime where every day looks
very much the same and then we can
expect them to be very correlated in an
innovative sort of changeable setting we
may lose that correlation and one day
doesn't look very much like the next and
then we've got the the observer there
the forecast and and and the only
assumption we make is that actually the
the weather forecast might be correlated
with this time series okay so in this
case where they're the same thing one is
a they're both temperatures but that
doesn't need to be the case the other
thing we've been looking at is
predicting carbon intensity of the grid
where we have observations of carbon
intensity we want a prediction of carbon
intensity we also have observations of
the total demand on the grid that we can
get from the national grid very nicely
the national grid also predicts keeps us
a prediction of the demand so those two
things we can put together with in
exactly the same model so even though
they're not measuring the same thing
anymore one is a one is you know
gigawatts the other one is kilograms of
co2 per kilowatt hour they've sort of
completely different things but they're
correlated so we can exploit that
correlation so this approach works quite
well the difference is relatively small
so you look at the difference know where
the a multi output gaps in process
improves on significantly on just using
our observation of yesterday you get
down to you can sort of carry on
tweaking and you get down to sort of a
two degree error how significant that is
at the end of the day it's a bit hard to
say but clearly there is there's some
improvement and actually coral looking
for correlated data series and
exploiting the extra information that
we've got so so it's quite a nice trick
and it sort of it works quite well in
this setting so that's the first thing
we've got now we've got a prediction of
the temperature the other thing that
we'd like
the other thing that we would now like
to do is is is try and learn something
about the thermal properties of the
house okay so we've done initially this
in simulation and then I'll show you
some real data so this is a sort of
simulation of a house it simulates the
thermal properties of a simple house
with a very simple sort of physics model
and this is the physics model that we'd
like to try and learn so this is a model
of heat flows within the home and this
is probably the base the simplest sort
of physical model you could sort of come
up with so basically you've got this is
the heat into the into the house we're
assuming that the house is just one on
big room there's some heater input
there's an indicator function it which
is whether the heater is on or off at
that particular time there's some
leakage so the leakage is proportional
to the difference between the internal
temperature in the external temperature
with some parameter and then there's
some noise which sort of factors in all
the stuff that we don't know and then
that heater hit that heat input results
in some change in the in the temperature
so it's just the thermal capacity of the
air and the mass of the air so this is
all the simplest of a model of sort of
home heating sort of leakage that you
can come up with and basically lots of
these models some have correlated with
most simple electrical circuits so this
is the equivalent of electrical circuit
so so here we've got a fixed voltage
which is the temperature outside we've
got a current source which is the heater
we've got a capacitor which is the
voltage across this capacitor is the
temperature inside the home and then
there's some leakage to the outside with
this resistor so these these sort of
heating the differential equations that
describe heating exactly the same as the
differential equations that describe
these sort of simple RC circuits and
creasing Lee you can sort of add more
and more complexity so other things that
you can add in you can add in leakage to
a sink which is sort of leakage to to
the to the ground you can add in leakage
to the envelope of the house which then
leaks to the outside you can leak to the
internal furniture within the home which
then licks back into the into the home
you can have delays and lags around the
heating system so the heating system
heats water which then leaks heat into
the home so you can even add more more
complexity to these models
as you add more more parameters as you
add more complexity there's more
parameters learn this sort of very
simplest model that we learn remember
these are observations so we know what
the if we got a time series we know what
the internal temperature is the external
temperature we know what heating system
was doing so we can very easily learn
what these parameters are we don't need
to worry about the size of the home or
that or this we can this or just gets
folded into these parameters so what
we're left with is just so trying to
learn the heat of input parameter and
the leakage rate in the simplest model
and this is sort of what it looks like
from for my home and there's there's a
whole host of ways you could do this
learning this is this is sort of simple
so V numeration of the whole search
space you can sort of see it's got this
a nice diagonal nature which sort of
says that a very strong heater and a
very high leakage rate looks about right
and also a very weak heater and have a
low leakage rate it looks about right
where there is a there's a best best
spot in the middle and so this is
complete enumeration of the search space
but you can do in a much click more
clever ways so if you've got more
parameters this becomes obviously sort
of company exponentially expensive but
you can cast this as a Kalman filter and
just do a iterative update every time
you get a new observation you you re
estimate what these parameters are so
this works very well some of the some of
the challenges were which what model to
use you've got an increasing complexity
of model and what you find very quickly
is that the models become unphysical so
if you build in a model of all of the
features so you have the heater feeding
heat into the into water in the heating
system and that water leaking into the
inside when you when you run it you very
quickly get sort of overfitting of the
model and you find lots of unphysical
parameters here you find that the the
water in the heating system is at 300
degrees C so things that you know it are
obviously force so you could fix some of
that with with a sort of a Bayesian
approach and sort of priors over some of
these parameters one of the approaches
that we've been so looking at recently
which is which i think is sort of a
really nice approach is this latent
force model so so we do this in the in
the same space as the Gaussian process
so where where we're setting up a model
a Gaussian process like model we
uses these simple differential equations
so if we stick to the Simple model which
is a very simple differential equation
we can do this and then crucially we can
have a latent force so all the things
that we don't know about we can wrap up
into this latent force and that latent
force ends up capturing two things so it
so it captures things that we don't
actually have an explicit model for so
typically that might be sort of solar
heating of the house so if there's some
extra heat source or heating from
cooking that gets folded in to the
latent force the other thing that latent
force ends up capturing is the failure
of the model so the real house won't
behave in the simple way that our simple
differential equation describes but the
trick that we want to exploit is the
fact that this failure and these extra
heating sources are likely to be
periodic so what you can sort of see
here this is a real trace from one of
the homes that we're monitoring these
are this is when the heater system is
coming on this is the internal
temperature signal source it comes on in
the morning it's dying away then it
comes on in the evening goes off the
evening and then repeats this is over
two days and this thing here is that is
the residual that we've learnt from that
and what we've done is we force this
residual to be periodic so we've said
okay well every day is going to fail in
about the same way so the way the model
failed yesterday it's probably going to
be the way it's going to fail tomorrow
so we force a periodic prior onto this
residual so this is the latent force the
extra heat that's going into the house
we force it to be residual and if you
look at it the things that it's
capturing are you can sort of see these
big spikes every time the heater comes
on and off and so what this is capturing
is the lag in the heating system so
outfit our simple physical model doesn't
capture any explain the fact that the
heater comes on but then there's a delay
before the temperature change starts to
occur or the fact that the other end
when the temperature goes off the
heating is off apparently but the
temperature is still rising because
there's hot water still circulating in
the pipes so this sort of captures that
you can sort of see these sort of big
consistent features so this sort of
overnight this is this is where the
temperature is dropping away decaying in
the house overnight and you can sort of
see that you get these sort of a sort of
characteristic features stuff in here is
like there's a lot of noise but this is
of a very consistent featuring sort of
see it just going off the off the plot
over here and that's the fact that our
simple model doesn't really describe the
decay of the temperature in the house no
the decay is much simpler than just
leaking to the outsiders in my house is
actually leaking to the to a sink which
is the ground it's leaking to the
envelope and there's also some extra
heat within the house from from the
fridge and refrigeration things like
that so you can build a model and
parameterize it and you learn those
things but actually we end up being able
to predict just as well without actually
having to go to all that complexity we
basically just use this that very simple
model and then we hope that the way that
the model fails yesterday it's the same
way it's going to fail today so we can
correct our predictions on that basis
okay so now we've got those two things
we've got a prediction of what's going
to happen outside tomorrow or to the end
of the day we've got a thermal model of
the home and then we can sort of start
to do some sort of useful things with it
so so here we've got our our simulator
running so we're we're simulating these
algorithms we're running these
algorithms on a simulated house so we're
generating data but the weather data is
real data so that the thermal
characteristics we've set in a simulator
but the it's going to be driven by with
some real weather data so the first
thing that there's how sort of home
heating system is doing is it's learning
those thermal parameters so it's
starting off it's just acting so this is
sort of the interface that you might
have so it's it's sitting there it's
watching what the house is doing so is
watching when heating the existing
heating system is going on and off just
operating as a thermostat licking at the
temperature changes and building this
probabilistic model okay so this is sort
of what's happening behind the scenes so
what we're doing here where this is the
distal Kalman filter approach this is
sort of a histogram of what we think the
leakage rate and the heater output is so
we're learning these things over time
what you can sort of see here this is
the set point this is the thermostat
just sort of cycling at that that's that
point this is the external temperature
the curves here the blue bid is when we
when we want comfort the green bit is
when we want heat when the heating the
timer is actually set to be on and this
red bit is when the when
heating it the heater is actually
generating heat so you can sort of see
in this bit here that heat is going on
and off to try and sort of maintain the
temperature and we sort of come back to
those and so the key thing you can see
here so here's our external temperature
prediction so the gray bid is our
uncertainty so the nice thing about the
Gaussian process is we have a prediction
we have some prediction uncertainty this
is the carbon 10 intensity so these
predictions are particularly good at the
moment because we're only saw a couple
of days in they get a little bit better
as you give it a little bit more time to
learn okay so now we've learnt what
these parameters are so the first thing
that we can start to do is we can start
to sort of try and provide some feedback
so one of the things we can do is we can
provide a cost prediction so if i set my
thermostat to 20 degrees it's going to
cost me one pound 71 today and as I
change the temperature I can you can you
can calculate what the what the total
cost over the day will be and also in
carbon so this is a sort of predictive
feedback so we're not we're not saying
how much you're using now we're going to
we're saying how much you're going to
have used by the end of end of the day
which is a little bit more useful to the
householder and then the other thing you
can do is turn that around so say okay
well only one to spend one pound fifty
today so do your best set the thermostat
to to the best that you can and it will
use that prediction it will model the
impact of these decisions and come up
with the appropriate temperature okay so
that's that's so that's relatively
simple so we're just we're using a
prediction and we're just operating as a
thermostat still it slightly sort of
more useful thing to do is then to try
and sort of explicitly optimize okay so
here we're assuming that there's some
critical pricing period so we've got
some smart meter we in some sort of
smart grid setting there's that the
price of electricity is in constant and
here there's there's critical pricing
period in the evening so heating is is
more electricity is more expensive in
the evening our agent is our home
heating system is planning around that
so what you can sort of see it doing
over here this is it's that critical
pricing period and what it's trying to
do is heat the home up before that
critical pricing period let the
temperature subdecay you over that
period and then heat it up a little bit
more to sort of maintain the comfort and
and the vertical we've sort of extended
the
the expanded out the deviations here so
you can sort of see them a little bit
clearer but what you saw should see in a
minute we're now in that critical
pricing period so the agent is sort of
warmed the home up before it's doing its
best to sort of maintain a little bit of
temperature and then it lets the
temperature decay away to try and
minimize the amount of heat that it uses
over that period so this is using a
model so we have a probabilistic model
of what's actually going to happen
outside we've got a model of the thermal
properties of the house and then we can
optimize that in any way we like so we
can do this sort of this is the same
thing here optimizing the electricity
costs so heat up the house try and
maintain it let the temperature decay so
we try and minimize how much energy we
use over that period this is sort of
doing the same thing for carbon
intensity that turns out to be not so
much you can do with carbon intensity it
sort of gradually ramps up over the day
so this is sort of the optimization that
it's come up with which is sort of heat
up more in the morning we've got this so
slightly unusual case where we just want
heat all day go and comfort all day and
then let the temperatures of decay over
the day and there and the verticals of
deviations here is sort of expanded
because we've relaxed sort of the
constraints on that we have a sort of
comfort model that tries to first and
minimize those book gives you an
acceptable bound which you can
manipulate the temperatures around ok so
this sort of has some you know
reasonably significant effects so in at
least in the simpler in the in our
simulation which we believe is sort of
performs reasonably close to it or to a
real home we get sort of something
around for twenty percent savings in
cost and a lot of that is down to
actually optimizing when you do the
heating so preheating at the appropriate
time and and in this case with a
critical pricing period actually sort of
making it being able to optimize around
that critical pricing period so a
typical approach might be just to turn
off the heating of that critical pricing
period but actually we do it you know
we're a little bit more clever than that
where we we can we know it's coming we
can heat up appropriately beforehand
model how much it's going to decay away
over the critical pricing period and
then try and do the best that we can
either in terms of cost or carbon so
this all seems to work quite nicely in
terms of simulation what we what we're
doing now is we have some homes in
Southampton that we've metered so over
the winter we've been recording
minute by minute set point activity
therm the heater activities that we've
instrumented the boilers so we know
every minute whether the boiler with a
boiler is firing at that point we've got
some interesting data on how people
typically use these heating systems
which is which did isn't really how we'd
expect them know very few people
actually found the timer most of them
are just turning it up and down manually
on the on the thermostat which which is
a bit makes our predictions much harder
and the thing that we're trying to do
now is to sort of build this into it
into something that we can try out next
winter so we like to try and sort of
optimize these hope the thermal heating
in these homes next winter on the basis
of the data that we've got now in there
and the data that we've got now is sort
of helping to inform these models so
trying to give us a handle on how good
this our prediction has to be okay so
that's the that's the sort of smart grid
aspect and then the key thing there is a
sort of nice interaction between machine
learning and human agent interaction so
so we've done quite a lot on the other
building the models the work that's also
progressing at the moment is actually
sort of how should you present this back
to the user no the thermostats and
notoriously have notoriously hard for
people to understand so you know I tell
the story I was stayed in the hotel a
couple of weeks ago where the thermostat
had instructions they were extra
instructions stuck on to the thermostat
on the desk in the hotel room they're
extra instructions on how to use the
thermos so now the only thing in the
room that you needed three sets of
instructions for was the thermostat and
it's not much you can do is one dog we
turn it up and down but these interfaces
and notoriously hard for people trying
to stab normally because I very poor for
mental models of how the heating system
works so we're working with a with
sociologists who's of interviewing the
people and trying to understand now
what's the model that the person has in
the head of how their heating system
works how the thermostats works and how
is that influencing how they're they're
actually using it so that's sort of
quite an interesting aspect okay so note
so that's the Sun it's off with the
smart grid work what I want to talk
about another sort of brief example yeah
what's crazy yeah yeah so wait so we
looked at a critical pricing period
which is probably more characteristic of
a
country with a calling we're with air
conditioners so the model that way so
with gas there's no critical pricing
because you can store it anyway critical
pricing period is sort of more
significant with electricity and
actually the the the real impact on here
is probably in a hot country with
calling but we don't have the data for
that so so the but so critical pricing
periods to turn off air conditioners is
it is typically a there's already lots
of results on that there's understanding
of how well that works and the fact that
actually pre-cooling before everything
is saying we just stick a minus sign
into the fit into the model actually pre
calling before the critical pricing
period it sort of is the significant
thing to do so Australia has quite a lot
of example of critical pricing periods
to try and minimize their conditioner
use at peak times because once people
sort of adapt to this sort of take this
policy then companies might change their
great yeah yeah yeah so lots of people
have done sort of um so the salawa study
is where you you have an automatic
switch on the on the on the air
conditioner and the lesson there is all
it does is move the peak so so and
typically it moves the peak tail off the
critical period so everyone's house is
extra hot and then the air conditioner
comes on full whack to try and call it
down and all you've done is sort of
shift the peak to a little bit later in
a sense here we sort of shift the peak
earlier and you'd need something you
would need to worry about equilibrium
mistake and actually sort of existing
economy seven where you have these dual
rates they randomized the switching time
so that not everyone's sort of heating
Cubs on at the same time so so the
existing so the radio signal is slightly
randomized so that so that you don't
have everyones heating system switching
on at the same time and creating all
these sort of for speaks but we have
some work looking at exactly that and
one and one of the one of the lessons
for critic you actually critical pricing
period is is a pretty crude tall what
you really want is sort of real-time
pricing but real-time pricing is very
hard for anyone to two corresponding
so it's a real-time pricing with a fully
automated system that can respond to it
and find a nice equilibrium is this of
the end game but it's not clear how you
actually get to that at that point it
seems to make my limited experience that
the problem with those things is the
limited input devices if you could just
run it with a screen mouse yeah yeah it
won't be easy you could explain it is it
you know you're looking at that yeah
yeah so this so this is a this is an
interfaith this is an iphone interface
so so this is a small soft start up
moisture who have a home energy system
and they have a you know you take your
thermostat off you put a little sort of
an their box on and then you have an
interface and that's sort of that's
that's also a lot of the issues the
thing that sort of interests me is sort
of how how much you can do without
actually tube with the minimal change
within the home so one of the things I'm
interested in is actually maybe not
actually sort of replacing controllers
but could we give someone could we could
we send something bae cheaply and
provide some feedback without actually
having people to install complex
controllers so so there is a market for
sort of complex controllers and people
like to know it to you know there that
you can buy passive systems will sell
you sort of heaters controllers that do
some of these things I've just looked
this this is for smart home vision just
sort of way seems a long way off though
and I think there's a it will take a
long time for that to get into people's
home so it's or interesting as to how
quickly people will actually sort of be
comfortable with with automating that
that you're not measuring the sale
capacity of the house as a separate
thing because by lumping it in with that
that's real forcing work you yeah um
unfortunate to be periodic you know you
can see that it's linked to win the
heating comes on and off yeah and you're
about to change when them he's in
Kherson off therefore it's not going to
work yeah and I've been looking at for
example using thermal storage in houses
to improve optimize use of electricity
off peak foot you know for underfloor
heating
and and that's exactly what you need
yeah so it's like Toto too yeah so it
says probably have something is a mix of
things that we're trying to do here so
so so so one my my preference is try and
do it with the minimum sentencing that
you can so so what could you do just
sensing at one place and the bit and the
best place to sense is at the thermostat
because that's the thing that's
determining the heating costs at the
moment so you have someone's existing
know the thermostat may be in the wrong
place but actually the fact that you set
it to 20 degrees that's determining your
your costs so if you can model the week
the thermal properties of a house at
that point on the wall you have a good
understanding of how that turns into a
into a heating costs but at and and I
and I think there is space for actually
sort of producing a more and more
physically informed model the challenge
is how much information you need about
the home to do that so my preference
would be to what could we do without
asking the homeowner anything and then
maybe you actually need more information
so maybe if you're going to parameterize
this model you know is it a house but on
a concrete slab and that might be able
to inform the model in the leakage to
the floor and you can begin to strip it
priors over some of the parameters the
model how much energy is going it's just
to attend to the heated yeah then you
can work and then you can work out what
sound going oh yes yes one yeah so one
of them in the key thing the other thing
is that is the leakage rate so so we get
good good measurements of how quickly
the heat leaks out of the house which
either tells you is a house which is
where the which is useful so either it's
a very leaky house or it's at it which
which is one possible explanation or
it's a house which has which is very
insulated inside so that the heat
doesn't leak to the structure very
quickly and there's a
leakage from the steady state you get
the capacity the thermal capacity from
the dynamic foot from the change and
turning it on yes yes I see why you need
extra extra information extra sensor
data in order to determine the thermal
capacity so in terms oh it's a witch so
we saw that we thought were effectively
we do model the thermal capacity I mean
we know we we know how much it how much
the heating is going to be reduced by
two if you decrease the setpoint by 2
degrees yeah yeah wait if you don't turn
the if you have a nice sort of schedule
and then tomorrow you're going to have
the same schedule but you going to
reduce the set point x by 2 degrees we
can calculate how much heating how much
you're going to save on heating by doing
that because we know what the leakage
rate is going to be at 18 degrees as
opposed to 20 degrees we know how much
heater output we know what that we've
parameterised the heater output so we
know percentage-wise how much of the
time it needs to be on so we can so we
can turn so in so in a sense we are
coming up with thermal capacity the
house in terms of its response to the
heating system yeah yeah okay yep so you
mentioned that you know you will be
waiting for like a smart grid and that's
a very you know future thing yeah I
don't really see why in the proposal and
apologize i came in a bit late maybe
there was something more before but
given what I saw I do not understand why
this could not be applied house by house
on the basis that there is a smart meter
present in the house which can be done
for you know one housing in the
neighborhood or one housing the whole
city doesn't actually require any
infrastructure support no no so no so in
terms of the the modeling of the
response to the critical pricing period
you know there will and I mean there's
economy seven but that's the only
variable tariff that people are sort of
exposed to at the moment so so once
you've got smart meters there is this
sort of scope for more sort of varied
thing in a sense where we're looking
somewhere into the future in the sense
that you know most heating at the moment
is is ninety-seven percent is is
gasified condenser boilers so
and and there's no there's never going
to be any pricing criticality for for
gas because it's a storable commodity so
in a sense that you don't have to
optimize over your your use in that way
but actually you do want to optimize in
terms of when you actually want to want
heat or when you want comfort so there
the optimization then is useful so you
know how early do you put the heating on
to make sure you're at set point when
you want it the the work you're doing on
sort of a predicta panty so if you know
that no one's in so let it cool down and
actually no okay with they're going to
be back at six o'clock what time do i
need to look turn the heating on so i'm
back at set point before they arrive so
all of that sort of prediction a
modeling you can apply now to a to a
normal sort of heating system where some
of the stuff around optimizing over a
gas or electricity there that has a
variable price so different times you
know that that requires you know we
don't have that market electricity yet
allow it to improve its its process and
that much might be something you want to
do to share your prediction on oh yes on
local conception and if everybody does
that at the operation level in the first
picture you can optimize the petition
process yes we have some we have some
sort of related work which is sort of
around around that if you getting trying
to get trying to elicit predictions of
energy consumption from homes because
the better electricity is good example
the better prediction you have of the
demand for tomorrow the better you can
trade and you'll get a better price for
it so actually so having and and within
the home you always have a better
understanding of what your energy used
tomorrow is going to be then some of
them outside because you know what your
schedule is you know what your calendar
is so it so we've looked at sort of you
know how what's the value in that extra
information and then how could you be
paid for that extra information and
there's some really interesting
incentives you know if you if you want
to be careful that the the you don't
encourage people to turn on extra loads
to get back up to their prediction
because they're sort of gonna they're
going to fall belief their prediction
and they want to
of you know you know they they they
increase their reward by being a
reliable predictor so you have to worry
about those incentives but it's an
interesting yeah it's an interesting
aspect in the sense that the grid and
new energy company would have with their
performance would be improved if they
had a good prediction of how much energy
you're going to use so actually telling
them that has some value so you know it
should have some value to you as well
yes yeah and i think is very close but
on top of that if it's right to esteem
it okay then see you as well yeah yes
awaits we're doing so we we have server
student he's looking at using smart
meter data to disaggregate appliances
and which that work sort of reasonably
well you can still recognize key
appliances but sort of one minute data
and then the obvious thing to do from
that is actually ok well can you sort of
estimate occupancy from that so that's
not quite a nice thing when you know how
much can you you predict without any
extra sensors so the next thing is quite
nice you now have a little sort of
occupancy sensor within the device it's
probably some nice little machine
learning problems in terms of inferring
ultra Qin see when you've only got one
sensor all the other model is you just
employ lots of sensors around the Holman
and and try and get absolutely ground
truth mr. as to where people in the
house in the house because you the
comfort level is not very good at sure
you know that you are going to face a
high pricing in the coming out a few
ideas to rise to about you and then to
stop and then you yeah so it's like it
yeah that's the key yeah so I mean the
key thing that's missing is is a good
model of comfort and that's the and
that's the thing that no one really has
a very good handle on so yes that
basically you have to maintain one don't
be at your level so that well that's one
model so what's a weight that's the most
yes we must use in architecture yes we
use the actuary model of comfort and we
look at an aggregate comfort over over a
period so the ASHRAE model just
penalizes is basically a deviation away
from a an optimal set point
and then what we're doing is we're where
we try to ensure over a certain period
that our aggregate comfort is the same
as we'd have without doing without doing
the deviations but that that model of
comfort is very sort of ill-defined I
think that's that no the real thing you
want to do is sort i and model the the
users you know dissatisfaction is the
temperature berries you know how some
people are going to be more more
susceptible to deviations in temperature
some people won't really care and
actually that's that trying to elicit
that comfort information seems to be a
release of really challenging task up to
a degree yeah yeah there's yet so it's a
good so so the so the ashrai models is a
is a very simple it's just deviation
from a set point but it's is there's an
exponent which is more than one so you
deviation yet deviations are worse than
stand at the set point but there's some
sort of the some leeway in that so if
you're a little bit on average a little
bit more comfortable you can submit
tolerate some some deviations but how
well that actually sort of maps to real
people's comfort it seems to be an open
question so I'm a little bit skeptical
about that and actually the data that
we've done sort of on looking at real
people how real people use their heating
systems actually the benefits are much
lower down the scale actually telling
people you're heating is on all the time
you know try turning off at night you'll
say forty percent those are you know you
know though that there's very quick very
significant wind is just been doing that
most people just don't really know what
they eating system is doing no the fact
that now having your eating system at 24
is quite high you know telling people
how they compare to the averages there's
there's sort of quite significant of
games just been doing that over time
they're almost done so very good i'll
skip through this very quickly so that
so you actually i'll just show the video
so one thing to another sore area the
disaster response sort of area the saw
mentioned earlier that's what we want
some really interesting aspect is for
coordinating apply
coordinating UAVs for aerial imagery
collection and I just going to show you
the so I've spoken to a couple of people
here quite a lot about our approach
which is sort of based on message
passing so we we have a coordination
problem and we represent it as a as a
message passing algorithm so this is all
nicely come from probabilistic inference
and I just want to skip on to the video
which is quite nice get worse all this
which is actually trying to do it for
real so so one of the key things in
orchid is not just to sort of try and do
the algorithmic search you try and sort
of do these things for real to sort of
discover what the real problems are so
this is somewhere the student did in at
the Australian Centre for field robotics
where the Australia is so big they they
seem to have they have their own flight
test facility with their own runway they
have their own Island in the great
barrier reef where they can run their
sore underwater vehicles so what we're
what we're going to see in the video
oops it runs is a message passing
algorithm which is sort of based on the
on the maxim algorithm which is
basically sort of you're familiar with
graphical models it sir
so this is basically they sort of belief
propagation in the graphical model here
we're using it for utility optimization
so we're using the Mac summer with them
rather than sort of some product and
what you're going to see in a second is
this is the this is a factor graph
that's running on real time on the two
UAVs so we've got two vehicles and we've
got to aerial surveillance requests so
what we what we've is to solve the
simplest coordination task you could
come up with you've got two vehicles and
two tasks the task is ok I want to
collect aerial imagery of this spot in
this spot these are two people with PDAs
standing on the ground said ok I want
aerial imagery for me this guy says I
want aerial imagery here you've got 22
UAVs and the UAVs are doing the
coordination task of deciding who should
go where so this is clearly this is the
simplest coordination task what we could
meet we could have had one task and it
would have been a little bit simpler but
this is about as simple as you can get
in terms of coordination but the key
thing is that this is running sort of a
graphical model or maxim and so it's
running maxim over this this graphical
model and what what this is representing
is the utilities of the different you
OBS doing the task we do message passing
over the graphical model which in
reality turns out to be message passing
from each UAV to man on the ground and
and back again and the message
propagation basically souls the
coordination problem and they decide
where to go so we just let that run
so we've done a lot of work on on the on
this of the coordination mechanism in
the algorithms and this and this is
really just of an illustration that
we're sort of trying to do a lot of this
stuff for real so these are this is the
aerial imagery coming from the from the
UAVs now you see one task is now
completed and they're both sort of
reassigned to the other one is a
slightly more complex setting so I've
spoken to a few people this morning
about Mac some coordination to do this
so this these sort of task allocation
tasks so this is it really sort of
happening for real so now we've got just
one task at the moment you're going to
see both of the UAVs are going to end up
being assigned to that task they will
start flying towards it and then another
task comes and then they make a decision
as to who should who should go where the
flight control of the Yogi's is pretty
poor so they they they they flied to
waypoints and you so you can sort of see
them they reach a waypoint they
circulate around it and they fly on a
little bit that's sort of the the
australian centre didn't trust our
coordination mechanism so they put lots
of sort of safety steps in the way which
was which was a little bit annoying and
because it actually works in the nicety
in the end and here's the last time so
this is a little bit more interesting so
a little bit more interesting factor
graph so now we're going to see three
tasks but there's some sort of
constraints on the task so only one so
hit this guy can do this task or this
task then we're going to add in another
task in a second so now there's three
tasks it sums of local constraints this
guy can only do some subset of them but
is that concern coordination algorithm
is just sort of passing messages between
the things on the ground so the factor
of the factor graph is on the ground the
variable of the practica off is in the
UAV and the message passing is the is
the message passing up and down up and
down here so we're trying to so this is
sort of the input for the Australian
Centre for robotics trying to take what
a essentially sort of graphical model
based coordination algorithms and really
sort of try them in reality and actually
you aren't you you discover all sorts of
constraints that you've sort of ignore
in terms of synchronization and a stand
how you know that messages got there and
all the although all the sort of
real-world features that it's very easy
to abstract away when you sort of
simulate these things on your on your
desktop machine okay and just very
quickly i just want to mention lots of
the things i mentioned quite a lot about
Galaxy Zoo so there's citizen science is
very interesting angle we're very
interested in in crowdsourcing how you
can sort of get people in the crowd to
contribute so this is work getting
people who are you know we want people
to look at this and classify you know
what sort of galaxies do they think it
is this is an improv that we just have
started off which is quite fun I the New
Forest is sort of a national park just
next to Southampton it's the home of a
sacar de which is the only native sacar
de in the UK unfortunately it hasn't
been heard for 12 years so it might
still be there might not be but it has
this very interesting feature that it
the song is at 14 kilohertz which is
almost on the edge of most people's
hearing and may may be beyond beyond the
speakers so typically you're not really
hearing 14 kilohertz you're hearing this
or the speaker the amplitude modulation
from the speaker so this is called a
really interesting aspects actually you
know that there's two people two experts
who are looking around the new forest
looking for this thing try and listen
for it but every year there's about
three million day visitors to the New
Forest mainly of those with smartphones
and the question is and actually the
smart your smartphone can hear this
thing very easily and actually detect it
very easily so it's very characteristic
sound it has very characteristic
frequency in a very characteristic
repeating so amplitude modulation which
is very easy for a phone to hear it's
hard for adults beyond sort of 45 to
hear I think the average agent of
residents in the New Forest is well
beyond that so that may be why I hasn't
been heard for 10 years or so and but so
this is an interesting project how can
we use devices that many people sort of
wandering around with that have this
capability they've already got sensors
built in sort of a microphone a very
sensitive microphone that will go out to
some 20 kilohertz and how can we sort of
encourage and incentivize people who are
visit
to pull out their iphone as they were
sort of walking around and if they hear
an interesting sound to record it and
upload it to us so we can do some
detection automatically on the phone but
the key thing we want is a is a is a
date stamped GPS geo-located recording
of a new photo sacada as evidence that
it still exists somewhere in the in the
new forest so these things they live
underground for six years they come out
the ground live for about two weeks
singing during that time and then they
they plant their eggs and then live in
the ground for another eight years so so
it could be there still or it could be
gone and and and and if we find it it
would be great but I told the PhD
student is doing this thing if you can't
get his ph.d if we don't find it so i
figure that would be good incentive ok
so i leave it there so is that the end
was very rushed but the questions were
great so i think that heating work is
