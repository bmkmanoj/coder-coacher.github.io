we envision to be the next generation of
the local search experience we believe
that users when they search for local
businesses they're only interested
they're really interested in figuring
out the state of the business at the
town of akyurek for instance it would be
great if we could show their users how
crowded the business is at the town like
here or if we could show the users what
type of music is plays or how loud the
music is at the current business over
the last thirty minutes now to give you
an example of how our search engines
today can delivers this they are to
provide a more meaningful service let me
show you our car knob on our windows
mobile devices
organ actually see here is very similar
to a search application users can
actually select a location they can see
businesses are on location for every
business were displaying real-time
metadata about this business we're gonna
display what the occupancy level in the
business is what the noise level in the
business is what type of music and what
is the level of the music is actually
playing the business and how loud the
human side of the business is even
better the user can actually filter out
the businesses depending on the metadata
for instance a user that this is
interested in going for a happy hour she
must probably be interested in a bar s
or not plays loud music so you can
actually go and say I want to figure out
a high music bar and for me right now if
the application will only display a high
music bar restaurants if you're a family
guy and you just won't have a quite
dinner with your family then you just
might wanna go occupancy normal and
search for businesses are quite low
noise low occupancy right now we are
counseling this information based on
real user check-ins every time I your
checks into a business
he actually explicitly tells us where
she is going and at the same time we
know that the phones in the user hands
do with that time gastly use the sensors
to monitor the business environment and
understand what is going on in
particular we're recording about six to
ten seconds of audio data using the
microphone embedded on the mobile device
then we analyze this data in both the
temporal and frequency domain to extract
some subtle set of features that
describe
human chatter and music and then we use
this set of features to train
classification models and if fun we can
actually accurately classify sound into
these different levels of business
metadata with more than 80% accuracy now
let me play back some of the traces you
can actually hear in the audio trace for
that different business is clearly a
high volume business with a lot of
people and as you can actually hear the
noise from the bar and he can hear the
human chatter so what I've shown you in
this demo is actually new technology
that can help enable a whole new
generation of years that none of the
search engines can actually enable today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
