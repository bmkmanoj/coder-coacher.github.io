of Southern California with buddy best
unique device dedicated to you all right
hey everyone thank you for being here
today to hear about the Buddy
corporation's latest conversational user
interface now buddy or best unique
device dedicated to you is a personal
wearable conversational user interface
that's designed to help users with
things like goal achievement and habit
building now the demand for productivity
apps is already very high and people are
using everything from virtual counselors
to online personal trainers and what
makes buddy distinct is that with buddy
we have found a way to eliminate
conflicting advice and eliminate the
time it takes to manage that those
disparate systems and coordinate
everything into one system that operates
across a user's devices aggregating all
of those resources and is supported on
the back end by a network of
professionals that analyze the data
collected by buddy and continually
improve the software but it consists of
an ear cuff and operates primarily
through cloud computing although some
processing in data storage does occur on
the ear cuff itself the majority takes
place on buddy servers in the cloud in
addition but he is also able to make use
of the users computing devices such as
their computer and phone for additional
processing power this combination of
features ensures the Buddy is
consistently able to maintain a snappy
response time and that it can continue
to function even when not connected to
the Internet but he is equipped with a
microphone a heart rate monitor a camera
a variety of other sensors and also two
sets of speakers one external and one
personal to the user on the back end but
he makes use of a variety of data
streams that the user has chosen to
integrate such as email to keep track of
what's happening in the users life but
he also relies on the Buddy network a
network of human experts such as
therapists and physicians with whom
we've worked to ensure that buddy is
always able to respond to any situation
in which the user might find themselves
but he uses three sources of information
when responding to a situation user's
preferences
the input streams that the user is given
it access to and the expert knowledge of
the Buddy network but he begins by
monitoring the streams continuously
looking for a cue that will prompt it to
respond when it notice is such a cue it
will begin by generating a set of
potential responses to the situation
using the expert knowledge of the Buddy
network then it will choose the best
response based on the details of the
particular situation and on the user's
preferences afterwards it will look at
the users feedback and use that to
update its understanding of the user's
preferences while also contributing any
new knowledge that might have learned to
the Buddy network to improve the
responses of the system as a whole body
network is our network of professionals
from various fields these professionals
are responsible for analyzing the data
and providing solutions for the various
challenges posed by body data collected
from buddies interactions with users and
their environment is sent to this
network anonymously and to make sure
that we have an efficient tool we
interviewed a lot of professionals and
it was their input that helped us design
a better body table was one of our very
first bunny users she was referred by
her therapist who was one of the
consulting therapist for buddy's design
and she integrated with her buddy
incredibly quickly now we wanted an
opportunity to see buddy in real life so
with Taylor's permission we had a
reality TV crew follow her around for
about a week to see how it all went hi
I'm Taylor and this is my buddy and i've
been using buddy for two months now gosh
buddy how did it be neat first of all
you should know I I work a lot and when
I'm overworked I get scattered and when
I'm scattered I become anxious
so buddy is an inclusive system that's
designed for people who are
underrepresented by existing
technologies so this includes people
like children with learning differences
people on the autism spectrum are
struggling with mental health concerns
or elderly people with dementia now by
designing to include all of these unique
abilities and needs we've been able to
create a product that is that can better
serve everyone so buddy is an adaptive
system and this means that it learns
both through its interactions with the
Buddy network via the updates from the
network as well as from each successive
interaction with the user so from there
it's able to create personalized
feedback for each user and this allows
the users to access a variety of
resources such as therapists life
coaches financial planners all in one
inclusive system that operates across
the users devices all permit first dates
are all about what's gonna happen next
take a breath last night you say you
just wanted to meet Alex and take it
from there
you can't control others only how you
react to them so we act
70 beats per minute much better good
keep the heart rate low keep it casual
no need for a handshake this example so
buddy does all of this using natural
language processing as you can see in
the video but he is continually
communicating verbally with the user so
first when it gets input from a user it
general generates responses based on the
general context and this creates
responses that could apply to a variety
of situations and then filters those
responses using any keywords or
anomalies and then defines that further
by user preferences this includes things
like a user's goals interest habits or
existing knowledge level and then
filters by the users current situation
like work or social context or a need
for tact and then adds any privacy
concerns before responding in the
example we just saw of a single self
activating interaction with buddy but he
was initially activated by an increase
that it detected in Taylors heart rate
it knew from the camera that she was not
engaged in any kind of strenuous
physical activity which might otherwise
prompted heart rate increase and it also
knew from his past interactions with her
a Taylor had a history of anxiety
combining this with the knowledge from
her calendar that Taylor was on a date
tonight but he correctly concluded the
Taylor was nervous about her upcoming
date and had to be calm down but he
generated a set of potential response to
the situation and shows the best one a
verbal intervention which had worked
with Taylor in the past afterwards when
Taylor's heart rate did indeed decrease
but he concluded that the intervention
had been a success and deactivated
itself until the next time it was needed
a client may be stressed because of a
project at work so buddy can respond not
just with stress reduction techniques
but with suggestions to solve the
problems in the project Fraser just
underwent renovations as well take a
look oh wow these are amazing okay let's
definitely include some of these
pictures in the presentation buddy can
use skeleton and availability email to
those people certainly the emails
haven't drafted I've also included a
draft to be sent to one of the board
members of a Space Museum it's a
frequent support of the clients
philanthropy efforts and maybe won't
offer a discount you are good okay I'm
gonna look these over and send them out
in a video we saw buddy talking to
Taylor through her earpiece actually I
have my nanas oh but it's a bit more
extravagant
Taylor's so buddy was talking to Taylor
through her earpiece and using her
computer to show her pictures Taylor has
chosen an engagement level of four which
means that buddy up automatically
activates itself whenever it's needed in
a situation and buddy interacts with
Taylor Taylor both both visually and
verbally so while suggesting her IV know
for her event it's always showing her
visual information on her computer
alright so we've seen that buddy works
very well as a proactive system it can
offer assistance to users without them
even having to ask for it but in the
second part of this video we also see
that buddy can take verbal direction so
when Taylor asks buddy to send emails
for her but he has the situation the
situational awareness through email
access to know both who Taylor's
referring to when she says those people
and the appropriate way to format a
professional email now but he also has
buddy net work input and buddy the Buddy
network has built financial management
tools into buddy's responses this is how
buddy is always searching for a more
cost-effective way to do things so buddy
automatically finds a board member who
might be willing to offer a discount but
he also has privacy settings so he knows
that Taylor likes to review all emails
before they're sent and he automatically
saves the emails as drafts for Taylor's
approval but he also knows Taylor's user
settings so buddy is aware that Taylor
likes verbal updates and using the
camera and microphone bubble buddy can
time those verbal updates of what he's
doing to fit in the conversation
naturally so we've seen hear that buddy
can work to de-escalate a stressful
situation using self activated
intervention it can proactively research
users current product projects to help
assist users and it can take verbal
direction in a specific situational
context so going forward we're looking
to expand the buddy market and we're
hoping to lunch publicly within the next
few months thank
I hope thanks very much it's also easy
actually really like the sort of
tongue-in-cheek videos of of you know
sales assistants and associates and
directors and research associates that
you're imagine company and what you've
given us a snapshot of you know the
perfect agent of several years from now
and it's it's fun to see how interesting
it is to just explore thinking through
what that will be like and the pitfalls
and challenges of what experiences will
be like when they're when we have this
sort of full-time life coach trusted
advisor personal assistant blended into
one you know a magical thing and you
know there's a thousand computer science
challenges and human engineering
challenges to figure out there before
we're at that but it's fun to see it's
too fun to see it as if it's alive today
right and that's the step you took
creatively is sort of yes you know that
but you're going to present it you know
straight-faced as if it's completely
existing today and and and and actually
kind of like that sort of humorous twist
on it the I do think the the idea that
there's a company that owns all this
information about me is actually like a
frightening gums concept and that the
most perhaps the most interesting
question it raises is who will own all
of this amazing data about Maeve right
and who has access to that and and the
idea that it's this buddy corporation
and their sort of- valent is a little
bit like perhaps very deliberate on your
behalf but it it's sort of an
interesting bigger question right anyway
I say um hi yes you it was incredibly
ambitious which which I commend but like
a lot of the other projects I like I
fantasized about a small piece of it
which I'll just shared hopefully be
constructive the idea that and I was
reading something about this recently
about it like the idea that it would it
could be a like an anti-anxiety solution
that doesn't require a pill the idea
that you could like detect anxiety
somehow and know that someone know the
right moment which you expressed as a
sort of a challenge just it's not just
heart rate because I could be exercising
whatever's you find that moment of
anxiety and talk the person down like if
you could do that again without a
serotonin inhibitors whatever didn't
have those lexapro or well you know
there's anti-anxiety medications that
they just defined a non-medical you know
and purely sort of talk therapy solution
to something like that would be quite
amazing so that was what I fantasize
like a small piece of what I fantasize
about what you created and generally it
seems like on the one hand you know I
think for all these projects a great
exercise to sort of think large I mean
and and I could see how useful it was to
sort of imagine step-by-step what buddy
was doing on the other hand there's such
value in sort of going into one small
focused effort and I think you know for
in school it's probably great to have
sort of both the range of experiences
but again I just shared my fantasy of
one a small piece of that well done so
this will take it down to a low level
even shooting videos like that and go
through that scenarios is really
interesting for example you notice
things about the design if the cameras
and the ear cuff
it doesn't see anything because of omens
hair is covering the camera you know but
it's not attachment for buddy so you
like to wear your hair down don't fear
you know that's right but does the point
is it the perfect conversation about
designer design parameters and and that
in fact even if it's about something
future by this fact that is this thing
out there the conversation to have
around root aren't bound by investments
because you're all trying to make this
project real but everything you learned
from that conversation can inform the
designs you are making that are real and
I think that's the part where the value
gets teased out and and so it's
provocative a candidate that forces us
to think critically and that's really
helpful thank you thank you so that is
our last school of this year's design
Expo we saw nine schools here are again
the name of the schools we would like to
and highlighted are the name of all the
professors which were with the schools
throughout the course can the
professor's please stand the ones in the
audience and big thank you to the
professors
and also the liaisons are also now
highlighted the liaisons and the
professors are partnering up and giving
great feedback to the schools so they
could select the best project to be here
can the liaisons in the audience pretty
stand and thank you professors and
liaisons and big thanks to the design
Expo organizing team I organized it last
year and it's a ton of work and I have a
big appreciation for people who organize
a conference like this it's always very
inspiring we hope you are all inspired
but what you saw today and there's a lot
more research and you can access the
website it's on the Microsoft Research
website then you can also access all the
previous years back to not back to the
very beginning but the last like six
years they're all up there thank you
very much sorry we went over time a
little bit Thank You judges Thank You
audience and see you next year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
