you
hi it's my pleasure to welcome Bruce
couch here today Bruce and I both got
our PhDs from the same institution
university of utah he got i got mine a
little bit earlier since then he's been
professor around the country at
northwestern north of chicago and for
last number of years just north of here
in Victoria in addition to professor
he's been taking a lot of the work
that's come out of his research and
turned it into product which I hope
he'll talk to us about today as well
through various startups I guess mmm
anyway thank you my team so like I said
I'm Bruce crew just call me Bruce have
any questions stop me and ask them comic
Tycoon is a is a product an app that my
company insatiable genius just dropped
and if at any time I get it boring all
the technology that I'm going to talk
about is available for free in the
Windows Store so you can get these apps
for free triumph or two days so if you
like it but it's comic effects on the
Windows Store like I said I'm Bruce
Scrooge I pretty much do none I started
out doing non-photorealistic rendering
cameras anymore are ubiquitous most of
us probably have one on us the crazy
thing is about eighty percent of the
images that humans create or
non-photorealistic we create art it's
what we do rating out my focus is
creating tools that allow people to
create content to create digital content
and the best content that the ones that
I like the most are the ones that can
cross over I can do stuff in the real
world and it has some virtual some
digital component or I do something in
the digital world that gives me some
real world artifact okay so as Michael
said in addition to being a professor
for the last three years I've been
running a startup incubator in my lab so
if you look at my Vita on a little light
on publications for the last couple
years on the plus side i've started
we've started 19 companies i have for
multi-million dollars
stable companies that have come out of
the lab insatiable genius tuna fax
gaslamp games DJ arts games I've been
working with these with the cogmed guys
we did it start up with them and we're
building applications medical
applications for kids who have panic
attacks maybe there's lots of stuff
relevant games has been building games
with embedded cognitive therapies for
kids with ADHD like I said this it's
worked fairly well part of the reason is
Victoria and it's part of the reason I
left northwestern to go to Canada we own
everything we build the university just
signed off on it they have a blank I got
a blank check for inventor owned IP
which just didn't exist in the US at any
of the universities that I went to and
so I was able to do this the other thing
is bc for some reason is something sixty
percent of the people in british
columbia run their own business it's the
largest concentration of self-employed
people on the planet is Vancouver who
knew
what 20 they're not me sorry i'm just a
facilitator I did insatiable genius and
tuna facts everything else is my
students yeah yeah and I think kind of
watched me and I part of this is it's an
exploratory process they've watched me
make a whole lot of mistakes and they
watch my few successes and they're like
coaches making money I can do this and
then I just tell him what to do and I
give him space in the lab like the
jetpack laser cat it was three students
that took my freshman game design class
they came to me this really cool final
project I said hey you should do this on
an iPad and then I just gave him space
in the lab over the summer and I let him
give him computers and I let him work in
the lab they showed up every day I
showed him how to incorporate in Canada
how to get a bank account and how to
start stuff on the iphone and they did
it the university gives you the IP or
allows you to keep the IP is that a
conscious decision on that their part or
are they just you know the exception to
the rule it is happened to be that way
they just closed yeah yeah like how they
gonna wake up someday and say wait we
should be like everybody else hold on to
the IP or they are they trying to foster
this new one exorcism yeah I could get a
big in HP or at Google it'll products
which will flip but so far they get a
lot of mileage out of it because I'm
there's a there's an incubator in Canada
called enterprise and my numbers are
better than enterprise so so like I said
they're getting mileage in the alumni
magazines and all kinds of stuff and
then one of the deals that I cut with my
students in their opera shown how to do
operating agreements and I'm like do
this and you'll never get in trouble if
you make if you do two percent of your
profit of your net and say that I'm
going to start a scholarship program for
computer science students at uvic with
that two percent of my net nobody will
ever nobody's ever coming after ya and
so they've all done that and the catch
for them is well they got to make money
right being a faculty member right but
you know two percent is two percent you
got to make money and so they're all
over it you know and everybody's like oh
that's fair i'll do that that sounds
great yeah okay so i've released a bunch
of apps and this is through insatiable
genius i tune pained is one and this is
research that I started forever ago take
a picture make something that looks like
a cartoon just black and white then you
can paint it in with your finger
painting colors that one has about three
million users now and this it's on
iphone android windows 8 and then
samsung pencil effects we drop this one
last fall about not quite a year ago and
this is a new engine that we developed
over the summer I take a picture and
it'll give you something looks exactly
like a pencil drawing this one has about
50,000 users okay so that's what I've
done and I'm going to pull back the
curtains here let me show you how I do
it and uh I kind of look at art I have a
three-part process for working I look at
art and psychology and computers and I
get ideas kind of from all three of them
we did a color to gray algorithm and it
came from looking at a book by margaret
mitchell the psychologist a lot of the
work that I do has been
non-photorealistic I'm making art and
its really tough to sell art to a
computer science crowd right why should
I care you're making art and so what I
started doing is looking at
psychological evaluation I'm going to
make an image that's going to make it
easier for you to perform a task then
then a photograph will write we all know
that like a technical manual certain
images that we make are better at say
facial recognition and if I can measure
a performance increase then that's
something that I can that is a
validation of this type of work right
and then sometimes its computers I find
a new tool that tool makes something
that looks like art or that tool enables
me to tweak some psychological process
right some cameras make really good edge
images
let me see into the infrared there's
things I can do with infrared some give
me depth well if I've got depth what can
I do so usually there's some inspiration
but I'm trying to combine these three
things another one is known versus
unknown right usually I'm pretty happy
if I don't know what's going on because
if I don't know what's going on then
maybe no one knows what's going on but
then you have to check yourself because
I'll run into things I don't know what's
going on but do I have to go back to the
book or somebody else's book so there's
this interplay right is this thing no
nor is it unknown do i need to go read
the papers is it in the papers is it in
the book right and then this idea of
top-down versus bottom up a lot of what
I do is very bottom all right i just i
play with things i look at them i put
together image filters until it looks
like art but then you've got to back off
and say what's going on here why does
this work why does this produce this
result or why does this can I look at
the bigger picture is there a bigger
picture does this mean anything computer
science at all so it's once again this
thing where we do the close-up we do the
high view and like I said usually I'm
close and I try and work on things I
don't understand versus things that I do
so today I want to talk about comics and
in this comic process this is a crazy
thing ever since humans have had writing
and art we've made comics right it's one
of the first things that people do when
they invent new languages let's start
making comics I'm going to do a picture
and a thing so you know the Bayou
tapestry the other Ronan the Egyptian
hieroglyphics they're also amazingly
effective right the 911 comic actually
outsold the 911 report more people read
the comic book than read the report as
far as imparting technical information
they're fantastic process information do
this do this do this the US military
still uses a comic that was developed in
World War two called the soldiers call
it how to love your rifle but it shows
you the cleaning in the operation of a
military weapon and it's a comic book
that you get they also give you one that
showed you how to file your taxes turns
out it's eighty percent more effective
eighty percent more soldiers file taxes
if you give them the comic book and if
you give them a sheet that shows them
how to do it right images and words we
put them together you get more than one
one or the other so why don't we all
make comics and the big one is the
crisis of realism right I want to paint
that you know I want to paint this and
boy oh boy I paint that right the other
one is schools don't really value
drawing in North America by fifth or
sixth grade I'll get half an hour of art
as an enrichment activity once a week
and usually they just let you go okay
guys first piece of paper draw something
you know so I draw a stick figure the
guy next to me draws something amazing
and I quit crumple crumple crumple well
we're done with that right and that's
what I can do right i can take what I
knew was I could take a picture and I
could give you something to look like a
comic the prominent what I really
thought the beginning was I'll just put
bubbles into tune paint and it didn't
work it makes this and so I went back to
the drawing board and I came up with a
five-part process this is how people go
about creating comics I just once again
unknown I don't know how to do it I go
to the note I got every single book I
could find and I read through him until
like came up with a process and then I
talked to I have a lot of Facebook
friends that are comic artists you know
and I just asked him questions how do
you do this how do you do this how does
the process work well there's a pencil
or and there's an inker and there's this
kind there's that guy the big one the
first big thing is composition we all
take photos there's tools on my phone
that show me how to take a photo where
it lines stuff up the problem with a
comic is I've got to leave enough room
in my composition for the bubble right
and then I've got to have some kind of I
control because if you look at most
comics there's something about the way
my eyes work in the way that it makes my
visual process work all right my macula
will track in a certain way
so this guy's eyes kind of pointer his
nose line points toward that bubble and
draws your attention to it when we start
putting together panels it becomes even
more complex and this for me was pretty
cool I've done a lot of work in
composition I built tools that helped
you simulate the work of Jackson Pollock
and one of the crazy things about
Pollock paintings is everything hits the
same fractional dimension he has a very
small range and the fractal dimension
with his paintings and you can show that
he went in and cropped to hit this
fractal dimensionality as a physicist
named Richard Taylor at the University
of Oregon who studied this forever and
so I just built a coaching tool that
helped you okay if you put some more
fine stuff here you'll get closer and
closer and you want this fractional
dimensionality to be about 1.7 and it
turns out to be freakishly difficult to
get things near 1.7 but then when we did
force choice experiments later things
that were closer to 1.7 were actually
the audience like the more if I give you
two things one of the 16 m over the 17
you're like the 17 on average people on
average like the 17 they did more than
they like the 16 of the 18 so it turns
to it seems to work this is one that I
did this is once again looking at a
mobile device let's say you're out whale
watching you see the whale somebody
takes a your wife takes a picture of you
and you want to send it to your grandma
on a mobile phone we kind of have a
couple of options right I can crop I can
scale which in my case is wonderful
because I just lost like 40 pounds or we
can chop the image apart put it back
together in a way that gets the
important things all into an image that
fits in to a small speck right and I'll
talk a little bit more about this later
but that worked pretty well and what
we're doing is using combining computer
graphics with some machine vision a
little bit of artificial intelligence to
recut these images to fit a given size
specification once that worked we did
the same thing with vector animations
and this worked really really well
because an SVG I just have a tree it's
this image I can annotate things or give
them away and
as things get smaller or larger we
change based on these weightings and
this worked really really well for
informational images right because in
Canada well I need to see what these
numbers are right if I do a uniform
right if I lose information my image
uniformly I'm going to lose him I want
to i'm going to lose important
information if we can annotate
importance then we can resize a better
fashion for the wally wood stuff for the
comics i tried everything and what I
fell back on was I found this thing
called the Hollywood made called panels
that always work and Wally is the guy
who wrote the original comic with
Stanley whenever the military in World
War two that's showed soldiers how to
file their income tax forms and Wally
had made this poster and he put it on
his on the wall behind his desk that
said hey don't you know don't reinvent
the wheel with every panel you draw just
use these most of the time and so I I
basically what I built was just that
it's a wally wood composition tool you
choose a panel and i just i can show you
either of them or like a cycle throw
them choose a panel and i just put it on
your camera right so you aim your camera
move the camera put you in there snap
the shot like i said not this is one
where there wasn't a whole lot of
technical stuff you know what I mean I
didn't reinvent the wheel I went out and
found something that worked I used it
instead of doing something with a whole
lot of technical specification a
technical difficulty the next thing was
a new incline algorithm and one of the
problems on a mobile device is that I
there's there's just a limit to the
computational complexity that I've got
right when we started doing this on an
iPhone 3 you know I get the
computational complexity of a stopwatch
the modern stuff i get a GPU but i'll
suck your battery dead in no time
and but what I really need is something
that works fairly well it is consistent
it takes 10 seconds it takes 10 seconds
and then on the on the devices of when
we went to Windows 8 I get a whole lot
more pixels and a better computational
model and I get more memories so it
actually worked really well and this is
based on some work actually started this
for my dissertation about 12 years ago
this work we published it said graph in
2006 with two of my graduate students
and basically all we're looking at is
difference of gaussians and with Cameron
hear what I'm trying to do is draw these
edge lines just wherever you see the
black lines so that would be the the
basics of the comic and all this is
difference of gaussians I'm going to use
a gaussian filter run multiple Gaussian
filters and DIF them to make an image
stack right so multiple blowers of the
image do a difference between these
things and it finds these edge lines the
problem is if you look at Cameron looks
a little bit on my screen but those
lines are really harsh right it doesn't
look like a comic it looks very
pixelated ok so we smooth em this was
kind of the other contribution there we
used anisotropic diffusion to smooth
everything and what we found is we could
run multiple iterations of the anti so
traffic diffusion and then the Gaussian
differencing and then one other thing is
when you look at an edge we usually
think of an edge so this is what the raw
output of those the of the Gaussian
stack looks like and we're due to a
threshold instead to decide where an
edges and usually what we get is some
sort of impulse right a step function
this is an edge this isn't an edge and
we just started looking at them as at an
age function and this gives us this kind
of softened edge
and that's what we were doing about yes
seven years ago and seven years ago on a
good computer on a fast computer I could
get this to run in about 20 frames a
second writing it produced at 640 by 480
and it produced a kind of jaggi video
but it worked um like I said it work the
stuff that I do today is crazy because I
well the other thing that you do when I
do okay so I'm going to go out i'm going
to make better edge lines i'm going to
make better video and my goal here was
to be able to shoot to make something to
look like a comic have a still image
that looked amazing looked like a comic
book image but have something that would
run fast enough that I could do video
now today video on a mobile device you
can do it but there isn't a whole lot of
video sharing there's kind of two
companies that are doing it right now
that are trying to do the kind of
Instagram thing with video you're
limited to six seconds 640 by 480 in
most cases and it just hasn't caught on
people aren't doing it but I'm saying
okay I'm going to position my company
for the future we're going to try this
so the first thing I did is I started
building tools because I knew that I
wanted to be able to I wanted to be able
to do this low-level thing I want to be
able to program in matlab right and look
at these filters and these iterative
filters and things are going to be going
crazy you know my diagram before was
fairly straightforward i'm going to do
in an edge image i'm gonna do a color
image and i'm going to do a compositing
step and get a final thing out if you
ask i'll send you my other one it's a
giant spaghetti of things we're doing
we're basically mini lee mimicking a lot
of visual processes that happen in the
human visual system so I've got feed
forward and feedback and i'm using the
edge lines to inform the color process
and the diffusion process and all kinds
of things are going on and it's kind of
the secret sauce behind everything but
but what I knew that I wanted to do is
be able to prototype in MATLAB because I
figure if I'm not working in MATLAB I'm
not doing anything that's cutting edge
I'm just refining somebody else's
solution and but i want to see these
thing work on a GPU on a mobile device
so Brad Larson is a chemistry student
and he'd built a system that it would
allow you to work in MATLAB using image
processing tools and it would
automatically kick out GPU code so we
started leveraging his stuff and we
actually worked with him quite a bit
we've debugged a lot of his stuff and
then we ported it to android and that's
out there you can download it on github
right now and then we ported it to
Windows 8 and I haven't released that
code because I know that it only works
on a note on a single Nokia phone so the
Nokia guys were happy with it it was it
was selling apps and we're like okay
that's as part we're not letting the
other developers touch it at this point
that's the first step in a build some
tool so I get to play with everything
and this ended up being this ended up
paying off really big time later on
because the memory requirements for what
we're doing or so are vast so what I do
when you interact when you're changing
things like they go into the app and
change buttons like you're using a large
medium or small filter we're actually
generating shader on the fly and ends up
being about 17,000 lines of shader code
that we generate and after that we just
use your shader right and the second the
higher order parameters you get to move
the sliders you get to play with and
that those are feeding into your shader
we're actually building a shader on the
fly for you so this worked out really
well for us okay so these should play
this should be a video and bad things
seem like they're happening
come on baby play
no no
okay doesn't matter um this is well Thor
versus the ice giant in my backyard with
me and the neighborhood kids and
basically what happened if this video
was playing you'd see that it's pretty
noisy and this is my first pass on this
kind of stuff and I'm getting noise in
two ways i'm getting noise from these
edge lines and i'm getting a little bit
i'm getting quite a bit of color noise
back here so i went through and tuned
everything that I could yeah i'm just
using diffusion in the soft quantization
once again at this we're playing this is
after that Valkyrie is stabbed me I'm
laying here on the ground there's I'm
getting a lot of noise over here in the
in the background where the trees are
and it's the trees are moving but
they're in shadow so I looked at
parameter variations but it turned out
that if you do a bit of analysis most of
my noise is coming where edges are right
i'm getting the bulk of the noise and
edges i look at everything i looked at
all kinds of parameters and once again i
can mail you these slides you'll just
see that it's it's crazy new easy and i
wasn't really able to get rid of a lot
of the noise from these things and what
it turns out is that the problems of low
light and texture and you can see on
this these are a couple of images i
believe it's scarlett johansson low
light areas or what were the worst for
us and then these high texture areas ram
and here's another example this is a
finer grain you can see that everywhere
where I've got like her hair right here
this is the worst because I've got low
light and the repetitive texture these
are images videos stopped here so what I
did and the whole thing behind what I've
been doing since 2006 is it's very low
level um if i get rid of all the noise
in a single image right if I decrease
the noise as far as we can in a single
image it seems that we that seems good
enough when we move it to video and I
was going to talk about this before on
yes if I can get multiple images they're
just simple bayesian 'he's work but then
i've got to do the registration problem
which tended and we talked about this
earlier there just isn't good
registration stuff outside of microsoft
that was freely available and so then
i'm solving an entirely different
problem on an iphone on the original for
i could trick it into taking two images
at once and then the stored the second
image in swap space and then you could
just do simple things you could do a
bayesian or you could just do an average
over the two images because he'd ended
up being really registered the camera
would just flip twice any cognitive most
of the noise but i haven't been able to
do that again and the other problem is
even with this camera in a vice so i
clamped this into a vice on my desk and
I was looking I was playing with low
light and so I was taking a picture the
inside of my file cabinet with my camera
and a vice just pushing this even with
the darn thing device moved me about six
pixels on average and so that that was
just another level of complexity so i
ended up for mobiles dropping down to a
single image but yeah if i could get 33
would be magic and all the noise goes
away so this is another low light in
texture example let's see where i am
wait today okay I must've gotten rid of
those slides at a whole bunch we talked
about noise how I moved him to the color
section okay so what I did was
everything I did was local adaptation
asymmetric filter kernels and what I
started doing was orienting them based
on flow images so i can crew calculate
optical flow really quickly orient based
on the optical flow so that everything
runs my folder criminals run in the
direction of the optical flow that
worked really really well and then
orient the filter and that got me to
here so once again it's pretty good
right I'm still in this place where
we're in the dark and the shadow yeah
it's not really great so I I did
something totally see that I don't know
it's biologically inspired in the
filters I started looking at the morph
count if I were going to use a
morphological operator so I look at the
16 neighborhood or the eight
neighborhood of a pixel and I just
invert the filter response so does that
make sense what was happening right here
and I'm this only works because i'm
looking at a black and white image right
but i look at the pixels and i look at
the 16 of the eight neighborhood right
whatever my filter size is and if I've
got more black than white I used the
same filter response if I've got more
white than black I flip it and the only
reason I was able to do this is because
there was an if I get in if now in the
shader generator I get one if in my
shader so I can make this one if call
and then I just changed that impulse
response but that ended up actually
working really well now it's generated
an artifact and it but the artifact is
pretty difficult to see because if you
look at her hair right here I've
generated those weird artifacts where
it's exactly it's a fence posting I'm
exactly right on those where it's coming
across and where it's oriented and its
interests but it's okay because it just
looks like a single
fake hair right i mean this very uniform
textural visual feel that it's giving me
this little heart of fact that goes
across it so then take this to diffusion
to an anisotropic diffusion same thing
we did back here in black and white
across that I just did it across the
color channels black and white and I
struck diffusion them push it together
and that artifact goes away and so
that's what pencil effects is
and then if we just generate we can
generate paper textures on the fly and
blend her onto it once again almost all
of the noise that came out of the
algorithm has gone now right and people
just read it as the paper texture noise
but i really like like we look at her
fingers and then her lips it all looks
pretty good and then these are just some
parameter variation changes so I've got
a couple sliders here where we can
change the size of the filters and then
how much diffusion and then the weight
how much weight we give to the diffusion
image versus the edge image we get a
variety of styles but like I said it
worked fairly well but it was a lazy
slider some yeah her ciders I give him a
preset and then there's a small medium
large that's the filter kernel size and
we had names for him and I can't
remember what they are you get a small
medium large extra large and then sort
of a blend one and it
here's ten combinations I'm thinking
right to hit that's the other and that's
kind of the Instagram the Nokia guys
push us for that and I didn't like it
because what we found is if you get the
user if I do everything for you you
think the Machine did it if I give you
some input even if the Machine did
ninety percent the user believes that
they did it this is the art that i
created and i did a I i did a graffiti
app i thought it was a coolest thing
I've ever done but we did almost
everything for you all you did was type
and then you got these graffiti images
it was a coolest thing ever in the
backgrounds I I spent forever on this I
was able to embed QR barcodes and they
looked like the background so did the
human eye it looked like a graffiti tag
but he took a picture of it you could
read the QR barcode so to be a tag but
the tag would take you to your website
you could use it for pricing all kinds
of stuff people I hate it hate hate hate
it because the machine does everything
that's just typing who cares and so yeah
this puts out this outputs video and I
kept a really great video but this is
what it looks like this is a hand
drawing and it's that whole a sure thing
if the source file is there let's try
cryptic
it's probably giving a graphics talk
right
yep
Seether this one ah this is this is the
next one that I was going to show said
this is this is the magnification talk
the stuff that you were talking about
before the guys at MIT that have been
doing the image magnification stuff so
they can see your pulse I'm doing
something similar but I'm doing it along
the temporal dimension to give you a
Cassidy Curtis style image abstraction
this is this one
but on the iphone this will run I can do
this on an ipad 3 in real time at about
30 frames a second so I could pan it
around you guys could see it but this
works really quite well I could show you
this one
see these things just pop and
scintillate everywhere but it's mostly
along the edges and Ian see there's some
noise in the color space but it's far
higher when we get to that edgy kind of
thing that we're doing which makes a lot
of sense right it's where the big
changes are happening so far it seems
like there's sort of the same low-level
algorithm going on for every basil or
every area image you get there for let's
see what my detail everywhere well some
artists would abstract away the detail
in places that are unimportant and just
show you the detail the faces things
they want you to look at maybe with that
sort of higher level abstraction
focusing the detail in the places you
want people to hit touch it
yes and no it's like I have two hats
right so as an academic yeah I did that
liquid the cell phone stuff when I take
that hat off and put on the developer
hot no there's a lot of apps out there
that do that kind of thing you need to
take a picture I'll show you a black and
white like a color on color or let you
scrub on a blur you know we're paint on
so I'm going to blur everything except
the part that other part so as a
developer I have to make money to keep
my little shoestring startup going and
so I've kind of stuck with stuff that
made money and where there was a ton of
competition other people were doing it I
didn't right so it's you know it doesn't
want to have it doesn't matter trying to
debate this I'm just thinking like one
of the ways to eliminate the noise being
distracting the trees is by will just
blurring that all away because it's true
we don't care people right and the real
problem with that at the end of the day
and I'll talk about more later I need to
be able to do foreground background and
I could do a simple one right have you
paint on the foreground paint what's
important but that assumes that i have
robust segmentation and i didn't have
really robust segmentation and so later
on it's what I'm working on right now
it's what I'm doing today like we might
graduate student gave a talk on it last
week so that's exactly what I'm working
on I want fast or bus segmentation and I
want a very specific property out of
that segmentation so what's the temporal
abstraction and you guys saw that color
algorithms so here's where i'm getting
i'm just going to show you the slide
so there's a slide let's going to find
me nope that's the source
if you look at this it may be a little
bit difficult to see because I've got
this I'm getting that ton of noise right
there and then if you look at my face I
hadn't shaved that day and so when I
move my face I'm getting a lot of color
noise and then on the back of the chair
where I'm sitting and so this is one of
the things I spent forever like six
months working on this
like I said the thing in the inversion
stuff worked really well on the line
images and this is one of the things
it's not so much a technical thing it's
like I went back to the drawing board I
said okay where does noise come from
turns out that noise comes in their side
sort of two types of noise random noise
and pattern noise when i started doing
experiments there wasn't a lot most cell
phones aren't calibrated but I'd have to
take get you to take yourself through
this massive calibration stop like go
into a really dark room take two photos
and then I could get rid of a lot of the
like the dark Corinth reap the thermal
noise but getting somebody to do that
for their phone might they probably most
people probably wouldn't do it and it
was heinous and then once again I ended
up with the segmentation thing and
here's well me wearing a hoplite helmet
and showing you the kind of noise I
could did it also comes in sort of three
flavors signal dependent
temperature-dependent time-dependent and
like I said I worked on this for an
entire summer just looking at the kinds
of things we could do the kinds of
algorithms that I could get and in this
photo once again if we if you could just
turn on a light I think the gentleman
will do you can see a lot more of the
noise it's just because it's really
light in there but I've classified these
based on the two different types this is
one's getting me in a hop and a
reflective a highly reflective hoplite
helmet and you can see all the different
kind of noise that I'm generating that I
want to get off we can turn the lights
back up please and what i found out when
i started talking to users doesn't
matter I'm like what do you mean that
doesn't matter and I'm like huh and I'd
worked forever on motion and focus right
how do I get rid of motion and focus
doesn't matter if the picture doesn't
work we'll take another one it's my cell
phone I'm like you're kidding as a
researcher I'm like no this is a big
problem this is huge yeah we don't care
so that's my daughter Zoe her dinner was
too hot and she's Fanning it
right well so he could you just hold the
fans still instead of waving it this is
my cat Percy and he's doing both things
he's in the dark and he's moving as I
took this picture of Percy being naughty
and it just doesn't matter i'll take
another picture once again that was the
thing i went back to the books i cooked
up everything i could i tried to do
everything on the cell phone that I
possibly could at the end the day that
answered all my research problem was
don't care that's what Percy was doing
amazingly difficult students don't see
the irony in this situation at all this
however I was able to get a lot of I was
able to do quite a bit of stuff on a
mobile device two of the real problems
that you have our low contrast ultra low
contrast and then the stuff that I was
doing was muddy and like Jessica this is
one of my engineers Jessica if I can go
into Photoshop and just pop her eyes out
as white she looks 10 times better right
but any the diffusion process her there
isn't enough difference in the color
near her eye and her eye color it just
gets kind of muddy right but a comic
artist would pop that out you make this
pop hill to do this weird thing where
you make that near that fold at the
bottom of your eye about 10 times larger
than it actually is if you look at it
artwork artists draw those things so big
that you could balance a marble on them
because it's something that humans pay
attention to once again a psychology
informs the art looks at the computer
science and here once again this is how
I work there's a lot of evidence that
Monet wasn't was actually quite near
sighted toward the end of his life and
you can see a lot of his artwork in the
early phases is very very tight and then
as Monet ages everything becomes very
very loose right and by garden of
giverny it's completely just shadowy
what people believe now is that monet
painted what he saw there's some
evidence that mode rhian painted the
apple tree in front of his house this is
Monet's apple tree evolving over Monet's
light oh it's
our motor on that's his apple tree bit
of Aldo burrows live turned out he had a
very large tumor in his visual center
near one near his visual center so
there's some evidence that the
abstraction that he was looking at in
the painting was based on those well was
van Gogh color blonde so there's a
Japanese researcher and I forgot to put
his name on my slide which is horde of
me and here they don't look really
different and what this researcher had
found was that if you he done a whole
bunch of work with protozoa color
blindness and he'd built a fairly simple
filter and there's apps now that'll do
it well what would this look like if I
were colorblind turns out if you look at
van Gogh's with proto no color blindness
they look a whole lot better so we took
the Japanese researchers work on color
blindness and the color blindness
problem was an interpolation problem
right I'm going in one I know what I
know what he is I know what B is I draw
an interpolation line this simple thing
that I did is I said okay what happens
if we extrapolate right because what in
what in fact we're doing is reducing
color contrast what happens if we just
use the same data the color blindness to
increase color contrast
and once again are these showing up
really well on them can you guys see a
difference because on my monitor that's
fairly amazing
okay and so this is in the app okay I
think my thing in the app we call this
the juiciness filter and this was
inspired by Bill Buxton's intern who
gave a talk at a temp are one time he
said yeah I want photos it look like
this and I don't know what word to use
but i'm going to call it juicy I want
juicy you're looking photos so given all
that
mmm Katy Perry where are you
I'm not seeing it though
anyway given all that I can do pretty
good video in real time and I've had
three and i just got a snippet of a katy
perry video vegan see it it looks
amazing the color is pulled slightly but
other that's fantastic okay and that
leads me to where I am today and this is
what I'm looking at now one of the
problems that I have that a real comic
doesn't is this thing that I call the
coloring book property so comic books
were made on for color presses and
wherever two colors touched each other
the artist would draw a black line over
that right and it's just an artistic
convention the reason was when the
colors touched everything got muddy so
you draw this black line over the top
and it's called a trap so if we look at
a coloring book and I chose this one
specifically because the artist who did
this didn't do a perfect job there's a
couple places here that aren't trapped
and my algorithms give us that right I
don't have a complete segmentation of
the image I don't have this trapping
property if I had this if I could do
this suddenly the world's my oyster for
a lot of reasons I can go down the I can
go have a conversation with Charles loop
and we can take video if I can process
the video and get this property suddenly
I can go directly to implicit right so I
can have an implicit image but I could
have an implicit video right and uh this
is amazing because megabytes of video
become kilobytes right watermarking
works almost every watermarking scheme
you can come up with I can destroy with
a couple of a fine image transforms grow
it by a couple by an odd number of
pixels shrink it by an odd number of
pixels I can almost always erase your
watermark but if you could throw this
process at the big image at the small
image if it were close BAM watermark
this would work for search right I run
this process on your image save it off
save off this little implicit function
as metadata say hey go find me images
like this and then you just look at that
image metadata right so that's why I'm
do
this the problem that I'm faced with is
I need fast amazingly robust
segmentation and that's what I've been
looking at this is what I did before and
the real problem with segmentation I've
got to enter in perimeter of parameters
that show me how how exactly do you do
that and so in the past what I've done
and what most people do is you're over
segment make the things really really
tight and then use some sort of
watershed to do to simplify these
regions back together to get coherent
regions and with this one I also had a I
used face recognition and I used Koch 80
in Ed Koch Lauren titty important
salience II so i would add the saline
see information or the face recognition
information to these before I ran the
watershed right takes a lot of time not
amazingly robust and this is where the
universe intervened and dropped a
graduate student in my lab his name is
ashlyn Richardson ash has been working
on ash's 35 he's been working on
segmentation his entire life he was a
quant in London and he worked for the
Canadian Space Association and then he
came and started working for me this is
nine dimensional radar data okay and so
what most people do and with what the
gold standard since to use k-means so
you do k means simplification so we're
looking at satellite this is well aerial
data an over fly with radar and they've
simplified this non-dimensional we use
dimensionality reduction iso methanol le
and we use a hybrid of those two to go
from nine dimensions 25 which the radar
community says with most salient so
here's k-means clustering on those five
dimensions and here's our k-means
clustering right we're far far faster
and there's one ash showed me this
so these are trees and so here's normal
trees these trees in this region are
different than all the other trees
because there was a forest fire here 25
years ago and our data shows it and the
k-means doesn't of the ground truth
dolls I told me that this was really
important the one thing that we're doing
and now ash calls these dendrograms what
he's really doing is looking at its
multi-dimensional but all we're doing is
treating right same thing you do but
when does your tree stop and how do you
look at your tree and what everybody
does is they say okay I'm going to do
some sort of Tolerance or distance
parameter and we did not bad we did
algebra so as you're filling up here as
you're filling up this tree type
database we look at secant lines based
on what's the difference between adding
this pixel versus not adding it and we
look for changes in the derivative
basically right so we're looking at
secant lines is this thing tending
toward infinity or not and so we're
finding what amounts to the first
derivative of the change in adding a
pixel versus not adding a pixel but
we're using an algebraic solution we
can't use a calculus based solution this
I think and Michael said that there's a
really strong theory group once again
I'm off the map of where I've ever been
before I've never seen anyone run an
algorithm like this right where I'm
trying to run calculus based on how data
structure fills up a calculus based
solution but i know that i can find
things that look exactly like minima
inflection points and maxima and it
works amazingly well it worked so well
that i can't show you how this haga
rhythm works i got hash just got a
letter from the canadian military saying
that they've given this the defense
stamp i can send you the slides because
we've already given them and i can tell
you about I can't tell you about how the
dendrograms work I can tell you about
how our solution works to stopping but
that's our stopping criteria but yeah it
works really really well and that's what
i'm using my hope is if i get a really
robust segmentation
um I've been using line interval
convolution would have just switched to
a third order runge-kutta to do
smoothing when the smoothing runs out if
I'm in a junction between two color
areas I'll just extend the line and
that's my hope I'll do some flow based
algorithm that goes in between those
regions that will give me this coloring
book property but it's one where I've
got to back off now and see if I can
prove that I have the coloring book
property for every image that I run okay
given that a lot of what I'm looking at
I've used really simple rules for
simplification right so when suddenly in
a really target rich environment and
this these are rules that cartographers
have for simplifying naps and there's a
ton of these and these are other things
that I'm looking at to help me with this
process how do I give myself this
coloring book prot kind of thing so
these exaggeration I'm going to find out
what's important and exaggerate it
that's you know if it's important I'm
getting something important function I
want to draw a line there if not I don't
there's things that I want to eliminate
that aren't important right and how do I
decide on what those things are right
now if it's something like this that
doesn't enclose the region we're calling
it a texture kind of thing your eyes and
close the region but your smile the line
of your smile doesn't so I've got to
leave that one right but maybe my
eyelashes where two things join where a
surrounding region joins a non
surrounding region maybe those can go
away type of vacation can I just
randomly get rid of some of the stuff in
my image and it turns out that under
certain conditions sure if I throw a
bunch of grapes at ya it's the same as
thrown at tennis ball at you right our
visual system doesn't care it's a green
thing in motion we really don't care so
if it's in motion sure right get rid of
it if it's still and it's important then
probably not but it's still an
unimportant like you said throw it away
right
and then outlined simplification and
once again I think that once I can get
an implicit right we can get an implicit
following routine then simplifying what
an implicit function is becomes really
really easy right so i'm not i'm really
not worried about that when I think
that's kind of automatic the type of
vacation I think is going to be a rule
set okay and i just threw these in I
didn't know if I'd go over time around
her time this is just another thing that
I build all of our apps right now you
can create products I've let that thing
go you can get it for free it's and use
in about a hundred apps right now so if
you if you do something with graphics
create a product I can be the price of
cafepress or zazzle higher quality and
the user gets forty percent anyway
that's what I have thanks any questions
okay um toothbrushes and cell phones
I've heard this attributed to many
people but six billion people on the
planet five billion of them have cell
phones four billion of them own
toothbrushes I'm probably gonna keep
working on cell phones
alright thanks for coming folks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
