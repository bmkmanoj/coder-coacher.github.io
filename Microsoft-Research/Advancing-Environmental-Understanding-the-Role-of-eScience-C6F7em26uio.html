se donde esta tarde para mi es un placer
a presentar a damp a damn phase noise to
director dentro de grupo de microsoft
research connections el titulo de su
cita suture levasseur advancing
environmental understanding the role of
e signs please join me welcoming Dante
so so I feel like you know need to have
a grand entrance with a introduction
like that so first of all let me
apologize my talk won't be in Spanish it
will be in English so if you don't
understand it you can blame me and come
talk to me later so as time you
mentioned I'm going to give us talk
about some of the things around East
science and how it impacts and be used
in environmental science and some of the
things we've learned over the last
number of years on how technology can be
applied my emails up there please feel
free to contact me if you don't if i
don't respond right away feel free to
send another one and feel free to bug
Jaime or Harold or Juliana if you want
to get in touch with me so one of the
things I did last year was looking at
the e science workshop was I was looking
back to see what we had originally
talked about about eight nine years ago
at the original e-science workshop and
one of the things that kind of came out
of it was there was a talk by Jim Greg
on 20 questions to a better application
and how you can use technologies for
some of these scientific insights and so
there was a talk on the also on the
online science being the new
computational science and the
interesting part is you know we're still
here eight years later and we're still
trying to get to that point I think a
lot more of the functionality and the
infrastructures air
we're getting to that the other thing
that was very interesting that event
Alex lay also gave a talk there and Alex
is giving a talk tomorrow so you'll get
to hear some of the updated pieces that
Alex will talk about as well but one of
the things that was very interesting in
this and these are some of the slides
from the original talk to Jim did was if
you look at some of the challenges and
what's going on some of these are still
we're kind of working on and still you
know running into as issues but one of
the things that I always found
interesting was the kind of the puzzle
pieces down here that there are
different types of people that can that
are needed for working on some of these
problems so in this eight years ago the
idea was you neva scientists what we
call the miners folk folks looking at
data mining looking at the massive
amounts of data the plumbers folks had
actually understood how to write some of
that infrastructure code and deal with
the lower level piece to keep the data
actually online or together and then
also the tools to help with what we call
the questions and help answer through
things like visualizations or other
types of tools and technologies and
actually I still think that that's a key
piece today one of the challenges in
academia is some of those roles are very
well rewarded even though they're very
important folks that know how to collect
data and actually do a great job of
collecting data are priceless people
that know how to do a great job of
analysis and understanding of the data
and then can find the insights in it are
also very key so how do you actually
balance across all those and do you want
and as it would be a good thing to
actually leverage those people in
different ways so that you know this has
been in the news for ever for less than
number years about the the amount of
data that everyone's dealing with and we
keep seeing more and more of it so how
can we actually take care of it one of
the other things that I always like
bringing into some of the talks of some
interesting books I've been reading and
these are three of them that I was
looking at some of it is are there
different ways of actually
looking at the data thinking about it
are as sink changing in ways that we
need to incorporate into our thinking
both in academia and also in the
research just in general and so just
interesting books to read but a lot of
this has led to the kind of concept of
the fourth paradigm and so we're in that
area of the data in sense of science
we're getting lots of information data
how do you combine it together how do
you gain some insight from it and what
are the tools and technologies that can
be built to enable that one of the
things we look at is are there ways you
can do this and not have to wait forever
to get the tools up can you do it in
what we call it working to working or
you know it's it's running keep
incrementing it keep getting feedback on
it and that's one of the lessons we've
learned over the years was by
implementing a methodology like that
going from working to working on these
implementations you may not solve
everything right away but you're having
interactions with either the scientists
or the users of the consumers of
information whatever in that in that
space to actually find out if it's
working and so it's something to think
about as people are actually designing
their tooling don't wait a year to
deliver it deliver something earlier the
other thing that kind of has happened
over the last couple years that we we
did was you know we started working on
what was called the changing nature of
discovery and there's a number of these
pieces that we were looking at and all
this got put into a overall book the
fourth paradigm which is available for
free you can download it and look at it
but it was written by a number of
scientists and some of our researchers
looking at some of the challenges that
we see at that point and going forward
how they can actually be maybe possibly
be addressed in different ways and
really where we're at in that space
there's also an interesting piece just
on IT how do you actually implement IT
in this new changing world especially IT
for academia and research so you know
this is kind of the traditional prob
that we kind of been looking at and
still goes back how does somebody ask a
question from these many different types
of information sources and get an answer
and not a number answer but an answer
that can actually let them understand
more and go into more detail look for
more information or dive into it but
this leads to many different pieces how
do you share your information how do you
share in a way that others can consume
it how do they find out about it how do
what tooling can you use to access those
do you have to have specialized ones can
you use generalized ones there's a lot
of pieces that go in there and that's
where some of the efforts been going in
to learn from that we're can some
standardization come and some other
tooling be made available one of the
other things I wanted to just kind of
place up here was you know what is e
science alright so we kind of sometimes
get asked that and put up there the
definition that wikipedia has the one
that's from our website but really for
me what it means and it might be hard to
read I see Claudia heaven Harper okay so
what I actually really think it is is
how does you know current and future
products technologies research assets be
applied to some of these challenges to
actually further them right and help
with that scientific insight but in an
easy kinda to use manner the the pace of
Technology both on the hardware side but
also on the software side has out
stripped ability for scientists and
others to actually track it all and be
able to then understand it and apply it
into their space and this is even we've
even seen this in little areas such as
folks that are using Excel maybe are
using 2003 and don't actually see what
has actually occurred in the follow-on
releases the road limits go away your
ability to have large data sets in there
through things like power pivot make it
essentially unlimited on the data size
you can have and have instant access to
the information but because we don't as
a company or others market these
technologies in that space folks aren't
aware of it
and so how do we this is a challenge we
have how do we actually make sure people
are aware of what technologies are even
out there both from us and from others
and how can those you be used for
science area what are the other ones
that was quite interesting earlier this
year Jeff Dozier produced a article was
based on a paper he had written around
the fourth paradigm and how he used it
and was applied to his work for snow
color so Jeff does a bunch of work on
California looking at the snowpack
understanding it but the key piece of it
was bringing together data from both
ground sensor based ones that he has
satellite imagery and models and
bringing those all together to actually
have an understanding of what the what's
happening in the snow packs and not just
for scientific sake but because people
that manage water in California need to
know how much water is potentially there
so that they know how they can actually
let it go do they do they have to
conserve what is the issue and this
becomes more and more of an issue as we
see some some of the climate changes
happening and what are we going to do
with them how do we apply science in
this way so the thing so sometimes think
about is some of the research that
happens it's not just for the pure
research sake and the understanding but
because there's resource managers and
others that need to know how to leverage
that information for their communities
another key thing that's kind of been
come out of a number of these activities
is the value of data and as you kind of
see on this this kind of graph and
photograph type that the the value of it
increases as it gets more clean
processed services are built on it
there's a value to others being able to
use it for their science and when I
mentioned earlier about the challenges
and some of the academic ways of
rewarding folks people that spend the
time actually providing those services
don't not just don't get rewarded but
you also can't get funded to keep
ongoing services even though everyone
else
needs it right people wanted just the
funding agencies just want to pay for
the on new research not research that's
actually being used over and over so one
of the things we've also been looking at
is how can we help folks who do provide
the higher level services that make
again the science quicker and faster for
others are there ways that that can help
be a self-funding type model and that
but that's a challenge in working with
agencies and everything else on how that
can be accomplished so one of the things
I also wanted to kind of highlight is
something we've been looking at within
the overall we call the environmental
ecosystem where you have things like the
what I'll say is the knowledge that you
get directly from this planet we have so
the direct science that comes out and
then you have people that want to take
some sort of action conservation of
information people change with the
pollution oil gas whatever there's some
sort of action that wants to be taken
well one of the things that we've
learned and kind of some of the working
with some of these projects is that
there's needs to be a good information
connection between both what I'll say is
that knowledge side and the action side
and if you break it down a little bit
more folks that are familiar with
technology obviously will recognize that
these are mostly all technology assets
on the left hand side you're having some
sort of data the capture of it the
management of it then you're doing some
sort of analysis on it find something
out of it and then there's this really
interesting part which is the insight
which is a purely human activity this
isn't something that actually happens
from any other programs or others a
human actually sits her and says wow I
think there's something here and I'm
going to actually write this up codify
it in a paper and I'm going to publish
my information and data and that's great
if all you want to do is kind of keep it
within the scientific domain and share
it with others but if you want to have
it have an impact with others within
this kind of the community either
policymakers the general public and
others there
to be a way to inform them so
communicating with them in a way that
makes sense to them which isn't usually
the scientific paper and also the
credibility for them increases when they
can dive back into the data and actually
feel that that it's real and it's not
just a graph or video or slide so we've
been looking at this as well how can
that how can we help with some of these
and the action side there's also an
interesting piece we when we were
looking at this so there's the overall
communication on it but then there's
another human piece called the decision
so some decision gets made we're going
to do some sort of carbon taxing we're
going to do conservation and there's
laws or other pieces policies put in
place and then it there's some sort of
implementation well unless that
implementation is verified and there's
scientific kind of data being captured
and actually published back it doesn't
it doesn't matter so there's this kind
of circular piece of both the
communication both ways and that's kind
of where we see the technology fitting
is that ability to help underlie a lot
of this and make that more seamless the
ability to dive back into the scientific
information and data and see what's
actually happening and the other part
that's really interesting when you kind
of take a step back even further is that
policymakers or elected officials or
whoever get bombarded by many different
organizations and scientists and people
and lobbyists and all sorts of things
and so there has to be ways that they
you get your message across to them in
ways that they can understand and that's
kind of the the reality of the situation
just because you understand what the
sitch what might help it doesn't mean
that that's what's going to happen if
that was the case none of us would be
driving cars because we'd be saving on
pollution and we'd be helping with
climate change but there's a reality to
how economic development happens the
other couple of other key things that
we've you know been noticing and you've
been seeing over time as kind of things
like the the data flood from the even
illogical type information right now in
the situation where you have
lots of information coming in you have
cheap technology that gets really good
precision and accuracy and can collect
more and more data and you can store it
away that's the cost of storage has gone
down how do you start dealing with this
and it's all being built on essentially
commodity computing but the harder part
is actually what are you driving from it
what is it actually meaning and that's a
lot more with the tooling needs to come
in the visualizations and other analysis
tools and also new algorithms and new
ways to communicate that as well folks
in the environmental space see this all
the time all the different types of data
that we have to be dealt with from hand
one data in the field to automated and
kind of measurements as well you know
sample collections outputs of our models
all these kind of need to come together
to help get a better picture of what's
actually going on in the environmental
spaces and this leads to what we call it
you know this kind of data integration
piece how do you start bringing all
these together from all these different
levels from the spatial-temporal
challenges of data at different levels
the precision on them the gap and the
quality of them the precision of them
it's all through there also you're
dealing with rasters points you know
other types of images how do you kind of
bring all these ones together and this
is kind of some of the projects we've
been looking at in different ways and
then why it's kind of interesting is we
were doing a project on as motifs Asher
project which was looking at getting
modis data providing the
evapotranspiration information from it
over 30 years so we're pulling the data
directly from NASA processing it
understanding which ones were the cloudy
days which ones weren't and going
through this even for folks in the
computational side from our side that
we're working on it this took a lot of
effort for the scientists it was even
harder and we were actually using Azure
on the backend so our cloud computing
platform to paralyze it and the poor
scientists we were working with was
really original II trying to do this
with just one pc and so it becomes a
challenge we don't want
site scientists to have to get to this
level to get science ready data so
that's that idea on the value of the
data goes up as it's being processed and
made available and so why is this really
kind of key is that because really in
reality the the science kind of happens
when you start bringing together all
these different data sets from the
different levels and actually kind of
mashing it up if you if you say and what
can we actually gain what knowledge can
we understand from that and what
predictions can possibly be made so
improving the models but also allowing
for other predictions to be made and
then you know because we deal with folks
in supercomputing centers and others not
everyone has access to all these
information to the large data set how
can you provide that in a way that
scales out to a lot more individuals so
this was the project we were working on
on the ashram Otis pulled together many
different data sets the imagery download
even just things like that tracking the
ftp transfers from from NASA which one's
worked which one's den which ones
actually had errors within the the data
sets doing the reprojection doing some
of the other activities and actually
presenting it for the scientists
actually do something with then that's
actually where it gets interesting but
all this other processing also had to
happen just to get to that point so how
do we put that how do we make that more
available to others so that you're not
starting from Ground Zero every time so
some of the other kind of projects we've
been we've been working on the micro
meteorology project looking at putting
sensors within the web the Atlantic
amazon of one of the forests there some
of alex's students were working on this
as well with us and researchers and how
do you bring again them together and be
able to look at some of the present the
data in different ways so sensor data in
the field and you're dealing with
battery life all the other issues but
once you get the data back what can you
do with it
and one of the challenges you know
especially with sensor information and
data is nature isn't like the lab you
know things happen in nature you know
animals bite the the sensor termites
will will gather around the heat sources
so how do all those effect also the the
readings and information that you're
gathering there's also another project
we've been we've been working on which
is this combination of taking some the
biology from the waterways understanding
what the biological processes are going
on there combining that with the spatial
information and seeing if we can start
pulling together data across the world
understanding how the objects or that
said the plants are the life forms
within different regions how do they how
do they correlate between them and so
we've been also looking at all these
ones what are the infrastructures that
we need to provide this and so this is
something we've been we've been testing
out and now we're actually starting to
go forward with even more implementing
those and you can see different types of
visualizations being applied in spatial
areas and and even we've been working
with some of the folks that provide
these drifters that float along in the
ocean and seeing how does that
information get because you're dealing
with point sources how do you apply that
within the models to actually visualize
that to actually gain some insight out
of it one of the other things that's
really key that we look at and it's
that's something just in general with
data and information this is what we
call discoverability accessibility and
consume ability of the information the
data and you need to have actually all
three of them to actually allow someone
to do something or do at something
interesting and so the discoverability
is not just you know where is it can I
find it right because a lot of times
that's hard one of the hardest problems
and it's not just doing a search but
fighting a search of the information
you're looking for the accessibility but
can you actually get to it is it on an
FTP
you need to have a secret handshake to
get to is it through some sort of
website that you have to click a whole
bunch of buttons and then try to
download it and then actually once you
get access to it or you can do some of
it what can you really do with it is
there some sort of technology tooling
that could actually pull it in and allow
you to do something more interesting
with it and so these are some of the
common pieces we work on it and if you
don't have all three of them the data
might as well be in a file cabinet so
we've been working on one of the other
pieces we've been looking at is kind of
a way to describe this we call it the
environmental informatics framework it's
more just a way to talk about how to
bring these data sets together so allow
data from different data sources that
you want to pull from it and sharing it
and bring together the you know
everything from make it easier for
people to do but really kind of allow
that information that got to go back and
forth and get to the access to it and
then do it in a simple way so one of the
thing we looked at was oops isn't it
there we go was what kind of
applications are out there what are
people currently doing and what are some
of the challenges and one of the things
is there's a lot of different types
applications devices try to have access
to all these different data sets you
know different smartphones different
types of equipment and you're having it
in different sources and so is there
ways to actually make it easier than
this kind of spider web of doing one for
one to the different data sources and so
one of the things that's been going on
is there's been work on the open data
protocol and so we've been looking at
that and utilizing that as a way to
combine a lot of these data sets
together in a simple and easy kind of
way to use it at a manner and kind of
what open data protocol is really about
is it's based off a little Adam
specification feeds and so it can allow
data to be published in a way that can
be consumed very easily across any
platform and it's implemented in such a
way that can be or designed in such way
they can be implemented on any platform
and one of the things we've learned over
the last number of years with the
internet just in general is
simple to use and implement
specifications are the ones that are the
ones that get most widely deployed and
so one of the reasons why really
interested and could have been you and
leveraging on some of the work on the
open data protocol is because it is
simple it can be implemented Lee it's
different platforms and it already has
there's SDKs on different platforms and
it gives you information now something
you can do now not waiting for the
solution that's always just around the
corner and so this has been very
interesting that we've been looking at
it they've just added geospatial data
support as well so that helps especially
in some of this areas that we're looking
at with environmental space and so we've
had number of projects that have been
kind of leveraging this infrastructure
and going forward with it and we're
constantly kind of looking for places
where it could be utilized and really
all it's doing is allowing that on the
wire protocol to allow interoperability
across these data sets and one of the
things that even just I like about it is
it gives you at least information about
the data like the data type so it may
not give you all the information or
semantic type things that allow you to
combine it with anything but for the
most part there's usually data or
information kind of L say embedded
assumed within a lot of different data
sets and so you still need the human in
the loop to say yeah you know this data
and this data are kind of similar or
from what the for the uses I'm going to
use it for their similar and I'm
actually going to combine those together
and mash them up so it gives you that
ability to do it just even knowing that
that what the most common format that
people send around to each other is csv
that gives you no information on data
type at least this is the next step up
that allows you information that you can
start consuming it much quicker and
actually doing something with it and so
there there's some other technologies
that are coming out of Microsoft in
different areas one out of the sequel
Azure labs looking at what's called data
Explorer the ability to combine some of
these data sets together and mash them
up and actually change the
not just change them with the values
pull from 0 data data sets this is
something that we find really
interesting we've been looking at it how
can be used in some of these other
environmental projects if you're
interested you can go up there and sign
up for an account as well and try that
out and see if it'll work there's both a
version that runs locally on your
machine and also a version that runs
directly in the cloud as well so it's a
it's something kind of very interesting
to try out and they're looking at you
know the same kind of things we're
looking at which is how do you add
manage the data sources you know kind of
enrich it by combining them mashing them
up together and then and cleaning them
up if you have to do some transformation
on them and then being able to publish
it out oh and in some cases on the
business side they're looking at how you
could actually make it available for
let's say for sale but you can also have
it as a snapshot so somebody can just
play with a version of it or you could
have it constantly as a live feed one of
the other challenges we can look at
especially in the scientific side is
this a whole challenge of of you know
with more and more compute being
available some more models get done
where computation happens the storage
going down more people people creating
new storage or storing away more
information is doesn't get used and so
while we can always save more and more
of it if it never gets used is it really
that valuable and so there's that
interesting balance there and so
providing some other information on it
maybe making it more available to others
could be a way to help with it the other
interesting part is are there other ways
to data-mine that information so either
collected information or model outputs
or other ways of dealing with it there
was an interesting project right across
at the University of Minnesota that was
data mining on modus datasets imagery
over the number years and what they
could start telling from it was between
the imagery was where fires had happened
we're in the case of the Amazon or
others we're logging had happened and
clearing
me and you can start seeing some of
these changes based on vegetation and
other parameters but it was really just
applying some of the machine learning to
it to actually look at these datasets
over time in the same area and so you
know that's one of the reasons why we
kind of look at are there ways that you
can share this information out earlier
or more often so that others can
actually consume it maybe find some
other use of it that you originally
didn't think it was designed for so we
also kind of looked at you know new ways
to analyze and communicate with the
information and data it's been some work
within Microsoft in our european
organization that's been working with
folks in the eea and others around the
world on this I on earth project which
is a way to bring in other information
and data and both consumer ones but also
process ones from like the eea and
there's they're creating more these what
they call network watches you can go out
to the site and see what they're doing
but it's kind of an interesting again
model for bringing together data sets
and making them available to the public
so again how do you make that connect
that communication part and inform
people on the data we also have a group
in our lab in Cambridge in the UK that
focuses on computational ecology and
environmental science and so there's a
bunch of work that they're also doing on
model outputs and model development and
some other interfaces and both I wanted
to highlight their their website there
but there's some other interesting
papers and activities going on there and
one of them they've been looking at is a
global carbon feedback model helping
bring in more than uncertainty into the
models and actually can you start
combining different pieces of the
different models together so that there
you're having an apples-to-apples
comparison rather than what happens on a
lot of models the energy actually isn't
preserved in a lot of the models and so
you have actually divergence on them
over time and so that's not really a
good thing so how can you start applying
some of the same rigor within the models
across the models applying to
pieces and accounting for a lot of the
uncertainty that's actually happening
and they're actually looking at this
overall component from framework where
we have some different pieces the fets
climate activity which allows you to
pull data set it out of a certain region
over time so one of the challenges has
always been I just want data for say
Brazil or for Mexico over the last 30
years in just this region I don't want
it for the whole world every year and
pull it so this allows you to get your
data in that data set and if you got to
do a search on fetch climate there's a
website there that you can actually test
it out and utilize it and it works
against a lot of the carbon climate
model outputs that are already out there
and there's some other activities I was
going to show the data set viewer you
can bring in netcdf files very quickly
slice and dice them and visualize them
very quickly and so again how do we make
that easier for folks to utilize and
this kind of just a screenshot of it the
website down there at the bottom
actually has a link to the to the to all
the tooling that's good that's been
coming out but you have the fetch
climate up upper left you have some of
the filled Spock which it brings machine
learning and some Bayesian networking to
applying to the different data sets you
might be pointed putting in and then
some other that'll data set viewer on
the lower left so we're always looking
at how we combine these together in
different ways and and allow easier
access to the to the scientist a couple
of the other things I'll cover this
really quickly that I've been really
interested in lately is just the overall
complex event processing piece so
bringing together streams of information
very quickly and be able to analyze
those and can you process a lot of it
very quickly detect some of the you know
the patterns within the data sets and
while so while we have this insight
project Microsoft insight project which
comes out of the sequel team we've been
looking at it not just for stream flows
of data so we have a project down at USC
where they're actually taking traffic
information and data
and making determinations on the fly
based on not just historical information
but ongoing ones even on side street and
other pieces so they're actually able to
use light information like changing data
but one of the things that we actually
see is really interesting is this can
also be used against historical data and
files so you can run it against large
file systems or large databases of files
or file sets that are out there and the
query you're sending to it maybe you're
looking for a gradient change of a
certain value over a two minute window
followed by another change in another
value over 30 seconds or you know in a
certain time window the latency on that
query is actually from you could do it
if you place it right next to the file
from the disk read to that running of it
and back so you're not shifting a whole
bunch of data all the way across the
network or to a computational engine to
do it so are there ways to help filter
through some of this information and
find some of those maybe needles in a
haystack that you're looking for and
triggered off other ones so it's been an
interesting piece that we've been
looking and trying to see how to apply
better for some of these environmental
spaces and we'd be interested in others
that might be interested in that the
last piece I just really want to cover
is some of the visualization portions
that's been going on we have a project
called node Excel that's been out for a
number of years it was originally
designed for looking at social
information social graphs but social
graphs are nothing more than directed
graphs which is used in a lot of other
data sets protein interaction graphs
things like that are all just types of
network graphs and so one of the ideas
on this was could we put this ability
into something like Excel to allow that
to be very easily done by anyone be able
to do some of this analysis and the
visualization on it and create
visualizations kind of like what you see
and so it's directly in Excel and you
can download that and plug that in and
again it's for any kind of data set
they'll pull from your email they'll
pull from Twitter feeds or Facebook but
you could also apply any other
information as well it handles
clustering sub-sub gray
other a whole bunch of other
functionality in there and you could
also put in the other images and see
what's in there so so one of them that's
kind of near and dear to my heart
because it sits in my team is the world
wide telescope so we riginal e were
working on it for visualizing astro
astronomy based information sky surveys
other datasets and being able to
visualize those and not just visualize
those in 3d but also add in the temporal
piece but also kind of create a way to
communicate that information through
what we call tours and a tour unlike a
video right so video is a linear
progression of something you've decided
to show someone you if you stop it you
pause it you just start it up again from
where they left off you're not getting
any other diving into the information so
when I was talking about the ability to
dive back into the information of the
way to actually when you're
communicating it the tours we have allow
you to pause at any time dive into the
information in more detail you know
right click on it get a more information
on it and then started back up again and
continue the tour so with both audio and
video and others or not video but audio
and imagery so it's a way to communicate
information and data we see this is a
really interesting way of communicating
to others and Alyssa Goodman one of the
researchers scientists at Harvard that's
been involved with us from the beginning
said she's actually had more people
watch her tours that she's created than
have ever read her papers and so it
gives you kind of an idea of this how do
we appeal to other folks in other a
broader set of community then and can we
bring in some of this new media and a
way to communicate scientific
information and data we've also added in
an API so you can actually push
information into it and visualize it and
there we haven't a piece in Excel so you
can just upload data as well and it uses
just a web-based API so it can be done
for anywhere but the other thing that's
been really interesting it's not just
for astronomy we've been doing a lot
with earth-based data and information
and so you know we bring in all sorts of
different polygons and in from datasets
and using some of the standard
geospatial types
from like well-known text and others to
visualize it and one of the things that
we actually can do that some of the
other globe can't do the virtual type
Globes is visualize information below
the surface as well as above it and
actually at the polar regions so we're
really interested in how those can be
utilized for other scientific insights
and along with that we created what we
call later scape which is a site to not
only share the some of the data and
information these tours but one of the
things that's kind of an outcome of this
is if I create a tour with a that the
data and information when I hand that to
your hand the link to you to that tour
I'm also handling handing to you the
link to the data or two maybe a subset
of the data right away and what this is
kind of enabled is now a way to share
information through this kind of token
of a of a this case of visualization we
really wanted to get the thing I really
always wanted to get down to was the
ability to have a graph on a on a site
and I like the data or I like the way
the data is visualized I want to rip the
chart so I can apply my data to it or I
actually want to use that data combined
it with my data and so we see this kind
of as a way to start getting to that as
well one of the other things we've also
had fun with over the last number years
is applying things like connect to
interacting with the information and
data so since we have something like
worldwide telescope we integrated in the
Kinect originally for xbox and now for
the kinect for windows to allow us to
actually play with the data and again
play with the interface so you don't
have to actually just be at your desktop
or in a small device or others in fact
we've even done it on a 10 by about 20
25 foot screen and it changes your
perspective on how you interact with
information and data and so we see this
as a new way for folks to in the
environmental space to actually start
doing that so a couple other things just
wanted to get people thinking about
before I finish up here was
about the overall data storage
sustainability so one of the things that
always keeps coming back in my mind is
you know having digital data and having
it open is a great thing but the end of
day they're still spinning disks there's
still electricity being consumed they're
still maintenance all these other things
disc brake and it's an interesting thing
of where does that actually the cost get
covered at and so one of the things
we've been looking at is are there ways
models to help with that you know in
some areas you have things like tolling
is that a way to do it is there like you
have in a lot of countries TV Licensing
where you pay to actually have a TV and
accept the broadcast you know it's not
clear what the right thing is but it's
not it's also not clear to me that
either just advertising is going to be
the way to support all of these
scientific information data and so are
there ways that we can have self funding
ways of supporting some of these systems
don't have an answer but it's definitely
something we kind of keep looking at and
trying to understand especially as we
start getting more and more these data
sets up there again there's kind of no
other for some of these challenges and
the silver bullet right now but where
there's a whole bunch of areas that can
be applied that still need pieces in
here so that start thinking about the
data and retention earlier one of the
challenges when I talk to a lot of the
folks in the environmental space is that
they do a great job of teaching people
how to actually capture physical data
they don't do a great job of doing it
with digital data so we need to start
putting in those types of things and
teaching people from the beginning how
to do that and since my time is almost
I'll skip over this one and just last
thing real quickly in October we're
having a science workshop it'll be in
Chicago I've the link up here for the
the website the call for sessions and
kind of proposals for talks are up there
we want to bring in all sorts of
different activities you know like in
fact one of them the live and ease talk
I saw today is a good
ample that bringing together technology
and science and how you can actually
utilize that for for scientific benefit
and so these are the types of things we
would like to see there we invite all
you to submit talk come and it's a good
opportunity to collaborate with others
and other domains as well so done so
thank you I appreciate it if you have
any questions feel free to nail me after
the thing because I think we're ready to
move on and again my email is Dan bay at
microsoft com so appreciate it thank you
thank you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
