you
thanks so much for coming today we're
going to be this panel we're going to be
looking at us talking about some of the
challenges around accessing scalded
literature and some of the innovative
ways that businesses and of all
different shapes and sizes have come up
with new models to address these
challenges and so running a little bit
behind time so I'm going to give as much
time in speakers as possible to talk
about each of their different projects a
brief introduction on the panel today we
have Rob McGrath from Reed cube we have
William gun from mendeley Marguerite
Avery from X MIT press now at MIT
libraries Jennifer farthing from JSTOR
and Eric Hellman from Gujjar so to get
started I'd like to invite rob up a
little bit about reviewing some of the
access kind of solutions that we've been
thinking about over the last couple of
years and some of the observations that
we've had and doing a variety of
different pilots in the space but just
to give you kind of a quick overview
some of you may know Reed cube from kind
of the reference management desktop tool
space which is where we started and it's
kind of the the space that's definitely
closest to home in terms of addressing
the needs of researchers but in trying
to do that and trying to create tools
that are really great for kind of
organizing your research literature and
then getting discovery around other
things that you should be reading based
on what's already in your library you
naturally come across access boundaries
and that actually became one of the
biggest kind of resonating kind of
feedback items we got from our user
population when we were talking about
how we can improve our product and we
did a lot we tried to work with
University Library proxies come up with
simple ways of going kind of one click
download type scenarios but invariably a
lot of people hit pay walls and they'll
start to be frustrated and then what
happens when that occurs you in serving
users as many of you are probably aware
there's a variety of different scenarios
that people will undergo they may try to
go to Google Scholar they may try at
Microsoft academic search and see if
there's alternate download sites often
those are pretty good at revealing
different repositories where content may
reside they may just do general searches
for Google they may email the
there and ask for a copy they may
contact their library and ask for i ll
to become to be transferred over to them
which has nice latency period that's
very frustrating and so there's a number
of different channels but all that is
taking them away from the focus of
thought that they had at the point that
they found that article and they wanted
to consume it and so those were kind of
the driving forces around what we wanted
to do and we started working with
publishers towards that end there's a
couple of different kind of things that
all connect together Surrey cube is kind
of a platform we do have desktop and
mobile apps but we also have solutions
that are tied into our publisher
partnerships and those are actually
facilitating the access scenarios that
we're doing so just a quick overview
recuse a reference manager you've
probably seen it and you can import your
PDFs and organize it you can also find
recommendations search for new articles
and so forth within the application we
kind of innovated a enhanced PDF reading
experience early on which gives you the
ability to annotate but it also gives
you which I'll show you in a moment the
ability to discover new content and that
connects to the access pathways as well
sharing and metrics and information that
you can kind of view around the article
is also kind of a helpful part of
discovery and discovery leads to access
mobile just to show you just kind of a
mobile app that also allows you to view
and consume your library and the same
sort of interactivity of connecting so
kind of the point of the the different
platforms is that there's actually a
number of different scenarios where
people can kind of channel into access
and as I kind of mentioned the enhanced
PDF has the ability to click on
references and go directly into the
references which very often leads into
access challenges and there are some
platforms that actually have
interlinking partnerships between
different publishers through reference
linking and that's actually a very
interesting way of brokering access and
something that we're looking at very
closely in terms of how we can broker
relationships to allow kind of that
serendipitous discovery layer to be
facilitated especially when the and and
recipients don't have access sorry a
couple of X or screenshots about kind of
how people access engage with content so
check out was the first kind of access
solution that we implemented and we
launched a couple of versions of it
about two years ago starting with the
nature publishing group and what that
enabled was at the point of hitting a
pay wall
we tried to introduce new price points
and what we came up with were 48 hour
rentals or cloud access or the
traditional PDF access and so what why
is this interesting first off that the
traditional PDF price point is fairly
high most academic researchers that you
would talk to would never personally pay
for a $35 sometimes 50 or more dollar
price point a lot of commercial
institutions that's a different story if
you have a third-party payer at the end
of the day the price sensitivity is far
less pronounced and so what we were
trying to do is just kind of discover
okay if there if there were some lower
price options in the market would
academic researchers actually consume
this how valuable in a sense is this
particular article to their their
research and it turns out that when we
introduce these price points
overwhelmingly researchers were
consuming the the rental the the cheap
price point the price point that's an
expensive cup of coffee the
institutional buyers were actually
staying with the $35 price point and
that gives you a PDF that is technically
unrestricted the the rental and other
formats were we restricted formats and
cloud allows you to view it within the
refute platform you can go and check out
we introduced a second version of that
for libraries and that is called recoup
access and in that scenario when the
patron comes to the the paywall page
they can see that they have access
through their library and in this case
it's very much the same as the checkout
scenario that I showed you a moment ago
except for it's borne by the library
that the price is paid out of a deposit
account that the library sets up with
read cube in this case so those are some
of the things that we've been working on
we're trying to innovate in different
ways through a number of different
channels to promote both the discovery
and the introduction of the sharing
scenario once they discover it but yeah
thank you very much
so I'm going to tell you about unglue it
how we're building distribution and
sustenance mechanisms for e-books one
way how do I yes so one way to think of
what we're doing is is to say that we're
trying to build a bookstore for free
ebooks for books that want to be free
you might ask yourself well why we need
this well it turns out that book
publishing has an extremely well
developed supply chain all of these
players in the supply chain their
mission is to somehow help the people
who create books to connect with the
people who consume books readers and
authors now if you look at the names
inside those boxes a lot of those
players survive on taking a percentage
of the purchase price of the book even
libraries hate free ebooks so the whole
supply chain breaks when the e-book is
free because there's no percentage to to
provide an engine or for all of these
things to work so I thought the best way
to describe what we are actually doing
is just to talk about the book so this
is a book called oral literature in
Africa it's a relatively old book it
sort of the life work of an aging
academic named Ruth Finnegan and this
book basically put or a literature on
the scholarly Matt it created a whole
field but the problem was that that
scholars in Africa I really didn't have
access to the book because it was too
expensive so we work with the publisher
ran a crowdfunding campaign we raised
about seven thousand dollars to turn
this into a free ebook
so how do you get text books free text
books into classrooms this is a book a
textbook on high performance scientific
compute computing it was funded by the
sailor foundation but how our teachers
supposed to you know what books they can
use in their classrooms this is a
cookbook by Lee Anne brown it is a great
cook pocket but the reason she wrote
this book was focused on people who have
to survive on four dollars a day on on
food stamps and so the question was how
do you make this book how do you get
this book it to the people who actually
it was meant meant to how do you get
libraries to list this in their catalogs
so we're making a mark record so that
easy for libraries to load this book
into their catalog and get it to people
can use it this is this is a wonderful
novel called zero sum game written by
lisa wong who was a math major at MIT
it's she didn't want to to extort money
from people who wanted to read her books
so she put a Creative Commons license on
it and made it free but have any of you
guys read it it's a fantastic book and
when the them when a hundred thousand
people have read it and they make a
major motion picture of it you'll be
able to see say you read it because you
got it from unglue it and you can give
her money if you want using the buttons
on our website what about books that are
derivative works of Creative Commons
license fee books we've just started
working with a French publisher called
frame a book that their mission is to
take books that are creative commons
license translate them into french
and make them available so we are
helping them a finance or operation by
letting people contribute to this effort
what about fair use works this is a book
that was produced last week it's a remix
of a book produced by Mattel where Casey
feast ler took out all the fifo the
horrible cringe-inducing sexist text
about how Barbie needed help from guys
to make her a computer game work and
made a really great book now how this is
legal to distribute under fair use
doctrine in the US so how do you go
about making it available well we're
listing it in our catalog we have about
over a thousand Creative Commons license
books in our catalog we're also making a
opds fee this is the type of atom feed
that it's used in iphone and ipad and
android apps to present books on inside
app so we basically have three revenue
programs that are designed to replace
that percentage that the conventional
book supply chain uses the thanks for on
glowing program is meant for books that
are already free licensed we have a
pay-what-you-want system and so that
people can support the books that they
like the by to unglue program is where
the Creator the publisher the author set
a revenue goal and when they hit the
revenue goal the book becomes free and
finally we have the pledge to unglue
program
which is a crowd funding a program
similar to Kickstarter and so the book
becomes free if they reach their funding
target so that's a quick overview of
what we're doing we can't do it alone
check out on glue it on glue IT hi so um
my mark ii agree i was with the MIT
press for about 10 years and I just
stepped into the MIT libraries to
continue scholarly communication
research but the initial topic I wanted
to talk about was trying to create
altmetrics for open access scholarly
monographs to determine value for
university presses with something aside
from dollars earned but that became
really unwieldy for seven minutes so I'm
going to talk about other issues of
access for a minute so so the
traditional barriers for access that we
have are usually we think of price time
time for the access to the research how
long does it take you to get it when is
it available for you to look at and
format what kind of how are you
accessing this material so I want to put
this into context about University
presses just briefly some a lot of what
we're talking about is not about
University presses so I feel the need to
explain what they are but there's over a
hundred of them they are mission-driven
nonprofit organizations there's serve
the public good by generating in
disseminating knowledge they are charged
with publishing works of scholarly
intellectual or creative merit for more
specialized audiences which also means a
smaller audience that is when we're not
going to sell as many books ups are
extensions of their sponsoring
institutions and tend to reflect the
research that's done at these
institutions but that's not always the
case and they are considered a key node
in knowledge and the research network
various scholarly communities so
just talk for a second about we've
talked a lot about open access and I'm
sure you're all familiar with this so
I'm not going to talk about it very much
but these are just the the current on
the vanguard of university presses and
scholarly monographs and open access so
there's a new open access advocacy group
called authors Alliance which is trying
to create a agreement for authors to
work into their contracts making their
content openly available after price
after sales drop off after a certain
period of time and Pam Samuelson from
Berkeley is doing this some of their
open access publishing initiatives that
have cropped up in the last two years
our knowledge on latch twitches a UK
initiative from Francis Pinter which is
kind of similar to reminds me a little
bit about glue it in terms of the crowd
funding aspect of it is a certain number
of libraries purchased the book then it
will be openly available for for all
libraries and everyone to be there's an
open library for the humanities
initiative and again these are all
dealing with monographs which is not
what we've been thinking about a lot
here amherst college press has started a
new digital press an open-access press
that is in the conceptual stage right
now and there's a group of 70 libraries
called the other forming under the
Oberlin group which are hoping to create
their own platform for open access
digital publications time is our other
was one of our other barriers that we're
looking at so and we've talked a lot of
people here talked about different
communicating communicating research at
different stages and this is a rough
life cycle of research that would then
end up in a book so you might tweet an
initial research results if you could
end up with a draft paper on ssrn this
could be discussed at a conference paper
turn to a journal article and then
eventually be a published book this this
life cycle here even though these this
tends to be a longer life cycle this is
an example of a book that i published
about the panama canal and the
environmental impact of this and i did
take liberties with my author saying
that he tweeted OMG asian passing
through the Panama Canal uses 52 million
gallons of water but that is true he
didn't actually tweet that but but this
is showing this is actually the life
cycle of his work but so that's a long
for your life cycle to publication so a
format is the big thing that I'm going
to talk about 457 more seconds um so
what does content want to be the
architect Louie Cohn asked famously of
what does a brick want to be and like
would determine what what in building
should be and format is really the thing
I've been thinking about with publishing
with all the books that I have signed
and all the authors that I've worked
with a more and more research of really
was not able to be able to publish in
the book or in a journal form in a
journal so I really wanted to move
beyond the book and journal binary and
to create digital authoritative digital
publications which is what I'm hoping to
do in the library now so some new things
that University presses are doing is to
engage with shorter formats so this is
actually engaging with the question of
time and with format so these are short
short projects and lengthen the time to
market is also briefed as well so they
have my former pres MIT press which is
using existing content and creating
these into smaller bite-sized pieces
called bits presses like Stanford and
Rutgers and a host of others are
commissioning new content that they're
getting to market in about three months
and then Minnesota is actually taking
the most progressive stance I think by
actually publishing developing content
that they will then hope to create into
a book later sort of along the model of
a veces RN of posting something and a
not finished format and this is that's
for runners which is what Minnesota is
joining so one example of this of a
publisher that's actually a university
press publish shirt that's removed all
these barriers already in one prob and
one experimental publication is
Cambridge University Press with the
history manifesto so this was just
published this is by to historians which
as we all know are on the vanguard of
scholarly research and publishing
technology British historians especially
but this is a book called the history
manifesto where they got this to from
start to finish in about four months so
this is the the irony of this is this
book is about actually long to rate his
and that we want to be looking at long
timescales rather than short increments
but they were able to produce it in a
short increment so this book is
available to open access it actually had
a very low price point and it came out
very quickly so this is a an example of
what is possible but and this is the
author pay this is the page that
Cambridge put up when they release this
book open access simultaneously and
actually what some sales information
that I probably shouldn't disclose but
I'm label but they've actually sold the
so the same number of copies of books as
they've had free downloads which has
been in six weeks over 2,000 copies
which is great for a history book from
University Press so that's just a
snapshot of what's happening in the
university press book monograph
publishing world thanks thanks very much
Alex and Aimee and Alex and everyone for
Microsoft we're hosting is here I'm
going to talk about something that I
just kind of grandiosely called a
next-gen content discovery just so here
I am I'm mr. Gunn and if you're a
computer here I am we talked about
orchid before I always tell people that
you know you can come and chat with me
later if you really want to know what my
presentation is about and tell me you
were busy signing up for an orchid now
that's totally fine I'll forgive you
okay so you know statement one search
doesn't work around 2009 it was a
venture capitalist guy by the name of
Paul kujawski who was looking for a
dishwasher and so he went you know onto
google he typed in you know dishwasher
reviews and he you know Gould and he
searched and he kept googling and
searching around and eventually he came
to the realization that the entirety of
the Google search results for dishwasher
reviews with all spam it was all
generated crap there was actually
nothing useful in in Google far you know
about buying dishwashers it was all
content
arm stuff in and spam this guy wrote up
his story a little bit and this signed
his students had a task to go and you
know connect with other people in their
class on linkedin and if you can't find
out if someone's not only did search for
them on google and of course that
entirely failed for these people as well
this guy Joe Atwood from the stack
exchange many of you guys know did the
same thing he was looking for iphone 4
case this is back in 2001 he you know
googled around a little bit found the
whole process entirely futile and he
just went to Amazon and looked it up
there which is pretty much what I do now
and so a lots been written about content
farms and all this kind of stuff so aha
but you're saying that this is not the
scholarly domain we don't have these
problems in in search well maybe that's
true maybe you know as the recent paper
from the google scholar team says that
actually search in Google Scholar works
reasonably well it's reinvigorating old
content and this works across
disciplines and so on and so forth
perhaps you know that's true you can
find a lot more old stuff in Google you
can also find this in google scholar and
this is actually in the Google Scholar
index because it matches all the
criteria Google looks right looks like a
paper you know it's kind of title is get
authors got affiliation abstract this is
indexed in Google Scholar aha but Google
scholars not a curated database maybe
pubmed well okay six thousand papers in
pubmed every day lots of people trying
to solve the problem of finding these
things probably all these people
wouldn't feel this is an interesting
enough problem to go out and solve and
raise money for were pubmed solving
everyone's search problems even for
their own domain so great you know this
is not a human scale problem if you're
talking about six thousand papers even
in this one little domain although it's
a big domain so so what you do one of
the things that we're starting to do is
looking at push rather than pull so
where you can think of a search as
you're going out
actively trying to find something and
you know get the search engine to
retrieve it and bring it to you the
other idea is you know well let's learn
from someone's behaviour and that you
know activities over time and push
things at them so we have a couple of
different ways that we can push out
recommendations in the desktop clients
the desktop client is a reference
manager kind of like in no job with some
neat collaborative features but this
isn't a sales pitch going too much into
it we also have related papers on the
page and related researchers and our
initial tests on some emails with these
recommendations show that I'm know if
you guys know anything about you know
email marketing but this is actually you
know mini fold better than usually you
get so there's evidence that researchers
really like the recommendation way of
putting something in front of someone
before maybe they even really knew what
they were we're looking for if there's a
lot of different ways you can do this
pulling in the different information use
collaborative filtering use popularity
behavior analysis as well as the actual
content in the article itself to pull
things out so that is my that is my
statement sir is search broken or is it
not I would I would suggest that it's
not entirely broken there's a lot of
room for improvement yet and let me just
show you one little thing over here that
we are doing to try to fix it a little
bit so this is a story for the min delay
catalog and so let's just start typing
in a keyword oh look suggestion of
keyword terms all right so let's go
let's search that now it's given me a
whole bunch of results 350,000 that's
useless let's just pick the ones from
2011 pick that filters it down and then
you pick your authors so already a vast
improvement over the type in a keyword
get a whole bunch of results back you
have no idea what to do with them or how
to filter it down in a useful way or
what search operator you're supposed to
use for this particular syntax or
anything so search may be broken but
there's a lot of things we can do
pushing things to people and just making
so much better thank you hi I'm Jen
farthing from JSTOR and I want to tell
you a little bit about our program
register and read and how our program is
doing two years in and possibly a short
demo lets out see how we do with time
JSTOR's mission expanding global access
understanding the needs of our users so
we can deliver more value to them
helping our publishers who share those
interests of compost shows those same
goals so JSTOR and its users you
probably know JSTOR from the library but
I'm going to talk about something that
is a little outside of the institutional
access model we have 150 million content
accesses per year and I put a couple
question marks there because you might
think what's that content accesses are
every time that an individual user goes
and interacts with the content they
might download it they might read it
they might save a citation currently
we're serving more than 9,000
institutions worldwide we have more than
2,000 archival journals in JSTOR and
some people don't know this we have more
than 27,000 books we're not going to be
talking about books today because the
register and wreath program right now
only has journals in it we are working
with more than 1,100 publishers and we
work in licensing arrangements with them
they're from around the world so we had
all these institutional users but then
other users wanted in there like you
know why do I have to be in a library to
get that content so over the past 10
years JSTOR has added programs to help
independent researchers and unaffiliated
scholars get at that content they need
so our first program was early journal
content making content in the public
domain open to users next we have our
publisher sales service which has a
really interesting name but that's where
our publisher partners set the price for
their articles that they put on sale
through the JSTOR platform they set the
price we offer it to users and hopefully
I'll get to show that we have an alumni
access
program were libraries by choice have
decided whether they would like to
extend their access to their alumni
groups there's more than 100 of them
right now and then register and read
which is our guest access program
finally just last year we launched jPAS
which is our new member access plan for
individuals so let's say register and
read so free limited access for
everybody this was an experiment that we
launched in march of 2012 and i say we
but I was not yet at JSTOR we piloted
with 76 journals from a select group of
publisher partners found mainly through
search referrals users land on an
article V page and without institutional
access there's shown the option to buy
the article or read it for free so JSTOR
now allows up to three free reads over
two week period so if users stay on top
of adding and subtracting articles on
their free reading shelf at JSTOR they
can read up to 78 articles free per year
for free so this little chart shows the
past couple of years following our pilot
phase we added about a thousand journals
to the program and by the end of 2013 we
had 1,300 journals in the program and
got our one millionth user over the past
year that figures grown 22 million users
which we got just about last week and
there's more than 1,600 journals in the
program now and that's all through
publisher participation they opted in to
put their journals in the register and
read collection of these two million
users more than a third of them are
repeat users and now come some data for
you I'm not sure if you can read all the
labels but so we want to know who are
these people the chart on the Left
breaks out the users by their
self-reported classification so for some
register and read is their only access
option but for others it supplements the
partial access provided by their
institutions now all institutions
participate in all the JSTOR programs
you'll notice that the largest
components are undergrad and grad
students that's in the red in the kind
of gold tone on the left and they're not
our target
which is independent researchers and
unaffiliated scholars we also have
thousands and thousands of those but
take a look at the chart on the right
this is our top countries list the u.s.
is in red and by far the largest
followed by UK India Canada than Germany
but the light blue wedge is huge and
thats everywhere else many of these
users are in regions with no
institutional access to JSTOR and many
of the students that we see over on the
left in the red and gold are some of the
people that are in that light blue area
and they're making their making that up
so some of our publishers often ask us
will hey I see a lot of undergraduate
users in there I thought you were
targeting independent users so two ways
their school may not have the journals
that they need so they're supplementing
or they might not be from US UK and some
places that have a lot of access options
now this chart shows interests and
access this is the variety of the
content that our users access it's the
top 10 categories mostly arts history
stuff like that our two million users
have checked out more than 3.5 million
articles in just two and a half years
and here's where the insight part comes
in both JSTOR Nets publisher partners
are interested in this information from
the previous slide we learn more new
years of users live and what kinds of
learners are interested in the content
on JSTOR but from this view we can add
the content access information we make
reporting available to publishers that
details article access by journal and
shows the user demographics so they like
that I'm just super quick if you're at
let's say Google Scholar you search on
something you might find this article at
the top and see that it comes from JSTOR
you click through it and it gives you an
opportunity you could buy it publisher
sets the price for this one at ten bucks
or you can read it online and it's got a
little banner so I'll check on that and
it expands and gives you a little bit
more about the program's got a couple
rules and then to get into it you have
to register that's how we get the data
so this is the registration form that we
share with all my JSTOR users whether
you're in an institute
tional or not and then it asks you are
you sure you want to add that to your
shelf so this is my first time adding
you can see I have three spaces and I
say yeah why not let's add that to the
shelf so I have two more spaces and now
I've surfaced an ad and this is for the
J past program that I mentioned which is
a membership that you can get for a
month or a year you can pay for it so we
take the opportunity to upsell them here
if they want to do things like download
the content that they can't do with the
register and read program and then I go
in to read the article and that's it so
I'd like to open up the panel to the
audience but like that's one question
before we go knowing what you know about
your different projects each of you've
been working in this space for quite a
while probably different projects
knowing what you know now was it there'd
be anything you would have changed in
your path or decisions that you you
would have maybe chosen the other door
as opposed to when you went through
regrets so probably the biggest thing is
that I think we've learned that user
interface has a huge part to do with how
people engage with any of the systems
we've been fortunate to do a number of
pilots with different publishers and
experimenting in the space a fair bit
and being able to iterate quickly to to
track very carefully how kind of the
usage and engagement is occurring on the
platforms is is really critical and it's
it's there's nothing worse than finding
out a few weeks later that I wish we
attract that and then having to do and
wait a little bit longer to do that so
I'd say that kind of that's one small
lesson to learn is just to iterate and
track from the very beginning as much as
you can you'll never get it all right
but getting as much as you can right is
very helpful I would my only regret is I
would try to have pushed for four
metrics to create to determine value
outside of sales for publications as I
think with research publications the
circulation of the research and the
circulation of the scholarship is what's
really important to scholars and the
sales are obviously important to the
business end of the presses but that's
not that's not the entire picture so to
try to articulate that value and Express
that to the University I regret nothing
no I think if I was if I was going to go
back to the beginning and figure out
okay what is something that's going to
be really really important that we
didn't jump on as as good as we could I
think we would have really focused on
the social aspects of the plot of the
platform a bit more our social features
even today with our groups online and at
sharing you know references and papers
are really still kind of it like the
bare minimum viable product stage and
they're not really front and center as I
think that could be so
um i think for j for j store with
register and read we hope that you have
been upon the article through a search
and then you get referred into the
landing page for the article and if you
don't have access in your institution
you may be offered the opportunity to
read it we don't have the ability to
sort and search when you're on the JSTOR
platform only that content that might be
available to you through the program so
it's on our wish list it's something
that we'd like to have but we were
anxious to get something out there so
again it is in beta it's a Minimum
Viable Product it would be great to have
that in future and we will have that so
unglue it started out as a crowdfunding
platform for free ebooks what we didn't
really understand was how broken the
book supply chain is when the books are
free how ineffective it is to just sort
of put a book on a website and expect
people to be able to use it so if we
were to do everything over again we'd
start with what we're calling thanks for
allowing which is gather all the
creative commons license free ebooks
that we can get and and and fix the
supply chain problems first
hi um so I'm a research and instruction
librarian and I work really closely with
students and I know sort of the
population that spin talked about it has
been a different type of publisher or
researchers probably more at the faculty
or lab and but what I've noticed is that
students are publishing materials and
they are sort of using some of these
tools that are up there they that you
all are talking about but the biggest
frustration is sort of the integration
of that and one of the other audience
members asked a little bit about that
for the first group and so they'll use a
product like mendeley for about two
minutes it's too hard to set up or they
don't wanna do it and it's hard to
integrate with the other tools that
doesn't work with google docs but
ProQuest works with Google Docs and and
all these different things in and when I
work with the students the biggest thing
is that to teach them about the research
process and sort of just the ethical use
of information and I think that I don't
know if any of you can sort of speak to
a really beginner part of this research
process and how your tools can integrate
with that there's there's one comment
that I can make with regards to
interoperability with other tools and
that's the importance of good you know
very performance and an open it will
document it ap is so we have one at min
delay as Zotero now has an API for a
quest in a note you know still not so
much so it love more interoperability
but that's something that everyone has
to really participate in
so the book industry has designed out
interoperability amazon is designed
Kindle so you can't take their Kindle
books off of your kindle same with apple
ibooks the whole process of using drm
digital rights management on on ebooks
is designed to present prevent people
from doing stuff with ebooks and so that
is been a big barrier for adoption of
e-books in general for for many types of
uses I'll just speak to the the format's
thing erm is part of it but in the space
of kind of breeki that we think about
it's usually journal articles typically
PDFs and so a lot of the kind of early
problems that we saw in terms of
building workflows was first actually
how do we identify the PDF and so that
when you take this otherwise kind of
disconnected form that may or may not
have a DOI even associated with it how
do you then kind of incorporate that
into your library make it searchable and
reduce the level of effort involved in
getting up to speed but I mentioned the
PDF because it is kind of this this kind
of anchor point it can go from program
to program it can be emailed it can be
used in many different ways and in that
sense because it is inherently portable
it's very useful it's also very limiting
because it's very static and it's
difficult to connect online with
revisions and updates and all the kind
of additional information that comes out
around around literature so I agree
api's but also kind of just the
portability of the different formats
that people are going to do not every
user is going to need a reference
manager if you're only dealing with a
couple of articles a month or so you may
not actually have a compelling need for
advanced research management software
but for those that do typically you'll
have hundreds or thousands of PDFs and
other related research forms that you
need to organize and being able to take
those from one app to the other whether
you're doing kind of active discovery
versus active paper writing are very
different tasks and different apps may
be better for different types of
workflows and so as long as I can work
together can go towards kind of a
solution
I actually would challenge the notion
because there are students just for your
own audience you know product
development there are students who they
may only have five or six articles but
they need to be able to translate
between disciplines and becoming aware
of like how to integrate some of those
articles more seamlessly from different
formatting and not get caught up on the
formatting so we do have students that
use read cube that use mendeley they use
all of these products well I'm even with
four or five articles in their library
so just for your own awareness students
are using them that way oh yes certainly
um I think sometimes when we think of
our user demographic we have kind of the
kind of super researchers that tend to
have these very massive libraries that
they spend a lot of time kind of
organizing and then you have kind of
maybe the more undergraduate level
engagement that you have like a bunch of
things you work with the course pack or
something of those sorts sometimes
getting in but you're absolutely right
there's a use case but just for what
it's worth when we talk to most users
the they're not switching from other
apps most of the time they're coming
from Windows Explorer or finder like
that is kind of the the starting point
that they're used to and when you
actually engage with dialogue desktop
operating search is actually probably
the biggest kind of kind of crutch that
you can use if you don't use a reference
manager I've got a question for you
Robin and others to China anything it's
relevant but specifically on the six
dollar pay for a 48 hour access how the
dialogues gone with the publishers when
you've gone out beyond the McMillan
family and have bags I know that there
is turns out what the overall revenue
difference is so there's a couple of
dimensions of that first off there's
there's a question of what that's going
to do to the PDF sales or the
traditional sales like if you're
introducing new formats and mediums does
that mean that you're going to be kind
of generating incremental sales with
those new mediums are they going to
cannibalize the legacy existing ones and
we then it was an open question we did a
number of pilots we've done it with npg
and wiley in a number
publishers now and the data that we've
collected is that it tends to actually
not cannibalize the PDF there's a
contingent a contingent group of people
that are not particularly probably sin
city vande will choose that format
option and then there's a huge group of
people that are very price sensitive
that will buy the rental option so and
all of our pilots that we've done so far
we have not seen any decline and the PDF
sales and rather we see a nice lift in
the lower price points similarly the
other part of the equation is is this
going to affect site licenses and other
parts of the business and the the
difference really is that you can't
compare them the cost per download or
CPD rates that you would look at in a
site license are not really the same as
a 48 hour rental I mean it's a different
format so even if the price point of the
48 hour rental were lower than the CPD
right it isn't the type of kind of
format that would compel a library to
decline the site license site license is
still in almost every case going to be
the most cost effective way to acquire
the content and libraries often I mean
that is the purpose of electronic
librarians is to provide that access any
other questions
I think one of the difficulties i have
with any sort of pay model on content is
is not the lack of willingness to pay
it's that you have no way of appraising
the value of what you're going to buy
until you've read it so you could be
spending 30 bucks on a total piece of
garbage or it could be the best article
you've ever ridden it written or red
sari and it's just a total guess and so
that ends up being the barrier and so
rentals whatever it is it's it's very
similar software you don't know if
software is helpful to you until you try
it so it seems like the models haven't
quite well some of the models like the
free online but then by the PDF seem to
get at that but not all the pay models
that I've seen seem to recognize that's
the real barrier to a lot of people it's
a great thing we got a lot of feedback
about that early on I can't say that
we've solved it but some of the steps
that we have taken to kind of mitigate
that risk is and all the publishers that
we're working with they've agreed to the
first page previews many of them allow
you to view all the figures the the
captions associated with them the
references and a blurred-out version of
all the subsequent pages which gives you
a sense of the structure the length of
the paper in many cases you have no idea
of the $32 paper you're buying is two
pages long or fifty like it's it's not
actually presented at the point of sale
in most cases so we've tried to do that
and I think it has helped quite a bit in
terms of the kind of the comfort level
so if you try it and read keep you can
you can actually see the first page all
the subsequent ones are blurred out on
the left you have the check out options
and and that's kind of the option that
you can choose if you think it's worth
that risk but it is a risk with any of
it if the price point gets down to the
sort of we think the cup of coffee level
then it's a relatively small one and
depending on the researcher and and how
relevant they think it is sometimes you
just don't want to hunt for substitute
good and it's taking your own time to do
that to you don't actually factor in the
amount of time that people will spend
hunting for content online asking their
librarian to provide it through I ll or
some other latency kind of latent format
so for some people it just makes sense
if you want instantaneous delivery let's
do one more question in the back there I
see four large like publishers that are
much more ingrained in the pre
open-access era what would what would
suggestions do you have for both
maintaining them getting revenue but
also innovating and adjusting to all
these new exciting thing I'll go but
I'll try not to hog it it's it's a
question that we talk a lot about with
our publishers and there's all sorts of
innovative things I mean off the top my
head everything from kind of the
e-commerce sort of rental and other
formats to ad supported sponsorships
different ways of kind of delivering
kind of access to to users in clever
ways using technology and one of the
ways that we're trying to do it right
now is is to find ways that don't
overtly threaten the existing business
models and that means the site license
and others that you can't do anything
overly radical in this space and we
wouldn't want to overnight either but
there's a lot of room I think through
technology through apps and ecosystems
just as has been done in the music and
media and movies to explore different
ways of brokering access of looking at
different potential payers in the
equation across the board from
sponsorship from vendors to end users
who could be researchers to libraries
and different budget scenarios that
haven't been done before so I think
there's actually incredible room for
creativity doing pilots quickly they're
not all going to work necessarily but
but if you can mitigate the risk and
kind of quantify what you're getting
into most of the time it's actually not
nearly as large as you think in terms of
what the worst case scenario could
possibly be and better armed of data
will just allow kind of that evolution
of the different models open access and
otherwise to kind of come coalesce
together I think in the most productive
way for me it really comes down to what
what Jeff said earlier about making sure
your revenue model is in line with your
your mission you know whether you're a
for-profit company or not it makes a lot
of sense to think about this and if you
have content and you want that content
to be distributed then you have services
on top of a free content layer it's kind
of more the more obvious things the
whole open source business model is you
know well you can't charge for the
access to the code anymore so you have
all your services around it your support
and your hosting and so on and so forth
right that's kind of the basic way that
the people generally go in in that
respect and that's certainly what we
been delayed being a you know a
value-added service owned by a
traditional you know content-based
publisher is hoping that we can make
come true I think another way to think
of it is to distinguish between the
container and the content so if the
content is open and the content is
available but the container is what you
paid for and that is the convenience
factor without you're consuming it such
as the book there's a container of
content and Amazon Kindle file is a
apple and apples format it's called it
doesn't have a clever name but these are
those are formats that the readers will
pay for to use for what will be useful
for them but if then the content is open
a searchable then that allows it to
circulate and ostensibly is best for
both worlds yeah the problem with a lot
of the pay-per-view things is that it it
gets in the way to some extent of some
of the uses some of the more valuable
uses that you might make so for example
human reading of a PDF is a valuable use
but you know mining across you know
thousands of articles is an emerging
area of reuse that may have quite a
large potential and so we need new
business models that get kind of behind
the you know one article one on one
charge kind of point of view
with JSTOR what we've done with our
programs is we have the free guest
access then we have you can you can buy
one if you want to and to Tim's point
you can read it freely and then if you
still want to buy it you can do that and
we offer our publishers information on
that as well as the royalty and then
talking to publishers they were really
nervous about letting that content out
for free for reading even in limited
ways that we're doing and it hasn't
proven to be an issue the single article
sales have not gone down when we
launched our member model jPAS we also
got some feedback from publishers that
they were nervous what's that going to
do with our article sales they're just
different users and when we've allowed
them to read it for free before
purchasing one or before joining the
membership they they've done that and
they're doing that in number so that's
what we have today but so far the
publishers have been very satisfied with
it I think the most important thing for
that the traditional publishing
organizations to do is to cut their cost
basis they they have you know offices in
very expensive real estate they're very
fancy they pay a lot of people to do a
lot of expensive things and they need to
start thinking about how they can cut
the cost of what they do on that note
each year microsoft research helps
hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
