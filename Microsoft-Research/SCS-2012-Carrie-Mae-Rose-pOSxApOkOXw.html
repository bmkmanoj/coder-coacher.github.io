thank you Brady fast and it's
interesting because I feel like my
project can actually tie in a bit with
the subject matter every morning
discussion and I'm going to my story
here is gonna be a bit personal I've
been artists never background we've been
wearing a lot of traditional things I
did that design of technology degree at
Parsons a couple years ago and then kind
of branched out into and Betty
technology to my wearable ideas and it's
brought it to what I'm find wearable
weapons so yes I'm currently a resident
which is a huge turning point at eyebeam
here in chelsea in New York City so I
feel like my work is an integration of
fine art fashion performance and
technology for me my creative and Adam
for me where were weapons means
exploring the power of true
vulnerability and how we as a culture
see protection so my role as an artist I
feel is to challenge cultural
assumptions and provoke and awaken
people I think you like my personal
awakening began when I moved to the
Arizona desert I grew up in the Midwest
and moved out there when I was 19 and it
transformed me the sky the space the
plant life army and so my early work
began with building sculptures with the
agave leaves and I didn't bring across
so this is an agave leave um and it
maintains a tender sweet center probably
heard of the gaana Hector sort tequila
comes from and and they protect itself
from water seeking animals and so for me
it has this natural
form of protection that became a
metaphor for me wanting to create
armored dresses and sorry that the you
know God way wants it doesn't be like
okay you have to treat it with respect
you know you can't just walk up in like
jagger self dictator you get injured so
that's kind of the metaphors that
striking this balance between respect
and honor and everybody needs to be
loved and touched so our type of this
series on a gobby armor and they were
definitely based around personal
intimacy the dynamic of intimate
relationships then they need to feel
safe if you feel protected and the risk
of like the potential to be learned and
the potential to reach the sublime when
when sharing intimate relationships and
I've also got many many circular
sculptures which I'll talk more about it
so when I moved to the urban environment
I took the similar shape the agave leaf
I started working with scissors are all
confiscated from the airport security so
I bought them at eBay yep I got lots of
pounds scissors and just sort of them
like them try to get inspired by them
and um so i called this series
confiscated weapons of mass construction
so using construction scissors using
Medical scissors and working with the
themes of protection and safety and
vulnerability but more on a national
skills these are all confiscated from
the airports you know from people you
know their cultural response to the work
you know the fear of terrorism and
tightening national security and them so
they used some circles in my work both
stationary and wearable refers to an
inspiration from the archetypal
me a symbol of unity and perfection and
it's been used cross-culturally in many
many areas as a symbol of spiritual
practices so the Tibetans believe that
if you view of San Mandela and has an
imprint of perfection that changes the
consciousness of you are just like a
pureed open shattered glass I continued
working with the scissors and these
weapons in the end placing these
sculptures on the female form so to be
the female body represents beauty and
vulnerability and wearing these
sculptures after offers the
juxtaposition of elements you know soft
skin hard edge so last April I had show
at a gallery links for Colton ocean this
rat forth a new body work with thousands
of donated razor blades the series
involve more simple forms deadly objects
and zip ties for included I placed them
on the female form and exhibited both
the sculptures in the photographs this
was when where what was really starting
to take form because I decided decided
to start work purely on wearables so
where are these weapons that the message
that it's now safe to feel beautiful it
just made sense to me on a personal and
national level to feel to be provocative
and place these weapons on on the forum
if you want for me so I also use a
reoccurring theme of wings in my work
which to me our symbol of freedom
spiritual longing rising above sea
picture giving a different viewpoint
instead of the day on a Monday many of
things just really being able to get a
higher perspective so these were some
wings than that but with the scissors so
I had a moment of clarity in my
meditation practice where I realized
that nothing visible is going to keep me
feeling safe that's my experience and so
um no no guns razors deserves missiles
national security I hopeful sake so I
thought I started asking myself the
question well to me it's a spiritual
connection so if the if the arm is to
God's more armor what would the
substance of the armor of the god ski
and tube answer I got was fire just
purifiers intensity just pure
impenetrable shield so then I came up
with the idea of creating a dress attire
and this was inspired by the Rubens tube
experiment where if you put two speakers
in a tube with gas the sound wave
becomes visible and it can dance to the
beat of music so I wanted to pump that
group in thin tubes and then activate it
with music and happy voice voice and
music interactive it was also a greatly
inspired by the mesa de Brochu
performance that zach lieberman created
it's all projection and sound and then
the fluid dress is actually pumps fluid
throughout the dress and then this is
called the Lightning ordering a great
ship are correct and if you press a note
electrical arcs that he Jacob's Ladder
and I actually have worked a little bit
with Arduino not so much Malika but I
feel like to create those voice
interactions you can program that stuff
with on weapon controllers so another
concept that I drew that I was thinking
of was creating waves with electrical
arcs or Judas concept round and week
later I want to see the maker faire in
queens and architectures that are
performing this was two years ago and it
was really inspired by these dramatic
these huge Tesla coils and they're like
parking fee to music at lighting cook
music equipment and I was really
inspired ok i want to take i want to
take this idea of using electricity and
making it more refined making it stink
to be wearable and just have a more
delicate experience so a friend of mine
recommended that I do some research on
the violet ray which was mentioned by
Nikola Tesla it's a handheld device that
has a mini Tesla coil in it and then it
was invented as a healing device back in
1894 invented the modern-day version has
actually called the violet wand and it
sounds but basically the two main people
that purchase these are their police
departments or the larger community of
S&amp;amp;M community so there are sex to it now
you can stick different attachments into
and then they give off the electricity
nation and they can actually neither
burn do scarification or you can arouse
the person through light staticky under
particular
feeling so i solicited one of the
distributors of the violet wands and she
sent me a whole shipment of goodies and
um and that was exciting so I happy not
to continue with my research and
development and I I feel like as an
infection a major turning point what's
getting the residencia some financial
funding and just creative support for
these ideas since it's kind of a mood
board the like Alexander McQueen and
Iris van Herpen Harrison fashion
designers that I really enjoy I'm just
kind of going because Elizabeth in
collar protecting the head which is a
vulnerable space and moving towards who
I've just been working with collars so
this is my current very rough tex catch
so I have a Faraday cage that's
protecting the body that's made of
conductive thread and have electrodes
actually the big thing is that when
Violet wanna sent me all these wands she
recommended that I design my own
electrodes that can open the door to
signing some electrodes so when I design
electrodes that are in the shape of
flames and then have them activated by
the voice or by music and so these are
Faraday cages that are out there chain
mail from arc attack these are a high
high power line guys wearing a really
thin fabric that's made with on the
twenty five percent stainless steel
thread and then just the traditional
metal cage with the Tesla coil this is
an artist that works with filigree felt
so I started just playing around with
shapes for for the electrodes and then
we filled with argon gas which happens
in the spectrum really different colors
that argon gas comes from Compton so who
might wear such a costume um yeah we'll
see I so a friend of mine was actually
asking me why are you waiting for a
gallery to have your work seen either
other you know public places that your
work can become visible there's
definitely I feel like there's a few
options right now either entertainers
both live performances or given a music
video where there's millions of YouTube
video viewers and then the second one is
recommended to work with women for women
international and have them collect
materials from the war-torn countries
and then I would build them out into
where our weapons and also there's an
element I wanted to score a little bit
of women tripes work with bile
bioelectricity in his research so that's
it my main message I guess with the spy
of work is that the only real protection
spiritual that physical islands offer a
false promise and I do want to just put
in there I was talking with somebody
last night that I am open to
collaboration of the first electrician
scientist so if you guys have some
recommendations or anybody here want to
talk about collaboration so thank you
very much
alright well thank you so much
many notable increase know
how would you feel if any
I mean I guess there's somebody
my experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
