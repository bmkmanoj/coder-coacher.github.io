hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
thank you so much for coming my name is
Amy Draves and I'm thrilled to welcome
Sydney Pato at the Microsoft Research
visiting speaker series she will be
discussing her graphic novel the
thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and
Babbage it's a retelling of our history
where Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage
go beyond theory and actually build the
first computer and then use it to fight
crime Sydney padova is a graphic artist
animator and author of the steampunk
webcomic 2d goggles her work has
appeared in several films including the
irony irony i a'n't clash of the titans
and john carter her book has been
featured on BBC's tech lab in the times
and wired UK please join me in giving
her a very warm welcome aah hello um so
this is one of the very very very first
talks I've done so be kind if I choke
just someone poke me until I on a choke
so this is sort of a general purpose
talk i'm not sure how many people are
familiar with the comic or even with
Lovelace and Babbage although I presume
at Microsoft at least the name term
average might ring a bell and so I know
I move this forward this work yes all
right so this is me I draw this comic
generally speaking in my spare time
normally I work in visual effects sort
of making imaginary giant monsters
that's what I do all day I work on when
I put this together i realized i work on
blue and orange movies
I started out as a hand-drawn animator
and it's a bit hilarious to find myself
giving a talk at Microsoft because I was
one of the very last and most reluctant
people dragged into computer animation
backwards leaving fingernail grooves in
the carpet but my relationship to
computers has changed a lot over the
last few years and it has because of
these two folks um about five years ago
I was in a pub I'm usually in a pub but
25 years ago I was in a pub with my
friend Sue shaman Anderson if any of you
guys have heard of ada lovelace day this
kind of online festival for celebrating
women in tech can stem um she started
this thing and and she said to me Sydney
you're sort of a woman attack oh look a
microphone should I be talking to us or
just talking about ok then I'll stand
over here uh she so she said you a woman
in tech you should you know you should
do a blog post for ada lovelace day and
I said I have no idea who Ada Lovelace
is so I picked her up on Wikipedia as
anyone would do and found this
extraordinary crazy story which I
thought this is such a great stories
make a really fun comic so I did have
quite short comic if you're not familiar
with it or them this is a speeding
introduction Ada Lovelace was indeed the
only daughter of Lord Byron the
notorious poet adventure in sex god and
she was the only product of this
marriage between him and Annabella
milbank called the princess of
parallelograms she was a bit into math
herself and when ADA was born her mother
was very concerned that she would become
poetical is the word they actually used
and buying himself actually also said I
hope that she is not poetic poetical and
I think this was a euphemism for
until illus which ran in Barnes family
Annabella's plan for eradicated poetic
ality was mathematics which is obviously
the opposite of poetry and therefore
acted or was supposed to act as this
sort of countervailing force so she
brought up beta on this site of logic
and mathematics a very unusual education
for a woman at the time this was the
1820s Lovelace was born in 1815 so this
is her 200th anniversary actually and so
she met Charles Babbage at a party
Babbage is leaning on his first
calculating machine there the difference
engine and Babbage was l'occasion
professor of mathematics and he's very
famous now as the inventor of a computer
which was never built the analytical
engine and barbuda Lovelace became quite
close friends and then unfortunately
they both died Lovelace first by quite
some time after she had written this big
paper on Babbage's machine and so I did
this these were just some panels of this
little very short comic I think it's
about a 12 panel comic just describing
these events so that people know who
they were I put it up online and and I
mean I thought this was a miserable
ending for the story I work in Hollywood
we don't like kind of happy endings so I
just threw in as a joke the following
panel um yeah because I mean that sucks
that they died so this was actually a
joke um it was the gag was wouldn't feel
nervous if there was a comic about Ada
Lovelace and Charles Babbage fighting
crime and it turned up the next day on a
wired blog as this person is going to do
a comic about some stuff I was right in
fact I succumb really easily to peer
pressure
so I thought oh actually that would be a
really fun comics so um I think by the
way this image here was heavily
influenced by the Avengers uh huh huh
I've asking people are people in the
u.s. familiar with the Avengers okay yay
and so yeah I started drawing this comic
where they fight crime generally badly
and because you know it's very true to
life for comic so they're their
definition of crime is straight music
and poetry sure they've devoted
themselves to the destruction of the
Arts basically and the triumph of
mathematics and I can try the comic for
about five years it's served now a book
available for sale in the back of the
room you should all buy it and it's uh
now the thing about the comic is it's
about it's mostly comics but at the same
time there's a lot of notes and I call
it being mostly true story the first
computer i've had this disputed because
the comic is actually 30 pages of what
actually happened and then 280 pages of
crime-fighting which is that mostly true
however it's mostly true by word count
because of the fitness and there's a lot
i love ways of course is famous for this
paper if you don't know the story very
briefly and Lovelace and Babbage had
been hanging hanging out I guess I would
say Lovelace was very fascinated by the
analytical engine and she got a
reputation as an expert on the subject
basically from listening to Babbage
rabbit on about it for about nine years
she was asked for this reason to
translate a paper from the French which
was the only existing documentation of
Babbage's engine published at the time
this was in 1841 and it's very strange
that Babbage never wrote his own paper
on them
sheen and but because this was the only
paper in existence they asked Lovelace
to translate it and partly because I
wait for a woman to write an original
scientific paper was not a thing that
would have happened at the time but
translating papers from the continent
was a known sort of accomplishment for
women and consider the proper role so
she translated this paper but Lovelace
was not a proper woman for the time she
had her very very specific own ideas and
opinions and she started adding
footnotes the footnotes are actually
three times as long as the original
paper and it's in the footnotes that so
much of what we now know is computer
science appear so here for example um
one of the great things i found when i
started the comic and I think anyone who
has actually read it online as I was
putting it up will have noted is that I
usually put a couple of panels of comic
and then a whole bunch of endnotes the
comic was sort of my way of just sharing
really interesting stuff that I found
about them online my proj that kind of
coincided with the starting of google
books and this kind of fantastic dumping
of all sorts of Victorian ephemera onto
the internet that was made searchable
and the great thing about that is that I
could find just all these mentions of
them from their contemporaries at the
time and what they thought of them and
what they thought of this project you
can read Lovelace's paper for example on
google books although tragically they
haven't unfolded the program the famous
Bernoulli numbers program is actually a
fold-out and if you open it up in google
books is just this sadly blank unfolded
paper so it's a bit ironic and yet so
appropriate in a way and so this is this
is love Lisa's famous observation that
the machine can work on general symbols
that which I designed the machine is in
arithmetic ille machine for the doing of
math I'll show you at the end of this
talk the reconstructions I've done a bit
ncg but love is as a kind of
theoretician of the machine was the
person who first said actually this is a
machine for the general handling of
information and not just arithmetic ille
stuff and so that you know that was
interesting of course and very worthy
but I also started reading oh here are
some footnotes by the way I probably
should have flipped it around but here I
can see these wrong signs in there one
of the first things I read was Bobby's
autobiography which is fantastic and
everyone should read it and in there he
describes the error pop up which is
actually a thing um he was always this
very complicated machine with all sorts
of widgets and bits and I think this is
one of the very first things i read that
made me think that this there's a lot of
material for a comic in here so not only
does it come with an arrow pop-up it
comes with a continual loud bell which
i'm sure would be very delightful if you
were the actual person programming the
machine so here's Lovelace debugging and
you'll notice she's swearing down there
this is she did swear quite a bit in her
letter she the Byron political and other
nature was not eradicated in any way
shape or form her personality to her
contemporaries comes out a lot I found
this now you can't read it because it's
tiny and super blurry this is from a
u.s. the New York mirror a tabloid who
says Oh fie it is said that ADA Byron
the sole daughter of the Nova Bart is
the most coarse and vulgar woman in
England and she was quite weird a lot of
her contemporary descriptions tend to
describe her is not successfully
socialized or ladylike which is what
happens when you raise a child solely by
mathematics so I wouldn't advise it uh
what else did I find there's a so this
is a my gag on and it'll Lovelace's
computer language
uh there's tons of stuff on beverage one
of the things I was really surprised to
find I think that they kind of imaginary
the popular view of Babbage is that he
was this poor misunderstood obscure
genius who created this amazing machine
but nobody appreciated or understood him
which is completely not true actually if
you look at kind of the contemporary
newspapers and what sort of stuff like
that Babbage was really hugely famous
and he was famous as a super genius who
had invented this amazing machine but
everyone really wished he would finish
it um this is from punch this is Babbage
he's very angry because he hasn't been
given the appropriate notice for his
machine from Prince Albert um so I've
had this also it's a great step above
average to see had a very big
personality so ever there's there's
literally dozens and dozens if not
hundreds of contemporary descriptions of
Babbage but I think this one is my
favorite because it's just so typical I
they put Queen Victoria's Diaries up
online searchable which I always love to
see and of course the very first thing I
did was put Babbage in and this is what
i get that just made a great fool of
himself as he does every where parov
Babbage I like this this is actually my
absolute favorite um but there's time I
mean there's there's so much bad stuff
it's actually really hard to pick out
kind of specific stuff there's a bunch
in the book and a bunch more on my
website I link to all my primary sources
which you can read yourself in full my
absolute absolute favorite though and
this is the true glory of searchable
documents this is from a private letter
from this guy Reed who is an American
poet who visited
babbage in the this I think this is 54
1854 two years after Lovelace had died
and he wrote a letter home and then 10
years later this letter appeared in the
southern review a very strange and very
short-lived periodical um that would
print I've it's a bit like a church
circular prints all kinds of sort of
random things but one of the things it
printed was this letter from Reed with
this beautiful description possibly of
Babbage trying to explain what computer
programming is to some guy the
descriptions connected with this
calculating machine I feeling I'm not
expressing myself rightly as to the
precise nature of the subject which it
is computer programming that's being
mentioned here it's not surprising that
you can't quite understand what the
subject was um anyway this it's it's
really magical when you can read this
stuff it really brings them back to life
as human beings so I would encourage
everyone to kind of poke around primary
documents because they're great um so
how much for tongue power sorry I've
been told to to keep this brisk so I'm
going to rattle through um now these are
the one thing that I found in
researching was the third character I
guess in the comic is the analytical
engine um and we are everyone's read the
secondary sources are you know computer
history 101 or whatever the first
computer was Babbage's engine it had a
memory not a processor it was made of
cogs it was driven through steam and
it's so complicated that you can't
possibly understand it now we're moving
on and and this drove me nuts i kept
kind of paging through more and more
dense papers trying to find someone who
would just described really how it
worked and also what it looked like
because I'm a cartoonist and I just
wanted to see a drawing of a big-ass
computer made of gears because who
wouldn't um but uh no such strong
existed
some as it appears in the comic it's
this vast labyrinth of gears that's
continually changing which is kind of
reflective of my own experience in
dealing with computers and people are
continually getting lost and attacked in
there as happens to us all um but um so
here's the so I'll just quickly go over
cuz you guys are computer people so
you'll probably find this interesting if
this is really boring it should probably
stop me uh but just to just to kind of
quickly go over the basics this is the
difference engine I think come when we
say the analytical engine was never
built a lot of people say ah but what
about the one in the Computer History
Museum that's the difference engine this
is Babbage's first machine it's a
calculator it but so you can get a sense
of what this machine would have looked
like oh I can shoot out anything it's a
beautiful machine but it's an adder
that's the one carry the rippling arms
that go up the back are carrying the
ones um but really all this machine does
is add and it adds in a specific way for
printing uh basically tables in the days
before computers if you were say
navigator at sea trying to triangulate a
position or much more excitingly someone
working for life insurance company
trying to figure out compound interest
over a course of 20 years and you
couldn't just stay out of that you know
type it into your machine so what you
would use is these giant tables and you
can pick them up for nothing because
every office had them you know volumes
and volumes this thick of every
conceivable iteration of a certain sum
yeah I'm she'd say oh I need to figure
out this X percent of this for this
period of years so you'd flip through
find that X percent and there it would
be the printing of these tables of
course is a huge pain especially because
these were calculations done by human
beings sitting in a room you know
working through each
one of these calculations they were full
of errors so this was why Babbage
invented this machine in the first place
the theory being if you could mechanize
these calculations they would be
error-free and faster and so the
difference engine is an adder uses the
method of differences that's what it's
called a different engine um and
although it's very beautiful and it has
especially this remarkable printer I
think they show yeah there's a thing
sorry there's lots of stuff online about
this widget the the workings of a
Difference Engine are obviously
extremely well understood because it's
been built in those terms of great stuff
on YouTube on how it works just doing
ads and then the carries so lovely thing
but it's not the analytical engine and
that's the one I really wanted to know
how it worked um basically in these in
the early 30s Babbage started to think
what if you could take the result that
came out one end of the engine and then
fed it back into the beginning and did
something else to that number he called
this the engine eating its own tail so
he started doing all these designs for
how to feed numbers back through and do
different things over the course of a
vote oh oh he worked on the machine for
the rest of his life in kind of spurts
um when he was a this is the machine in
that state when Lovelace wrote her paper
he kept moving things around which is
one of the reasons it's so hard to find
diagrams of it but this is the most
complete overview of the engine so this
is what I used um so you can see the did
I get a pointer I'll just point you can
see the this is the store you can't
quite read that this is storage the
memory this is these giant wheels that
turn around and carry the results around
I'll sure it'll be clear when I show you
the innovation in a sec um so well
basically took this instead of doing
elevation
which is was actually by no means
straightforward because there is no
proper elevation of the engine so I had
to kind of call it together but as to
the best of my understanding it would
have looked like this um punch cards are
on the bottom and that was kind of my
first surprise I always picture them at
the top like a jacquard loom there on
the bottom the whole thing is driven by
these cams uh and it's got these barrel
controllers which I'll explain in a sec
this is possibly a little small actually
um each of those columns the vast bulk
of it is numbers each of those columns
represents a number this is 40 decimal
places so you have you just have little
cogs you know one two three four five
going up with you know each each layer
is one decimal place so this is 40
decimal places high beverage ideally
wanted it 50 guests of all places which
he described as being as far as he could
see necessary for all future purposes of
science I think actually 50 decimal
places is extremely unusual to use right
now so um I think you may be overdid it
but that is always liked things to be as
as perfect as possible which is probably
why you never actually finished the
machine um just got cats on it because I
like to draw cats um so how does this
what are you looking at here and this is
a bit of an overview this is from the
book but the clearest way to explain it
is probably to look at the animation
this is way obviously sliced down
simplified I've stripped out everything
babish never used one lever when 50
would do ah so he sought he's always
linking everything with these wonderful
Rube Goldberg devices to make things
faster and more air free and to make the
operations more efficient
um hopefully this will be clear it
actually took three different kinds of I
should loop this if I can it took three
different kinds of cards to run a
program um it's got the operations card
this is the famous programming this is
the addressing system the variable cards
and then there's the number cards on the
far end and so what's happening here I
can can I step friend no thanks so I'll
just can't just rent it the number cards
are just a card with each number as
holes they push against the levers if
there's a hole doesn't activate lever if
there's no hole it pushes the lever so
you have each decimal place down each
one will have a 1 spot with no hole
activate tool ever reads the number out
onto the store so this is only one
decimal place right this machine would
actually extend upwards so each of those
little gears would then register
whatever the number was on the card so
that card is read on to the store on to
the memory so once it's got the numbers
into the store next thing that happens
this is a this I'm a little fuzzy on and
actually Babbage kept changing it just
very Babbage whether the operation card
sets the operation first or the variable
sets the address first not quite sure
just for clarity I'm having the
operations card set up this is the mill
and each of these sections does a
different mathematical function it could
add subtract multiply divide that's all
the engine could do um it had actually
specific for speed it had specific
sections for multiplying by 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 it would break the number up
multiply each bit kind of in a chunk put
it back together it's a very very very
complicated machine this is just to kind
of explain how the information flows
through the operation code up
the barrel it's incredibly clever and
it's incredibly like machine language in
a sense and each operation card has one
will operate one lever the lever will
rotate these barrels around and the
barrels have rows of pegs it actually
controls 33 different barrels the same
time each of those barrels has 80 pegs
or so going up and down they push
forward so you'll see it in a sec here
that's the address wait back up back up
a little more the barrel pushes forward
and those barrels will activate dozens
and dozens of levers at once to set up
everything necessary for specific
calculation so if you have the
operations card says I want you to add
the numbers that are going to come in it
hooks up the adding system so will it
will as you see select the little
opinion just will bring an opinion up
and then send it basically channel it
over to this section from the addresses
on the variable card which has the
address in building this machine in and
trying to describe how it worked for the
book I started to understand why
everyone said it's so complicated that
it's hard to explain in it it is in a
sense quite a simple machine like all
these bits even I can understand so
there must be pretty simple but it's
it's how they all combined together
there's lots of stuff happening at the
same time so yeah storage ingress so it
feeds everything into the ingress the
ingress sends it to whichever section
depending on the operations card
operation does its thing these are all
very specific little bits sends it back
out to the out grass which can go to the
printer or back into storage so when
they say it's basically a modern
computer they're not kidding because
every part is basically there yes how
many numbers do
Stewart hey that was left this up in the
air um as you can see actually if I go
back in this plan you can see the story
just goes off the page everyone wants
more storage uh his basic design had a
hundred and he had mentioned the number
of thousand but he basically left it
ideally obviously it would have millions
of these things and you're very
constrained by the racks the go back
forward the racks are just these giant
racks with teeth like it's a physical
thing and it would the longer the
storage is the longer the rack has to be
and it's just a rack and pinion so it's
turning this you have this little
opinion turns a thing and pushes the
rack over however many units so
mechanically speaking the longer the
storage is the longer the racks get and
the more room you have for something to
go horribly wrong and moving the numbers
around his later designs moved this mill
the kind of calculation bit the CPU into
the middle and put the storage down
either side so it's a bit more square
than this but I don't have proper plans
for that so I didn't do that one um
right these are just some more
animations if bits all mechanical um
these are this is basically I worked I
would just take a plan fortunately I'm
an animator so i have this kit around
just to build it i mean for me to
actually be able to build the machines
was vital to understand them it's
Babbage's genius is absolutely
incredible when you think that he was
doing this stuff in his head so if you
think in terms of spatial reasoning
skills it's pretty spectacular there's
thousands and thousands and thousands of
parts to the machine this is the barrel
controller and the famous or it's not
famous the obscure
unless you're me and conditional arm
this is what gives the machine the
ability to loop and do feedback certain
results could send a calculation back
through the system so it has this little
arm that drops down if you get a certain
result um the theory is well stop stop
stop spoilers the theory is that
Lovelace got the concept of this machine
is a logic machine ah this is okay there
we go sorry I'm using the wrong button I
need to stick to the mouse here you yeah
stop wait oh not pass that one there we
go oh of course yeah I have to keep
running if there's if the lever falls
down then it will activate if there's no
leaver there then it won't so it's an
if-then function um this is you know
known as Lovelace asleep babish put that
in there for mechanical reasons for pure
math there's no evidence that Babbage
ever thought of it as a logic machine
also logic was not there yet logic at
the time was still a wrist Italian logic
basically this is about 10 years before
bool but a lot of people were working on
mathematical systems of logic including
notably Lovelace's teacher Augustus de
Morgan who was teaching lovely
mathematics and that's probably where
she had this conception that you could
put Babbage's analytical engine together
with a mathematical logic system to
handle information generally and not
just arithmetic on the machine just to
cap it off these the punch card system
this was based on the jacquard loom um
how can go forward ah there you go I
took a trip up to I just thought this
might be fun and or interesting for
programmers the jacquard loom of course
required thousands of cars to do these
patterns and cloth and I was I they have
these wonderful machines for stitching
these are this is a giant sewing machine
for stitching the cars together and this
is a piano punch on the other side here
which is how you you punch the program
onto the cards basically so you push the
button and it makes a little hole so you
read along the pattern and punch the
punch it in so I designed for Lovelace
her programmer organ out of these two
machines um oh yes yeah of course you
need a lot of thread to to hold the
programs together uh so that is
hopefully not too long we're boring
we're confusing sorry this is my first
time doing a talk hope it went okay
thank you I guess I'll take questions at
this stage yes so just glancing through
the first bits of the comic um it seemed
like you start using the term difference
engine and what's what's what's going on
um okay I'm getting a lot of stick to
this obviously the difference engine is
the crappy simple adder machine the
analytical engine is the far superior
giant punch card control computer
Babbage would not be pleased to see me
using the term difference engine but
it's just way cooler than the term
analytical engine and if you just say to
the analytical engine it doesn't have
the same ring to it so I am helping
spread confusion and
misinformation by calling it the
difference engine but are willing gibson
did it first so that sir that's Frank's
cute so who's gonna direct the movie me
of course cuz I feel free more vision
like a Downton Abbey version oh uh two
things one is how was the kiss work
there were funded and it wasn't really
speaking tube and what would that be
used for and baggage of course but of
course I say of course because I've been
immersed with this stuff um the story of
Babbage and government funding and would
make a extremely boring but very lengthy
comic and Babbage got an enormous sum of
money to make the difference engine
17,000 pounds is the official figure I
think even at the time they described
this as the cost of two warships it was
kind of the first disastrous government
IT project Babbage worked on the
Difference Engine 4 10 years or so I
think 23 was when he got his first Grand
to do it there was several reasons why
he didn't finish it um main one probably
being that he was trying to Spanish
beverage was a perfectionist and not
much of a people manager he was very
extroverted he loved people but he
wasn't very good at kind of handling a
crew so the difference engine fell apart
then it came up with the analytical
engine which was so obviously superior
to the difference engine that he
abandoned the Difference Engine much the
government's discussed he tried to get
funding to the analytical engine but of
course if you haven't told The
Difference Engine then it's hard to get
like three times as much money to build
a much more complicated machine and in
terms of how he funded his own
researches in Babbage was independently
wealthy he was loaded he was like the
classic gentleman scientist kind of the
11 of the last ones really of this you
know guy who had tons of passion was
really smart so he just messed around
with it
on his own dime and what was the second
question is what's the really speaking
to is that your imagination that's my
magic okay smishing does not a diss
about not what I just wonder if there
was any because of the size of it any
what you know maybe he envisioned a need
to be able to communicate with somebody
on the other side for fixing it i don't
know i think you i think it would be too
loud but the analytical engine in
running would have made a hell of a
racket i don't think you could have
heard anything yet oh so i noticed that
there's lots and i enjoyed them the lots
and lots of footnotes on every page and
it occurred to me that it sort of
mirrors the relationship between how
it'll of lights were a bunch of
footnotes to to the charles babbage's
paper or the start of the paper
describing machine and i was curious if
that like a really long footnote thing
was a specific and purposeful allusion
to that relationship or it is a sort of
evolved from from what you were doing in
making a mostly fictional account um
definitely evolved out of the nature the
comic being a blog um I mean it'sit's
people call it a webcomic but I think
real webcomic people would object that
there's not enough coming in too many
notes but it was definitely ultimately a
joke about Lovelace's footnotes being
the real meat of the story yep uh are
you familiar with saddles own filth ugly
old girl genius oh yes of course I
didn't know you mr. in Seattle yes oh
yeah I'm way less prolific but you'd
grown girl genius Thanks yes I used to
read his stuff and dragon magazine back
in the day he's still around so it is
the comic still ongoing um yes I think
so I've got a lot of comics i'd love to
draw but um is this is not my day job
both financially and time wise and
working visual effects with it which if
you know anyone who's works and visual
effects is not the most free tiny sort
of let it all hang out occupation ever
so it's very hard to find time
especially right now seriously look them
contain everything that has yet appear
here everything except organist which
that's if you don't know the comic the
longest-running story by a good ways is
organists organized crime um but that is
actually a hundred and fifty pages long
so it's it's kind of far mostly cleaned
up so we might do another book with them
just organized in a couple of other
things wow I was that clear so you're
