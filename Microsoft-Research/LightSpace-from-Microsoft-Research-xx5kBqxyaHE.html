new system we calling light space and
what we're doing is using some of the
new depth sensing cameras technologies
to extend the sensing so that it
encompasses the entire room and so what
that allows us to do in light space is
all the usual kinds of surface
interactions on tabletops but then we
can also fill in the void between the
space between these various surfaces so
that we can connect surfaces so we can
move objects from one surface to another
just by tracking the the person and
understanding that the 3d shape of the
person and where each surface is placed
in the environment now one of the things
that we're using is this setup this
configuration here of projectors and
multiple depth cameras and together
these are calibrated to a unified 3d
model and we do all our reasoning and
calculations out of this 3d model allows
us to do perform various kinds of
reasoning to move objects from one place
to the other for example so what we have
down here is a regular tabletop now
there's there's no instrumentation in
the table but it's a standard-issue
Microsoft table really would but what we
can do is we can project the appearance
of the interactive tabletop and we can
track what the user is doing on the
table from above from the depth sensing
cameras above so here all the kind of
typical surface like interactions that
one could assume to get in an
interactive surface but the interesting
thing right now is that for example
these are our research videos if we want
to actually take this research video and
show it here on the wall you can
literally just connect through our body
we can touch an object on the table and
touch the wall and now we have a video
playing from our last from our last
TechFest demo
so in addition to all the kind of
surface level interactions we can pick
up an actual object and move it to our
hand what you're seeing here is a
different representation of a that same
object it's a little ball in my hand and
we can move it to another hand like this
we can even hand it over to to Andy
and he can play with it some more I'll
hand it back to you sure or we can also
take you directly over there to the to
the screen and now this video that we
picked up from the table and played
around with in space is now playing on
the screen we played around with a
couple other concepts in this space one
is that we can we can have locations in
space actually have special meanings so
for example if you look down here on the
floor you see a flashing menu sign and
really what the signals to us is that in
the column of space right above this
space on the floor there are options for
you to select so if I move my hand here
through the column of space we actually
get to see different options of
selection and we all only two selected
we just have to wait a little bit in
here and now we selected to change our
all our videos and photos from our
research videos into our personal baby
photos for Andy and me
and in addition last thing that we can
select here in the menu is to highlight
every person in the space so right now
you're seeing me highlighted as blue so
the system tracks me in the space and
I'm highlighted as blue if some other
person comes in like Andy in here he's
gonna be green and so this brings some
interesting opportunities for us to
track people and infer the interactions
between two peoples so if we shake hands
we are going to change colors we just
merged and we have a different the
system detected that that there was an
interaction between us
so this highlighting example is just one
thing that we can do with the 3d data
that we get back from the depth sensing
cameras in the future we'd like to think
more about different kinds of things
that we can do between surfaces and in
particular we're talking about what
we're calling deviceless augmented
reality most people have seen augmented
reality concepts where maybe we're using
head mounted displays or see-through
goggles other kinds of devices you have
to wear and it could be kind of clumsy
with white space we can project the
graphics directly onto the onto body
parts or your environment for example so
maybe you're late for a meeting in the
way that
you figure out where you have to be as
you pull out your hand in the shows you
where to go and then maybe even in front
of you on the floor you see some kind of
arrow that shows you exactly where to go
so this is a an example of the some of
the things that we'd like to look at in
the future
you
so I'd like to take you through some of
the processing that we're doing in light
space so this window shows a lot of the
representations we're using so for
example up here at the top we have the
three camera views this is the their
actual data coming off the depth sensing
cameras in the raw and what we do is we
combine these views into a single 3d
model of the space and we can do that
because we have the the cameras and the
projectors calibrated to this 3d model
and so you'll notice that as Benko moves
around in the scene this this is 3d
models updated appropriately from these
these inputs now another thing that
we're doing is illustrated over here we
can take various projections of this
data for various purposes so for example
we have this simulated or surface
representation here or the table with
the pictures on it now as Benko starts
manipulating these photos we see this
this particular projection now shows the
the kinds of things that we usually get
with surface these various contact
contacts as they're as they're made and
so that's just a quick example of some
of the things that we can do with our 3d
model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
