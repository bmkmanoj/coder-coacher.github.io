approaches to minimize the effects of
latency and projector camera systems
projector camera systems or programs
afford a wide range of interactive
possibilities however latency in the
system can cause the projection to slip
from its intended target as a result of
this program systems have typically
shied away from truly dynamic scenarios
instead constraining users movements
previous work has explored latency
reduction through custom hardware or
advanced multi camera tracking systems
however the requirement for additional
hardware and expertise brenda's these
approaches at odds with the lightweight
development approaches favored by both
the enthusiast and research communities
such as made possible by cameras like
Microsoft Kinect as a result of this we
explore the feasibility of software only
prediction approaches to reducing
latency we explore two different example
fast motion scenarios involving on
object and on body projection our first
scenario explores objects in free flight
we developed a juggling display we fit a
projectile motion model to a Kalman
filter to predict the balls location
approximately a hundred milliseconds
into the future this allows us to align
the projection with the balls expected
location our second predictive approach
is based on the observation that expert
skill involves repetitive motion and
seeks to minimize jerk watch the
jugglers hands the motion is
predominantly cyclical we call the semi
predictable motion we developed a
predictive memory model where we use the
prior motion from the last 30 seconds as
a look up for our prediction we can use
this technique to increase projection
accuracy in on body projection across a
range of scenarios as latency varies by
device we designed our system to
automatically measure and account for
its own latency we encourage you to read
our paper for a more detailed
explanation of our work and our results

hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
