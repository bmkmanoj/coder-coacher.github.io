think we have an almost unique blend of
basic open research that's directed to
all solving real practical problems for
industry and for society the lab in
Cambridge began in July of 97 we were
the first lab to be opened outside of
the USA today we're part of a network of
microsoft research labs around the world
that taken together I think represents
the strongest computer science research
lab in the world
I think Cambridge is a very natural
location for Microsoft to set up a
research lab not only do we have a
world-class University but it's also hub
of innovation there's a real
entrepreneurial spirit in the city
so we have around a couple of hundred
people in the lab comprising scientists
and researchers and engineers and
postdocs we also have a very strong
intern program particularly in the
summer we have product groups embedded
within the lab that we collaborate with
very closely the lab collaborates
extensively with the academic world we
participate fully in academic
conferences and we co supervise PhD
students in universities across Europe
the lab has a portfolio of research
areas which I think reflects some of the
major trends in our industry
particularly around cloud computing and
machine intelligence we do research on
languages and tools for programming we
do research in networks and in systems
and in security all of which are vital
to the infrastructure of cloud computing
one of the newer areas of research in
the lab brings together a
cross-disciplinary team of designers and
engineers and social scientists aiming
to create compelling new experiences for
living in the digital world
in the early days of the lab one of the
first research areas we set up was in
machine learning and at the time that
was seen as a sort of a crazy wild field
in which to be doing research but today
machine learning is very much in the
mainstream in fact it's one of the
hottest and fastest moving areas of
computer science recently we've come to
realize that there's a very deep
connection between computer science and
biology
it's extraordinary these two very
different fields should have such deep
connections this is reflected in our
research in programmable matter and in
biological computation
we have a strong culture of doing basic
open research that's driven by very real
practical applications we like to go
after problems that have practical value
who which are so difficult we don't know
how to solve them it causes us to do
basic research in the process we solve
those practical problems and at the same
time we develop new ideas and principles
that can be applied in many different
areas
a lot of our research has a direct
impact on Microsoft's business in fact
virtually every product or service that
Microsoft provides has been influenced
in some important way by the work of
Microsoft Research whether it's being or
office or whether it's Skype or Xbox</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
