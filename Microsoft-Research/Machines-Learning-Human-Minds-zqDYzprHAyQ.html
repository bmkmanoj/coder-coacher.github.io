it's a great pleasure to have you all
here for Metallica Shinseki's talk eval
is a PhD student at the psychometric
center here in Cambridge working with
Professor John rust and he has also been
with us for some time as a contractor
now and we have various projects going
on together makalah has done some
amazing work at the interface of psycho
metrics and crowdsourcing and that's
what he's going to talk about today
please retire thank you thank you all
for coming it's such an early hour so I
started a social psychology as well to
be honest I started as a mathematician
but I kind of decided to drop this
course after one year and I switch to
psychology and psychology as you may
know it's about understanding human
minds but then being interested in
mathematics and computers and science in
general and some people say that
psychology is not a science which of
course I college is fine video offense
it is and in many very nice methods like
for incidence factor analysis comes from
the context of psychology but well as a
person interested in computers I decided
to kind of focus my research on the kind
of environment where machines interact
with people and then my research is
focused both on kind of detecting
people's minds looking at the behavior
in the online environment but also kind
of trying to make machines to understand
human minds then the well sorry to that
work the second to go
Oh
so today I will speak about what is the
important what is the importance of the
human mind then I will tell you a little
about why I believe that machines should
learn about it why it could be
beneficial for them and for the owners
of those machines and also i will show
you an example how you can make machines
to learn about human minds so what
theory of fear of mind theory of mine is
defined in psychology as an ability to
attribute mental states to oneself but
also to the others and this seems pretty
obvious kind of disabilities pretty
obvious to most likely all of the people
in this room but if you think about the
animal kingdom but also about if you
look at the human development is not
such an obvious ability so for instance
kids when they are very very young
infants below second the second year
they do not really have the theory of
mind so they they will understand that
there are those objects around that they
are pretty soft and sometimes can feed
you and they will tell you nice things
but they do not really understand that
those objects they have mental states
they have their own beliefs they have
their personalities and so on hi so
theory of mine is not really any kind of
scientific theory it's just the notion
that people recognized psychological
states of the others and then having a
theory of mind allows you to predict
other other's behavior so kind of
infants they came kind of making
association between you know a very nice
and smiling soft object and getting some
food but they are pretty bad at kind of
predicting the behaviors of human beings
in general the same about animals
especially animals that were not
domesticated did not evolve co-evolved
with humans they're the kind of can
treat you as a danger they can treat
other animals is a danger but they will
not go over kind of treating them as
dangerous or helpful object that will
not be
to assign some mental state or beliefs
or motivations to those to those object
and of course fear of mind allows people
to master kind of adjusting our behavior
to the behavior of others to plant the
plants and motivations of the of the
other people and then all of this allows
us to succeed in the social environment
which kind of you may say it's a basic
environment for us we more or less
mastered the physical environment around
us we we know how to feed ourselves and
defend ourselves from predators and we
do it where well there are different
opinions about it but i would say that
we do it kind of we are relatively
successful at this stage and now kind of
individual differences in their success
in the success of the people depend on
how good you are at understanding other
people predicting the behavior and
adjusting your own behavior to the
behavior of the others to succeed in the
social environment and of course people
show great variety of behaviors so all
of us here can be both very aggressive
and very cooperative all of us here can
be very honest but we are also able to
do some petty crimes like for instance
lie or still a small thing and actually
research in psychology but also history
shows you that perfectly normal people
very cultured ones that would never kind
of admit to it kind of predict that they
will be able to kill someone if you put
them in a right situation in right
contacts they will more or less
voluntarily kill other people in behave
in a very atrocious way but while we are
able to present kind of very wide ranges
of behavior behaviors there's also a
case and kind of we all kind of
intuitively understand that that kind of
people have certain tendencies and they
show certain patterns and behaviors so
even if each one of you could be very
aggressive and very calm kind of you
have your tendencies so you kind of
recognize that people some of the people
or rather calm whereas other people are
rather nervous and aggressive towards
the others and then this recognition led
to some systems of intuitive like kind
of non-scientific system that we all
kind of possess here of kind of
predicting those patterns and being able
to to try to try to get the tendencies
of the others when it comes to their
behaviors and well which in turn leads
us to be able to predict their behaviors
but it also led to some scientific
approaches to understanding describing
and categorizing human minds let me
start with the intuitive understanding
of other minds so you have an individual
here on the picture and while you look
at him you kind of instantaneously
create some opinions about the mind of
this individual so for instance you may
be able to predict where this guy here
is conventional or liberal and any any
guesses but this person is but a cool
liberal okay spontaneous or well
organized well-organized introverted or
extroverted assertive of or agreeable
stressed or relaxed smart stupid stupid
not sure well we also could kind of go
further and I guess that you could
handle ascribe to this individual mood
he's obviously smiling so it's kind of
pretty easy but if you think about it
will be just lying it'll be just kind of
trying to convince us that he is in a
good mood and also kind of temporal
goals so for instance this guy looks
pretty official so he might be going for
some important business meeting or kind
of tried to show his better self and
what is his real personality what is
this will mine to be honest I don't know
it's like a stock picture really but the
thing is that the kind of predictions
you all made here and express them or
just kind of made them quietly are
pretty accurate the research shows that
just looking at someone's picture
provides you with
kind of very accurate prediction of
someone's future behaviors goals
attitudes basically gives you a good
view of someone's mind so such kind of
assessment of minds can be based on
personal interaction so of course the
longer you interact with someone the
better is your idea about his or her
potential traits potential behavior
goals motivations and so on but the same
kind of assessment can be based on an
East based on the picture of someone on
the voice on just seeing the room of
someone you can basically assess the
personality just by seeing a bedroom or
an office of an individual looking at
Facebook or a website website or
Facebook profile but also and this is
kind of this was shocking to me out I
must admit you also make some
associations between individuals and the
trades just looking at the names and
what is fine in it is that those
associations they are marginally
accurate when it comes only to to the
name of course you could say hey how is
it possible but actually there are some
theories how it could work so for
instance if someone is called Albert and
in a given society there was a famous
Albert in the past that was very brave
so now everyone who sees guy who is
called Albert will associate bravery to
this person and then kind of by kind of
social but kind of fulfilling the
prophecy this guy those people on
average might be slightly more brave
than the others simply because kind of
society accumulated them for it I don't
say this is a kind of very important and
very and very kind of predictive factor
but this but studies show that someone's
name you can actually tell you something
about his or her mind those assessment
are unsurprisingly i would say accurate
and you will see in a second why and
kind of they are so obvious that we
really kind of notice how important and
widespread they are when you observe
people that have deficits of the theory
of mind and a good example of the of a
group of people they were kind of
due to the kind of to have a personal
personal problems with with with with
predicting others people's states and
assigning trades to them is when you
observe for instance people with Down
syndrome or Asperger syndrome those guys
there might be super smart otherwise but
they're kind of interactions in the
society are seriously affected by the
fact that they cannot really ascribe
they cannot really predict others people
behavior behaviors they more or less
treat other people like objects and they
kind of have to understand other people
using their reasoning and not this
autopilot that allows you to very
quickly predict others people behavior
and now why the question the question
that psychology tried to answer for a
long time is why kind of we have we kind
of deploy so much of our brain power to
make predictions about the others and
try to kind of figure out they beliefs
motivations and so on so the first the
first issue here is personal safety you
should remember that most of our
evolution kind of happens well on the
Savannah where the main enemy of the
human being was the other human being it
was the one most dangerous factor in our
history kind of history of modern humans
was just the other humans and then kind
of being able to figure out very quickly
what are the motivations goals emotions
of the other people whether you can
trust them or not whether they are
reliable or not whether the aggressive
or not basically was saving lives so
those guys were bad at it simply were
killed at one time or the other and
didn't leave so many descendants but
also obtaining help and support so even
if you kind of were able to avoid with
risks of being killed you still needed
to predict other people minds to obtain
their help and support successful
socializing
scientific support the theory of
basically man versus man leading to
evolution of like these technological
entrances well so there well this is a
very kind of interesting interesting
subject in general i love it i read a
lot about it so for instance when you
find when you find scarves or bones of
the people of death or or hominids
because not only homo sapiens but kind
of previous species versions of Homo
then you can see that most of them
actually did not die for the natural
reasons most of them died because
someone killed them so kind of you very
often find a piece of an arrow or a
trash skull and it's not animals and our
animals do not shoot arrows so kind of
you can find that people mostly died
because of meeting other people and then
you can also observe it in animals so
for instance chimpanzees our closest
closest cousins who would spend an
enormous amount of time kind of trying
to understand the adders and plot
against the others kind of make
audiences with their friends so for it
so simple shim pansies are the example
of the of the species very similar to
human beings i would say but of course
we kind of assign so much importance to
culture and science and knowledge and we
kind of do not pay so much attention to
instincts that it sometimes becomes
obscure but if you think about like a
dog pack the strongest usually the
strongest dog would be there kind of the
alpha alpha male or alpha female it
depends probably of the only species of
the dog but in human beings or
shrimpanzees it's not always the
strongest that is a is a boss of the
village is the chief of the village it
might be the one it was most skillful in
kind of making ions and plotting with
the others against you know against
those bulky ones they were not really
skillful in kind of in kind of obtaining
other people's help and support but
there are many proofs for the fact that
when your social skills grow and we kind
of wicket we say social skills but
really social skills are based on the
ability to understand the others to kind
of please the others
but to please the others you need to
know what they want to hear for instance
right so kind of disability to
understand our mind is shown it's widely
kind of visible it kind of helps you to
advance in the society it helps you to
make friends it helps you to climb
social hierarchy think about like people
who are taking very important positions
and I kind of controlling controlling
the social environment the controlling
the company controlling the country very
often those people would have super well
developed social skills and a which
basically can be reduced ability to
understand other minds of course it
helps in personal relationships for
instance with your partners but also it
was an important factor in trading and
exchange understanding other goals needs
fears helps you to sell them stuff but
you can also figure out what kind of
they could give up easily for the thing
you want to sell them so today we kind
of sell things for money in the past
trade was usually bartered was
exchanging was exchanging goods so kind
of it was helping you if you could
understand what is not what is less
important for you and more important for
me and vice versa so I can kind of which
kind of gives the potential for a
successful exchange and then of course
the importance and kind of prevalence of
theories of mine and kind of I'm sorry
because in order to communicate with
someone you have some idea of what state
parents you know
tell them is that something that you
consider an important factor I do agree
that language is is important fact or in
for instance communicating States some
some kind of some some scientists would
claim also that that actually theory of
mind at the level achieved by humans was
enabled by having language kind of being
able to describe each other's people's
each other states also language kind of
also language proves the importance of
human states and understanding minds for
our kind of survival and well-being and
the and the proof is that there are so
many words in the languages that
basically kind of are focused at
describing other people traits like
someone is nice good bad basically there
are huge numbers of adjectives that kind
of our focus at describing other people
but i wouldn't i'm not i don't think i
can solve this problem and i don't
actually think that this problem is at
the moment kind of there was a kind of
the final decision made on whether
language enabled theory of mind or the
other way around or is it is it really
kind of related for instance bees not
sure if it has a plural form be
basically they can communicate they can
kind of send quite complicated messages
to each other showing where the food is
and it is currently believed that be do
not have to Yuri of mind so they do not
really kind of assign any goals and
motivations to other bees they just have
this instinct that tell them hey
communicate show to the other little
objects with wings that's the food is
here or there not sure if it if it's a
good answer that's an interesting boiler
I guess with bees they tend to have the
same desires all the time like that
the state of mind could be said to be so
constant they always want hunting
forever but it's interesting for
anything well some people would argue
that humans are the same they just wont
honey and and other things but not so
many of them so basically kind of the
importance the importance of
understanding human minds of course led
to the signs of human minds and the
first kind of record that approaches but
of course presumably there were plenty
of unrecorded approaches are in ancient
Egypt where they kind of distinguish
between four humors for different types
of people and you can easily kind of you
can even today easily understand those
four types so this was popular later in
Greece and Rome and also pretty much
dominated the psychology of the medieval
times and only in the 20th century we
kind of started getting some other
approaches to to scientifically
describing human minds including some
personality theories they were like type
theories like mbti Union theory sixteen
personality factors 33 personality
factors theory but in 1980s Big Five
approach which basically which basically
claims that human behavior human
motivations differences in human minds
can be successfully described by five
presumably orthogonal but in practice
not so often dimensions which are
openness to experience conscientiousness
which is basically how much how much
will organize versus spontaneous you are
extraversion agreeableness and
neuroticism and also of course you can
plenty of other approaches to describe
minds like IQ satisfaction of life
satisfaction of life values attitudes
and so on and then the question would be
why should machines learn human minds
and I made a little blood here and
basically
where I will put some companions on the
on the dimension of how much they
understand the human minds and I start
with the cat I actually wanted to say
machines with tools but I thought that
cats low cat lover could be offended
when I when I refer to them as tools or
machines that people use but actually i
would say that as much as we
domesticated cats cats domesticated us
if you look actually probably the ratio
of kind of at the benefit for the
species it's probably cats who benefit
more from from domesticating humans than
and then the other way around but
domestication of cuts happened quite
recently and even if most of you and
especially those who had cuts would
agree that cats do have personality so
there's this there's this funny funny
think about human beings that because
our kind of very kind of our mechanism
to ascribe minds to the others are so
strong we keep ascribing man minds to
animals and when it comes to cut is
probably quite valid but we also keep
ascribing minds to very simple objects
like a stone if you stumble over the
stone you're very often tend to say our
stupid stone which obviously is rubbish
don't cannot be stupid but you kind of a
sign mine to it because it's kind of
your autopilot this kind of guides you
here and then three c-3po who was
successful kind of what a huge theory of
human minds was not always applying it
successfully as you may remember and
then dogs dogs are again animals similar
to cuts but the theory of mind is much
better and actually there's a there's a
area of psychology of animals and they
would say that simply dogs can
understand human minds much better than
cats because they were domesticated
earlier and there was kind of a
selective breeding so if you think about
the dog owner who had many dogs those
dogs who can understand the mind of the
door of the dog owner better can control
the dog governor better so then I'm more
successful at obtaining food spreading
the genes and so on but it would work
also otherwise so those dog owners that
understood their dogs better we're much
more successful in using those
dogs for the right purposes so they were
kind of having more success in their in
their environment so we could say that
the evolution work on both sides like
dogs evolved to understand human minds
but also people evolve to have minds
understandable for dogs and to
understand and to understand dog's mind
and then of course you have this this
job here how 9000 that that was quite
successful at having his own mind and
also understanding people's mind of
course you have people who are quite
good at understanding most of us are
very good at understanding up other
people's mind and at the end here
Tupperware and used car sellers that
definitely master understanding human
minds and using it for their advantage
what now what could be there what could
be the advantage for the machines to
understand human minds well I would
start with advertising because this is
kind of the most interesting part for me
and you could for instance use
understanding human beings to target
advertising so if you have a machine
imagining a web browser and your web
browser or your poor google or facebook
or bing wants to show another advert if
this machine understands the mind of the
user it can nicely select the advert but
it can also nicely select the language
that will kind of feed the minds and
goals and emotions of the individual
that just uses the computer to maximize
its success in selling your stuff it can
be using content selection so by
understanding the minds of the reader
you can select the content that this
kind of most attractive for the
individual and to give you an example if
you talk to people if you have let's say
a young daughter you would not talk with
your young daughter about mysql you
understand her mind and you understand
that my school is probably not
interesting for young girls so you kind
of talk with fairy about well i don't
want to be sexist or ageist here but
probably about teddy bears so kind of
cartoons and so on you don't talk with
her about mysql
at this moment computers are very good
in talking about MySQL with with people
who don't really want to know about
MySQL or or otherwise because they do
not have the areas of mind it can be
used in search it can be used to
personalize rerun the results of the
search if you understand kind of the
individual you can present him the
results that he is looking for a much
higher on the results list it can be
finally can be using recommender system
we are very good at recommending content
to each other after a very short kind of
period of time that we know each other
you're you could probably very nicely
predict what kind of books for instance
or movies i would like to watch or see
and you could suggest them to me if you
could teach machine to do the same then
of course the success of the machines in
recommending content would be much
larger and finally it could be using
research where we were because by
understanding minds of the users of the
machines we can kind of use those minds
to describe them better and kind of try
to improve their experience with the
systems but also risks involved so as
you kind of may remember from this movie
oops what happened we are hitting the
uncanny valley problem that it is
possible that if we give understanding
of human minds to machines then people
would kind of treat those machines with
huge suspicion they basically would not
like to use the machines that kind of
seemed to humane for them also you have
PR issues journalists policymakers might
be afraid of the machines that's kind of
attempt to understand human minds and it
could be for good reasons because if you
give someone power to understand your
mind you also kind of give him a power
to control and manipulate you in a very
well sometimes for good reasons like
let's say in in health care you can
imagine manipulating people into
stopping smoking but this
manipulations those manipulations could
also go in the in the wrong direction
and I am I made a mini experiment where
I wanted to check where we are at the
moment and I and I've chosen a very
popular search engine assuming that this
is an example of the machine that if any
machine if if machines do kind of
understand human minds search engines
that are kind of interacting with humans
a lot should be bested it and I searched
for Jaguar and as you can see the
results of mix the machine completely
failed to understand that I'm a male and
I'm probably not very much interested in
cats I would rather see more about cars
so I thought hey I will expose my mind
to this machine and I searched and
navigated to few websites that are very
characteristic for conventional
emotionally stable single and all their
males a perfect target for the jack cars
I navigated to kind of I searched for
those for those queries and I kind of
navigated to those websites wait at a
moment and try to search for Jaguar
again and as you can see the results
were exactly the same machine
consistently ignored the fact that I
kind of exposed my mind I kind of gave
each human being here in the room would
understand after seeing that I'm
interested in those issues would
understand that I don't want to see the
cat I probably am probably looking for
the car for the car one of the greatest
machines ever designed which is this
search engine completely failed to grasp
this idea so we come to a question how
is it maybe it's kind of impossible to
cheat machines about human minds who
kind of allow them to understand though
this concept so too to verify to verify
that to check what it's possible I I
designed a little experiment where I
first characterized minds of the group
of individuals using traditional tools
personality questionnaires IQ
questioners satisfaction with life tools
measures and then I collected some
observational data of those individuals
behavior
s could be seen from the perspective of
the machine for instance your web
browser finally I use this observational
data to develop an artificial theory of
mind to kind of look for patterns and
tendencies in the behavior observed here
to develop an item approach and finally
I checked weather machine theory of mind
kind of has any relationship with the
human traditionally described minds that
I kind of collected at the stage one so
as I mentioned before I use big five IQ
and satisfaction with life questionnaire
and applied to applied it to two hundred
thousand individuals from us and then I
to report to kind of gather the
behavioral information their actions to
kind of observe them from the
perspective of the machines I use the
records of the behaviors and connections
and content they shared visit website
listen songs watched movies basically I
recorded a connections within facebook
open graph and this is of course only
one of the possible sources of the
observational information about human
beings from the perspective of the
machine you can imagine that the same
kind of data you can see probably comes
from searches browsing logs tweets
shopping credit cards records but also
mobile says sensor is to kind of your
mobile phone that is always with you and
it gets enormous amount of information
about your kind of walking patterns when
do you sleep what time do you wake up
kind of what are you messaging about and
so on so kind of machines have enormous
amounts of information about our
behavior and I used Facebook simply
because it was kind of easily accessible
to me I could I could get records of
hundreds of thousands of individuals
easily and quickly and then as you can
see I constructed a matrix where I put
those 200,000 users here and hundreds of
thousands of possible behaviors
as columns and I basically looked for
associations and as you can see even
here this example there are some
patterns in this matrix and of course
you can analyze those patterns you can
bet get better idea about how those
patterns work by reducing dimensionality
of it of this matrix using Esper's SVD
your Spurs principal component another
ways and then this graph shows how much
kind of this kind of shows that the
behavior is the kind of observational
data is not random that by extracting
few dimensions you can describe quite a
lot of the variance in the data it means
that it's not that our kind of actions
connections behaviors are random they
kind of they create nice patterns and
finally I looked at the relationship
between those item dimensions artificial
theory of mind dimensions developed
using a principal component analysis and
human minds described in a traditional
way and as you can see here there is a
quite a quite quite significant and
quite strong relationship between
traditionally described minds and kind
of the artificial system that I
developed how it worked I basically
build a regression model that was
predicting personality dimensions from
artificial theory of mind dimensions and
accuracy here is expressed by Pearson's
correlation coefficient just to put this
in context I will show you the accuracy
of the traditional methods so the green
bar here shows you the accuracy of the
personality questionnaire so kind of
this is the correlation of one
personality questionnaire with the other
that can be kind of explained as the
correlation between what the tool is
measuring an actual personality and as
you can see here on one of the trades on
the trader on the trade of openness
machine can actually predict this trade
as well as
psychologists can after thousands of
years of a kind of developing
personality theories in creating
personality questionnaires on the other
dimensions I'm not kind of machines are
not so successful but actually I would
not be so much concerned with that and I
will talk about it in a second well you
can never because this is kind of a
latent trait we cannot directly observe
let's say extraversion of or openness
this is kind of a it's just we believe
that the concept like extroversion
exists but we do not have a measure that
can perfectly accurately measure
extraversion actually it applies to all
the things that you would like to
measure if you want to measure length of
something will never and of ever well as
far as I know you cannot really kind of
measure it without any error of
measurement and when it comes to
psychological concepts the error of
measurement is usually pretty big so the
correlation between between what I'm
measuring using personality
questionnaire an actual trade is in this
case in the case of conscientiousness
for instances is point 7 so you cannot
well I measured it using personality
questionnaire but personality
questionnaire has only certain accuracy
and accuracy of this passion of this
questionnaire in this case is point 7
and accuracy okay so there's a concept
of reliability in in psychometrics and
basically because we can never measure
actual extraversion what we do we
measure we take let's say 100 people we
measure the extraversion ones and then
we measure the extraversion again using
the same tool for instance after some
time and then we try to because the the
theory says that extraversion should be
stable what you can do you can correlate
those two measurements and if the
measurement is perfect if there is no
error of measurement the correlation
with perfect will be one but the less
accuracy there is in the measurement the
lower the correlation would be between
two measures right and this is how we
of expressed accuracy of the of the tool
in psychometrics we express it as a
correlation between man measurement and
the other way this is one of the ways
one of this simple approach just what is
the point is a yes so the green bars
here show the correlation of the
extraversion questionnaire with itself
so kind of if I if I attempt to measure
acceleration 2 times the correlation
between the measurements on average in
the population is point 7 of course you
can use more advanced approaches here by
kind of still kind of most
questionnaires would have their accuracy
reported in this way these days and then
I can measure your I can measure your
extraversion also using my artificial
approach using kind of observation of
your of your of your behavior in actions
in the online environment and then I can
also correlate it with the with this
score on the on the questionnaire and
you may have noted here that I'm
correlating the my estimation of your
extraversion with another estimation of
your acceleration which actually is also
inaccurate so kind of the because I'm
not correlating it with the real with
the real level of extraversion because
it's unmeasurable I cannot measure kind
of it directly I have to correct this
correlation for attenuation and there's
a method in psychometrics called
correction for attenuation it basically
says that if I have two concepts
measured with certain degree of error
and I want to correlate those two
concepts I can later correct the
correlation coefficient for the fact
that there were errors in estimations of
both of them and in and in this and in
this example I'm correcting I'm
correcting in basically for attenuation
so it is it's a very simple method but I
would probably not like to go into it at
this stage
he accepted number or is it just for
your data set so this point 68 was it
was kind of it was calculating using my
data set so I calculated the accuracy of
the extraversion questionnaire for my
specific data set but this is actually
higher than reported in the manual of
the test so when they were developing
the test the accuracy of the scale was
lower so accuracy of the personality
questionnaires would range between point
five and point seven for the longer
question s and of course the more
questions you ask about someone's
personality the more accurate presumably
the prediction should be so sometimes
you can see personality traits they
would have accuracy of point eight for
instance yes many of my users because
actually I was sampling it these two
hundred thousands comes from the sample
of seven million users and among those
seven million users plenty of users took
the questionnaire more than once but I
also actually techniques that allow you
to estimate accuracy of the questioner
when we administer it once for instance
you can split the scale randomly into to
help and then correlate those two halves
and it's like basic comparing
correlating two different versions of
the same question
so basically I show you that to kind of
come back to to the main point on this
slide is that those artificial
dimensions that you can extract that
machines can automatically extract from
observing human beings are related and
in some cases are very highly related to
your personality but also to your IQ and
somewhat not so much to your
satisfaction with life to your to your
mood and of course those estimate
estimates of accuracy were developed
using cross-validation so it's not kind
of there's no bias here I
cross-validated the measurement I
predicted I use 10 well I probably don't
have to explain them a 10-fold
cross-validation here but then you can
also predict some some classes so for
instance I wanted to to check whether
the machine is able to predict political
views and religious views of those
individuals and I used some proxies here
as you can see for political views for
instance liking Sarah Palin or liking
Obama and kind of predicted it check
whether my machine is able to do to
predict whether given individual would
would be a fan of Obama or rather fan of
Sarah Palin I did the same with religion
here you can see that I attempted to
predict who the people associate
themselves with Jesus and accuracy of
the prediction here is expressed as the
area under curve which again can be can
be expressed on this example that when
you take a person that likes Obama and
the person that doesn't like Obama
randomly from the sample this would be a
chance that your classifier would
classify them correctly and as you can
see of course point 5 is no prediction
at all because it's kind of just random
if you have one person likes Obama and
one that doesn't the machine is right in
fifty percent of cases it means there is
no
curacy whatsoever but as you can see
machine is quite successful at
predicting political views and religious
views of the individuals and actually
because one of the problems here in the
data set was that very small fraction of
individuals actually associated
themselves with Obama or Palin or Jesus
or or any other object so kind of to
make it easier for the machine I made a
little experiment here and I kind of
selected only a group on a group of
people where they either liked Obama or
Pauline and the other group of people
when they either like Jesus for Allah so
I kind of removed kind of this whole
trade zone where kind of people were not
associated with neither of the objects
and as you can see here especially when
it comes to religion the prediction of
the machine is close to perfect it's
like point a point 99 in ninety-nine
percent of cases the machine and made
the correct decision and then I will
show you a practical a kind of how it
can be used in practice and actually we
can we'll try to compare the accuracy of
your theories of mind and the end
accuracy of the machines theory of mind
so we have this real individual here
that's watched Pulp Fiction visited
Richard Dawkins dotnet sure if a blog
content listen to Led Zeppelin pink
floyd songs and studied psychology and
it's not me so I know kind of the
personality IQ and so on of this
individual because he participated in my
test so kind of I can estimated with
with with high accuracy and then I also
asked machine to make the predictions
for this individual and then what do you
think what are these guys rather liberal
or conservative and the Machine thought
the same organized or spontaneous well
organized well organized and actually
he's well organized so those of you who
thought that he spontaneous actually
were worse at kind of predicting and
this guy's mind and then machine
introverted versus extroverted well done
a team member and the trusting person
versus competitive one well then Richard
Dawkins is actually a very competitive
object to connect with and light back
and relaxed or easily stressed and
emotional well actually in case of this
individual he scored exactly in the
middle and machine was not able to kind
of made a prediction but it was a
prediction with a huge error so you can
say that actually machine kind of
couldn't really estimated but the guy
was really in the middle here IQ hi
gender obviously so as you can see here
both human theory of mind human-based
your mind and machine theory of mine
we're able to accurately predict who
this individual is but machine could
also take those dimensions here and try
to recommend some make some
recommendations for the individual so I
guess that if if I asked you to suggest
a book or a movie or a song or a
restaurant for this guy you would
probably be quite kind of you'll find
this task quite easy now because just by
looking in those few connections few
facts about him or hear him you already
kind of know a lot and machine because
we kind of gave we kind of tried to give
machine a theory of mine here can do the
same and those are the recommendations
that based on the artificial theory of
mind made by the Machine and I'm not
sure what you think about it but I do
think that kind of it really matches
and the profile of this individual how
accurate is that here in this example I
don't really know but please mind that
what we are showing here is simply
making recommendations for the
individual so I'm kind of recommending
Jesus for the individual and I'm
checking how accurate i was in
recommending Jesus so kind of you can
see that actually the accuracy of those
predictions of those recommendations are
quite high because I'm slowly running
out of time I will click quickly go
through the limitations of my approach
so of course I am sure you could help me
finding more limitations the limitations
i think are more crucial here are that I
in this research I was looking only at
permanent traits I was not looking at
someone's mood which is a great modifier
if we observe someone behaviors if we
kind of have an individual current mood
current state someone might be stressed
in a very bad mood or extraordinarily
happy and it kind of will Blair our
vision of who this person really ease on
average not to mention kind of
predicting what is the state of the
individual in this kind of moment is
also very important when it comes to
understanding him or her and making
predictions when it comes to products
content advertising and so on I used
only facebook data and while I believe
that the data collected in other sources
is pretty similar to what you can
collect on facebook it will be worth to
kind of look at it and also well as I
mentioned before I do not think that
mapping on the traditional dimensions is
really kind of where I should stop this
research because if we know how the
traditional dimensions would were kind
of developed scientific ones and they
were developed by the analysis for
instance of the language x factor or not
and a factor analysis of adjectives that
we use to describe people they were also
very limited in terms of available data
here we are having an enormous amount of
data about the behavior of the
individuals that we can well analyze
with the help of machines and maybe come
out with a new
structure of personality new structure
of skills and abilities of the
individuals that could be more accurate
in describing the variance in the
behavior goals and attitudes of the
people and to just give you a little
insight into what I'm doing currently
i'm currently trying to understand that
item dimensions adam dimensions
themselves so do not map them and
personality anymore though here you can
actually see two dimensions dimension 3
I don't have a good name for it yet and
I mentioned to but you can also can you
can also see a personality of those
individuals kind of here and you can see
that people who are liberal kind of
scoring high on dimension 3 and kind of
a clustered in this area of the
scatterplot so you can nicely see that
there is a relationship between item
dimensions and openness but maybe we
should kind of really forget about
openness and try to understand what
those dimensions stand for and and how
they can be used in accurately described
behavior of people and I'll give you an
example of dimension 1 and some top and
bottom connections characteristic for
people who either score highly or lowly
on this quazy personality i mentioned
created by the machine and kind of you
can see that guys on the top like family
guy music youtube where's guys at the
bottom we're interested rather in in the
dark night Wendy's Burger King and so on
and well I do have troubles now
interpreting this structure some of the
dimensions i will show you let's say
let's say this one is is much easier to
interpret so this is dimension 3 you can
see that people that are scoring high
kind of interested in those
sophisticated cultural artifacts whereas
though lo are kind of much more
conservative visibly conservative also
when you look at the relationship with
at the relationship with this dimension
and kind of traditional ways of
describing human minds those guys are
happier whereas those are much more
liberal which also kind of makes a lot
of sense and i think i would stop here
and i'm waiting for your questions and
comments well i will try to actually i
was looking to looking for a forever for
appropriate option I even created an
account in the email system associated
with this engine and and logged in with
this account to make sure that the
engine really knows who I am and use the
same computer all the time but I
couldn't kind of make this engine to
change its behavior but I will if you
could show me later I would be very glad
to see how it works you know your use of
that example confirms my theory that
most searches on the single word jaguar
by search researchers and in fact I
would argue that the search engine did
exactly what you wanted to do to
demonstrate that it didn't respond which
is what you wanted it to do personally
this is this is a very good point I take
it I take it I should in your in your
very potted history of scientific
approaches to the mind you stepped over
entirely anything to do with
psychotherapy Freud and it's anything
fried and post fry I sort of i sort of
correlate that with your response to
john's question about language yo yo yo
you're very happy with using language of
the search engine level or but which is
which is a very low level of language
use but but it seems like you're not
you're not prepared to go into
the complexities of cognition
represented by more sophisticated use of
language but I don't Vigo comment on it
I must admit that I completely agree
with that so I I did spend quite a lot
of time trying to explore the
possibilities of using language in kind
of trying to predict humans personality
IQ and so on and there are quite a few
studies that also kind of approach that
one of the kind of those are most known
or Facebook gross national happiness
index that kind of analyze the status
updates and try to figure out what is
the happiness of the people that kind of
post them but while I do believe that
there's a lot and I do believe that we
humans we can use human language to
understand the others it's I do believe
it it's also much too early for the
machines at the moment to do it and I do
also believe that many much easier
sources of the information about the
individuals are completely ignored at
the moment for instance kind of music
you listen to is completely ignored in
trying to describe who you are and
understand who you are so kind of
language which is much more difficult I
believe should come second here you're
looking at this like new quasi
dimensionalities um how do you find them
and like how like how how do you know
how many of them are there that's a very
good question and the same it's actually
the same question
and the same question was posed to all
the personality researchers in the past
so actually even those three or four
systems I mentioned here they all relied
on different numbers of dimensions and
different actually also ways of
extracting those dimensions so some
people would use pc ADRA the other
researchers use maximum likelihood they
were rotating or not rotating dimensions
when they were rotating them they were
using the different rotational approach
and this is actually this is a big
problem I don't I don't have a solution
to it that's something that I'm playing
with now researching now trying to find
an optimal number of dimensions and also
kind of optimal way of extracting kind
of turning those dimensions into
something that will be understandable
for humans I do think that this is not
such a big problem from the kind of
machine point of view because machine
for instance doesn't really care whether
it uses 56 or 150 dimensions as long as
they kind of are useful in predictions
the same about rotation whether we kind
of represent data in this way or the
other for the machine from the kind of
prediction point of view it doesn't make
much difference I do think that this is
rather important for us so we can
understand what actually makes machines
to understand human minds it's why I try
to kind of find some kind of
interpretable representation of the data
that machines are using to predict your
personality for instance your analysis
and the future Juventus still focus on
the individual and their trades but you
have all this this facebook data did you
look into exploring whether I could be
friends with somebody on facebook just
by so trying to predict whether we would
be compatible or like the interpersonal
element you have all this rich data
about a person but yes I did look at it
myself trying to look for instance that
the homogeneity similarity between
personalities between friends and there
are some and weak results here I also
have some students who work on it if you
guys are interested into taking it
further the data i was using herein is
too large extent publicly available
anyone can use this data
we just need to register with the
psychometric Center and you're getting
access to it so definitely those
questions could be could be answered
it's just that there are so many
different exciting questions it could be
answered that you can all I cannot
handle them all by myself all right I
think we can wrap out at this point
let's think and you can again for a very
interesting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
