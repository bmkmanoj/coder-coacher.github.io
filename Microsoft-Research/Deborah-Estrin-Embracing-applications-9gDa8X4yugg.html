give the advice because it depends what
they want to do with their lives to me
it's about embracing applications these
days and deciding on some things that
you really care about and building the
skill set then to solve those problems I
think my biggest mistake was when I
moved from networking to distributed
sensing I took the assumptions of
application being application agnostic
and being most abstract from the world
of networking where we sort of were
agnostic to the to the application and I
took that into distributed sensing and
really as our God involved in the field
of distributed sensing the applications
mattered tremendously and what you were
doing with the data mattered
tremendously and there was really no
such thing as a general purpose sensor
and so it took some hard reality of that
to realize that it was really about
working very much with the applications
and generalizing from the specifics not
trying to always start out generally</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
