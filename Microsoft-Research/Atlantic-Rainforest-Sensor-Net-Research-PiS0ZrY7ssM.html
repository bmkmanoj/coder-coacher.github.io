potential terms of natural resources
in terms of renewable energies so all
these potentials up for exploration and
the exploration really starts with
Sciences it is very important for
mankind to understand the environment so
that we can leave in a situation in
which life and development are
sustainable and if you want to have
sustainability you have to understand
how the environment works how things are
connected so that you don't create
situations in which you are going to
make permanent damage to the environment
most countries in the world have already
destroyed all the native forests they
had Brazil did not initial concept of
these experiments how can we monitor a
large area forest that would provide us
with a three-dimensional view of the
tropical forests of the Amazon
functioning water from the outset of
this project we believed firmly that it
should be done through international
collaboration so we bring the best of
all the groups involved John Hopkins
with experiencing already deploying
inexpensive sensor networks in the
tropical forest our expertise in running
these experiments for 20 years in the
Amazon and of course Microsoft Research
providing the means and the software
development it's extremely enjoyable to
be able to take a new technology that
we're adopting from our collaborators at
Johns Hopkins University and bring that
down to other researchers who are
operating in Brazil through the process
of that adaptation create a new
scientific data set and created a whole
new methodology which can be applied
again and again to other research
projects
we imply two types of sensors a
thermometer which measures temperature
and a hygrometer which measures water
vapor concentration in a third one solar
incoming radiation sensor or a
radiometer we design it a network of
towers over a hill slope in the rain
forest and attempt to measure that every
minute so there's one central tower and
around that are five others total and
then radiating out between the central
one and all those towers are cables and
then between the perimeter towers or
cables so that's the arrangement and
what we did is we took our sensor
network and we went out there and we
deployed that up into both on top of the
towers and along the cables so we
created a mesh above the forest canopy
in addition to that we also play sensors
on the towers below so inside the forest
canopy and then we made a transect of
about twelve of these sensor network
nodes that went up the hill along the
ground they're about a meter off the
ground challenge number one is just to
make the stuff survivable in the rain
forest once you've managed to solve the
problem of not letting the water get at
this stuff is to actually have the thing
operate for that period of time without
running out of batteries so that's
something Johns Hopkins team have been
working very hard on in the strategy
that they use is called duty cycling the
next thing you do is you make sure that
you have radio connectivity because the
radio link is how you get your data back
and then finally what you want to be
able to do is you want to have a robust
data recovery system and then you take
that laptop out and you connect it to
the internet and you push that data
through the internet up to Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore Maryland where
it gets ingested into a database and it
gets processed to where it can finally
be used for scientific analysis
we had a deployment time period of about
a month and we had total of about 200
sensors and they're taking data once
every 30 seconds and so that represents
a potential total data you and I would
have been delighted if we'd gotten up to
something like seventy percent of that
total data yield in the can but actually
what we I wanted a round of getting was
about ninety-eight percent so we did
extremely well against our goal if we
can successfully carry out this pilot
study experiment then we can go ahead
and scale up the experiment perhaps by
factor of 10 so we take not not 200 but
2,000 sensors we take him into a larger
area maybe it's instead of on the
Atlantic coast the rain forest there we
go into Amazonia and do work there so
there's all kinds of expansion
possibilities so always have been very
concerned how science can help to
achieve sustainable development in the
Amazon climate change is a real thing
and it's not just the increase in
temperature but also the implications
for variability and whether well if
we're going to understand that and how
that couples to how we use our resource
then you need to understand the system
better it's a really complicated system
the general proposition is we're taking
steps to better understand a very
complicated system so that we understand
the implications of our choices
