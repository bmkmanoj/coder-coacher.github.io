collaboration between the two major
Swiss technical universities EPFL which
is where I am in the French speaking
part of switzerland and eth which is in
the german speaking part of switzerland
and microsoft research of course and it
builds on a earlier collaboration
between the three organizations which
was based around embedded systems
research which was part of what all
three of these organizations do the new
research center is much brighter it
encompasses computer science in general
which is appropriate considering both
universities and Microsoft Research have
broad research programs that cover many
many different areas of the field and
computer science for a strong department
in particular department in computer
science it's really crucial to have
industry collaboration but does not mean
that every research is pursued together
with industry but clearly computer
science ranges all the way from
fundamental research to really applied
research and it's on that letter site
where you need really the interaction
with industry just to stay up-to-date of
what is really relevant and I think this
kind of interaction is mutually
beneficial and stimulating scalar
numerous one of the projects from EPFL
there's a large research effort called
echo cloud in EP FLT to look at data
centers and data center efficiency and
scalability data centers today consumed
already a non-trivial fraction of the
world energy production particular
electricity production and that
proportion is growing with time so it's
important to find ways in which we can
increase the capabilities of data
centers over time and at the same time
reduce the amount of energy and bacon
soon the key challenge then is how do
you access that memory efficiently we
have a strong collaboration with my
research that is because the researchers
at Microsoft are very focused on solving
big data analytics problems and what
these researchers have identified is the
need to have ideally ultra-low latency
access to remote memory on a relatively
large scale and that was one of the
prime motivations for our projects which
is how do we deliver that ultra-low
latency to applications in a way that is
efficient and particularly from an
energy perspective yeah one project that
the gut funded is called human centric
flight project what's exciting about
this project is that it combines
cutting-edge technology on micro aerial
vehicles with human-computer interaction
and this has the potential to lead to a
lot of interesting new applications
there's a rapid advancements in consumer
electronics actually make these flying
robots feasible make them realistic
today we can directly take these these
advancements transfer them into the
robotics context and have machines that
can not only navigate and move around
the world but they also have perceptual
powers we're really trying to create a
smart personal assistant that can fly
that can move in 3d space that can kind
of explore the world with you create a
novel user experiences anywhere on the
go in mobile scenarios one of the
biggest technical challenges is on the
hardware side we have a device that
needs to be low power and it needs to be
lightweight so it can fly and so if we
instrument it with any type of
computational capabilities or sensing
capabilities both these things have to
be power efficient and also lightweight
and so one of the things we're exploring
is trying to take some of the depth
sensing technologies that we've
developed such as the Kinect and the
Xbox one camera and try and make those
smaller miniature so that they could be
embedded onto onto these flying vehicles
what motivates us in research is to
study fundamental problems with the hope
that the solution can have a large
impact on the industry and on society
the Swiss joint research center is a
great tool for collaboration first and
foremost allows us to deepen existing
and new relationships and allows us to
do work that goes across boundaries we
have this opportunity now to to work
closely together and we kind of bring
complementary skills to the to the mix
they are very good people involved so
everything is possible from at least
good or very good results which I would
expect from any one of these projects up
to a real breakthrough I think
everything is possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
