the goal of the inferred on that project
is to allow a machine learning
applications to be created in hours
instead of weeks this is extremely
challenging because the framework needs
to be flexible enough to cope with the
huge variety of real world problems and
fast enough to cope with today's
internet scale datasets the flexibility
in in Fernet comes from a rich modeling
language that allows complex customized
models to be designed and quickly tested
continuous and discrete variables are
supported and these can be combined
using factors including arithmetic
operations linear algebra range and
positivity constraints boolean operators
and many others in Fernet has been
designed from the ground up to be
scalable to large models and large
datasets it effectively acts as a
compiler that converts a model
description directly into source code
for performing inference with no
overhead costs in Fernet has already
been applied to datasets with hundreds
of millions of data points to achieve
accurate inference in different models
inferred net provides multiple
algorithms so the most appropriate one
for the task can be used the
message-passing architecture allows you
to use standard tools to step through
the inference procedure and examine
individual messages making it easy to
identify and fix inference problems
in Fernet has already been used for
projects in social networking in
healthcare in computational biology in
web search and in machine vision in all
these cases complex models have been
created and solved using just a handful
of lines of code in Fernet can be used
from any net language including c-sharp
C++ Visual Basic and ironpython

year Microsoft Research hosts hundreds
of influential speakers from around the
world including leading scientists
renowned experts in technology book
authors and leading academics and makes
videos of these lectures freely
