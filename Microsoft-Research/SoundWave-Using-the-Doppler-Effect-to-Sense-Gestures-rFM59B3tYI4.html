popular means of interacting with
computers however it is still relatively
costly to deploy robust gesture
recognition sensors in existing mobile
platforms Soundwave is a real-time
sensing technique that leverages a
speaker and a microphone to robustly
sends energy sure's and motion around a
device it is capable of detecting a
variety of gestures and can directly
control existing applications without
requiring the user to wear any special
sensors on their body to sense motion
this technique uses the Doppler effect
which describes the change in frequency
as a result of relative motion between
the sound source and an observer
Soundwave uses existing speakers on a
device to produce inaudible tones or
frequency between 18 to 22 kilohertz our
system then uses the microphone on the
same device to pick up the frequency
shifted signal to recognize the gesture
here we see the tone produced by
Soundwave and the shift in frequency
around it as a user moves his hand
closer and farther from the PC as the
hand moves faster the change in
frequency is also greater
variety of gestures can be realized by
mentioning characteristics of the sent
signals such as speed amplitude
direction and time variation by
combining direction of the motion and
it's variation over time the user in
this example can change the direction of
scroll by performing a double tap
gesture
using the number of motion events
generated by Soundwave walking towards
or away from the laptop can be uniquely
detected in this example it is used to
lock a users computer screen as he walks
away Soundwave is robust to audible
sounds for example music can be playing
on the same device as Soundwave is
running on without affecting its sensing
capabilities this example application
also demonstrates the use of two hand
gesture here we see a user playing a
game of tetris by performing different
gestures slow tapping gestures are used
to move blocks left while faster taps
towards the right
two-handed gestures are used to flip and
pulling the handbag in a quick stroke
drops the block this example
demonstrates the accurate and quick
control that Soundwave is capable of
to establish the robustness and
reliability of Soundwave we tested it in
a busy and noisy environment
