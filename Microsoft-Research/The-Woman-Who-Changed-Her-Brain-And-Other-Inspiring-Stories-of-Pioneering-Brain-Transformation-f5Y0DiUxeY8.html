hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
welcome everyone
it gives me tremendous pleasure to
welcome Barbara Aerosmith young to
Microsoft it's really a real great
pleasure for me personally to have you
come and speak to a Microsoft audience
this is something that I know that I've
been thinking about for a long time and
thanks to photos other folks who are
very familiar with your work that we
were able to make this happen so we're
really looking forward to it though I
just wanted to say very few words and
then leave most of the time for Barbara
to have a chance to speak and then also
I think we'll have ample time for Q&amp;amp;A I
think it was in 2008 that I read the
Norman Doidge this book the brain that
changes itself and I came across
Barbara's work this is in the summer of
2008 and in the fall of 2008 we were
enrolled with our youngest daughter in
Vancouver and the Eton Aerosmith program
and ever since then both Barbara's life
story as well as her life's work have
been a real inspiration for us as a
family I think that as you'll hear in
the talk today and as you will read in
the book what she's been able to do is
actually it's tremendous in the sense of
being able to take adversity and turn it
into a program that now I can take and
have such broad impact with anybody with
learning disabilities I think it's just
an amazing feat and it's the thing that
I think inspires me beyond the field of
LD when I think about Microsoft I would
say the one thing that I know there are
a lot of parents here and for anyone who
has learning disabilities or anyone
who's a parent obviously this work that
Barbara has done her vision of how to
make that much more ubiquitous is a
personal relevance and that I think is a
maze
anything the other thing that I would
also say is from a Microsoft perspective
for us to reflect on if you look at the
genesis of this company it has all been
about democratizing technology and
improving and empowering lives the idea
of being able to take the technology
that we have and then marry it with the
neuroscience and education has I think
tremendous implications in terms of how
you can have societal impact the other
side of it is if you look at in fact
Microsoft Research is perhaps doing some
of the leading work around AI and the
frontiers of AI and and you look at the
new theories of even AI because the AI
started out thinking that let's ignore
the brain and now I think we're coming a
full circle to say let's in fact think
about the anatomy of the brain and the
neocortex perhaps even as an inspiration
or a constraint of how you build
intelligent systems and I think Jeff
Hawkins and his work there as perhaps
being you know the most inspiring work
in that field and I think it has
implications and how we even think about
building intelligent systems and then
you marry it with this concept of racing
with the machine because when we think
about building software and you really
want to build it in such a way that it
really gets augmented by the machine
then I would say that Barbara's work has
perhaps implications far beyond you know
the specific place where it's being
deployed today and I think that's one of
the other things that I would sort of
encourage those of you who have come in
here and think about this more from a
computer science or a neuroscience and
data one of the things that Barbara will
allude to is that this is not just one
curriculum but it's a curriculum that's
learning and I think there's a lot that
many both on the research side on the
product side at Microsoft that we can
both learn and then perhaps contribute
back because Barbara's vision is not
just about having a program in a few
schools but it's about being able to
make it accessible to every student and
every teacher and change the face of
Education as it really meets the
frontiers of neuroscience and perhaps
computer science so with that let me
turn it over
thank you thank you
the mics on okay so I want to thank you
statue for that lovely introduction and
Eric for making this possible and and
Amy also for making this this possible
and allowing me to come and speak about
what I'm passionate about and I try to
you know compress my talk but it's
probably somewhere in the order of about
an hour and then I'm open for questions
and answers and I hope you enjoy the
journey is I kind of take you into the
territory of the brain and my my story
is a journey into the territory of the
brain and really what happens when their
cognitive glitches or things that aren't
working properly and and if we think
about this incredibly complex organ that
we really can't escape and we carry it
with us everywhere we go it has
something on the order of 86 billion
neurons and if we think about the
world's population at about seven to
eight billion it kind of puts it into
perspective in terms of the complexity
and also we have hundreds of trillions
of connections in our brain and again if
we think about all the stars in the
Milky Way galaxy we actually have more
connections in our brain than all of the
stars in the Milky Way galaxy combined
and to me what's really fascinating is
no two brains are exactly alike I mean
if you think about the person sitting
next to you or think about a loved one
or a family member and you think about
the physical differences between you
I kept different eye color different
shape of your ears different
fingerprints there's actually more
differences between your two brains than
all those physical differences combined
so neuroscience has taught us that our
brain does shape us it makes us uniquely
who we are it really it filters our
perceptions and understanding of
ourselves of other people of our world
and our relationship to that world and
to me what's most promising is this
whole concept of neuroplasticity we now
know that the brain is capable of change
and that it's capable of change across
our lifespan I've worked with students
as young as six and as old as 81 and
I've seen neuroplasticity and as I'm
getting a little older I'm really
actually quite encouraged that there is
neuroplasticity as we as we age
and what that means is you know the
brain changes at a physiological level
more dendrites increased
neurotransmitters and that change leads
to more efficient and more effective
learning and my story begins with my
brain and it's really it's a personal
story and it's a universal story the
personal was my journey for a hunt for a
solution to very very severe and
crippling learning disabilities and the
universal is that we all have a brain
and if we can understand how it
functions I think we can have more
compassionate understanding of ourselves
and also of others so for me growing up
I lived in the world that was really
pretty incomprehensible there was part
of my brain I was later to learn that
wasn't working properly and it was the
part of the brain that attaches meaning
to things which allows you to comprehend
or understand and for me it was almost
like if I listen to language it was
about as intelligible as Lewis Carroll's
the Jabberwocky I could hear the words
but my brain struggled to attach meaning
to those words if something was really
concrete somebody that was raining
outside which I understand it does quite
often in Seattle I could conjure up an
image because that was concrete I could
paint a picture in my head so I can
understand that but as soon as it got
into a relationship I struggled with
that so if we think about numbers I
could understand what one is because I
can see one object I could understand
what four is because I could line up
four objects you put that one over top
of the four and it meant nothing to me
because that's a relationship and I
could not understand relationships I
couldn't understand how you know part
was related to a whole things as simple
as my aunt I really couldn't understand
how could she be my aunt and be my
mother's sister I mean how could
somebody have two relationships it
really made no sense to me
and my notebooks growing up were filled
with drawings were filled with diagrams
because I was trying to use my right
hemisphere to draw pictures to
understand what I couldn't understand in
language and something as simple as
telling time I couldn't read a clock
because to interpret time you have to
understand the relationship between the
hour hand and the minute hand to know
what
time was so up until age 25 age 26 I
could not read a clock things as simple
as jokes I didn't understand jokes
because how do you understand a joke
you hear the irony kind of the
juxtaposition of the language the things
that that make it humorous so like
individuals with learning problems I
learned compensations so what I would do
is I would match my laughter to the
laughter of the other children because
that would tell me how funny the joke
would be but I had no idea why it was
funny things like con artists I was
incredibly vulnerable to con artists
because how do you tell if you're being
conned you hear the logical
inconsistencies and what somebody's
saying well for me there was no logic in
my world so obviously there were no
logical inconsistencies so it meant that
you know that I had a lot of trouble
understanding if somebody was being
genuine and authentic or whether they
were telling me a story and making
decisions was really hard for me it was
paralyzing because how do you make a
decision you compare and contrast you
weigh alternatives I couldn't do that
because weighing alternatives you're
comparing one thing to the next you're
seeing a relationship or a connection in
my world there were no relationships
there were no connections
I got labeled as being rigid as being
stubborn and I was rigid and I was
stubborn and change was really hard for
me but it wasn't coming from an
emotional place it was coming from a
cognitive difficulty because I couldn't
hold those pieces of information to
understand so if I finally did figure
out something I wanted to hold on to
that for dear life because it always
felt that if somebody else said well
look at it over this way I had to let go
of what I'd come to figure out over here
which was hard one to allow this to
integrate and and it just felt too hard
for me and what happened over time was
that really fragmented view of my world
led to a very fragmented psyche a very
fragmented personality where my
self-esteem my self-concept was really
really impacted and if that wasn't
enough that was one area I had another
area of my brain that wasn't work
properly I was a klutz I was incredibly
uncoordinated the whole left side of my
body was like an alien being I could put
my left hand on a hot burner and I felt
pain but the part of my brain that
registered where that sensation was
coming from didn't work so somebody that
didn't have that problem would feel the
pain register it's in their hand pulled
her hand away I didn't I would leave my
hand on the hot burner unless I looked I
didn't know where the pain was coming
from and what I needed to do my mother
was convinced I would be dead by the age
of five because I was so accident-prone
I had bruises and cuts and and didn't
some that left side of my body and I had
no idea where they came from and I kept
my fingernails really short because if I
put my hair behind my eye with my left
hand I might scratch my eye out so I
truly was a danger to myself with that
difficulty and if that wasn't enough
there was another problem another part
of my brain that wasn't working I didn't
understand three-dimensional space so I
couldn't construct maps in my head and
it's a child I would get lost in my
friend's house because I couldn't
construct a map of how those rooms
related so I didn't know how to get from
one room to the next and and I would get
paralyzed and be lost
things like geometry and geography were
really hard for me because you have to
construct spatial relations and
something as simple as crossing a street
that we all take for granted that was
terrifying to me because when you're
crossing a street you have to create a
mental map of where you are relative to
that car that's coming at you well I
couldn't create that map so again like
children with learning problems did or
knew I created a compensation and that
would be walk blocks out of my way to
find a stop sign or a stop light where I
knew the cars had to stop so it would be
safe to cross or the other strategy was
I would wait at the side of the road for
however long it took until somebody else
came along to cross and I would follow
them across the street and I would hope
that they knew what they were doing a
lot better than I did and my joke was
that I would be successful crossing the
street with my eyes open as with my eyes
closed and there was truth to that and
if you can kind of think about what my
world was like I wasn't good
academically because I didn't under
and concepts I struggled in
relationships with people because I
didn't understand what they were saying
and I certainly was not an asset to any
sport esteem I mean I was the last child
ever chosen for any athletic activity
and rightfully so because my reaction
football was coming at me would be to
run as quickly as I could in the
opposite direction because more than
likely I would end up connecting somehow
with that ball and a very painful way so
there was really for me in school no
area no arena where I was successful and
when I began school it was a long time
ago in the 1950s this was the time of
what I call the pre neuroplastic
paradigm when I started great one the
belief was your brain is fixed basically
the brain you're you're born with it's a
brain you're gonna die with and there's
nothing you can do about it if you have
a problem you just need to learn to
accept or live with it and in grade one
I overheard my teacher tell my mother
that I had a mental block because at
that time there wasn't even the term
learning disability it didn't exist so I
had a mental block I was told that I
would never learn like other children
that I was slow and then I had to accept
that limitation and that was my message
the message was really clear in grade
one I was sentenced to a lifetime of
struggle and pain and there were a lot
of dark moments I mean this is me in
grade eight it was right around the time
that I've attempted suicide because I I
couldn't imagine how could I go to high
school elementary school was such a
struggle and I just felt like I could
not handle it the mixed blessing was
because my learning disability meant I
didn't understand things I got the
instructions wrong so I wasn't
successful in the attempt which allowed
me then to create this work so you know
there's kind of a mixed blessing to
things and I just I think partly I was
very blessed this is my father he was an
inventor and had patents and I grew up
in a family where the belief was if
there's a problem and there's no
solution don't be limited by the
conventional wisdom that there's no
solution for this problem he instilled
in me you go
and create your solution it's kind of a
moral imperative that you need to go out
and hunt for solutions so that set me on
my life's path to really try to find a
solution to the difficulties that I had
and that solution came in the work of a
brilliant Russian neuropsychologist the
fellow with the glasses in this picture
alexander Luria and he was doing a lot
of work after World War 2 in Russia with
Russian soldiers who had very localized
head wounds as a result of trauma in the
war and the other gentleman in this
pictures in the office is etske and in
the Battle of Smolensk in 1943 says
etske suffered a bullet wound to a part
of his left hemisphere and so cesky
started to keep a journal describing his
his difficulties and Luria took this
journal and wrote a book called the man
with the shattered world in an August of
1977 I remember the day really well
someone gave me a copy of this book
which changed my life and in this book
in Suzuki's journal he was using the
exact same language to describe his
difficulties that I was using in my
journal in the 1960s talking about
living in a fog where meaning was
ephemeral where it just kind of
disappeared into a mist that you
couldn't grasp things or hold onto
things and this was a man who was
brilliant mathematically before the
wound who could tell time before the
wound afterwards
he couldn't tell time he couldn't
understand fractions all the things that
I hadn't been able to do from birth he
couldn't do after the wound so I mean I
knew I didn't have a bullet in my head
but now I knew what the source of my
problem was it was part of my brain and
the left hemisphere the angular gyrus
that wasn't working properly and
obviously to create a solution to a
problem you have to first understand
what the source of the problem is so now
I knew what my problem was and if we
think about this area I like to get a
feel or sense of this area it's an area
that builds concepts or builds idea and
probably a lot of people in this room
are really good in this area so if you
think about your the palm of your hand
it's a concept or an idea or a construct
and you think about your fingers it's
all the elements that have to come
together in a synthesis to build that
concept or that constructor that idea
that's what this area does so if we take
a really simple concept a cat
which we're probably all familiar with
you know and we think it's nocturnal as
a carnivore it has good night vision fur
bearing retractable claws all those
elements have to come together to build
that idea that concept if you have a
problem in this part of the brain at the
level that I did or the levels as SK did
these pieces always remain disconnected
they never come together in a meaningful
way so you can never build concepts you
can never build ideas you can't grasp
ideas and that was was my challenge and
so what do I do about it now I know
where the problem is so the next piece
of the solution came in the work of Mark
Rosen schwag who is a psychologist at
the University at Berkeley in California
and he was where one of the very early
research is looking at neural plasticity
and he was working with rats because
they're often easier to work with than
humans and what he did is he put rats in
different environments so he'd put a rat
in cages or a cage with lots of other
rats and lots of toys to play with and
he called that an enriched environment
and then he put a group of rats in an
environment with other rats but less
stimulation and then he put that poor
little rat all by itself with not much
to do and what he did after they've been
exposed to these different environments
as he ran them on a maze test which is
like a little intelligence test for rats
and what he found was the group of rats
that were in that enriched environment
learnt much more effectively on the maze
much more efficiently and much more
effectively compared to the other two
groups and then because there were rats
he was able to look at their brains
afterwards and what he found was the
brains had changed physiologically this
was early early proof of neuroplasticity
and this research has more replicated
thousands and thousands of times now
what he found was there's more dendrites
if you think about the neurons the
dendrites are the branches that create
the synapses which allow for more
connections which is really important to
neural transmission they're actually
more neurotransmitters more glial cells
which are important for
neurotransmission enlarged capillaries
so more blood flowing to the different
brain areas so what it meant was that
the brains had changed as a result of
the stimulation which is neuroplasticity
and that change had led to better
learning
and then he did what I thought was a
really interesting experiment he put a
group of rats in a very tactile
environment and he blindfolded them so
they couldn't see so the only way they
could navigate through their environment
was through sense of touch and after
that experiment when he looked at their
brains he found that it was a very
specific part of the brain that had
changed that part that I had the
difficulty with that didn't register
sensation had changed and for me that
was my aha moment because it told me
differential stimulation leads to
differential effect so if I could find
an exercise or an activity that could
stimulate that specific part of my brain
possibly I could change it and at that
time nobody was really looking at human
neural plasticity but naively or
optimistically I had to believe that
humans had as much neuroplasticity as
rats and hopefully we had more
neuroplasticity than rats even though
nobody was suggesting that so I set out
to create the first exercise to
stimulate my cognitive functioning and
what did I pick I picked clocks because
all the research that Luria had done and
my experience and Suzette's keys
experience was if there's damage to this
area you cannot tell time and it wasn't
that I wanted to get better at telling
time which I did but I wanted to force
that part of my brain to process
relationships and that was away like a
window and I believed there multiple
windows into the different cognitive
functioning this was the window I found
into that part of the brain and so you
know I started that was pretty abysmal
at the beginning like I couldn't tell
time I was 26 I had to have a friend
help me and we'd write down the time
he'd turned the hands of the clock I
would try to read it but over time like
hundreds of hours of practice eventually
I could start to read those clocks and I
could read them accurately I could read
them really quickly and now it was great
I could read to 200 o'clock I could tell
time but I wasn't really experiencing
any cognitive change so I knew I had to
make it more complex so I added a third
hand and then did that whole level of
the exercise and now I could read an
hour minute and second hand on the clock
and that was great and then I added a
fourth hand and that's when for me I had
my breakthrough when I mastered the four
handed clocks which is
like processing for relationships
simultaneously and what happened was my
world just expanded I could do things
that were the best will in the world I
had never been able to do before I could
before I talked about how I lived in
what I called lag time I was hours
behind everybody else in processing
information or understanding concepts
and often I never could
I had a verbatim auditory memory so I
would listen to conversations and I
would memorize them and then I walk away
and for two hours afterwards I play
those conversations over and over and
over again trying to understand what you
know had been discussed and if I was
able to just understand what had been
discussed it was long after the
conversation and everybody else had left
so there was no opportunity to be part
of that conversation or that discussion
now I could actually listen as a
conversation was unfolding I could
understand I could participate I could
interject my thoughts I could understand
what they were responding and it was
incredible for me that I could actually
be part of that dialogue in that
conversation and before when I read
anything I would have to read a page in
a book five times ten times 15 times 20
times and what Laurie talked about if
you have this difficult and it was my
experience is she could never verify
meaning so as you're reading something
you're always hypothesizing I think this
is what it means but I'm never sure
which leads to a tremendous sense of
uncertainty in your world now I could
read and I could understand as I was
reading and then I decided to go back in
and teach myself all of mathematics my
father had been a mathematician and a
physicist and he'd always told me math
was beautiful all right it had this
majesty and poetry and tapestry and
logic and I'd say sure dad you know
whatever but I certainly didn't
experience it and now I can actually see
what he had been talking about because I
could understand math from first
principles and grasped the logic behind
it which I hadn't been able to before
and what really I found quite remarkable
which I had not had all I anticipated
happened was every night after I had
this changed when I went to bed wasn't
something I'd intended to do but images
would come up from my life from like age
4 up until 26
and I would start to understand why
things have happened in my life that
understand okay this happened because of
that because before there been no
cause-and-effect because to make a
relationship but understand cause in
fact you have to see the relationship
and now it was it felt like my psyche
got realigned because I could understand
why things happened where's before I
felt I was always kind of buffeted by
random events with no meaning behind
them and since then I've worked with a
number of psychiatrists in Toronto and
Norman Doidge is one of them who refers
some of his his clients to me because if
you have this problem you can't gain
insight you can't benefit from inside
therapy because what's inside you have
to make those kind of connections and
it's interesting these psychiatrists
know it's okay this student this
individual must be at this level of this
cognitive exercise because now they can
start to make insight and insight is is
really important for our functioning in
the world and I've also had some
students that come to me that are
misdiagnosed as having Asperger's and
they have severe problems in this area
so they can't attach meaning and their
world is incredibly confusing and it's a
misdiagnosis in those cases we address
this function they can relate their
world has meaning and just quickly to
get an idea of the complexity because
what I wanted to do with this area I saw
my change after the four hands level in
all of the exercises I've created I try
to bring that function if it's all
possible up to an average level and this
is what I call lovingly the ten handed
clock this is the highest level in this
reasoning so somebody to function you
know and and interpret this is reading
ten relationships simultaneously it goes
from all the way from the millennium
century decade down to millisecond and
you know someone who masters us can do
this in five seconds which is like a
mental workout and I know it was on to
something when I invented this level
because only two people have ever walked
through the door of my school and been
able to look at this and interpret it
and one was an astronomer from the
University of Maryland who was one of
the people that discovered radio meeting
galaxies and the other person was a
physicist from Harvard so I knew that I
was really onto something there probably
some people here I'm sure Microsoft that
could could interpret this but
the ideas is to really force the
cognitive function or process in that
that area so once I saw that change I
thought can I take or create an exercise
that will address that really
uncoordinated part of my body and it
really was a danger I'd fallen off the
wrong end of a diving board and
fractured a tooth
I had actually slammed a car door on my
head with this left hand and refracts
heard that tooth it was like this was an
alien part of my body and it would do
things if I wasn't watching it it would
actually do things that weren't in my
best interest and then by extension when
I learned how to drive if I didn't know
where the left side of my body was I
didn't know where the left side of that
car was so the left side of my car was
banged and dented and and damaged so I
thought to create an exercise here I
knew I had to do something with my eyes
closed because how did I compensate was
with my eyes opened so I created an
exercise where I had to draw really
complex shapes eventually with my left
hand until I could be as accurate with
my eyes closed
with my eyes open and the only way I
could do that was through registering
very very fine sensation and now I am
functional on that left side of my body
my car doesn't spend any time in the
auto body shop which is almost really
good and I'm not bruised and banged and
dented on that side of my body which is
is a relief and I can do things like
before I could not have picked up this
glass without it or if I had Sandra
probably would be wearing it there in
the audience because I wouldn't know
what my hand would would do with it
so I addressed that part and then I
thought okay can I do that
region of the brain that's related to
spatial navigation and and for me any
piece of paper that said some assembly
required struck fear into my heart
because you have to go from a
two-dimensional representation to
construct three-dimensional objects like
IKEA if anybody's ever built anything
from Ikea like for me the bookcases you
know the backs were upside down or
backwards and the shelves were upside
down if I sewed from a pattern
everything I had to rip seams out all
the time because I'd sew things upside
down there was there were no maps in my
and also whenever I would go anyplace
new I always calculated in what I call
lost time I would have to add an hour at
a minimum to any new location I was
going to because I knew I would get lost
multiple times before I finally found my
way because there were no maps in my
head you can tell something that has
made me mild problem in this area if
they're driving you know the map is here
and they have to turn the map in the
direction they're going that's kind of
an indication that may have a trouble
with that mental rotation for me it was
even worse there were no maps in my head
and some of these problems are
hereditary and interestingly my mother
had this difficulty and one of my four
brothers had this difficulty and my
mother did have a good attitude about
things so she would say whenever we get
into a car to go anywhere we were having
an adventure and we always knew where we
were starting and we knew where we
wanted to end up but it was truly a
black hole in between like there were no
maps in either of our heads and we
always got to where we were intending to
get to but we never got there the same
way twice so we saw a lot of interesting
territory and as I got older I once
asked her you know had this had an
impact on her life
and she shared with me that she had
wanted to be a chemist and she had gone
to her first-year University to study
chemistry and her professor had
suggested that she actually pick a
different major because she couldn't
construct molecules if you think about
those molecules right that you have to
construct in three dimensional
representation three dimensional space
she could not do this because there were
no Maps no ability to construct
three-dimensional space my brother that
has this problem at a lesser degree did
become a chemist because these things
work on a continuum nobody has them
exactly to the same degree but he
couldn't become an organic chemist
because he could construct the molecule
so it was too much effort so he became a
physical chemist so what I've learned is
no part of the brain is irrelevant or
unimportant if there's a difficulty in
any part it will have some impact on on
people's functioning so this began my
life's work so I went back into Laurie's
work and when I came to understand is
each one of us has our own unique
cognitive profile and for individuals
that are struggling with learning it's
when multiple
has come together to make the learning
process difficult and the work that I've
developed I can now identify and have
programs cognitive programs to stimulate
function in 19 different areas from you
know nonverbal reading of
interpretations and situations auditory
memory motor plans for writing visual
memory for symbol patterns and in order
to address a problem that somebody has
you need to understand its very nature
because you have to target that
difficulty to change it I mean that is
how the brain works
you know you need very targeted
stimulation and what's very interesting
the students that I work with and from
the parents that I work with and when
parents said to me very aptly school is
just a metaphor for life if you have
these kind of problems they aren't going
to stop at the classroom door they're
gonna follow the person out through life
and what Laurie talked about he
described the brain as a functional
system we now talk about neural networks
it's the same concept there is no one
part of the brain that reads or that
writes whenever we do any kind of
intellectual task multiple areas come
together to carry out that task and each
one of those areas has its own job its
own function and it can be involved in
multiple tasks so if you have a problem
it can affect a number of activities and
this is a blood flow study that just
illustrates this this came out of Sweden
and this is the brain reading out loud
so you can see there's no one area
that's involved in reading there areas
that remember the look at the word the
visual pattern of the letters there are
areas that discriminate speech sound
because you have to hear the sounds to
be able then attach the sounds to the
letters they're parts of the brain that
are critical in eye tracking in reading
they're parts of the brain the Broca's
that's involved in the phonological
aspect or processing all of these areas
have to come together for somebody to be
able to read easily and anybody that
works with children that are struggling
with reading knows you can have five
children that are having reading
difficulties and each one can have a
different profile depending on what
combination of these areas are impacted
and there are some students I see that
have all of these areas impacted and
those are the ones that walk through the
door and they might be in grade 10 and a
reading at grade to the
they have no part of the brain that can
support the reading process and
obviously to address any problem we have
to be targeting the specific area that
that individual has to give them a
strength in that area so that they can
go forward with reading and if we think
about special education processes or
approaches they all have benefit and
certainly growing up I used everything
that that was possible so they're what I
call compensatory processes or
approaches which is the child count
right you give them voice recognition
software which can be of great help so
the concept here is were working around
the deficit we're finding a strength or
technology to support the area of
difficulty but we're not changing there
if difficulty and then there's what I
call Content skill based approaches and
these are ones where you have to learn
how to read and their multiple reading
programs out there and what the best
will do is look at the cognitive profile
of the individual and if they're strong
phonological abut poor and the visual
recognition you pick a program like
Phonographic s-- to teach reading that
that that calls on their strengths and
then their strategy based approaches
which are of benefit where you are going
to learn a rule or a strategy like
metacognition that you can apply to
solve a problem and and you learn where
you use those strategies what kinds of
problems they solve but all of these
approaches come out of what I call the
pre neuroplastic paradigm they call all
come out of the idea that the learners
fixed we're not changing the learner
using these approaches we are accepting
the cognitive profile of that learner
and we're adapting the curriculum to
that profile and then their programs
that I call capacity based which my
program is theirs cogmed there's some
other programs that are being developed
and here the principle is we're actually
going to change the learner we're gonna
change the fundamental cognitive
capacity of the learner so they can
learn curriculum they can learn
strategies they can learn content and
these approaches and my approach come
out of neuroscience not out of education
and here we believe we can actually
change the functioning of the learner
and if we think about this concept of
neuroplasticity which we hear a lot
about often we think it's a positive
thing it really is a neutral phenomena
it just means that the brain is capable
of change as a result of experience or
stimulation it can change in negative
ways actually there's research now to
show that certain long-term exposure to
things like chronic stress sleep
deprivation like we're a society of
people that are sleep-deprived a chronic
pain prolonged anxiety actually changes
the brain at a physiological level in a
negative way and there are things that
can increase the positive aspects of
neuroplasticity make the brain function
more efficiently and effectively and
really what we want to do in our lives
and in our practice is working with
people are as much as possible to
increase those positive factors and
reduce the negative factors and the
principles of the program that I've
developed are really working to enhance
those positive factors related to
positive brain change so the first one
is I think as I've talked about is
designed a task that's very targeted to
the specific cognitive function to
stimulate it and the next piece is you
have to start the level of difficulty
help to calibrate the level of
difficulty of the task to the current
functioning that that individual is
holding at so we do that through an
assessment process so if the cognitive
functioning in area is here we're not
going to start the exercise up here
because the brain is going to spin
wheels it is not going to engage and
it's just going to be frustrating and
that's a lot of experience of these
children in school if we start away down
here again there'll be no stimulation no
effortful processing it is not going to
change the brain so we have to start the
level of difficulty just slightly above
the current holding capacity to
stimulate that function and then the
function comes up then we step up the
level of difficulty and we have to
remove the support of the other areas
that would normally compensate and that
is one of the hardest things I found
with for individuals with learning
difficulties because their compensations
have been life-saving I mean I know all
the compensations I developed allowed me
to function to a certain degree and here
we're saying we want to take those away
because as soon as the student
compensates in an activity it means
they're diverting energy to other parts
of the
brain which is limiting the stimulation
to the area that we're trying to target
and I've seen in so many different
creative ways that students compensate
there was that exercise I created for
the what I call the kinesthetic the
registering of sensation and had a
student as I was watching them I knew
they weren't doing it quite correctly
and I couldn't tell why so I asked her
what she was doing and she was a
musician and instead of registering the
sensation as her body was moving she'd
memorized musical phrases and she knew
exactly the length of the phrase that
told her when her muscles had to stop so
we worked with her to help her
understand why that wouldn't support her
changing her brain and eventually she
could drop out that compensation and she
did work on that that area and actually
went on to win some major badminton
championship because she could now
coordinate her her body in space and you
know hit the birdie with the racquet and
then we build in performance criteria in
every single exercise the student has to
be 90 percent or better because for
cognitive functioning to be holding in
an area it has to be really accurate or
it's not processing effectively at that
level it has to be consistent if the
student gets ninety percent once that's
wonderful but they have to do it over a
run of trials and they have to be
automatic if something is taking them an
hour and it should take five seconds we
have to get them down to the five
seconds and once they meet these
criteria then the level of difficulty
steps up and and and sometimes we have
students say you know after they've
mastered something they want to just
kind of go on cruise control and enjoy
that mastery but just to know as soon as
your brain is on cruise control
you're not stimulating function and it's
nice to be on cruise control but it's
not stimulating cognitive change and
sometimes you know people ask why do we
insist on this mastery criterion and
there are other cognitive programs out
there but for the brain to really change
in a meaningful way it needs to be
really solidly processing at that level
and if we stop our training before it
meets these criteria we haven't got that
cognitive function up the level that we
need it and I've tracked people over
thirty years out of the program and what
I see is there's no drop-off in function
once the cognitive area is solidly there
they just start to use their brain in
their everyday activity
neural network and it gets its own
stimulation so they don't have to
continue to do the exercises because
we've really got that section of the
brain up and functioning solidly at that
level so if you want to kind of try an
activity to see where you are on a
continuum of one of the cognitive
functions which part of the brain
I call it symbol recognition some
researchers call it the brain's
letterbox or visual word form area so if
you wanna think of the word cat it's
fairly simple word and you want to close
your eyes and see can you actually see
that word in your mind's eye or almost
like its projected up on the blackboard
and some people will be able to see it
really crisply and really clearly other
people it might be a fuzzy image the
children or individuals that have
problems here will just see the back of
their eyelids or just black they will
not see the letters and those are the
children that are going to be dyslexic
or struggle with reading so if we think
about this area if you're strong here
this is that visual photographic memory
for text it's a person could look at
something and just visually remember it
so they're going to learn reading
patterns spelling patterns if they
struggle here this is the child that
will read the same word or have to see
the same word five times on a page and
have trouble reading at each time
because they don't hold the look of the
word obviously they're going to be slow
in reading they're gonna struggle with
spelling any kind of visual even
learning visual like chemical equations
any kind of visual template learning
math formula is gonna be hard for them
to learn and what do we do for this area
this is one of the exercises is the M
Hart from Ethiopia and people ask why do
I use foreign languages well again I
don't want students to be able to
compensate I want to be stimulating that
visual part of the brain that holds
symbol patterns so if I use English they
could put sound to it they could put
meaning to it
there would be familiarity it wouldn't
be just stressing that part of the brain
and there are multiple different
languages that I've built into the
computer and by the time a child can
memorize and hold in their minds I eight
Chinese characters English actually is
pretty easy to learn the visual symbol
patterns it's not that I want to get
them proficient at Chinese but I want to
stimulate that cognitive function so
that part of the brain holds visual
symbol patterns and what changes as a
result of this we've got a lot of
research studies that are
the website if people are interested is
Aerosmith school org we know that
students with learning problems don't
learn a year for a year so this was a
group in the Toronto Catholic District
School Board in Toronto which is a
public fund publicly funded school board
and they were learning at two-thirds of
a year per year prior to the program
after the program were partly through
the program their rate of learning
doubled and tripled which to me is the
power of a cognitive program we're not
teaching skills we're not teaching
spelling we're not teaching reading we
are changing the brain so that it can
learn the things that it's designed to
learn and it can learn pick up the
learning everywhere through all of their
exposure experience and then the other
study was one done at E narrow Smith
School in Vancouver on the Woodcock
Johnson again showing the kinds of
things that you'd expect to change as a
result of that cognitive stimulation and
then this is the right hemisphere
function we just tried actually a left
hemisphere function with the word cat
this is can you imagine a cat like the
actual cat which we've probably all seen
and can you think about a cat close your
eyes and can actually see a cat can you
see it in all its glory with his ears
and its fur and its tail so just see
whether you can call up an image of a
cat and your mind's eye and then you can
see how well you did on that continuum I
mean some people who are exceptionally
strong here see they can't even see the
gradation and the shading and the cat's
fur other people kind of see a line
drawing or you know not too many visual
elements and some people don't see
anything and this area is a critical
area in the right hemisphere for memory
landmarks remembering the look of a
place that you've gone to before so if
somebody has a difficulty here they get
lost not because of the way I had the
problem with spatial maps but they don't
remember the landmarks they don't
remember the look of a place they also
will have trouble with visual imagery
somebody that has this difficulty will
not like to meditate because when you
meditate you call up your happy place
like you you conjure up a visual image
that calms you if somebody has this
difficulty they can't call up those
those visual images this is the area
that Oliver Sacks book the man that
mistook his wife for a hat it's talking
about
had someone who had traumatic head
injury he was hit by a truck when he was
11 and he came to anyways 33 and he had
massive damage to this area and the
first day he walked into my school he
tried to walk out a filing cabinet
because it looked like a door to him
like it had the same visual elements
like it was kind of rectangular and had
a handle if he saw me in the school he
knew who I was if two seconds later he
saw me in the hallway he didn't know who
I was because he couldn't hold the
visual look to match it up to me I often
call this the refrigerator dysfunction
because this is the person and I think
there's some research to say that men
have a little bit more of a difficulty
here than women that the person opens
the refrigerator says like where's the
mustard and there it is right in front
of them but it's because they don't hold
the visual look of the object to match
it up to what they're looking for so
someone with this difficulty will not
like to shop because they'll walk by the
the item that they're looking for
multiple times and I had a garden writer
once who had this difficulty if you can
imagine like she couldn't hold the image
of the plants so she'd have to use
language like it was the clematis you
know growing up the fence with the large
purple leaves which really is pretty
limiting if you're trying to write about
gardens and then if you have the face
recognition part that's the difficulty
this is a person that will recognize
again their neighbor on their porch but
two minutes later if the neighbors
walking down the street they won't
recognize them and a friend of mine
hasn't had this difficulty and we worked
on them she doesn't anymore and she was
a reporter at the Toronto Star which is
a big newspaper in Toronto and for 20
years she rode the same elevator
probably with the same people you know
to her workplace and she didn't
recognize who was on the elevator with
her so she decided her strategy was
going to be to be friendly to everybody
so she figured some people think she's
just a little too over friendly but she
felt that was more would less likely
result in her offending somebody that
she should know because she didn't know
if she knew them or not because you just
couldn't recognize their faces and now
and now she can and then just quickly
I'll go through a couple other areas
this is a very easy area to identify
this is you ask a student or ask an
individual to tell you a story and they
can
tell you an elaborate story give them
five or ten minutes and you know they
can just talk and talk and talk you put
a pen in their hand or a pencil give
them the same five or ten minutes and
maybe one sentence two sentences goes
down so they've got the thought they've
got the content but it doesn't get
translated into the motor plan into the
written expression and students with
this difficulty often talk about feeling
locked inside their head because they
can't external eyes on paper what they
know so it affects writing obviously
spelling not because they don't remember
the visual look of the word but they
don't remember the motor plans so they
it just doesn't fire out in an automatic
motor plan so this is a student they can
spell the same word five different ways
on the page because it comes out
differently each time and it affects
reading not because they don't remember
the visual look of the word but they
can't eye track so this is the student
that makes these kinds of reading errors
so they'll have the right letters in the
word like calm and clam but the
eye-tracking doesn't work smoothly or
they'll use their finger to track
because they'll lose their place when
they're reading because the part of the
brain that's that's developing the
well-ordered fixations for tracking is
is implicated and it also affects
mathematics this is a student that will
say please don't make me show my rough
work on the paper I can do the
calculations in my head but they know if
they have to write them down they're
gonna make mistakes are they gonna miss
read the sign and they're gonna add
instead of multiply or they'll miss copy
the question down the last one I saw a
student say 3 into 15 is 5 so she knew
the answer but the last thing she saw
was a 3 and that's the number that got
written down teachers will often say to
these students you're making careless
errors they are not careless errors
these are motor slips these these
children do not externalize the the
proper motor patterns and the exercise
for this she looks like a happy pirate
we use an eyepatch because it's it's a
motor functioning and the I motor
movements in the right I talked to the
left promoter region and that's where
we're trying to get more stimulation
into that area and they learn lots and
lots of motor plans and we see things
like legibility and writing amount of
writing ability for the person to edit
eye tracking reading speed improves and
obviously fewer errors and a lot of
students with this difficulty as a 14
year old boy print
instead of right because printing is
relies on more discreet motor movements
and a place is less of a load on that
cognitive function we don't work on
handwriting we work on the cognitive
exercise and you can see over time the
students writing changed from printing
printing a writing to writing and that
is because the cognitive capacity was in
place for the person to learn these
motor plans for writing this was a
student at was given 10 minutes to write
on the topic this was a year later same
ten minutes and it went on for three
pages and again he had all these ideas
in his head we didn't put the ideas in
his head now he could put them down on
paper and this was an English teacher
describing a student that was going
through this exercise and the changes
that she saw in her English work and
again you can just see it graphically I
mean it's it's more organized this is a
student at the writing they'll go off
the page around the corner they'll go on
to the desk now the student can organize
the motor plan on the page and this is
the student to the traditionally you
hear in psychological reports give the
child more time on the test because they
can't externalize their thought by the
end of this exercise these students can
do time tests within the time limits
they don't need extra time and this
these are a couple studies again they're
all on on the website showing the kinds
of things you'd expect to change as a
result of that that cognitive function
and this was a study sometimes people
say you know they're a little nervous
like we're going to take students out of
academics half of a day and do brain
exercises and you know how is that going
to help them learn well we learn with
our brain that's kind of how it helps
them learn because some of these
students could sit in class forever and
they're not going to benefit from the
instruction and this study I really like
because it was done by somebody actually
who was quite opposed to my program and
the Vancouver School Board and the blue
is Aerosmith and the red is learning
assistant students and so those learning
assistant students were getting English
they were getting spelling they were
getting reading writing every single day
the Aerosmith students were getting
cognitive exercises after eight to nine
months the Aerosmith students actually
did better on spelling and also on
reading comp
henshin the learning assistant students
even though they weren't getting
exposure to that material but now their
brain could process that material and
again to me this just points to the
power of this work that it is really
with our brain that we learn and engage
in the learning process and this is a
brochure that's on our website and I
think I've brought a few of them here
that just summarizes all of the studies
and what's really exciting
Howard Eaton and I've eaten hours from
school formed a research group about a
year ago I think and we are now involved
in a research study with the University
of Calgary looking at outcome measures
on the Woodcock cognitive achievement
and academic and seem really really
positive results and we're just working
with researchers at UBC starting an
imaging study in the next few weeks
we're just finalizing that and also the
university of southern illinois doing
imaging because i mean my interest is
finding out I mean I know the work works
but how can i enhance this work how can
I actually make it more effective for
the what I call the end user which is a
child sitting at that desk that that
needs this kind of works I'm hoping that
what we discover in these scans will
will help us improve the delivery of the
system and then my favorite area is what
I call artefactual thinking and this is
probably should have called nonverbal
thinking but this was a lot of years ago
and I like that term this is really the
part of the brain in the right
hemisphere that that plans and thinks
non-verbally one researcher calls a
cognitive Goldilocks which i think is a
really an appropriate term because it's
the part of the brain that allows us to
project ourselves into a situation
before actually being in that situation
and imagine what outcome do we want to
create and then once we get into the
situation allows us to problem-solve and
plan to see are we on target to to
create that outcome and if not then what
strategies can we use to modify our
behavior modify the situation to create
the outcome so it's thinking planning
problem solving in the nonverbal realm
and if somebody's good here this is the
person that can walk into a situation
read
subtle cues and nuances and is really
socially apt and socially appropriate
and if they have a problem here this is
the individual that is awkward socially
uncomfortable socially you can give them
a rule like in a social situation do XY
and Z but they miss apply it they'll
apply it to a situation where it doesn't
really work and you know I believe
there's no rulebook for life you have to
be able to generate your rules and all
of these different situations that you
come into and that's what this cognitive
function allows you to do I like to make
up terms so I talked about premature
closure which for me is the student that
goes into a situation or the individual
and they're multiple things happening
they'll look at one or two details or
factors they'll make an interpretation
and then they'll run with that
interpretation but it isn't accurate
because it's only taking a subset of the
the information so it means that they
end up getting into difficulty socially
or the other ways this is the person
that leaps before they fully look at the
situation and this was a picture that I
gave to a young girl she was 12 that had
this difficulty and nobody in her
neighborhood would play with her and she
had a reputation they called her they
said she was a teller of tall tales
which is sort of a nice way to say they
thought she was lying a lot and it
really wasn't that she was telling tall
tales it was just she didn't read
situations very well so I showed her
this picture and asked her what she
thought was happening here and she told
me there playing badminton so I kept a
very straight face and I asked her to
explain why and it's sort of hard to see
but the woman with her hands
outstretched has netting on her hat if
you can sort of see that it's easier in
the real picture and this girl saw the
netting it triggered an association
netting badminton there playing
badminton very very severe premature
closure like looking at one element and
making a whole interpretation so really
put into perspective why nobody want to
play with her in her neighborhood
because she was making these kinds of
incorrect interpretations all the time
and then an 18 year old girl looked at
this picture and told me they were at
City Hall and I asked her why she
thought that and she pointed to the rope
in the foreground and she'd been to City
Hall in Toronto and there was a section
of the
area side of the city hall that was
cordoned off with a rope so it triggered
that association so again imagine these
individuals world it's really hard for
them to navigate socially and then this
is the classic Norman Rockwell picture
the little girl that's lost her two
front teeth and her friends reaction to
that and probably 80% of the people have
this difficulty in nonverbal
interpretation we'll look at this
picture and say they're having a
shouting match because what they're
focusing on is the mouth being open and
that triggers an association with the
shouting match but I mean they don't
look at all the information that girl
doesn't look like she's angry she
actually kind of looks like she's happy
and proud of whatever's going on and
certainly in my world if somebody's
shouting abuse at me I'm not gonna be
leaning in like the other girl is to
hear more of that abuse so the body
language doesn't fit the interpretation
and I had a teacher one of my teachers
her son was in my school he was 12 and
he had this difficulty so he's it was
describing this picture and explaining
his interpretation so she asked if she
could take it home and show her husband
and I said sure so she walked through
the door and held up the picture and her
husband looked down so that's
interesting they're having a shouting
match and sort of shows that these
things are inherited but also she said
it explained a lot in their marriage
but he had it to us much less degree
than the son had it and we have a whole
program for this area which stimulates
this function which allows these
individuals to have a real real
relationships in in the social world and
do all that planning and thinking we
know in the adolescent class when we're
being successful because they start
massively dating because they can now
have all these kind of relationships so
for a while they don't really want to do
anymore of the exercise because they're
so excited about you know having
relationships but it's a positive thing
and then I work with individuals
obviously who have attention deficit or
attention deficit hyperactive disorder
and in a lot of cases students that come
into the program that are on medication
when they walk through the door by the
end of the program 75 to 80 percent of
the students are off medication and for
a number of reasons one is what I call
cognitive load these students are
in class with number of cognitive
deficits that means it's really hard for
them to attend they're being asked to do
things in class that take extra energy
and effort for them to attend and the
brain goes refractory it just gets
exhausted and then their attention
starts to wander and drift and they
start to engage in behaviors that their
teachers wish they wouldn't
and as we lighten that load by
addressing the cognitive functions the
individual can sit in class and do what
is being required of them and they can
sustain attention and then there's a
group that have what I call symbolic and
artefactual thinking which is the
prefrontal cortex and the right and left
hemisphere and part of the job of that
part of the brain is to keep attention
relevantly focused towards a goal it's
very much what that part of the brain
does it allows you to say this
information is important to solve that
goal this information over here is
irrelevant so don't get distracted by it
if somebody has a problem here all
information is equally relevant so the
butterfly flying outside the window is
just as important as as the math
question in front of them and again as
we address that cognitive function that
part of the brain comes online to be
able to regulate attention and the
children can come off of them children
adolescents adults off of medication and
then some of the other areas we work on
auditory memory and all sorts of
different programs for different aspects
of auditory memory the the child that
comes home they know they're supposed to
do homework but they can't remember the
instructions of what they're supposed to
do the child that you tell to do three
things they come back with one or two
done and have no recollection of the
third thing some adults I know that are
writing all over their hands or the
post-it notes all around their house
because they know they won't remember
the information or they're lost if they
don't have their to-do list because they
can't hold the the information these are
people who aren't going to like books on
tape because they aren't going to hold
the auditory information and often they
get labeled as irresponsible because
they don't do what they're asked to do
and they really aren't be responsible
they can't hold the auditory information
and then I have a program for what I
call quantity blindness these are the
people have no sense of number so for
them ten a hundred a thousand all means
the same thing so they can't time
schedule they can't budget they run out
of gas on the highway I had a
psychiatrist that had this problem she
was always double booking people because
just had no sense of how long things
took which irritated a lot of her
clients so we worked on that area and
she now can do that and then I work with
a lot of adults and see what I call a
cognitive mismatch this is where parts
of somebody's brain aren't compatible
with the demands of the job that they're
involved in I had a pilot that had the
auditory memory problem and his strategy
was whenever he was flying into busy
airspace was to ask the air-traffic
controller to repeat the instructions
over and over again because he couldn't
remember them and my fear was what if
that air-traffic trollers really really
busy and can only say those instructions
once he couldn't remember them so my
joke was I used to ask him if I was ever
getting on the plane to file his flight
plan with me so I wasn't flying in the
same airspace as he was but the better
solution was we addressed the problem
and now he can just hold the information
he can hear it and hold it I had a
pathologist he was doing his residency
in pathology and actually a teaching
hospital in the United States and he had
that object recognition piece in the
right hemisphere and he didn't realize
he had the difficulty that he was
examining breast tissue and it was
somebody that had cancer um and they
were seeing whether she was in remission
she'd had chemotherapy and radiation and
he knew how important this determination
was so he was really careful and really
diligent and he was just about to sign
off that the person was in remission
when his supervisor came over and said
didn't you see these cells up here this
is cancer so some of the things we think
or human error could be this cognitive
mismatch he realized this was really
serious and significant he exited his
residency addressed this problem and he
won't make that kind of mistake
I had a butcher who had that kinesthetic
problem and imagine if you don't know
where this hand is and you got a really
sharp knife in this hand it's really not
a good career choice so the first day he
came into my school his left hand was
all in bandages so obviously we
addressed that problem and he doesn't
make that difficult they had someone on
the Olympic ski jump team in Canada who
had this a very very mild problem here
but for him a mild problem was really
significant because you're coming out of
those shoots at whatever speed they're
going and he would just make a slight in
perception
or slightly miss read where that part of
his body was in space and he would tend
to fall to that that side so there's
going to kind of go through sort of
quickly like we know that for
neuroplastic change I think I've talked
about this briefly there's certain
things that that have to be I mean I
wish it was a quick fix I wish it was
really easy but it isn't the brain
doesn't change all that easily not in a
sustained way so any activity we do
that's really going to change the brain
requires real active sustained
engagement lots of repetition and
neuroscience is talking but this thing
called effortful processing which is
again where you have to calibrate the
level of the difficulty of the activity
so it's really a mental workout for the
brain and one of the ways you can do
that is this novelty and task complexity
look at the clocks I did everything I
could with two hands I had a third hand
and a fourth hand now we have ten hands
it's it's to increase the complexity to
make that brain process and as I said at
the beginning of talk what's really
exciting to me is there's plasticity
over our lifespan I've worked across the
whole age span and and I've seen the you
know the 81 year old made the same
progress as the 15 year old and there's
lots of research going on now looking at
variability and plasticity which is
really interesting I mean I've
practically seen students that come in
they have very similar profiles same age
same gender do the same amount of work
and they both make progress but one
moves four times more quickly than
another one and just makes sense their
individual differences in everything so
why wouldn't there be individual
differences in plasticity so there's a
lot of research now a lot of us coming
out of Sweden looking at some of the
factors that make somebody have more
neuroplasticity or less neuroplasticity
and this we understand this more we can
use it to enhance these kind of programs
and just again repeating what I've said
but again we know every time we do
something with our brain it changes it
but the kind of change we're talking
about here is it's really profound
change that takes incredible amount of
effort and work and energy to to change
it but then those changes are there for
life and what can we do to sustain these
changes I mean we can keep our brain
active over our lifetime
in our own lives
we can try to be left sleep-deprived I
mean meditation reduce stress and
anxiety increased effort for processing
active engagement and we've all heard
that hebbs principle neurons that fire
together wire together that make those
parts of the brain function more
effectively and why is it important it's
important because it allows the brain to
function optimally and to learn and can
navigate through our world and people
often ask what is my vision for
education
really I mean having struggled with
learning disabilities myself and and
knowing the anguish that that costs I
mean at some level this is I believe
alleviating human suffering and I work
with lots of adults and what they tell
me all the time is at a certain point in
their life they stop dreaming they did
not dare to dream I mean the doors just
started closing and their life got more
and more constricted and they feel in a
lot of cases that their career was
chosen for them because there were so
few doors open that they could only walk
through those doors and I think what
this work allows people to do is not
only dream but actually competently
realize their dream because they have
the cognitive capacity to navigate
through the world and learn and it opens
up more doors and more possibilities for
these individuals to walk through and my
kind of reason for being in life is
really to make this work more accessible
to individuals that are having learning
challenges to make it available in
schools this is a teacher training in
August in 2013 in Toronto their teachers
here from Australia New Zealand United
States actually might be I'm going to
some of the teachers that are here in
the audience today we're in this picture
and in Canada and and I'm committed to
training more teachers to really we've
got probably millions of data points of
all of these children's progress from
1978 when I started this work up until
now and to really mind this data so that
we can Hance the the delivery and the
effectiveness of the program so that
children have a different trajectory
through education
and that they can actually experience
learning as joyful and easy and
pleasurable and that is my true vision
for education so I thank you and I'm
happy to answer any questions
yes
yeah I've worked with individuals with
Asperger's which is the high-functioning
autism and they're those whole nonverbal
pieces and auditory processing reasoning
we've had success the progress through
the programs a bit slower partly because
a lot of students it's harder for them
to maintain engagement not because they
get distracted externally but internally
by the processes going on within them
students that are more severe on the
autistic spectrum we don't really
understand what's going on in the brain
for my work to work it's very targeted
cognitive stimulation two very specific
parts of the brain so if I don't
understand what I'm targeting I can't
create a program or an exercise for that
how do you feel about talk about the
neurological reorganization
of the crawling yes yes I mean I believe
there multiple windows into different
cognitive functions and what I've
discovered is a series of windows into
different cognitive functions it doesn't
mean that other people haven't come up
with with ways that can stimulate
stimulate function and I guess it would
be my comment would be to look at what
they're asking you to do and think does
that match where you're having
difficulty and if you feel it doesn't
then it's probably unlikely that it's
going to be of benefit
question three mentioned in your
childhood we're not either to try new
things well it's difficult conceptually
for you to reach out to something
because and how what what are the
strategies you would recommend like if
you're trying to get children to do
something new it's there's a real
cognitive difficulty there the best
approach is to address the cognitive
difficulty to find a program you know if
there's a school there schools here that
that can deliver this program to
actually stimulate function so then you
don't have to use a strategy he actually
can do things differently he can he can
compare and contrast and do all of that
if that's not an option it's kind of
look at the task and see how you can
break it down to very very simple steps
and do it gradually because if it's too
overwhelming like for me everything was
overwhelming and that crazy anxiety I
used to talk about I lived in amygdala
Hell which was just terror and fear all
the time and when you're in that state
you can't learn but maybe if somebody
had understood and just made it really
simple like kind of one tiny little step
and helped me understand rather than you
know the whole overwhelming Magilla of
everything that that would be my best
recommendation if you can't access the
program
identify up front so that's my first
question the question is are there
options here locally for okay so I can
answer both of us my program is very
broad because it's addressing 19
different cognitive functions and what I
say to parents or educators go on the
website or look in my book I describe
all of the areas that we work with and
if you see a match to your child or a
child in your class to those profiles
then this program will be appropriate
it's it's so broad and it covers the
very common areas that are related to
learning difficulties that in most cases
it's going to address those problems and
in terms of schools that that are here
there's a school in Bothell that gate no
Heritage Heritage Christian Academy and
I'm doing a talk there tonight and it
offers the program and then there's a
Gateway and cross point that's in poles
bow and Bremerton so those are the
schools outside of the the Seattle area
that currently offered the program on my
website there's a little button called
participating schools you can go in
there and they'll show the schools
around the world that offered the
program
they often seem to run in families I
might you did not have anything for home
is there any yeah I mean my my
commitment is to make it accessible and
and it's looking at how is that possible
so one is obviously private schools but
then there's private school tuition one
is you know getting publicly funded
schools interested and we're in just a
public school in Toronto when in
Auckland which doesn't really help you
very much one in Sydney in Australia but
I'm that's my commitment I mean it just
takes time I mean a publicly funded
schools a larger bureaucracy and a long
term to see other ways that I can
deliver this remotely I mean currently
the model that has we've had a lot of
success with and works really well is
the school gets interested we we create
a relationship with the school because
we we need certain requirements meant we
need the school to agree to give me or
give the program for cognitive periods
for 40-minute periods a day so it means
we're taking really half of the students
day to do cognitive exercises less than
that is not going to benefit the student
and I will not do anything that won't
benefit the student so it really works
well in the school-based program because
we're taking half of the day of that
that child and then the school will send
teachers to be trained and then we have
ongoing support delivery model ongoing
professional development with with the
school but I'm always looking at how can
I maintain the integrity of the program
and deliver it more broadly and make it
more accessible that that's always what
drives me
people within the Toronto region are
trying to move but they because it's
only one school system and we're in four
schools and that's 40 students which is
tiny
they're picking they're taking students
pretty much out of their their school
system
it's a charc the charter school they're
voting tonight in Portland they're
voting tonight to see whether it's going
into charter school which there won't be
tuition with adults I mean some adults
come into the full day program schools
that have run the program after two
years of sort of successfully running
the program they can offer a part-time
program so adults did and that that
depends on whether the school wants to
do that and the part-time a lot of
schools offer part-time programs I mean
Aerosmith in Vancouver I think Gateway
here is looking at in February starting
a part-time program and that would be
after-hours but usually what we can do
is work on one cognitive function at a
time because we need four hours per week
to affect change but but we've had a lot
of success with that with adults so it
would be if you're interested I would go
on the website and contact
I think Gateway is they said they were
starting in February I think
it is confusing I mean Lumosity comes
out of I think good neuroscience posit
science which is Michael Marisnick out
of the UCSF is good science but they're
doing general stimulation it's going to
have limited benefit for an individual
struggling with learning difficulties
because it's not targeted stimulation to
the area that they're having difficulty
with I would say they're more you know
for this we're getting older I mean just
to keep our brain sharp a good general
stimulation but they aren't designed or
targeted for individual struggling with
learning problems some people come in
with having you know psychological
reports having a report from a
psychologist other individuals just go
on the website and they say this is this
and this we're working on an online
questionnaire that hopefully should be
available in about a month that people
would be able to go on the website and
answer the detailed questions on a
continuum and then it would say well it
looks like your child has this profile
and that would suggest that they could
benefit because it's expensive to go to
a psychologist and get your child
assessed ideally if you don't need to do
that and you can say yes this is a match
according to the areas then you don't
need to have a separate assessment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
