tegmark to the Microsoft Research
visiting speaker series max is here to
discuss his book our mathematical
universe my quest for the ultimate
nature of reality he leads us through
his hypothesis that our physical reality
is a mathematical mathematical structure
and his theory and also his theory of
the ultimate multiverse Max is a physics

papers he holds a PhD from UC Berkeley
please join me in giving him a very warm
welcome it's a great pleasure to be here
can you hear me all right laughs Mike
awesome
so I want to convince you today to think
big because we humans have again and
again and again underestimated not only
the size of our cosmos discovering that
everything that we thought existed was
just a small part of much grander
structure our planet our solar system
our galaxy our universe perhaps even a
hierarchy of parallel universes
we've also repeatedly underestimated the
power of our human minds to understand
and even improve our universe and that
last part should be particularly
striking to those of you here Microsoft
or you know spending your time really on
research and trying to figure out how we
can push technology to new limits to
really appreciate the first part better
we have to remind ourselves first of
what we humans have figured out about
our place in space during the first 13.7
13.8 billion years of our university can
we just turn the lights completely off
just for a few minutes so we can enjoy a
little space right here let's head off
from Himalaya into space and take a
little look at what we found when when
the ancients lived here thousands of
years ago and looked at the sparkling
white dots in the sky they of course
made up beautiful legends about these
stars but I think and they were just as
smart as we are but I think many of them
probably felt a little bit melancholy
figuring that they would never really
to figure out for sure what was up there
and yet you know by two thousand years
ago Eratosthenes have managed to figure
out the actual size of this ball we live
on there was 40,000 kilometers not with
rocket power but with mental power by
letting his mind fly and using his
really clever observations and logic and
the same kind of logic is of course also
given us now rocket power you see here
the orbits of all the near-earth
satellites
this is a fully accurate rendering made
by the American Museum of Natural
History everything is to scale now we're
beginning to see some orbits some
farther away satellites in geostationary
orbits coming into view soon we're gonna
see the orbit of the moon coming
interview but you won't see the moon at
all because it's the scale that's how
fast the moon's orbit is right and just
for perspective you all know it takes
eight minutes for light to reach us from
the Sun so we're not seeing the Sun the
way it looks now but the way it was
eight minutes in the past as we continue
to zoom on out we start to see the
orbits of the planets but again you
can't see the planets because this is
the scale that's how fast they are takes
several hours for light to reach us from
the outer parts of the solar system this
was the our universe this was everything
people knew existed of course for much
of human history because they had no
clue how far away the stars were now I
want you to arrange your hands if you
know anybody was born before 1925 so
think about them when they were little
kids they didn't know that there were
other galaxies that's how amazing these
much our perspective our universe is
expanded just now in 1925 when Edwin
Hubble for the first time realized that
this fuzzy little blob in the sky was
called the Andromeda nebula was another
galaxy we see our own galaxy coming into
view here with its hundreds of billions
of stars and its majestic spiral
structure hundred thousand light-years
from side to side and yet we now know of
course that this too is just one part of
a much grander structure clusters super
clusters enormous filaments of billions
and billions of galaxies here we see the
Sloan Great Wall that I and my
colleagues on the Sloan Digital Sky
discovered which is a billion
light-years across and even this
magnificent tapestry of the cosmos is
itself just smart a small part of an
even grander structure which is going to
appear here in about one second our
universe our universe the way we use the
term in astronomy of course is not
everything that exists it's not all of
space it's the spherical part of space
from which light has had time to reach
us so far during the 13.8 billion years
since our Big Bang there's probably more
space out beyond here with other
galaxies but we can't see them no matter
how good telescopes we build because
we'd have to wait billions of years more
for the light from them to have time to
reach us so this is our universe our
home this is what we have it have a shot
at actually exploring with it normal
methods of science now most of what I
said was kind of intuitive farther away
we've looked woman's the more stuff
we've seen but what's the deal with this
green and blue and yellow stuff here on
this ball what is that I mean to
understand this it's not enough for us
to talk about our place in space we also
have to explore our place in time
that's fortunately quite easy in
astronomy because as we discussed we see
the Sun the way it was eight minutes ago
we see stars at night the way they were
hundreds of years ago if you look at
some stars this evening if you can see
them if someone looking that back at us
from there wouldn't see us today but
they might see the American Revolution
for instance and here in this amazing
photo from the Hubble Space Telescope we
see many galaxies the way they work
billions and billions and billions of
years ago so by simply looking at
different distances away from us we can
directly see history unfold the sky is
like a time machine in the sense that we
can directly learn a lot of things about
the history of our universe now so what
have we learned from looking into the
past like this we've learned some really
surprising stuff and just to appreciate
how surprising it is I want you to for a
moment to just imagine that each one of
you is a galaxy okay and I'm standing
here looking at at you galaxies
with my telescope hmm what do I see I
see something pretty funny first of all
you guys are all in your 90's and you
guys on the next drawer in your 80s and
you guys are in your 70s and then I see
progress to the younger rows of people
there is a whole row of teenagers and
behind you a bunch of preschoolers and
then a bunch of kindergarteners and
toddlers and the second last row is just
a bunch of infants in the very last room
row of the room is completely empty and
as if that wasn't surprising enough the
back wall I say here are of your room
glows with a strange strange glow of
microwave radiation and further adding
to make a puzzlement here it seems like
you're blushing you guys are a little
bit pinched in the face here where some
of those of you in the far back or like
tomato red what's going on why this is
exactly what we see in the sky well the
first part that you seem to mysteriously
have sorted yourself when you came in
and sat in your chairs by age we can
understand simply from the fact that
we're looking farther and farther back
in time right because when we look at
galaxies nearby we see the way they are
more or less now 13.8 billion years
after a Big Bang whereas when we looked
much farther away we see galaxies the
way they were long ago when they hadn't
had time to mature fully really far away
all we see are these baby galaxies much
more small and immature and beyond them
well that's the empty last row of the
room here
we see no galaxies at all because we're
looking so far back in time that the
galaxies simply hadn't had time to form
this black and all these telescope
images which I used to think was a
vacuum when I was a kid it's of course
not vacuum it's actually hydrogen gas
and the other ingredients out of which
the galaxies later ended up forming now
why are you guys all blushing were you
embarrassed well if you go out to the
i-5 here and listen to the cars you hear
them go in they don't go mmm
why not well because of the Doppler
effect you know that if a car is going
away from you the frequency shifts
towards lower frequencies and it's
exactly the same for light if something
is moving away from you the frequency of
the light gets lower which means the
color of light gets redder we call it
red shifting in astronomy
that means the since you galaxies are
all better than you should be it means
you're all flying away from me this is
what we mean when we say that our
universe is expanding let me see that
all these galaxies are flying away the
fact that those of you in the back are
more red in the face then those of you
near me means that you're flying away
faster and when Hubble discovered that
the galaxies twice as far away
typically flies away twice as fast I can
figure out if you're flying away from me
how long ago you were roughly here by
just taking your distance and dividing
by your speed and because this relation
that the farther you are the faster you
go you were all right in the same place
pretty much at the same time how long
ago can you take these distances and
divide by speeds you get about fourteen
billion years ago or 13.8 when we take
into account acceleration and
deceleration so something really weird
happened then everything was much more
squished together and dense we have a
fancy name for it our Big Bang although
we're still there's still some big
mysteries as to the details of this you
can ask me about that later
however we know a great deal about what
happened during the 13.8 billion years
since then because as we said we can
actually see most of us with our
telescopes and also find whatever the
fossil evidence of what happened back
then so we have one more thing that was
weird that we saw here which you have to
explain which is why the back wall was
glowing with microwaves right well if
everything is actually flying apart if
our universe is expanding then the gas
was expanding too and you know that an
expanding gas cools off that's how
you're refrigerators and air
conditioners work right so if we go back
in time everything was more and more
squished together I guess what was
hotter and hotter and hotter if you take
an ice cube and heated up it turns into
liquid water heat up a liquid it turns
to steam and the gas if you heat up a
gas like hydrogen enough
does it turn into plasma exactly
anaplasma is not transparent anymore
it's opaque so it's gonna look to us
like we're staring into an opaque plasma
screen there behind all the galaxies it
looks like this and it looks like this
regardless of what direction we look in
so it's actually appears to us visually
like beyond all these galaxies beyond
even the baby ones there is the plasma
screens and opaque screen of hydrogen
plasma on all sides and this is what's
drawing plot what's shown here on the
perimeter of our universe which you're
welcome to play with as long as you're
gentle and loving with it we don't want
to pop our universe these are actual
photos of this plasma sphere taken with
with the Wilkinson microwave anisotropy
probe satellite in my opinion one of the
most awesome NASA missions ever to
revolutionize cosmology for the cost of
40 cents per American and the only
question people had about this was well
is it right could they have screwed up
somehow on these measurements because
it's really really hard to make these
images of basically baby pictures of our
universe the way it was only four
hundred thousand years after our Big
Bang well now we know because last year
a totally different satellite the Planck
satellite took an even sharper image of
these behalf of the baby universe and
got this and look just how marvelously
it agrees look at any one of these spots
red or blue and see how still they're
accepted but even higher resolution now
this was a 3 megapixel photo this is 50
megapixels so it's really quite amazing
to have this kind of data and it's
totally transformed cosmology from being
largely a speculative and flaky science
on the somewhere on the verge out there
between philosophy and metaphysics into
an actual quantitative scientific area
like today when I was a grad student we
would argue about whether our universe
was ten billion years old or 20 billion
years old now thanks to data like this
we argue about whether it's 13.7 billion
years old or 13.8 billion years old so
that's progress you know when humans
have been able to figure out a lot but
we shouldn't yet hubris and lose sight
of the fact that they're also a lot of
big missed
really remain as as most of you have
heard for example it's clear it's clear
only about 5% of all the stuff in the
universe is made out of atoms that
constitute everything here at Microsoft
and we have very little clue what the
rest is made out of except that it seems
to be at least two different kinds of
stuff that we have no clue about dark
matter and dark energy dark matter seems
to be some kind of stuff maybe some new
kinds of particles that are very shy and
don't interact much dark but we don't
know that for sure dark energy is a
little more than a code word for total
ignorance although you're welcome to ask
me more about it afterwards I'll tell
you what little we do know and we would
also another big mystery is what really
put the bang into our Big Bang right
why was there all this stuff hot and
dense and flying apart 13.8 billion
years ago and another big mystery is
what's gonna happen in the future in the
long-term future and that answer that
question turns out to be equivalent to
understanding what dark energy is
because the nature of the dark energy is
gonna seal the ultimate the faith of our
cosmos so we have a lot of really cool
questions to go after
fortunately we also have a lot more data
that we can harvest from our universe
that we haven't yet captured because of
our universe we've only mapped a tiny
fraction this looks like a big map but
it's only a map of the surface here the
inner surface of this plasma screen
shown in yellow which is a tiny
percentage of the volume and then all
those galaxies we flew around and looked
like you're really big map right well
actually it's just this little part here
in the center much less than a percent
of the volume again so it's a little bit
like maps of the US before the Lewis and
Clark expedition you know when people
knew a little bit about what was on the
eastern seaboard and western seaboard
because of the Spanish and them have
very little clue what was in the middle
how can we do more well fortunately
there is a very nice technique for
mapping most of the rest you cannot
build a super-duper big telescope and
take pictures of galaxies here because
there simply aren't any galaxies here so
long ago that they hadn't formed right
but this hydrogen gas that's there we
can see in a different way because
hydrogen gas gives off radio waves
they're 21 centimeters long and by the
time they reach Earth there's
by the expansion of space to be longer
to a wavelength that encodes how far
away they came from so we can make
awesome 3d maps there is a whole bunch
of different teams across the world now
scrambling to try to do this we at MIT
have one of them and I want to share
with you just a little movie of what
we've been doing this is how to give you
a two-minute version of how to build
your own radio telescope you'll see how
easy it is
the kids who keep sitting here not doing
anything at my youngest son
yeah that was easy wasn't it it's been
so much fun getting to work with this
not just because I find it fascinating
to be a part of this quest to understand
our universe better but because the
people that who I get to work with it
just so awesome and so much fun and this
is very much a Microsoft style project
because you've seen a lot of old radio
telescopes like Arecibo where you build
enormous dish and if you have a motor to
point this it becomes a nightmare if you
try to make your square kilometer area
or something like that where's what you
saw we had or isn't that Italy fast a
large number of very cheap
mass-producible antennas no moving parts
you just measure all the vaults and put
it into some really high speed
electronics and in left and then just
compute what the universe looks like
we're now at 20 we're now in scaling
this up we just went to the second round
and for an NSF grant proposal build a
point one square kilometer version of
this together with various colleagues
and it's fantastic cuz you take the
picture not just have one little
direction of the sky like will the
ordinary telescope you get this image
the entire sky at the same time and it's
just vastly cheaper than an ordinary
telescope so basically leveraging off of
all the investments in semiconductor
industry and software that would happen
over there recent years that's just one
example of a fun stuff going on but I'll
just summarize by saying I said at the
beginning we've discovered not only the
humans that our cosmos is much larger
than we thought right there we've
underestimated that but also that we've
underestimated our ability to understand
things and it really is remarkable that
we have a quite detailed story of what
happened during the past 13.8 billion
years which I think begs the question
how have we humans really been able to
figure out so much of course partly
because the human mind is awesome it's
as far as we can tell the most
complicated and sophisticated object in
the known universe but there are also
two other reasons to really the two most
useful ideas in science one is
we should do experiments and look at
mother nature yeah theta hi and the
second is that whenever we get data we
should analyze it for mathematical
patterns and regularities why is that
second part so useful why does it seem
like our universe it has these
mathematical properties it's an old idea
Pythagoras already said that numbers
rule the universe over 2,000 years ago
and Galileo during the Renaissance
exclaimed that our universe seems to be
a grand book you know written in the
language of mathematics but where is all
this math but these guys are going on
about I mean I look around in the room
the only numbers I can see are it says
154 there but some human design that
clock doesn't tell me anything about
nature right well Galileo talks in this
quote here about mathematics also in a
broader sense patterns and shapes and
that we do have a lot of a nature what
do we call this shape that everything's
thrown in a gravitational field makes a
parabola and it obey is a very simple
equation as you know y equals x squared
if you look at the patterns and shapes
but things orbit around in space
anything orbiting anything whether it be
the Sun or a black hole goes in this
shape known as an ellipse which obeys
another simple equation and these are
related these shapes too because of
course a small part of an ellipse like
this is very well approximated by a
parabola and if you actually tackle it
exactly the shape this flow moves and
it's actually technically not a parabola
but a piece of an ellipse and let me
give you a little pop quiz here these
three discoveries of the planet Neptune
the radio wave and the Higgs boson what
tool was it that the trigger these
discoveries
don't be shy this is a this is none of
your knocking this is can often be part
of your final grade for the course it's
just diagnostic yeah especially although
a Neptune was discovered Uranus was
discovered serendipitously people were
looking around the telescope and found
it but how was neptune discovered relate
this video exactly with what tool with
mathematics because as you as you were
in st. as you were suggesting there this
Frenchman of man level EA realized that
Uranus was not moving in the way it was
supposed to according to Newton's
equations of gravity he did a bunch of
math he wrote this letter to an
astronomer named Galileo Berlin and say
hey point you telescope at such and such
a place and such at such a time and you
will there find a new planet
now this German dude probably figured
whoever wrote this letter must be cuckoo
for cocoa puffs you know but he was so
curious that he pointed his telescope
there anyway and boom there was Neptune
predicted basically no way with a pencil
if you want to be really nitpicky and
then a few decades later James Clerk
Maxwell when he unified all of the no
knowledge about electricity and Mac and
magnetism into the Maxwell equations
which of course underlie all the
semiconductor industry made a prediction
again with pure math that if you build a
certain kind of device you can send
radio waves which will travel at the
speed of light through him and let you
send information through empty space
through walls
I mean raising and raise your hand if
you have a cell phone in your pocket
again predicted through math right and
then most recently Peter Higgs took the
most advanced mathematical description
we had in theoretical physics the
standard model of particle physics and
predicted just two math but if you build
most advanced scientific instruments
ever built in Geneva and you crash
particles together there any other speed
of light in a certain way you will
discover a new particle the Higgs boson
you know how that went we built the LHC
boom there was the higgs boson and he
got a free trip to visit my hometown of
Stockholm and it's not just those those
are three samples but we have of course
by now an incredible variety of things
we can predict
understand with very small number of
mathematical equations that actually my
wife was kind enough to let me put up in
our living room lets her off sweet and
understanding she is we're still not
done with this because this equation
here the describes quantum mechanics
doesn't get along with this equation of
general relativity
so you one of you guys maybe or maybe
one of your kids can unify it you have
another free trip to Stockholm for the
quantum gravity theory but it's really
remarkable and it's not just shapes and
patterns and equations either it's even
numbers shredding here by the way
whistle didn't just put equations in his
living room but even on a tombstone it's
also numbers and the book I have this
list of 32 numbers which have this
property that they have no units they're
pure numbers and from them you can in
principle using the equations of physics
calculate every other fundamental
physical constant ever measured we can
measure more than a hundred thousand
different numbers for example about the
properties of spectral lines and light
coming out of atoms you can calculate
them all from this if you want to know
why is the proton eighteen hundred and
thirty six times heavier than an
electron well you can calculate that
from these numbers no amazing data
compression even beats gzip minus nine
and why is this so so far what I've said
is pretty uncontroversial everybody
agrees that math is useful where it gets
really controversial and interesting is
when you ask why is this so in the book
I explore a wide range of possibilities
Eugene Wigner said in the 1960s that the
enormous usefulness of math in the
Natural Sciences is really something
bordering on the mysterious there's just
no rational explanation for it and
there's still many perfectly respectable
scientists who think this is just a
fluke
it's just the way it is doesn't mean
anything we shouldn't speculate about it
and I respect that there are also people
who think maybe it has something to do
with the human brain you know maybe
there's the math module in our brain and
somehow we invent math and doesn't tell
us really anything about the universe
and the other extreme which I explored a
great length in the book is that
actually this really
does mean something very profound but
really is something quite mathematical
out there about our universe and the
most extreme idea that you'll find in
the book is this one that a universe
isn't just described by math but that it
actually is math that it specifically is
a mathematical structure where I don't
define in the book and in other words it
doesn't just have some mathematical
properties or cosmos but it's
fundamentally only has mathematical
properties and you guys know that you
can often sorry you can often define you
can often define find some simple math
that approximates the more complicated
math just like Newton's theory of
gravity is a good approximation to
Einstein's theory of gravity so if this
is true the way to think about it is
there are these ultimate equations that
describe our universe perfectly that
maybe one of you guys can figure out one
day and all the physics theories we have
so far just the other simpler math
approximating that now this sounds
pretty crazy though to say that our
universe has only mathematical
properties because after all you look
around here it really doesn't look
particularly mathematical and just a
drive home that point I want to
introduce you to mr. huggles here he is
our he lives in our backyard actually I
think he feels a we live in his backyard
because we he moved in before we did he
was very charming young groundhog who
mows our lawn for us and if you ask what
what properties does he have
they don't seem but I would say
properties maybe like cuteness charm
brownness you know her business maybe
affinity for digging they don't sound
like mathematical properties right but
when I look at him as a physicist I
realized that he and everything else in
our universe is made of these elementary
particles like electrons and quarks and
what properties does an electron really
have the only properties an electron
have has our properties like minus 1 and
1/2 1 and we humans have made up geeky
names for these properties like electric
charge and spin and lepton number but
the
turn doesn't care what we call it the
properties are just these numbers
mathematical properties and as far as we
can tell the electron is a purely
mathematical object in the sense it has
no properties at all except mathematical
properties and the same goes for all the
other particles to make up everything in
the world around us as far as we can
tell everything so what about space
itself that contains these particles
what properties this space have it has
the property three we have a geeky name
for that too right the largest number of
pencils that we can put perpendicular to
each other what do we call that the
dimensionality of space right but space
doesn't care again that the property
what we call the property the properties
is this number
Einstein realized that space also has
properties of curve of curvature in
topology which are also just purely
mathematical so if you if you grant the
space itself has only mathematical
properties and the stuff in space has
what mathematical properties also only
it starts to sound a little bit less
ridiculous that maybe everything around
us all of nature has only mathematical
properties and if that's true what does
that mean then well the summarize its it
means that this much larger universe
that's out there than we had anticipated
is much more amenable to understanding
by us than we thought right if it turns
out that they say that it's that there's
still our properties of nature which are
not mathematical then physics will
ultimately be doomed because one day
we'll hit a roadblock when we'll run out
of them a new mathematical regularities
discover right and there'll be stuff
that we haven't been able to figure out
and we'll never be able to figure out on
the other hand if I'm right and about
this and there are oh no non
mathematical properties then it really
is no roadblock so there is no aspect of
the cosmos which is fundamentally
off-limits for smart people like you
guys to try to figure out with the usual
methods of science we don't know which
of the two ways it is but my feeling is
it's a good working hypothesis to assume
that you can figure it out and try your
best because there's no better way to
fail at any project than to convince
yourself as an axiom a priori that it's
impossible you know and therefore not to
try so that's the future of physics I
want to just finish by being back home a
little bit and saying this cosmic
perspective that we've gotten over the
centuries what does it mean for us and
for the future of humanity in the future
of life we've discovered that we have
much more potential obviously for life
than we thought because we're not just
stuck this small planet we have 10 to
the 57 times more volume out there at
our disposal and we also have much more
time in our disposal than we thought
billions and billions of years of future
so so what lies around the corner for us
you guys have all seen books and
speculations about different
possibilities for the future some
optimists point out that there's nothing
in the laws of physics preventing life
from spreading off of our planet and
maybe one day making much of our
universe come alive right but there also
been a lot of more dystopic scenario is
about various creative ways we can use
these same technologies to wipe
ourselves out maybe an accidental
nuclear war or maybe build super
intelligent AI which some people
although some people think it's gonna be
awesome
other people who speculated about that
it could actually destroy both humanity
and everything we care about the only
fair thing to say is we really don't
know there were most many other ways to
in which we can use our technology to
discover up our planet and various ways
so we face this this fork in the road
here and if you take all these risks to
humanity the people talk a lot about and
you just organize them like you did in
the book by how far into the future
they're most likely to be problematic
for us you see something very striking
which is that all the most urgent risks
the threat enough the soonest or risks
that we cannot in any way blame on
Mother Nature can only blame on
ourselves all of these risks here are
caused by us humans so what this means
is if we can actually get our act
together and avoid wiping ourselves out
any time wheel soon we have a much
longer time horizon during which we can
deal with all the other risks and what's
actually very beautiful is it turns out
for each of these other ones they're
already very promising technological
solutions for how to deal with them if
she asked me later I can tell you how to
deal with the problem that the Sun is
gonna make the Pacific Ocean evaporates
in a billion years you can solve that or
what to do with think about the killer
asteroids as long as we can get through
the crunch here in a very very short
term now why is it that the so I yeah as
a professor I have some bad habits which
is and one of them is I'd love giving
grades so I decided to give humanity a
midterm grade for risk management 101
asked some friends what they thought was
a fair grade and some people suggested
maybe like a b-plus because you know
we've done a lot of dumb stuff you know
played some Russian roulette with our
civilization like during this Cuban
Missile Crisis but hey we're still here
it's pretty good maybe a b-plus and
that's it maybe pretty and people argue
a lot about like what is the probability
that we go extinct in any given decade
some people will say maybe it's very
small like a hundredth of a percent some
people think it's higher like 10% huge
uncertainty here but if if you think on
the time scale only 100 years or so this
isn't such a big deal maybe a b-plus I
feel though as the cosmologists if you
take the cosmic perspective that we
actually have billions of years of
potential for awesomeness right then
this is not a b-plus performance if you
keep rolling the dice like this every
decade you're not gonna last a billion
years and it's ridiculously reckless so
be - I say and whenever if I and I'm
known as very lenient grader at MIT
whenever I give a little grade which I
don't very often do people will come
back and come and of course ask me to
justify it though so let me justify this
a little more succinctly why I gave the
d-minus let's just look at these two
guys and ask yourselves who's more
famous i think justin bieber by a
landslide now let me ask you another
question which one of these two people
should we thank for us being all being
alive here today and being able to have
this talk because he single-handedly
stopped a soviet nuclear strike during
the Cuban Missile Crisis was it Vasili
arkhipov or justin bieber I'm just gonna
give you one little hint he was not
Canadian and this I think really
reflects some pretty screwed up
priorities among as humans so d-minus I
say sorry Justin don't take it
personally
why is this well the most common answer
I get for why we humans devote so little
resources and so little attention to
safeguarding our long-term future is
that we just don't have the money we
just can't afford it
but since I and you two were very sort
of numerical people let's look at the
numbers a little bit I talk in the book
about organizations who do a lot of
Awesome work to reduce this kind of
risks the biggest the best funded one in
the US is probably the Union of
Concerned Scientists they get about 20
million in the year that they raise so
if we shrink that 20 million which
sounds like a lot of money into this
tiny set of pixels here okay let's look
at some other stuff that we humans spent
resources on last year cosmetic surgery
air conditioning for US troops smoking
and don't get me wrong I mean I'm all
for personal choice and if my friends
want to light up it's fine by me but it
doesn't seem like the best explanation
for why we can't spend twice as much on
those little guys at the top is because
it's impossible to cut out you know the
tiny little corresponding area from from
some other kind of spending here I'm not
even showing the biggest spending item
of all because it didn't fit on my slide
here so I have to shrink shrink it to
fit the military budget and so I don't
think
it's clearly fact that we don't have
money is clearly not the the main
explanation for this and other
explanation which i think is more
pervasive i hear a lot is that it would
actually be it would just be
irresponsible for us humans to spend
money on risks that aren't proven for
example I often hear saying said that we
it's irresponsible to spend money on
combating global climate change when it
hasn't been proven now just to see the
the logical flaw in that argument I want
you to just imagine for a moment that
you're shopping for a baby carriage for
the baby of a really good friend of
yours okay and and you're in the store
and this smooth salesman comes up and
says hey there's really nice stroller
here for $49.99 we've sold it for over a
decade there have been no reports of any
safety issues whether it's really solid
model but for only $39.99 I can sell you
this and I know I know there have been
some news reports about it sometimes
collapsing and crushing the baby but I
frankly that's been kind of
unsubstantiated these claims and
nobody's ever proven in court that any
of the deaths of these babies were
actually caused by you know
manufacturing flaw but the manufacturer
so it wouldn't it be irresponsible for
you to spend 20% more money on a risk
that isn't proven which one are you
gonna buy and if you are willing to
spend 20% more when the life of one baby
is it as at stake here then by the same
logic obviously we would be happy to
spend 20% more when we're talking about
the lives of all babies not to mention
all future generations ever
during billions of years of cosmic
history so in summary we've we really
need to think big I feel because we're
humans have turned out to be the masters
of underestimation under estimating not
only the size of our cosmos but also the
power of our human minds to understand
our cosmos and through technology to
improve our cosmos so when we face this
choices you know what's going to happen
in the future
I think it's really really important to
understand the way humans have
really great power to improve the world
around us so let's make a difference
thank you
so you've been holding your hand up
patency patiently for a long time so two
points although first
towards your is it worthwhile to spend
money on things that have not been
proven Sagan did something very similar
to that and the point was that the
military spends incredible resources
every year just to project it scenarios
around the world that have not happened
they happen they spend billions of
dollars on how to deal with them so they
already do spend loads and loads and
loads of money on things that aren't
likely to have the rich
I would I would make that same choice
with a baby stroller too but as a
species I think you'll agree with me
that as a species if you look at all
with all of the different risks we face
we certainly not doing that very
consistently right the second I wonder
if you could comment on how the
anthropic principle underlies your
thinking or supports over
the anthropic principle so this brings
us to something we haven't talked about
much about the if it turns to the yeah
let me first just remind everybody what
what it is if we let's just talk about
the most famous example of it we have
this if it turn so if it turns out that
space is actually much bigger than this
in fact the best theory you know we
can't go out here and look and see if
there's more space there of course we
can wait a few billion years and see but
if you right now this is all we really
can see firsthand but the best best
theory we have what made our universe
known as the inflation theory invented
by Alan Guth and Andrei Linde and others
predicts that space is much much bigger
than what we can see here and perhaps
even infinite like the simplest space we
all imagine those kids if space is much
bigger then there'll be all shit might
be a lot of other galaxies far far away
here and if you throw in another
assumption to which might be correct it
might be incorrect namely that's true
there's something to strength recent
string theory research that suggests
that some of these numbers that were on
them on the master number list we we
explored actually orange fundamental
constants that are the same everywhere
in space but they might vary a little
bit from place to place the biggest
suspect we have for this is this number
here the density of dark energy which
has this funny value of about 10 to the
power minus 123 and it's a suppose for a
moment that's true Steven Weinberg wrote
a famous paper decades ago saying that
if that's the case you have more dark
energy in some places less than others
he realized that dark energy is really
toxic for galaxy formation so in places
where you have a lot more more f2 we
have a lot more dark energy than here
you don't make a single galaxy and
probably not a single self-aware entity
either you just stick with the fuse gas
forever in places where you make that
number much smaller you just collapse
everything into a big black hole
so if you then ask okay what value of
dark energy should you expect to find if
you are a random observer on a random
galaxy you can actually predict that you
expect about this much because that's
you have to find something in the small
range that allows there to be observers
okay so some people call this anthropic
reasoning or the entropic principle I
don't like calling it a principle
because it makes it sound somehow
optional even though it's obviously just
using Bayes theorem
you know it's correctly for a sort of
selection effect now if you find that
you are a random person living in the
Sahara Desert as a Bedouin and you've
been living there for quite a while
drinking water you shouldn't be so
surprised if you have happened to be a
known in no ASUS right and and what this
picture is suggesting is in most of
space is very very barren and then there
are these oases where some of these
constants happen to be by coincidence in
exactly the right range for life and
that's where we should work we should
expect to find ourselves this is a very
controversial idea but interestingly if
actually the only explanation really of
any kind
seems that has any traction in the
science community for why this number
has it's really weird value if you make
an ab initio theoretical calculation you
predict that this number should be about
1 this is the biggest failure ever in
science of trying to match up for the
theoretical prediction two data are off
by 123 orders of magnitude and another
suspect number which people are talking
more about now after the recent were
concern is this 1 minus 2 times 10 to
the minus 34 it's a number to do with
the Higgs boson have you changed that by
just a tiny bit so it gets bigger or
smaller you can't have any atoms so if
that number can also vary across the
level two multiverse this big space that
could it might that might also
ultimately be the reason why it is like
this
so if this is true we still have sitting
a single space we're seeing still have
some unique laws of physics it's just
that these numbers aren't hardwired into
the laws of physics they correspond to
different solutions to the same equation
basically and
the old dream of having a t-shirt you
know weather which contains the final
theory of everything that you can walk
around with now these numbers would not
be on the t-shirt anymore you might have
this the equator in a string theory then
you solve them but the just like you're
the number eight which tells us the
number of planets in our solar system
people might have thought that's
something very fundamental about the
universe right when they only knew about
one solar system but now your friends
would make fun of you if you had number
eight there because we know that there
are other solar system those seven
planets and three planets and so on
so the number eight and and this number
there these numbers then instead of
being fundamental they just become part
of our cosmic zip code so to speak if
you're explaining to the intergalactic
mailman where you are in space you would
be like oh I'm in this part of space you
know where the dark energy density is
this and this Higgs mu squared is that
and in that solar system no no not that
one with four planets that one there
with eight planets and he's like oh yeah
now I know where you live all right more
questions so thank you very reverse
isn't just mathematical but is
mathematics in some sense yeah there are
multiple different logically consistent
mathematical systems right you can say
I'll accept the axiom of choice or I won
exactly so does that mean that not you
know in your in your idea does that mean
not just that these numbers might be
locally different but whether or not the
axiom of choice is true might be
something you can experimentally
determine like it's in its empirically
observable but in our universe that
mathematical proposition applies exactly
that's a very very astute question so if
if you go with this business
misanthropic business and the big space
where the constants vary which is known
as the level two multiverse you still
might have equations of string theory is
being like the thing that can go on the
t-shirt but if everything is actually
mathematical it leads you to this idea
of an even bigger multiverse the level
four multiverse which this book also
talks about at the end which is the most
controversial kind and also the most
diverse kind and there is exactly like
this now mathematicians have studied a
whole bunch of different mathematical
structures you know
during einstein's days
you might have thought and maybe the
Ramon the structure we live in as a
so-called 3 plus 1 dimensional
pseudo-riemannian manifold you know
that's the geeky way of saying
Einstein's curved space-time but some
penser field we know that's wrong now
because you also need some hilbert space
some quantum stuff but so there's some
other mathematical structure there which
would correspond to this but there are
plenty of other mathematical structures
with mathematician studies and they
would all have the same status and if
you find that in the sentence they would
correspond the real universe is the so
if if if you're a string theorist you
know and you get really disappointed but
you make some experiments in string
theory isn't describing this you could
say well ok at least it's described at
least I can get the Nobel Prize
somewhere else than the level 4
multiverse where it's also interesting -
it's just worth making making the
distinction between you know mathematics
is a language where we just invent stuff
and and the structures of mathematics
for example Plato he was very
interesting how many different regular
3d shapes there were with flat faces the
so-called Platonic solids and he found
that there are the five of them that you
know the tetrahedron the cube the
octahedron the dodecahedron and the
icosahedron and we can invent whatever
names we want for these things we could
instead of saying the cube we could call
the shmoop or instead of saying that the
dodecahedron has 12 faces we could write
the 12 with Roman numerals that I've
Latin the ones we use but we can't
invent the six photonic solid it just
doesn't exist so in that sense there's
some aspects these mathematical
structures which are just out there much
in the same way that we didn't you know
invent the planet Neptune we discovered
it so you can you can actually think
about writing a really advanced computer
program that just maps out ultimately
all the mathematical structures that
there are and then you can start looking
in this atlas of all structures and say
well which one might we be living in and
you can say well those over here clearly
don't work it couldn't be this they have
the wrong number of dimensions and oh it
can't be there but this neighborhood
here looks kind of promised
and then see if you can narrow down
where we live and if so if it is the way
you say then ultimately this t-shirt
which has the ultimate description of
everything is just a black t-shirt that
says nothing upon it because everything
even the Stevens string theory is just
part of our address saying where you are
in this bigger reality ok let's see if
you have any questions for in the back
your turn has been put forward about
reality and versus simulation and how if
people are writing computer programs to
define some kind of artificial reality
you know they'll use a set of
mathematical structures and they'll be
able to define it to a certain level of
detail after which point they have to
approximate things or they have to think
about like what the viewpoint yeah
server is so like if you're in a
computer game you know you don't get to
see everywhere in that you know
alternate reality exactly once it's only
when you like look at a particular thing
where the first-person shooter is
exactly that the pixels and polygons are
rendered to show you what you're looking
at as people have said well because the
universe might be based upon a whole set
of mathematical constructs but yet we
get down to a point with quantum
mechanics where things become
statistical and fuzzy and it's only when
we actually train our view on those
things that they come into being in a
more yea specific reality
yeah he'll what do you also that yeah
you raised a number of interesting
points there to to in specific I think
it should comment on first of all but by
by making the analogy with the computer
games that that highlights that
highlights two really important things
about physics the first is that if you
make it an artificial reality in a
computer game right there is no
particular reason why any one character
should have access to the whole the
whole thing right
so that suggests that we humans should
probably be a little bit modest too you
know many people think well we should it
seemed to take as an axiom that there
cannot be any more stuff than a I'll
beyond our universe but that's kind of
like an ostrich with its head in the
sand saying if I can't see it it can't
be there
I mean in a computer game there's no
reason why any character should have
access to everything and there's some
stuff that exists and then there's some
maximum amount of stuff we can learn
about and that might just be the way it
is we have to be open to there the other
that can be more it's the second point
you raise which is very interesting is
the business you said about
approximations and I think we have to be
very open-minded as physicists and not
conflate can are convenient
approximations where the truth for
example in nature like when I teach the
physics course at MIT everything of
course I ideal will always involve the
infinity infinity the continuum you
mentioned the axiom of choice for the
real numbers and stuff like that super
convenient to do that however if you
really have a true spatial continuum
with infinitely many points then even to
just to specify the length of this ten
of the sharpie I need to specify an
infinite number of bits of information
right this number of centimeters might
be thirteen point four seven eight five
five going on forever right but you know
as a computer programmer that you can
simulate all of the known physics here
in just a finite computer with a finite
amount of information so how do we are
we really sure that the infinite is
really there and and then this gets even
more poignant if you if you acknowledge
the fact that we've never measured
anything in physics to better than 17
decimal places
it's pretty far cry from infinitely many
decimal places right and as you we have
a very good reason to believe it doesn't
even make sense to talk about distance
is shorter than 10 to the minus 34
meters the Planck length and moreover
when we do the most hardcore physics
simulations whether it be you know
trying to predict why when we tried to
predict the other day that we were gonna
get a foot of snow in Boston while May
and I were here which actually happened
then we put in what do we do we don't
use infinite information we just put in
pressures and temperatures of air and
then big the street grid do some
supercomputer time on a blue gene and we
get the right answer when we can we do
really advanced particle physics or
calculations and try to figure out what
lattice QCD why the proton is 1836 times
heavier than electron we do with all the
finite math again right so if we humans
can actually do physics with a fight
without infinity or without the
continuum
I bet nature can - and I think one of
the things worth really exploring
seriously when we try to unify quantum
mechanics with gravity is to see if
there is some finite math which can
actually approximate things well because
we mean many of the problems that are
really embarrassing right now in
cosmology have to do with infinity in
fact from the hypothesis for example
that you can take space and stretch it
out infinitely many times without
anything weird happening and we even
know that the fact that you can hear me
now because of sound waves right can be
very accurately described by assuming
the infinite continuum there's an
infinite number of points where you can
define the pressure of the air you can
write down the wave equation it's very
easy and beautiful and it's also wrong
because if the air is made of atoms why
are we still doing the infinity business
because it's much easier to make that
approximation than to keep track of 10
to the 26 atoms so so I think the
computer atom analogy is actually very
very deep and providing some maybe some
really will provide them is the really
crucial hints for future physics ok way
in the back
demonite says all the physics theory
that we observe is expressive of
mathematics so essentially our universe
is being governed by the present
especially here basic communites a
mathematical universe
there was a statement there that he said
everything seems to be governed my math
but I didn't quite understand what the
question was it sounds like the issue is
what it's very important to not conflate
the description of something with that
which is described right a lot of people
will agree that our universe is at least
approximately described by math but
that's different from saying it is math
and and this is very related to the
business of conceiving in math not
confusing the language of mathematics
with the structure of mathematics right
so and we talked already about this list
the latter part there how we can event
whatever notation we want whatever words
you want for the cube and the
dodecahedron that we invent but we don't
invent the dodecahedron itself for the
fact that there are five platonic solids
any more than we invent the fact that
there are six kind of quarks in physics
and if billy-boy whether whether it
makes sense to talk about to say that it
you know
suppose the word no quantum mechanics to
keep things simple an Einstein theory of
general relativity was a final word on
physics but then we could say our
universe is perfectly described not just
approximately by AB pseudo-riemannian
three plus one dimensional manifold with
some tensor field obeying certain
equations now that means it's isomorphic
the mathematical structure to the
physical universe for everything in the
math every object in the mathematical
structure that corresponds to something
in the physical world you know but to a
mathematician if you have two isomorphic
mathematical structures they're one in
the same I mean the physical universe
then obeys all the axioms at the
mathematical structure would and there's
no meaningful way of saying it's
different if you want to insist it's
nonetheless the physical world is
somehow different than the mathematical
one even though that it's perfectly
described by math then you would have to
say that well our universe in addition
to having all these mathematical
properties which are described by
Einstein's theory
it also has some other properties that
are not mathematical but that have no
observable effect at all right that's
why it can still be perfectly described
by by Einstein that's a tenable position
but it's I think it's a pretty
embarrassing position that would make
people like Karl Popper or Turner to
turn it over in their grave because you
know I'm saying that the only difference
between my theory and saying that it is
math is these extra bells and whistles
the properties that nature has but have
absolutely no observational consequences
at all so that's a range of
possibilities you have to remember I'm
not claiming this is the way it is in
the book I think it's just a very
interesting to explore the whole range
of possibilities and the possibility
that it really is all mathematical is
clearly the most extreme end of that
spectrum on one side yes assume a larger
definition in the last thousand years
absolutely no mitten many people feel
free you think your math is basically a
bag of tricks for manipulating numbers
or or maybe as a sadistic form of
torture invented by schoolteachers to
destroy our self-confidence right but
mathematics is clearly broadened that
dramatically if you look at a modern
math book it normally doesn't even
contain any numbers at all except for
the page numbers it might be very much
about abstract geometric entities or
certain kinds of calabria manifolds or
whatnot and the modern formulas
definition of mathematics is simply as
destroy the study of mathematical
structures and the kind of things you
can define a completely independent of
any human language there's purely
abstract elements and in relations
between them so it's in that broad sense
we're talking about it when we say that
our universe is described by master or
is a mathematical structure and it's not
just math that's got more broad which
you very correctly point out but physics
too right if you think about what what
did people consider physics 2,000 years
ago well the very limited things they
could describe like Archimedes figured
out how how you would how catapults
would throw stone in certain orbit
and stuff they didn't think he had any
shot at explaining the motion of
explaining the behavior of light for
instance then we got Maxwell's equations
and by that time they still didn't think
we could ever figure out know why some
things are like soft and other things
are hard then we got the Schrodinger
equation which explained atoms and all
the properties of matter so in the same
way you know the domain of physics is
also expanded cover more and more and
more and maybe it can ultimately even
expand to help us understand everything
we don't understand no see yes I
wouldn't offer such a but now all of
this work with word or top of
mathematics but you hit a pet peeve
okay bring on at the very end when
strollers in the class yes you were
talking about the $40 stroller costing
20 percent less than the $50 stroller
that doesn't beam a $50 stroller it cost
20 percent wouldn't please 25 percent
okay I agree with that I would still buy
the more expensive one any more
questions
yes well then no other questions I'd
love to know what your thoughts are on
down
the TV show or the theory what do you
think well it's a mathematical theory
huh so what came before good so you know
that's a very good question what do we
know and what don't we know I I make you
I put great I go to great efforts in the
book to really this thing is between
what if you feel we know and what I feel
we don't know and it's cool because
throughout human history there's always
been a front some stuff we knew like
what's going on nearby and in the recent
past and there's been a frontier of our
knowledge right and well what's really
happened dramatically in recent years is
we pushed that frontier farther back in
time Newton could figure out a lot about
what happened you know where the planets
were a hundred years earlier he was in
his laws of motion but he had no idea
where the planets came from how they
were made or for that matter how the
atoms were made
now we have a great explanation of how
the planets remained gravity took gas
and squished it together to make a
planets and we know that the atoms were
made by inside and by fusion reactions
inside of stars except for the helium
that was made when the whole universe
was a giant fusion reactor during its
first few minutes all the stuff we have
very good and solid evidence for but
there's now the fronteira ignorance I
would say it's about at the first second
we have very good data we have when you
go farther back in time before that it
starts getting more speculative that
doesn't stop people from speculating of
course and there is a very successful
theory called inflation that I mentioned
briefly for what happened much much
earlier which holds that and it's this
the most popular theory in the physics
community right now for what to put the
bang into our Big Bang it says that you
start you with a tiny speck of stuff
which has a really weird property that
it doesn't dilute much when you expand
it so it has almost the same density as
it did before so you put it into twice
the volume and it weighs twice as much
and that has the effect that turns out
when you plug it into einstein's gravity
theory that you just keep doubling and
doubling and doubling and doubling and
doubling at regular intervals which very
rapidly takes 50 puny and makes it huge
faster than all of space explains why
things are flying apart like this and
remarkably it also explains in great
detail all these wonderful things you're
measured here for example it explains
why we see these funny spots and
patterns why our universe isn't just
uniform and boring like the air in this
room but why it was a little bit clumpy
it says that there was there were
quantum fluctuations with the Heisenberg
uncertainty or quantum mechanics insist
on said you can't have something totally
uniform on on tiny tiny scales but then
it took these tiny scales to stress them
out to be longer and wider than galaxies
so it gives us dramatic and crazy
sounding explanation that the ultimate
origin of all the fluctuations made our
galaxies had to do with with the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle of
quantum mechanics all that stuff
it's beautifully with with what we see
that of course does not prove that this
is actually what happened though right
there is one more prediction which is
the most dramatic of all which if we're
really lucky is going to be confirmed
later this year or whether the next few
years and edit if that smoking gun
evidence is found then I think there
will be a Nobel Prize for Alan Guth and
Andrei Linde for this theory and what
what this prediction is is that this
very violent doubling process it was so
violent that actually that Hawking
radiation fluctuations and the very
fabric of space-time during this time
made them so called gravitational waves
there are sort of rippling in the fabric
of space of a very long wavelength from
parable to the size of our universe
which should be around still today okay
and with the amazing thing is to find
those you don't have to build some kind
of crazy detector the size of our
universe all you have to do is you have
to look at something really far away
like like to make your background and
see if the images look distorted because
if you look at me while a powerful
gravitational wave flies through Redmond
Washington you'll soon restore Brooklyn
right because the light rays from me
bend as they go to you huh exactly if
you look at let me Roger you're driving
down the road and you think there's
water there it's a similar idea and they
get distorted and very certain was in a
very special way that you can detect if
you look at the polarized microwaves
which turns out to be much harder the
plunk stab light is going to release
it's polarized Maps in October this year
and there's a bunch of other experiments
racing to scoop them all so if this
happens I think for the first time we'll
have really good evidence that we've
pushed the frontier of ignorance back
from the first second to the first 10 to
the minus 34 seconds which will be this
incredibly dramatic
that still doesn't not mean that we know
what happened before that and then it
gets even more mysterious but this is a
really exciting thing I would that I'm
very much looking forward to seeing how
it how it shakes down
any more questions how much time do we
have anyway you were the bosses back
there
