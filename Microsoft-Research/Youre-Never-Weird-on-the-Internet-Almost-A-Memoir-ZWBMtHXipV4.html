internet almost her YouTube channel geek
and sundry has over 1 million
subscribers and over 200 million views
and there is so much more which I'll let
Marcie and Felicia take from here please
join me in giving them a very warm
welcome
I feel like we're in the belly of the
internet beast I know this wild thanks
everyone yeah oh I hope all of you are
supposed to be working you're welcome
and then all the ones on watching online
when they're supposed to be developing
so I have we're doing whatever you do Oh
sitting here it is hard to remember a
time when there wasn't a cloud and an
internet and streaming and we were
talking about this over lunch the fact
that you know it's not that long ago
that you're really excited when you got
gopher and you could find a library in
Serbia and like not understand anything
this was before your time but I never
found it yet but I do um but I wanted
you to start out at the very beginning
about that that first discovery of the
internet yeah is so weird in writing my
book that I discovered that my life you
know being my age I have grown up with
the evolution of the Internet what feels
like although post Serbian libraries on
doepfer bet I never really had a time
where I didn't know that I could reach
out to somebody through a computer to
connect with them and I think that's
kind of a generational thing that I grew
up with and I'm the first and everyone
subsequently will be able to do that so
I mean I I even when I was doing the
audiobook I was like oh I get to do a
bob you know a modem dial-up it okay
it's my favorite thing I'm like no let
me do it again I think I can make it
better and it's just amazing how far
we've come in this world where we are
never not connected and we never have
this idea that we can't be who we are
which I think it's a very freeing thing
that the technology has given us but you
you were this little kind of
homeschooled Alabama girl but you say by
hippyish parents yes this is a
distinction so it's you and your brother
and I got the sense from this book that
there really wasn't a whole lot of like
live human interaction beyond this
family unit no
I know I grew up in a bubble of oddity
and I mean I think that's definitely
served me well in life I wouldn't be
here if I had not grown up weird and
that's kind of what I say in the book
but also I mean there's some downsides
to it in being incredibly self-conscious
especially at parties and that's when
I'm relieved when someone it can talk
about fallout I'm like oh thank god
somebody I could talk to here so yeah it
was definitely a situation where I get
to pursue the things that interested me
regardless of other people's judgment
and I think that definitely allowed me
to pursue things like mathematics and
video games and technology in a way that
I don't think would have been reinforced
as cool or something that I should have
been attracted to if I were a normal
environment was it your brother who
introduced you to video games no it was
my mother actually she played in fuckin
games I don't know anybody in for come
in the house yeah Zork yeah she played
let her jaws got us a Phobos which was
like an adult it was an adult version of
I didn't know that but she would play
that I would sit in her lap because my
grandfather was a nuclear physicist and
he gave us his cast off laptop which was
essentially as big as this chair I even
have a picture of what I approximated
what it looked like what I remember and
literally it's this big and the screen
is here and I was like oh oh my god it's
you know it's so real so it's so I mean
in just in 30 years my god it's that
come so far but yeah that was how I got
introduced to them and then my brother
and I got an Amiga which I don't know if
anybody remembers that it was like a
yeah I know god this is great we should
have a club and we play video games on
that all the time but this is not the
only thing that Felicia did you actually
were in drama you I think danced for a
little while I'm not sure I deserve I
mean you know three hours a day I went
to class because that was I got out of
the house I was attractive to me yeah
and and your musician yeah I play the
violin and I played mostly to boredom I
mean I would just know I would read
voraciously and we would play video
games there was still more day to fill
up so I play the violin and I really
loved it and I played quite a bit which
adventure
got me a scholarship to college so you
guys are getting the impression academic
school work where did that fit into all
of this because I not a lot no I mean I
self-taught myself like ah my mom always
had text books we go to the textbook
store and just kind of read and pick up
whatever we wanted but there was no
formal structure to it I never took a
test before the s80 you know I never was
measured in any way I just love learning
and and I loved reading and I would just
read what i wanted i was never I never
tripped as train for a test at all and
is really weird to think about I never
had homework I mean I'm sorry children
in front of me I've got a stem stink eye
right here I'm sorry I just basically
did whatever I wanted I slept in every
day and I just ice I'm gonna just grind
it in there I mean but I just loved
learning so much and I just learned at
the same at the pace that I would want
to so I was bad and in some respects
like especially in like chemistry and
and history I was not as well versus I
should have been but in mathematics and
reading and literature and other things
I really interests me i just read as far
as I could so you got the scholarship to
the University of Texas you were 16 I
was 15 and I was in a lesson one day and
I studied with a professor there because
my mom raised me to be a princess I
don't know I was like I was tutored by
some people in areas like violin and
math and one day he was like what are
you doing next year and I was like I
don't know i'm really bored he's like
just come to college and somehow i don't
i actually wrote this in the book like I
don't have a GED which I didn't realize
until his writing I actually don't have
one so I have a college degree but no
high school no high school degree so i
don't know if that I just qualifies me
some out I'm afraid someone's gonna call
up and be like well you're not you don't
have a college degree anymore sorry I
don't think they take them back after
your I really hope not i was really hard
for that I don't think so but you you
were the girl that you described is this
not only a math and musical prodigy but
you're like super driven you're like
beyond obsessive I mean I wouldn't say
prodigy I just worked really hard i have
the time to devote to the things that
were interesting to me and i think
that's really the key to anything just
devoting time to something
in your life that gives you that sort of
fulfilling sense of I wouldn't it's more
and I want to build to something bigger
than just do this for an hour dropping
huh that sounds really nice when you say
it like that that's not how you wrote it
well I mean I'm i hope i didn't brag
doubt much now no yeah you made you you
were obsessed with being perfect oh no
i'm obsessed with being part yes that
part i think the most important actually
seeing in my book is when i tell
children close your eyes because i'm not
telling you don't get good grades but it
one of the stories in that College
chapter is how I was obsessed with my
GPA I wanted to be so good and really in
the end I think had I just gotten a
couple b's and learned how to not be
perfect it would have been easier on me
later in life because that perfection
it's kind of like they say like you can
get ninety percent of where you want in
your weight but pretty pretty well but
that last ten percent of trying to get
that much skinnier is I ninety percent
of the work is it really that worth it
to work about ten percent and then take
away from the other things that could
have enriched me like doing more theatre
or just spending more time with friends
and and quality of life things but you
know again it did not I'm not telling
anybody to get bad grades because I
don't want any parents mad at me see
that one but I uh uh let's see you're
never weird on the internet you were
weird in college oh yeah I mean I never
knew I was weird I really until I got
too high really cuz college the way you
program your life you get to be who you
are a little bit more so I think in
college you're freer to be you know the
thing you want to be because you cobble
together that your interests you're
working toward degree but you can also
take electives and believe me I took
like twenty two hours a semester just
because I'm like oh shiny but uh you
know I think that you know in life when
I moved to Hollywood to try to be like
hey I'm gonna be you know famous in a
second like you you you get a wake-up
call because especially that business is
very much on your physical appearance
and not who you feel like you are on the
inside and then you get self-conscious
about who you are like hey maybe they're
right maybe I am this person they they
are saying I should be and that's where
I really you know starting to struggle a
little bit well it's interesting so you
you have this double major math and
music and then how long did it take you
to say goodbye to both of those things
and go
to LA oh no it's always a plan it was
rappin completely rational I mean
unqualified in every way like I i got my
degrees because my dad was like you have
to have a degree in something reliable
before you try this acting thing because
and I realize in retrospect like it's
because theatre was a place where I felt
like I belonged and I connected with
people and that sense of belonging is
something I think is so important and
something I didn't have in my day-to-day
life because I was home-schooled so
theater gave me that that joy of like
hey we're hanging out with people even
though I'm the fist can-can girl from
the left you know I'm not the star but I
love putting on a show or just working
with other people towards a goal that's
probably why I like rating in World of
Warcraft so much for like taking down
the boss or like taking down you know
Oklahoma together yeah where the Sun
just out there in the sky yeah um while
you were doing this obsessive grade
pursuit in austin texas what role did
the online gaming and and the whole
internet play in for you well really
during college is when i discovered the
internet which is like I don't know this
was like 95 or something when i first
started college I was like oh my god
where do I go this all the Vista what
what where do I go from here and slowly
but surely like I kind of kindled that
love of connected with people on usenet
and with my own horrible website I made
and yeah and making terrible Photoshop
which I have pictures of in the book and
and really you know being obsessed with
Diablo number one which I had an Amazon
called booty call who I was very
advanced in Louisville that was the one
thing that threatened my GPA Diablo
so I did play online games but the hablo
isn't like the kind that you join a
guild you know that's not the kind of
game it is it's a little bit decimal
more separate or at least was back then
so it really was until I talk about in
the book puzzle pirates in World of
Warcraft where I like had a social group
where I would log on every day play
together and that was really when MMOs
became a thing and that's why I became
obsessed with him you became addicted
yeah I was definitely I mean I guess
yeah definitely I would draw your word
not know I did okay all right I'm braggy
and addicted I guess I yes I would wake
up in the morning on a play I mean my
brother invited me to play when the vert
getting first started and I would play
at night with him which was very healthy
and awesome and actually led to us
having a better relationship and I had
friends online and then slowly but
surely as my acting career it literally
just was like this is it you're gonna
work a couple dips the days a month and
then nothing else and it was I just
didn't know how to get ahead because
it's not a merit-based world it just
isn't it's a very appearance based not
merit-based world and it a lot of luck
and not to denigrate it that's just the
parameters but being from a very
academic background I didn't know how to
get ahead really except by like trying
to change myself which I started doing I
was unhappy with that so therefore that
equaled become the best warlock i can
because effort equals reward i'll have
to well you talk about that community
that you'd found doing theatre you
didn't really find that now lay you
found that in these games yeah because
la is really i mean i did some plays and
i did improv which was the closest I
came to having a family there but really
there is a sense of satisfying of be
able to log on every day and see the
same people it just feels very
comforting knowing that you have a place
where you feel like belong and you're
doing stuff together like I mean I love
I wish we could do something really
useful with a gameplay like that like
really change you know something on in
the real life by rating let's figure
this out guys cuz it's important because
I would rate every night I'm doing good
for people we're building a house some
it's like Habitat for Humanity in a VR
world
oh my god i would do that every day but
yeah it was something that felt good in
that I was unhappy with my real life and
I just kept piling it on because instead
of really dealing with the things
underneath that I was unhappy with I
decided to just read more and so
actually the guild came out of it almost
as like the result of of you're trying
to beat addiction right yeah absolutely
i joined us support and i talked about
this in my book that you know the reason
I'm here today is because a couple of
people can't got together and was like
hey you want to join the support group
which sounds terrible and it's like Oh
embarrassing but it was really what
lovely to have a group to be accountable
to in a creative world to show up every
week and not be able to prove myself to
the group and show progress when they
did and that's really what almost shamed
me or frighten me into stopping playing
as much because I saw them then
progressing out of the support that we
were lending each other and me not
because I was kind of tying my hat I was
putting my hat on the the wrong hat rack
so to speak with the with the long hours
and the week so these were were people
who were writers they were people who
had projects writers directors actors
they were all people who are creatively
frustrated in in Hollywood and wanted to
proceed together and you know when
people ask me how do i how do I become a
writer how to become a creator like to
me you can ever do anything alone even
if you're a writer which is a very
solitary act the idea of showing up and
being accountable not only to yourself
the two other people who are close to
you is so it makes it feel less alone
when you're suffering because when
you're suffering alone you feel like
it's all me I'm the failure I'm the one
who rationally can't get over this
roadblock but when you hear other people
talk about it and that's why I talk
about you know in my book depression
anxiety like you know if you're not
feeling alone you're already on the step
to healing which i think is really
important well you are actually very
depressed when you join this group
absolutely the guild online yeah no I
didn't I don't think I realized that and
then when i joined the chicken which was
the group i know it's a terrible it's
just this is that lady and they actually
SAT together in in the annulus basement
this is not a nominal group and it was
it was me not realizing how unhappy I
was I was operating from unhappiness and
I think it's funny how you can go
through life being so anxious so unhappy
but not have the physical know how to
acknowledge your what your brain is
trying to tell you you just absorb it as
truth but really it's not necessarily
true that your brain either just
basically telling you hey pay attention
to me take care of me in a way sometimes
so how many of you first saw Felicia
when the guild went online right most of
you raising hands yeah I like to do that
yeah they would take notes um talk about
about that that came right out of the
chicken right yeah I decided I'm going
to prove myself I'm not gonna show up
and tell them i rated you know molten
core again I'm going to come over come
this and I'm going to finish the
screenplay by the end of the year and it
was a very hard process which I talk
about in the book of how hard it was for
me creatively to get over that hump and
I do i do think it was part and parcel
with being a perfectionist being a
perfectionist was a very it was
something that I in retrospect feel like
really kept me back a lot because you
have to experiment like you guys know
but you have to beta test in a way
you're not going to create this perfect
you know object this Holy Grail or
something just from your brain it's not
going to emerge fully formed and perfect
nothing will you know it might be a
happy accident once in a blue moon but
we always look at the lottery to set our
bar but it's not it's really the
day-to-day work that you have to show up
to to build something and refine it and
refine it to make it something that you
can be proud of and that's what I didn't
have the bravery or the know how to do
well even after you join this support
group that you were so embarrassed about
joining and I mean really almost felt
like you were going incognito to the hit
diner um it still was several months
before you you've produced anything yeah
absolutely it was months and months so
what kicked your butt and got me to do
something I just had this panic attack
and I had them a lot but this one was a
doozy and I just realized i was going to
die one day and i needed to do something
that I was really proud of just for
myself it wasn't the external stuff the
the career the people wanting to hear me
like that was not what motivated me what
motivated me was I
to make an imprint on the world in a way
that makes me feel meaning before or I'm
going to die ahus can it be you know it
was Tara you know I really did I was
very afraid and I think that fear was
what the only thing that could get me
over that hump of getting over myself of
messing up being a being willing to fail
for trying so I love how the guild
started because if there ever was a DIY
video show this this is it oh yeah I
talk about hunting for trash and just
borrowing cameras and you know just like
the weirdest oh look it's wallpaper now
it's a painting you know I mean that's
literally how the gill got made and you
know it was it was a labor of love and I
think through the process of filmmaking
which was kind of like rating which is
kind of like making a play which is kind
of like playing in an orchestra we were
all together adding our unique vision to
get and making a project together and
that really is something I love and that
was what it was introduced me in being
you know cobbling together a film shoot
on like a thousand dollars or something
this money was that at the be was me and
the director in my producer Kim's we
just pitched in and we're like let's
make something in our garages not
thinking we had any end result except
maybe having some his show people later
to be like hey we made this and look how
wonderful descript is making a TV show
but really the minute we uploaded it to
the Internet and saw how people
interacted with it and and had people
even respond like hey I hate you I mean
even that was like oh they saw it
well you just have a little bit of luck
in that YouTube stuck it on his homepage
yeah you know there was a lot of and I
actually may put this together in a
talks that I did a couple days ago that
I love being in the tech world because
tech is based on innovation the bar to a
succeeding and innovating is thinking
about something nobody did before and
the Hollywood I love the things it makes
but the paradigm of Hollywood is not
doing that it's too risky to do that
thing and really innovate and therefore
innovative ideas are not rewarded the
way they are in tech and that's why I
love being on the web or whatever
platform it is that is technical because
they're so much more open to creativity
within their technology which people
don't actually give credit to as much in
tech so I mean that is a that's
definitely a testament to you know being
featured was YouTube not necessarily now
they don't really do this but they
curated the page of things they thought
were cool and just like the guild
succeeded and got to a whole new
platform by feature being featured by
xbox and being on the on the dashboard
because really you can make a lot of
things but unless you get the visibility
especially in the scoreboard we're so
saturated with creativity it's very hard
to break through and I was I've been
lucky many times in my life and my
career to be bolstered and basically
mentored by by tech companies some I'm
curious you have this creative need it
was a drive you had to make something
cuz you didn't want to die a husk and
leave as us I love that um but going
forward because you were sort of
producing and then you put the paypal
button up and people for kickstarter
yeah I was like I guess is my I don't
know somebody suggested he had no idea
that I would donate I mean it was crazy
did you have you know people make got
five year plans 10-year plan to give
like a five-day plan even I don't have
applied palladium today no I got a panic
attack last night last night I was like
your book tour is over tomorrow what are
you gonna do next you have nothing I
mean like
I know you let your feeling on your face
is like you're crazy well yeah but I
mean I think that that need to sort all
ways be creating i think is a good i
mean it's good its destructive and it
can leave me spiraling down or upward
and really it's the audience the
supportive audience that keeps me going
like I you know people ask me do you
have a marketing background or PR like
what is your angle and I'm like I don't
have an angle I just think like am I a
random person who likes my work what do
I want to see next that's literally the
baseline how does how do I make it easy
for a random person who likes what I do
to get what they like and get it easily
wherever they are I mean that's really
been the whole modest operandi of my
crew you know Swami career which is not
Swami at all but you also act in other
people's things and I'm curious what
what besides the fact that they pay you
and you pay yourself to make stuff what
do you get that's different if you're
going to adjust if you're in Buffy as
opposed to being in the guild well you
get a platform like I said like I mean
you know the project word a guild I mean
really that's you reach a lot more
audience and I think it's you know
something that tech companies you know
give away very you know I miss the days
when there were those slots for the
curation versus just the advertisement
because you know the ability of tech
companies to champion creativity is
there and I think in the need to
monetize you give the keys over just to
Hollywood but that means you're only
going to get the things that Hollywood
approves which are not necessarily
innovative which I think pairs better
with audience on tech platforms such as
my opinion but you know I'll i also love
to show up to a set not worry if craft
services there or like you don't know
we're going over time we have to pay the
crew we don't have the time we got to
wrap it up you know and and also you
know the dollars are not there yet to
have the infrastructure of a television
show like supernatural I worked on for
four seasons I loved showing up and just
being another character but also the
fact that 300 people are on that crew
and we're going to make that volume of
content you know they make 22 episodes
of season 12 hours of content and
everybody's a specialist and be able to
have that volume you have to have the
soundstages you have to have the people
who are qualified to be able to pay them
there
right and you know we're not there yet
we're seeing you know Netflix and Amazon
and all these other places kind of be
contenders like that but it's you know
even Inc it gets under way we have very
polished content but it costs a tenth of
what a TV show costs and that's just you
know until the dollars which are mostly
advertising dollars go to reward those
more niche contents than work this is
where we're at and we can just push the
envelope as much as we can that question
of monetizing Internet content goes
beyond entertainment and journalism is
also thinking about that as well where
do you think that I mean not all of us
can just put a Kickstarter or PayPal
button up so where do you think
ultimately that money will come from if
it will I mean I think the gatekeepers
control the money and if you want to
make a television show it's probably
going to go through traditional
television unless you're making
something really low budget like
community access or something like the
guild was made on very reasonable funds
and that was an outlier obviously but
it's not the only person who can do that
and I I think it's really interesting
you know as audiences spread over a lot
more kinds of content you know it's
definitely a struggle kind of akin to
the music business whether how do you
how do you justify spending three
million dollars on an hour of content
when a vlogger in their garage is making
getting more views and I think it's a
struggle that in the end will lift up
personality as a legitimate business
kind of like the vlogger and the
internet personality things but at the
same time you'll have more experiment
and more experimentation with other
platforms making television like content
because really just because it's on one
platform does it mean some another my
experience with the guild is that the
guild found new audience wherever it
went even like Hulu three years after it
was released i would get new fans from
every platform and as people see that
their investment in content has a long
tail to it unlike the quicker and
dirtier stuff I think emphasis will come
back around to that kind of stuff
hopefully because that's the stuff
that's what I like to make things that
will last a long time versus more media
that's just my temperature would you
ever sell it to anybody the guild yeah
look or your geek and sundry oh it's so
it's old well there you go
um you own none of it I don't own it but
i am the creative ahead of it and i have
quite a lot of creative control i sold
the company so YouTube invested in like
a hundred startups and a lot of them
didn't succeed that some did and mine
was one of them and I got bought by
legendary which is a very especially for
Hollywood standards very innovative very
geek friendly and allows me to do what I
want because they know that I know my
audience which I think makes them very
unique in the space to really trust the
audience to kind of lead content
especially in the digital world so and
you know it's very hard to be
independent and scale bigger I mean
really that's really the key like one
person in their garage can make can make
an impact but can they sustain you know
leveling up so to speak and that's
really when I talk about my anxiety
depression is going through that
adjustment of being not just in front of
the camera about behind it on multiple
levels and trying to scale instantly
without infrastructure was very very
very challenging and you know it goes to
show that just like supernatural has 300
people on it in order to scale the
infrastructure you do have to have a
bigger team in order to make consistent
content over years which I would love
you know I still want to be making
content even in front of the camera or
behind it in five to ten years and you
really do have to have that patron you
know to be able to support that so yeah
you're never weird on the internet
almost are you yourself when you're when
you're online or is there an online
Felicia and and this is the performative
Felicia I mean I think that um I
definitely swear less in my tweets than
I do in person but other than that I
actually I'm very proud of trying to
just be me and I think that's the heart
of the book like I am literally Who I am
here and I actually fight to show my
warts because i think that the
deification of personality doesn't help
anybody in trying to attain their own
goals and it's not about me you know
especially creativity is not about the
person who's creating it it's about how
you affect other people and if I can
bust down stereotypes and show people
that they should be proud to say they're
a gamer and connect with people
and like the things they like like we
should never round the corners of our
authentic selves because we're selling
ourselves short and anytime anyone tries
to shame you know shame me or tell me I
should be different or I should be doing
this I always go back to my gut and I
know that I'm doing the right thing
whether it's for out some of it might
not be the right thing for someone else
but it's the right thing for me so and
that's what I try to be online you know
I treat it like my own I am if I would
delight my brother with it i will
hopefully delight the world with it and
that doesn't please everybody but that's
the digital world you don't have to
please everybody you just have to please
the people who you feel supported of and
I think that's the beautiful thing about
the Internet and that's the the nice
side I can't end this and open it up
unless I ask you about gamergate because
there's while there are a lot of women
sitting in this room the world of gaming
went through a really horrible episode
long episode you a lot of these things
happen to you although you were
relatively quiet publicly on that
particular subject so in that sense of
shaming and daxing and and misogyny and
animosity are we coming out on the other
side from your point of view or it
doesn't still continue you know I mean I
think when you have anonymity like the
beautiful thing about the Internet is
that you can feel like you belong no
matter what you believe and that is the
dark side to that people can feel like
oh this attitude is acceptable because a
thousand people in this chat room or
this forum think that's cool and you
know I think gamergate labeling all
hatred online online and misogyny and
all those things just to one label is
not accurate like I talked to my book
about you know I'm sure we all remember
those means of like gamer girl like that
you know that gamer girl meme that went
around for years about sort of linda's
testing women especially who were
finding a voice in a world that was not
necessarily represent they were not
represented and I think when you see
somebody expressing enthusiasm about
something regardless of their gender or
anything and you slap them and say oh
you're not good enough for me that makes
me so angry and I think that's you know
that route and you know all those uh I
saw that for years and I
a couple of experiences i had toward it
that i never really recounted how much
they deeply affected me that I felt like
I belonged to gaming and in fact I these
people were telling I didn't and such a
small minority but you know on the
internet you can feel like you're being
mobbed by dirty people telling you
you're horrible so I would not attribute
you know everything to that label I
think that was a horrible incident that
just kind of showed that there there
were some people who were very unhappy
and decided to join forces and do it and
it felt like it ruled gaming in a way
that it does not because gaming to me is
beautiful it's a thing that brings
people together it's an art form and
it's something I'd rather do my with my
time than any consume any other kind of
media so the fact that in a broader
sense all of gaming is painted with that
is something I want to stand up to
against but you know just ignoring it
and pretending like it didn't go didn't
happen is not the case because you want
to strengthen people to be able to stand
up against that if it happens again to
them on a small scale or a large so I do
believe that gaming is improved in a
sense that so that more voices are
standing up against that kind of thing
and the more we form community in a
positive way the more that small
minority voices like that will be
drowned out so um it's 202 and here's
what I'm supposed to tell you at
two-fifteen Felicia will sign books back
there i'm in a weird corn in a corner
back here I don't dry some trees on down
but now is your chance to ask 13 minutes
worth of questions right there yes I'm
gonna be a pax so if somehow what oh you
had a question
I'll be packs to be great ok cool uh-uh
how could we make Xbox Live better for
codex hahahaha codex as a random gamer
yeah um what specific personnel that's
been a big personality a gamer I mean I
love Xbox like that you know i love I
think the environment is friendly I i
think more tools to be able to form
permanent friend groups on there would
be nice you know guild so to speak it is
a closed system but it feels friendly to
me design wise and and I love the
ability to curate like I think
customization in a sense but not just
customization for yourself but for
friend groups would be really nice and
and and just I mean I guess it would be
nice to to have more video on there i
miss i mean as somebody who was
literally made by xbox video i'm sad to
see there's not more of it on there and
i think that you know especially if your
tailoring it to a gamer like there's a
lot of content out there but you know
just like the curation wand helped me on
youtube and on xbox like there are
voices that you guys could you know use
as your mascots in a sense or your your
personalities and i think that that
would that would help or at least
curation of video to supplement gaming
it strikes me that they should all be
taking lots of notes no i don't know if
i can make it to order right there I
just like to express my appreciation to
you personally of the guild I think
articulated a dark time for a lot of us
you know post-recession delays
directionless depression stuff all that
and you had a great impact on me
personally and a lot of people i know so
thank you very much thank you Amy
so I have an online question for you in
terms of scaling project how do you go
about finding and choosing people to
work with and then the second part of
your question is any predictions about
the future of collaboration um yeah I
think it's really tough and that's
something I really had to struggle with
when I started geek &amp;amp; sundry you know I
just thought I was going to make a bunch
of content and I didn't realize that the
infrastructure to make all that content
was going to be a huge monumental thing
to build and that was something I just
naively didn't expect I didn't know
anything about business and really you
know creativity only it soars when it's
supported by people around that vision
right i mean you know it not to say
there it's art or driven but in fact the
infrastructure just as important like
the UI to show off that creativity and
the ability to interact with it and
share it like the nuts and bolts are
just as important as the creativity
because without all doze you don't get
your voice out so you know it's part and
parcel to be able to build a good
infrastructure with personality in a
company just as much as anything and you
know as far as managing people I was
terrible I wanted to I came out of a
world where I did everything myself so
delegating was really something I had to
learn and I think to build a great team
that you have to if you're the leader of
the team you have to be ruthless with
yourself and realize you are terrible at
this you are bad at this hey what am i
bad at you know how am i doing you know
always checking in and it seemed where
you can improve and fill the holes of
what you can do because no one is a
monolith with the best people who
enthusiastically love that thing too
it's like Swiss cheese you're a Swiss
cheese block how do you fill up the
holes with the right people to make a
solid Duda I don't know
has a terrible analogy haha oh I
actually like that okay good take it
back to my boss geez people are like how
dare you wes is not good at you
Philistine okay so standing next to a me
there's a hand you so you obviously
juggle a lot of different projects and a
lot of different things online I
obviously weren't carry Microsoft that
also do a lot of online content creation
and I never feel like I have enough time
to do everything so how do you juggle
imbalance all do different projects it's
really hard I mean especially when you
wear a million hats like the digital
world enables that and kind of requires
Olenna hats but you know every so often
I'll be like this this this hat is very
heavy why is it so heavy um I think it's
you know to me my hardest thing is
making sure that my time is as valuable
as my time as to other people so I a lot
of the time when I'm having an anxiety
attack or have a project to get done I
think of myself as another person you
know when I'm anxious or depressed I
think about myself as a child and I give
myself a hug because when you know in my
in my mind and that really improves my
mood in loving myself and being gentle
with myself not being frustrated with
myself so emotionally I get through like
that and then you know as far as like
creativity I'm showing up with a date
for myself like I am accountable as a
cannibal to myself and showing up for
the time that I carve out for myself as
anybody else needing it so I make up
people I'm like I'm sorry I have a
meeting with Judy and I'm like I'm Judy
but like in doing that it makes people
like actually because people do have an
attitude we're like well I need your
time so just cuz it's for you it means
you're self-centered no it means i'm
showing up for myself so to me I always
put you know gates with myself our work
work sessions with myself and pretend
i'm judy and it actually works it goes
far because you only get great things by
slowly accumulating them you know
everything isn't overnight and insidious
yeah damn it got to change my name okay
I'm in the dark t-shirt right there um
so I just wanted to know you're talking
about making time
do you still have time to play games and
what do you plan right well the good
thing is I made game playing into my
work by streaming what you actually
didn't start the way that way you know I
started streaming about a year ago only
because I just had to do something for
myself that got me back to where I
started and I love streaming on Twitch
we and out of that we started streaming
on Twitch with geek and sundry we
streams five to six days a week now and
I love the interaction interactivity
with the audience and it really got me
back to my roots of like this is a small
community and I kind of know a lot of
the people in there as people and we are
doing something together so regardless
aside from that there are games like
pillars of eternity that are not really
streamed friendly as much but they're
amazing wasteland 2 was one of my
favorites of last year I've been playing
Witcher 3 and I love indie games and I
really wanted in the future turn my
focus more toward indy because Triple A
they've got it covered you know they're
the Hollywood blockbuster of gaming but
there's so much innovation and design
and and just a boundary-pushing in in
indie games right now it's such an
amazing scene that I would love to put
more of my voice into and my company's
voice into two and you know I remember
you know Xbox Live that all the indie
games like I saw this way more often
back then so hopefully you guys can push
those a little bit more because those
are really where the jewels are to me in
the world of games thanks Lots thing
going on too ok cool wish I could be
here i'm at PAX with this guy ok I've
been ignoring the side of the room so
yes you um I wrote my girls cuz they are
home-schooled and I wanted them to see
it successful you know homeschooled
women yeah like what kind of thoughts do
you feel you wish you could tell
yourself when you were younger as home
school but you know what you know now or
just that kind of stuff that you wish
you knew you know now you didn't know
then oh wow now cuz you'll say it yeah
no um I mean I I do I don't want to say
i would say that don't base your
self-worth on your achievements as much
you know that's what I kind of found
myself doing you know I be game that
girl is like I have a four-point-oh or I
won this you know I think that's sort of
external gratification
um sort of sell yourself short you know
and then you think about their in result
more than the process I think that's the
best thing I've learned is like have a
love of learning for yourself and and
sign up for a daily work of it because
if you're just driving yourself toward I
need to win this thing like you really
you don't enjoy ninety percent of your
literal hours and I guess for
homeschooling you know I mean I had a
very unstructured homeschooling
hopefully your children are a little bit
more structured you know okay let's just
wake up whenever but at the end you know
that you have the opportunity to really
pursue something that you love and get a
leg up so you know getting out and
meeting people and and and being part of
like I said like building communities
around activities you love and just
really supporting you know things that
you love like I would never be here
unless I had loved violin and my mom had
literally got me any of the best lessons
in the area or just going and taking
watercolor at the Community College like
I did it I was like a ten-year-old set
next heir an 80 year old do in
watercolor like and those things really
fostered a love of learning in me and I
think serves me well nowadays Amy you
had one last question then I think yeah
okay so there's a couple things one is
in response to the cheese comparison
there's been so come out of appreciation
oh my god the cheese analogies hidden it
and then Joseph S what's the best
current show on TV or online which no
one is watching oh wow that's a game of
silence is really this this really
sleeper hit that um no I mean I think
the caller said there's the thing about
right now is there such a glut of
content you know and it's really hard to
find things like there's a there's a
show called catastrophe I think which
other it's a half hour common instead of
Britain I mean I love british comedy the
most I love Doctor Strange jumps the
strange &amp;amp; Mr Norrell that's an amazing
thing hey right there that was a great
show that I feel like people didn't talk
about enough because I love that book
and at that they've got a great
adaptation I mean you know there's
awesome stuff online and I think the
more that we can really if you find
somebody you really love especially on a
small scale like I be proactive and
creating community around there because
you know that really is the key to
keeping a creator going and also you
know having content mean more to you I
think we've gone beyond the point where
we're just passively being shoved you
know shoving movies in our faces and TV
and yes that's great but it's really the
experience around those and that's what
Buffy show be much long ago about
creating community around a creation and
it really in rich's people if you see
the charity work I mean we have a team
human around our twitch channel that
does charity work and knows people in
each of each other in real life and I
think that's really something that text
should facilitate the enabling of
community around content in a more
seamless way and I appreciate it
whenever I see that so yeah that's it um
thank you guys now you all have to go do
all these things especially the Xbox
people so feliz is gonna be back there
um signing books and you can buy books I
think yes you can purchase books if you
don't have one I will sign it and I know
yeah i'll show the devil so much for
everything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
