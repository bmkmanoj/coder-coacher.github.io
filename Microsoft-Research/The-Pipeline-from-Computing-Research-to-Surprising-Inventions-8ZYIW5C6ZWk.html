introduction I I'm just so honored and
thrilled to be here I considered just a
great gift from all of you to me and so
I hope you'll accept my small gift of
this lecture what I'm going to talk
about today is the subject of basic
research in computing and of course that
initially begs the question what is
basic research and it's a little bit
embarrassing but it's actually hard to
answer that question and it's a question
that's been hard to answer actually for
very long time around 80 years ago there
was the famous rocket scientist Verner
von Braun and later in his career he
once stated that research is what I do
when I don't know what I'm doing and I
think he was inspired by Albert Einstein
who said something very similar I think
a little bit earlier which was the line
if I knew what I was doing it wouldn't
be research and so let allow me please
to put myself in the company of Albert
Einstein and verna von Braun and admit
that oftentimes I don't know what I'm
doing and that's in fact part of what
I'm going to talk about today one of the
exciting things about research in
computer science is that we oftentimes
set out to do one thing set out to solve
one problem perhaps we solve it perhaps
we don't but surprisingly often the
results of our research in computing
produce surprising results and that idea
of surprise or sometimes refer to as
serendipity the feeling that somehow we
just became lucky in the application of
an idea or in the usefulness of some
result that concept is something that I
find just completely intoxicating and
valuable in our field of computing
research so what I'd like to do today is
go through three examples drawn from the
experience of Microsoft
research of how basic research leads to
surprises in innovations in technology
now before I do that I am very honored
here to be in front of so many very good
students and so I was a professor for
very long time and so let me start this
lecture with a small test and so I'm
going to ask all of you to participate
in this test and what i will do is i
will show you a picture of some multi
colored dots and i will give you three
seconds to complete the problem and what
is the problem i want you to look at the
picture and tell me within three seconds
how many green dots there are everybody
ready okay here we go three two one okay
how many blue dots anyone
if if it's any comfort to you when I
lecture to students in the United States
and in Europe they don't pass the test
either so it's okay now of course it's a
silly test it's a trick but there's a
point here for example in Microsoft
Research we oftentimes work with product
groups and these product groups are
extremely disciplined they are just
incredibly focused on understanding the
customers needs on defining a product
and a user experience on writing down a
plan very carefully and then executing
that plane that plan almost with
military efficiency and so what you were
all doing when you are trying to count
the green dots is you are also executing
a task almost with military efficiency
you are very focused because you're all
very good students on completing the
task of cutting the green dots so one
thing about research is that research is
more about an exploratory search for
truth and understanding sometimes a
search for beauty and so in research yes
we want to know how many green dots
there are but we also have other
curiosities we want to know are there
other colors are there other shapes how
many other colors and how many other
shapes how many blue dots and it's in
those other questions that we oftentimes
find surprising innovations and it's in
those surprising innovations that
oftentimes in fact more often than not
we get the real value of research so let
me try to go right into some concrete
examples so the first example I want to
talk about has to do with what's called
audio processing and so this is a scene
from the New York Stock Exchange and if
you look carefully at the picture you
just see pandemonium lots of noise
people shouting waving at each other and
a traitor who's recording trades on the
floor is looking at the scene and is
listening to each person's voice
for important trade information and is
noting this down sometimes in the
notebook sometimes in the tablet
computer what's amazing is that we as
human beings with our audio array of two
ears are we are able to focus our
hearing even in a noisy environment on a
single person's voice in a crowded room
like this and so one question is can we
have computing systems with similar
kinds of capabilities and this is a
problem that of course many people have
worked on maybe some of you have work
done and so the problem is as follows
someone is speaking to us and then we
have a microphone and we want to hear
that person's voice using this
microphone and of course we have the
complications that that person might be
in a crowded room with many people
talking and so somehow we have to focus
on that one person and in fact it might
not just people talking but there might
be many sources of noise and sounded
music all throughout the room and so the
question is can we have a system with a
microphone that's able to hear that one
person's voice that were interested in
now as many of you know with human
hearing we have two ears that makes an
audio right and so we could also imagine
having an audio array on our machine and
then building an audio pipeline that
gives us the audio output of the
person's voice so that we're interested
in as well as the direction information
of where that person is speaking from
and this is a classic problem in signal
processing in the computer science now
in Microsoft Research as long as the
more than ten years ago we have been
engaged in research on exactly this type
of problem and we're very proud of the
fact that we've developed technologies
such as the mvd our adaptive beamformer
that is actually able to do sound
processing of an audio ray in order to
have this kind of focus and this is an
example of what i call basic blue sky
research we're trying to solve a problem
trying to achieve some understanding
about the properties of sound
and about the properties of adaptive
beamforming and understand and write
down the theoretical properties of this
now at some point one wants to move past
the theory and achieve an actual working
system and so at Microsoft Research we
of course engage in that type of work as
well and so what you see pictured here
is a prototype of a 9 microphone audio
ray system that was used extensively in
a number of experiments to try to
implement and make real this concept of
an MV dr adaptive beamformer and so this
9 microphone array was attached to a
machine a computer with an audio
pipeline that would give audio output
and direction information and just to
give you an idea of how well it works
let me play two audio files the first
audio file that you'll hear is the sound
of several people talking in a noisy
room and this sound was captured with a
single microphone one of these
microphones so listen very carefully I I
think we need a little more volume
and so I don't know if anyone could hear
but in fact there was a man talking
amongst all in all that noise and you
hear the problem that computers tend to
have in a crowded room a room like this
or even in a living room where you're
having a party with a bunch of friends a
computer has a very hard time hearing
person trying to give commands to the
computer and so now with this device and
with an M vdr adaptive theme former that
very same audio source comes out
sounding like this and so now you can
start to see the same kind of ability to
focus the hearing of an audio ray
attached to a computer very similar to
what a human can do in a crowded room
and this ends up being extremely
important in a number of applications
such as video and audio conferencing
systems now I call this a type of
research that's directed to disruptive
innovation or disruptive technology we
take some basic research ideas
oftentimes very theoretical ideas and
actually try to reduce it to practice
try to build a device it actually
realizes the theoretical principles in a
way that one can imagine could be
practical and so the going from basic
research disruptive technology ends up
being a very important step in the whole
path or pipeline to innovation now one
thing I should say about microsoft
research is that and it's something I'm
very proud of that MSR is that we
publish openly most of what we do almost
everything that we do and in fact here
is a picture of a research paper that
two of our researchers Yvonne Tasha and
Alex acero along with their intern at
the time nilesh m'dear wrote on
that prototype system and this is
important because by engaging with the
external community by engaging with
universities we can tap into the best
minds in the world we can test our ideas
to make sure that they're solid and also
influence the direction of the field in
two directions that are hopefully
beneficial to Microsoft long-term future
now one reason also to show you this
paper is that this paper was submitted
incidentally i should also mention
before i go to the next step that Alex
acero is actually here in the audience
and I want to mention that specifically
that he's here in fact he's sitting
right there because this paper while it
was submitted for publication was
rejected and I actually took the time to
read the paper and and the referees
reports and the referees reports were
very unkind to this paper and so just to
give you some excerpts one reviewer said
that the that the solution doesn't solve
the problem at all there's no real
stereo echo cancellation there's no
improvements and the last review report
which I thought was the most damaging
was the reviewer thought that there were
serious drawbacks for realistic
scenarios when these are actually
comments from the reviewers and so this
is something else on the path to
disruptions in the path to real advances
in technology that oftentimes it's hard
for the scientific community to really
understand and come to grips with with
something that's very new of course this
technology is a technology that has been
incorporated into the microphone array
in the Xbox Kinect and so another aspect
of the pipeline from basic research too
disruptive technology is that there can
come a point when as researchers we
engage in what I called mission focused
research research that is in partnership
in this case
is with the Microsoft product team where
we work in close collaboration close
partnership in order to bring a brand
new disruptive technology to market and
this type of mission focused research is
for many of our researchers one of the
Holy Grails of being at Microsoft and
Microsoft Research the idea that we can
use the fact that Microsoft has
literally hundreds of millions of
customers as a very as Eric orbits my
good colleague would say as a long lever
to really get the most out of our
research efforts and so despite the fact
that the paper was rejected what we see
here in fact we can see in this
rejection that there's a very thin line
between a visionary product concept and
science fiction the reviewers of our
paper felt that what we had proposed was
actually science fiction not signs fact
and in fact oftentimes researchers try
to stay in a very safe zone staying
within the well-known technology
envelopes and so when you move from
basic research too disruptive research
to mission focused research there's the
potential for magic to happen the magic
that happens when a visionary product
concept and visionary project developers
work hand in hand with world-class
researchers you can take researchers out
of the comfort zone you can add
technical grounding to the project
developers and make something really
remarkable happen and that's in a
nutshell I think one of the lessons that
we see from the development of Xbox and
the Kinect device and so to summarize
this we see a pipeline an innovation
pipeline where we go from basic research
to attempt to disrupt and do something
for the first time to mission focused
research to actually bring something in
collaboration of product teams to market
and then after that continuous in
sustaining improvements to keep adding
on keep building on the successes that
we have and that sequence is
an innovation pipeline and that
innovation pipeline is something that we
work very hard to make sure we keep very
full all four stage of this stages of
this pipeline we strive in our research
to always have good things happening in
fact within the lab we think very hard
about the investments that we make and
so in this graph if we imagine this
graph is the graph of all research
investments we're on the x-axis we go
from very short term research and
projects and as we go out along the
x-axis we get into longer and longer
term research and on the y-axis we have
choices of problems where we have what i
call reactive problems problems that are
given to us by product teams by society
at large by our academic collaborators
and as we go up the y-axis we get to
research problems that are more
open-ended just the open-ended search
for truth and understanding within this
whole space we see the pipeline fills
the four quadrants of the space where we
have blue sky research in the upper
right quadrant mission focused research
and the lower left quadrant sustaining
research in the lower right and in the
upper left this very interesting
quadrant of disruptive research and so
for me it's as a manager of a lab it's
incredibly important to make sure that
we have very good activities in very
good people operating in all four
quadrants and this in fact is a
management principle for Microsoft
Research in in the last couple of years
and so this quadrant model is something
that will see a couple more times in
this talk all right there's another
point about the quadrants and that is a
point about diversity sometimes when you
talk to people maybe they're businessmen
perhaps they're writers
the in various aspects of technology
sometimes they are financial people
economists there's a tendency to think
of research as being only mission
focused or only blue sky but in fact as
you see in the innovation pipeline and
in the quadrants there's wonderful
diversity in computing research and in
that diversity if we embrace it properly
we get this innovation pipeline if we
can get all four quadrants filled with
very good activities we can really go
and hope to strive towards a really
great feedback loop that keeps new
innovations coming over and over again
all right so that's the first example
now let me give a second example and I
chose the second example looking at Rick
ratchets talk keynote from this morning
where he talked about program synthesis
and that's another area that has some
wonderful surprises and so let's start
from the very beginning on this now in
this research area we start from the
problem of program verification now what
is program verification well the problem
is we take some code and we want to
apply algorithms for program
verification and those program
verification algorithms are supposed to
inspect the code and answer just a very
simple question and that question is if
we were to run this program if we were
to execute this code can something bad
happen and as a practical matter to help
programmers it's also useful to extend
the program verification paradigm so
that if something bad can happen please
generate some examples that illustrate
or exhibit the the bad behavior the bug
and that's useful because that way
programmers can use those input outputs
to chase down the exact nature of the
bug and fix the problem now a program
verification is a very old research area
in computer science it's a
very important one Jeanette wing alluded
to it in the first part of her talk and
it's something that Microsoft and
Microsoft Research invests in very
heavily because we write very large
amounts of software and it's very
important for us to know that the
software is reliable and secure we again
conduct very basic research in this area
and in fact recently two years ago
there's a very important paper that we
published in popl 2010 on the idea of
compositional may must program analysis
and so I know quite a few of you study
software engineering and software
program analysis program verification
and this paper is really fundamental in
a lot of the tools that Microsoft uses
today in really analyzing our software
and making sure that the software is as
free as we can make it of certain types
of bugs particularly security bugs in
data parsers and so this type of
technology even though it is oftentimes
very theoretical is also very practical
for us and in fact from that basic
research the type of research that you
would read about in that paper in pople
2010 we also take the next step and try
to do something disruptive so we again
go from basic research and take the next
step in the innovation pipeline to
disruptive technology and one of the
disruptive technologies is a system
called sage which runs on the very large
computing system that's pictured above
there and that system called sage does
testing using program verification and
analysis technologies and in particular
using compositional may must analysis
and automatic they're improving to find
security bugs in data parsers in some of
our most important software products and
in fact today sage finds more high
priority security bugs in those software
products than any other testing
technology used at Microsoft today and
so that's again for us highly disruptive
and it's another great example of moving
from very basic research into disruptive
technology
but there's more here and there's more
that's actually quite surprising it
turns out that this idea of program
verification can be run essentially in
Reverse and so while we have this
program verification idea we can also
run program verification in reverse and
when we do that that is the problem of
programs synthesis that requested
alluded to this morning and so program
synthesis roughly speaking is the
problem of taking some example inputs
and outputs and then asking the question
or answering the question does a program
exists that produces those inputs and
outputs or can we generate all possible
programs that are consistent with the
example input outputs and if we can can
be then generate the code or all the
codes that are consistent with that
input output and this is the problem of
program synthesis and so the key insight
here and the key surprise is that in
fact it is possible to take program
verification technology which goes
typically in one direction like this and
in a flash of insight run it in reverse
in order to take example input output</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
