Microsoft chief Research Officer Rick
Ratched hi there well hopefully this
will be a very fun day for all of you
you know for me it's it's it's
interesting it feels like we've been
doing tech fest for a really really long
time but it's actually only been since
2001 so technically I think this is the
13th tech fest event for microsoft
research of course in the in the in the
first tech fest it wasn't nearly as big
an event as this it was just for
employees we didn't take up nearly as
much space and and we didn't even know
how many people would really show up I
mean I think I was actually one of the
strongest skeptics about this whole idea
of creating this technology show for our
employees because I wasn't really sure
how many people would show up and I kept
saying well gosh you know it seems like
it's going to be a lot of work and I'm
not sure it's going to be really
valuable and worthwhile but you know if
you guys really think you really want to
do it you know okay of course what
happened that year was we had I think
about four thousand of our Puget Sound
employees you know come over a two-day
period and of course Microsoft was a
much smaller company back then so that
was just a huge fraction of our Puget
Sound workforce at that time and and
everybody was really excited I mean like
the researchers came away from the event
you know really excited about you know
being able to talk to so many of our
employees be able to to interact with
them and deserve sell their ideas and
show off what they've been doing and we
got a lot of great feedback you know
from the employees who looked at this
and said you know this this was
inspirational they didn't even realize
you know that Microsoft was doing a lot
of these things that we were working in
so many different areas and so and so
from that beginning techfest was really
bored and it just grown since then
a few years ago we added this public day
where we're able to bring Outsiders in
to show a select collection of our of
our demonstrations and to meet some of
our researchers and so I'm welcoming you
here to that today now I came to
Microsoft in 1991 to start microsoft
research so i've been running microsoft
research from the very beginning and
over that entire period of time we've
had exactly one mission statement and
you see it up here on the on the screen
it's in three parts and the order is
really important the most important part
of our mission statement is that first
phrase there that our goal as a basic
research organization is to move forward
the state of the art in the areas in
which we do research and the reason
that's important is if we're really not
moving the state of the art if we're not
at the forefront of the areas in which
we're doing research then fundamentally
I don't think we're that valuable to a
company like Microsoft maybe we need to
be constantly pushing the envelope and
have people that are both creating new
technologies and exploring the
possibilities of those technologies open
up now when we do a great job of that
you know then you get to the second part
remember the first part said nothing
about Microsoft it just says if we're
going to engage in research in a
particular area we're going to be the
best we possibly can be we're going to
hire the best people that we can in that
area and they're going to push the state
of the art when we have great ideas that
make sense then that second part comes
in which is we want to get our ideas out
when the reason I went into the field of
computer science was I got excited about
the idea that my intellect my mind
because I've animate these these
otherwise inanimate pieces of hardware
that I could create things for others
that would make their lives better or or
help them in some way and that's what
our researchers want to do they want to
impact the world and the best way to do
that is through Microsoft's products
really getting our technology into the
products and into the hands of hundreds
of millions or even billions of people
now all that translates into the third
part there which is that that ultimately
our goal is not just to make sure that
Microsoft and its products have a future
but but really fundamentally make sure
that the field of computer science or
the technology field has a future as a
field we need to keep moving the
goalpost we need to keep moving things
forward if we want to be able to to
continue to add value and continue to be
important in the future of society we
need to constantly be improving the
things that we're doing and making sure
that they actually have a future now you
get a sense here of what's happened in
the last 21 and a half years we've built
a number of research labs around the
world with some of the most amazing
researchers in the world you see just
some of the awards in some of the of the
the kinds of people that we have need to
give you a sense of where Microsoft
Research is today we we are the number
one basic research organization in the
field of computer science we publish
more research in the field of computer
science than any other organization we
have roughly 850 PhD researchers that
means we have more PhDs working at
Microsoft Research than many university
universities have PhDs so if more PhDs
for example than Brown University we
have more members of the National
Academy of Engineering than for example
the entire University of Washington it
gives you a sense of the scale at which
we operate and the important role that
we play in moving forward to
state-of-the-art for the entire field of
computer science you can see the breadth
of our organization terms of its of its
spread around the world and and again
people will start to ask me like why do
you have all these different labs in
different places and the answer is work
trying to make sure that we have the
best talent we possibly can you know if
we only had research labs for example
the United States we'd probably be about
half the size that we are today and in
fact about half of microsoft research is
in the United States about half of it is
outside the United States there's a
limit to how many great researchers are
created each year in the world and we
need to make sure that we're in the
places around the world that where we
can capture those great people and give
them environments where they want to
live and where they want to work and
they want to create the things that they
create now if you notice there's
actually nothing below the equator there
but we announced earlier this year or
actually late last year that we will be
setting up an advanced technology lab in
Rio in Brazil coming up coming up later
this year so that will be our first yo
southern hemisphere lab I was joking
with Rico mall VAR who's been involved
in helping to put this together that we
could have called it Microsoft Research
southern hemisphere you know but that
kind of you know sounds a little too
grandiose so we do have Microsoft
Research Asia which somehow doesn't
include India so so I guess we've been
inconsistent in the past but again I the
key point here is that you know we have
grown to become a significant player in
basic research all around the world and
every part of the world that we operate
we work closely with the academic
community in those environments we work
closely with universities with other
research labs and corporations and also
with students especially with students
Microsoft Research runs the largest PhD
internship program in the field of
technology we have over a thousand PhD
interns working at some part of
Microsoft Research every year and put
that in perspective that probably means
we have more graduate student hours
working within Microsoft Research than
any other academic institution in the
world now you could ask the question you
know why is it that we do this all right
so Microsoft made a an important
decision you know back in
in 1990 and that you know led to the
creation of Microsoft Research in 1991
they made a decision to invest in
long-term basic research Microsoft is a
pretty darn small company back then
which is about a billion dollars in
sales you know now we've got a run rate
of something closer to 80 billion so it
gives you a sense of of you know how
much smaller we were and yet the company
made a decision then to invest for the
long term to invest in basic research
why did we do that well there are lots
of reasons why people talk about doing
basic research you know I've got some of
them listed up there and they all apply
in a way I mean they all make sense and
they're all values that a basic research
organization creates you sometimes say
hey we're a source of intellectual
property you know new product
technologies and we do a ton of fit of
that you know you'll see that in some of
the demos you know we generate about a
third of Microsoft's patents come out of
Microsoft Research and those are the
patents that are are the in some sense
the most valuable in the sense that they
really are those are the scientific
patents the ones that push the bar the I
Triple E over a number of years looked
at Microsoft sweet patent portfolio and
rated it you know the top scientific
portfolios in the field technology and
really that's on the strength of a lot
of the research that we do so that's
really valuable but that's not in some
sense the the reason to do a basic
research lab it's some sense it's the
best way putting it is probably to say
it's a a value that comes out of it it's
an outcome if you have a great research
lab you'll get that problem solving we
have really really smart people that
know their area is really really well
and they love solving problems that's
what they're trained to do you know and
and you know you bring me a problem I
just love solving it I just love a hard
problem to work on and a lot of our
researchers that way as well and so our
product groups do purring is problems
you know and that is an important value
that a basic research organization
brings to the table we do
help solve really really tough issues
that come up but again I would I would
view that as an outcome but not
necessarily a reason I mean lastly the
early warning system a lot of people
always talk about that when they talk
about research they often say well you
guys are an early warning system you see
you can tell people about the future
because you're working out you know off
you know some number of years in advance
of where the the current products are
that's true too you know we do do that
but again I would view that as really a
result of the fact that we have a great
research lab not a reason to do it I
don't think that's a valley you know any
one of these things things taken alone I
don't think are valuable enough to say
hey that's the reason why why we should
be in you know paying for this very
long-term enterprise the real reason I
think that you do this and I always say
this whenever I talk about research and
this is true of not just a microsoft
research there's a true of research in
general you know the investments that
the u.s. government makes in basic
research or the European Union making
basic research I think that they have
this same rationale which is that
investments in basic research are
fundamentally about survival it's about
making sure that if there's a new
technology a new competitor change in
the business climate that you'll have
that treasure chest of ideas
intellectual property and people that
can help you change that can help you
turn things around that can help you
engage or in or move forward in a new in
a new way or to solve an important
problem if you read the writings of
vannevar bush who helped to create the
National Science Foundation in the
United States you'll see that same kind
of of rationale that he made for why the
United States should invest in basic
research you know the u.s. to just come
from a terrible war and we
which technology was a huge part of
winning that war and and he made the
statement that you know we need to
invest and to create this or treasure
chest of ideas and people so that if
there's a new war or if there's a a
famine or if there is a disease you know
that we as a society will be able to
survive so I think that's really the key
point here that's why it's important to
make these investments and and many
times the things that we do within
Microsoft Research at the time we do
them there isn't a really obvious value
I'll tell you a simple story from a long
time ago now it's one of the most
important early stories in the history
of Microsoft Research back in 1992 so
one year after we got started I think at
that point we barely had you know two
dozen employees we developed a one of
our researchers working with some others
developed a technology for dramatically
reducing the working set size of 32-bit
programs so do the right way so if
you're not really a programming language
or operating systems person what that
really means is that we came up for a
way of taking the amount of space taken
up by the code of the program that needs
to be in memory to execute and reducing
that by about a factor of two now this
is mostly a lot of math I mean it was it
was primarily just a lot of symbols on a
blackboard but it was really cool and we
were really excited about this this was
a real breakthrough we went to our
product groups and I remember I was
sitting in a lot of those meetings and
we have these great meetings we explain
what we were doing we showed how it
could impact you know the execution of
programs how we save a lot of memory
space and back then memory space was
very precious and there are great
meetings lots of good interchange but at
the end of the meeting and we've met
with a number of different product
groups at the end of the meeting each
each group would say to us that would
serve look us in the eye and say to us
you guys you guys are just like really
smart okay I just look at all those
symbols on the board you guys are just
smart but we don't actually have this
problem right because it's 1992 and we
only have 16 bit code we don't have
32-bit code now we will have dirty
Tippett codes you know it's coming down
the line we know it's happening but by
then the memory sizes will be a lot
bigger because they had all these curves
showing how memory prices were we're
going down by a factor of two every year
and memory sizes were going up and said
so we're really not going to have this
problem but you guys are really really
smart and so you work go back to work
really hard I'm sure someday you'll come
up with something we need I don't know
when that's going to happen now those
were the polite people there was one
group we met with and they actually had
32 bit code this is the windows NT group
and but there and we had a great meeting
with him they had really great smart
guys too and you know did of that
meeting you know the head of that group
you know came up to me he's a real big
guy and he looked me in the eye said
you're going to do this to our code over
my dead body all right so 18 months
later he sent me a really nice note
saying I really want to thank you guys
for all the hard work we couldn't have
ship without you and what had happened
and this was this this was all lead up
to two important change at Microsoft so
leading up to nineteen ninety-five you
know which was the year that we switched
a 32-bit windows 32-bit authors you know
with windows 95 an office 95 what
happened was that in that period from
about 90 to 95 if you look at DRAM
prices they didn't actually change
actually went up a little bit and kind
of tailed down a little bit but mostly
stay stay fly so what was what the
company was looking at as it was about
to ship its 32-bit products in 1995 was
that the memory sizes of
seize back then was roughly four or
eight megabytes just put that in
perspective now most children's toys
have more memory than that I think all
children's toys have more memory than
that now the back then you know that was
what that's weather office pc look like
unfortunately that was the amount of
memory that Windows 3.1 worked great in
ok our 16-bit product it wasn't adequate
for 32-bit products but we had been
working on that technology you know
going back to nineteen ninety-two and we
had it and our product groups then were
able to use it it became a standard part
of their build environments and we were
able to ship windows 95 in office 95 on
schedule and they were able to run
properly on machines of that size that
was important for a variety of reasons
that wasn't just important because it
made us money but even more important
you know for a small company like
Microsoft this was a critical point in
the in the history of the industry we
were going from 16 or 32-bit code it was
a big change and our competitors didn't
have this technology WordPerfect and
Lotus they really didn't have it and it
made a huge difference in the
marketplace if you talk to ray ozzie of
course was at Lotus at the time he'll
tell you I mean he said they knew that
we had it they knew we had this
technology and it was killing them they
didn't know how we did it and that's
just one tiny example one algorithm from
one or two or three people that was a
turning point you know for us as a
company and a particular turning point
in the industry that's what a basic
research group does right those are the
moments that that payoff you know in
some sense not the yes we always have
those those constant payoffs new
technologies coming out all the time all
those other things i listed those are
the everyday payoffs it's the big
transitions that that are incredibly
important now i mentioned that you know
we have a huge impact on the you know I
talked about our mission statement you
know moving for the state of the art
I pointed out that we we publish more
basic research than anyone else in the
field of computer science the technology
transfer part is also very very
important to us this is just a list of
technologies that have gone into our
products from microsoft research since
last fall I mean we're probably the most
it when I look back in all the research
labs I've been in doing doing this sort
of thing from for 35 years now I guess
when I look back at the research labs
and feel of technology you know I've
never seen an organization quite like
ours in the sense that both were moving
that state-of-the-art forward in in a
way that that that really almost no one
had ever done before certainly at the
scale we're doing it no one's ever done
it before but at the same time you know
we have this intimate relationship in
terms of getting our ideas into our
products very rapidly and having that
kind of big impact and you know get it
it goes all over the mount I mean some
of these things are individual pieces of
technology that go into our product in
some cases these are whole products you
know if you look at something like
Kinect you know that's a whole new
product that was created you know
working with our teams in IE be based
around microsoft research technology so
with that I'm going to bring out one of
our principal researchers Curtis Wong to
talk about a hot off the presses this is
the hot off the griddle piece of
technology transfer Curtis has done a
lot of things that have had a big impact
involved in things like worldwide
telescope that will mention too and most
recently he's been taking and working
with our office team to bring a new
product geo a new technology geo flow
into our office products and that's
where we're just telling you this now
right so this is news hot off the wire
Curtis thanks Rick
ah it's so great to be here okay so ten
years ago Jim Gray was a touring award
winner was tackling the challenges a big
data to help you know astronomers get
insight into the terabytes of data from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and he did
a talk that I went to or at this last
slide was we need visuals visualization
and we know it and so I got involved and
started thinking about wouldn't be great
if we were able to build the biggest
telescope in the internet with the
highest resolution imagery from ground
and space-based telescopes and connect
it into information all over the web and
even better build a virtual camera in
this environment that would allow
astronomers and educators and even kids
to create guided tours of the universe
and so we did that five years ago and
almost to the month and we launched it
Ted and so what I'm going to do here is
I'm actually going to show you a little
bit this is a the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey so this visualization is a
million galaxies in fact it's a million
galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey and the data that Jim helped make
possible is what's powering this now
even though they look like tiny dots
each one of those dots is a galaxy with
about 200 to 300 billion stars but it's
not just a visualization because you're
seeing the large-scale structure of the
universe and if I paused and clicked
into any one of those dots I'd be able
to connect into data information and
imagery that's in a completely different
cloud somewhere else and get full access
to information about that one particular
galaxy and Jim Gray help make that
possible so but what's interesting about
this is it's not a video but it's
essentially a path in this 3d
environment and there's hundreds of
terabytes of data behind that particular
thing now we're going here into the
Milky Way and behind that is you'll see
about a hundred thousand stars which all
the stars and our nearby portion of the
of the galaxy and these are all rendered
accurately in turn
space and location so with this kind of
visualization you could see the
structures that are impossible to see
when you're looking at just raw data and
with a worldwide telescope tour here as
you can see all these half a million
asteroids kind of useful after that
thing in Russia but with the tour you
can pause at any time and start drilling
into some of this information so we
originally built world wide telescope as
a research project and you know it's
it's it's been amazing actually to sort
of see what's happened because now we
have about 10 million users well 10
million kids of all ages really
exploring the universe from every
continent on Earth including Antarctica
and I hear from teachers all the time
that you know send me emails or find me
somehow and tell me about how they use
worldwide telescope both as a learning
environment and also as a carrot to get
kids excited you know what they do well
in class they get to drive world wide
telescope and show the class something
that they've discovered and want to be
able to explore it's also used by
astronomers at the Harvard Center for
Astrophysics it was recently used to
visualize something called Nessie which
is a large-scale structure in the Milky
in the Milky Way plane it kind of looks
like a hiking Loch Ness monster and that
was visualized in worldwide telescope
and announced at the last American
Astronomical Society meeting so we built
world wide telescope back then and you
know to the point that Rick was talking
about I had this crazy idea of building
this thing and it was and I wanted to
make it as a dork a free resource for
science and education and it clearly
didn't have any particular connection to
business at that time but it had a
potential huge impact to inspire and
educate people around the world but I
knew that the technology that we were
going to develop from this would someday
be applicable to the things we do here
at Microsoft especially if you're
looking at what's happened since that
time in terms of the growing amount of
spatial and temporal data with mobile
devices and things like that how can we
start to see things you know and
visualize that kind of information so
for the past few years I've been meeting
with lots and lots of custom
murs to sort of understand their data
challenges and how we can apply some of
these ideas that we develop from
worldwide telescope and help them gain
insight into spatial and temporal data
so after all if we can visualize a
million galaxies in the large-scale
structure of the universe we can
probably do something for business
intelligence so I've worked closely with
the startup business group and Microsoft
Office over the past year and a half to
bring together a solution we think
you'll find interesting so I'm super
excited to be able to show you this
preview of Geo flow today so this is a
table of data which is publicly
available data from the city of Chicago
they have a web portal that anybody can
get access to it and so I downloaded
this data as you can see it has
information about this is actually some
narcotics arrests from 2011 to the
present and if I sort of zoom down here
you can sort of see that we have about
about 70,000 rows of data and what I'd
like to do is I'd like to okay let me do
this one thing here and show you this is
a new ad in that it's going to be
available later so you can see i'll put
geo flow here and now you see this
plug-in up here at the top so what I'll
do is I'll launch geo flow and I'm going
to create a new visualization here and
notice right here we have the globe and
the first thing I'm going to do is
provide some geographic coordinates so
I'll take latitude and longitude and
these are some touch controls in case
you wanted to you have a touch device
you can use these or pinch and zoom etc
but this is data from the city of
Chicago so let's go and take a look at
the city of Chicago here and we have
this tradition that we used to do when
we were building a geo flow whenever
we'd show a new feature in our feature
review meetings john Payne who's one of
our designers would go up and
say boom and then we'd all cheer when
we'd see something new and cool because
we haven't seen before and so it would
sort of convey the level of excitement
about that particular feature so I want
to kind of get all you guys and going
involved with this thing with me too
because after that sort of last incident
i'm going to start to get myself back up
to speed here okay so so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to press map it and
so we have those 70,000 data points and
boom thank you thank you all right we're
back in it so now those look like you
know a lot of points but they're all
kind of blended together there's quite a
lot of them and if I sort of show those
well you can see just how many there
really are I'm going to go in and put a
name in here to see 911 these are 911
calls and let's start to look at this
data now some of you are familiar with
XL 2013 field wells what i can do is
this is data from three years and if i
take year and drag it down into category
what it does is that boom it shows three
years of data right 70,000 data points
now these are stacked histograms now
what we can do is we can show them
clustered as well so you can see over
here that 2011 was bigger and then sort
of got smaller 2012 course 2013 is only
a partial year but that's really not
necessarily what we want to look at I
mean maybe we what we want to do is
instead of column chart we want to sort
of see it as a heat map boom
we're going now okay so let's go back to
column so what I really want to do is I
want to go and look at this by drug type
okay cuz 70,000 drugs what are we
looking at here so let's go drag this
down into the category field boom yeah
okay now we're looking at a lot of
purple what's the purple going on here
okay so purple represents possession of
cannabis 30 grams or less so it looks
like the police are spending a lot of
time busting people with pot okay some
of the other things we can sort of see
here you can see light blue this is a
was he like blue oh yeah it's heroin
white heroin white heroin and that's
sort of the realm of heroin and then on
the other side here we see a lot of
yellow that's cocaine and but we also
notice here that there's a some of these
tall bars here which are real outliers
one thing i want to add here is that we
have lots of different themes from which
is to represent the data so we have we
have 21 so if i looked at this i can
sort of see locations of what i'm
looking at we have other sort of choices
say we picked a dark earth notice a
change both the data represented to
emphasize contrast so you can see that
so we have a number of different choices
of how you might want to represent that
data but one thing you might want to be
able to do is select and sort of examine
what are these outliers so i can hover
over this thing and i can see that this
thing here there's 238 cannabis arrests
of more than 30 grams clearly this is
the big box store for pot
and what i can do is i can add an
annotation in here kind of call that out
and okay didn't undo that hmm anyway so
that's embedded in there but the other
thing you might want to really be able
to do is you might want to really
provide a way for people to sort of see
the things that you're talking about in
a way that's different than what you do
with a static charter representation and
when you have a chart and graph a lot of
times you want to do that's just the
beginning of the question like what is
that what's going on there and here in
this 3d environment what you can do is
you can create as I as I showed you with
worldwide telescope sort of a guided
tour into this space and we can do that
very simply so say we wanted to start
with an establishing shot here of this
and we'll just add a scene and that's
sort of the first sort of scene that we
have there you can do things like adjust
the time for this particular scene let's
say we make it three seconds and we want
to make it fast there are a number of
camera moves that you can do either
things like Faden or fly to or different
kinds of camera effects as you get to
that data will just say stationary and
for this particular location we might
want to just zoom in on on this one
location right here and we'll do the
same will change that three and make
that fast and then we'll go to another
place and maybe look at something out
here another green column this is by
o'hare case you want a another
distribution point and let's see let's
make this three as well
okay we're ready for another boo moment
okay let's do it the loudest guys are
gonna get a free swag of geo flow
post-it notes think about it okay so
notice we're just moving the camera
through very simple so when you start
thinking about data and big data
especially the cloud how do you do
analytics and representation of data in
the cloud you know I mean traditional
ways of representing data we would use
spreadsheets and you can hand the data
to somebody one day to gets too big to
move you have to move the analytics to
the cloud how do you do that you know
this idea of a guided tour is like being
able to drive a virtual camera in the
data in the cloud and send out an HD
movie maybe it's reduced data but still
it's a very large a design just a window
into the cloud and that path is not a
frozen thing it's just a basically
metadata and that metadata path can be
shared with other people other people
can annotate it show something else re
annotated it's a new kind of idea about
how we might be able to visualize and
represent data so let's go back here and
take a look at the same data and the
other key thing about this is time we
have temporal data with this and its
really kind of a difficult thing to show
but in geo flow we have the ability to
look at things over time so let's go and
select oh by day and will accumulate
this data and we want to be able to sort
of loop through it I'm going to shrink
this down and let's play boom
Oh somebody back there come find me okay
so you notice the data is forward moving
through time as we're zooming through
this very simple okay so i think i'm
running out of time because the hook is
right here but what I'd like to just say
is that I think Gio flow is a really
interesting example of how technology
created in Microsoft Research that's
purely for science and education and
serving the greater good we can leverage
it same technology to develop innovative
technologies for products if you're
interested in trying out geo flow you
know talk to your Microsoft sales
representative about getting access to
the beta because space is really limited
so thank you boom thanks Curtis thanks
all right now of course one of the
themes that you're going to be seeing is
you go around tech coast is your relates
to to the thing that the Curtis was
talking about which is this notion of
big data I mean we're really in a world
now where we can both you know store and
access but also collect data on truly a
global scale you know you can see we can
even represent it now and display it and
use it in presentations in a global
scale you know I think that's an
important change in the way we we
interact with the world and I think
another part of that is is the fact that
not only can we get all this data but we
can learn from it you know we can have
principled analysis that is actually
based on data you know the old days
people would talk about expert systems
but expert systems in the you know until
fairly recent times we're really systems
that captured human insight and human
data which is great I mean human beings
would code in a set of rules or a set of
perspectives on things but it wasn't
necessarily principled and it was often
very fragile now we can collect large
amounts of real data and take advantage
of that at the same time and even
related to that is another thing that
you're going to be seeing as you go
around
which is this notion of natural
interfaces so at the same time that
we've been building sort of global scale
data centers and filling them up with
incredible amounts of information and
processing capability we've also been
giving our are the computers we carry
with us and the computers that are
around us the ability to have the senses
that we have the ability to hear and see
know where they are feel even even
understand motion and shake right as
we've done that we've opened up in an
incredible new array of opportunities
and we've tied that in the machine
learning so when you look at something
like Kinect you know when connect came
out it was a revolution in real-time 3d
computer vision fundamentally based on
machine learning it was so revolutionary
that that it spawned entirely new an
entirely new wave of research in the
university environment because up into
that point knowing that no one really
had access to anything like that they
didn't have the underlying technology at
that price point in that scale but also
we demonstrated how by using machine
learning we could make that kind of
real-time 3d computer vision incredibly
reliable reliable enough that it can be
put at homes with children and dogs and
in grandparents and everybody else
that's their right and still be able to
work and deliver a huge amount of
satisfaction and value and entertainment
to people to give you a sense of how the
world's changing I'll give you a really
really simple example that is you know
it's funny it's remarkably powerful if
you walk into Microsoft Research and
building 99 which is on the other side
of 520 here on campus that's where our
main research building is if you walk
toward the elevator as you reach the
elevator the door will open for you
what's happening is we have a real-time
computer vision system that has been
trained to look at the movements of
people around the elevators and has
learned over a period of time there was
a long period of training has learned
it looks like when people want to take
the elevator versus what it looks like
when people are just standing around the
elevator so that as you walk up to the
elevator it knows that you're intending
to use it it's already called the
elevator and by the time you get there
it's there I mean it's so powerful that
that when the system was down a couple
weeks ago you know there were just
people standing in front of the elevator
right you know they'd forgotten about
pressing the button and and that's
really what by giving our computer
senses they can begin to anticipate what
we really need and by using advanced
machine learning we can understand well
enough people's intentions that it's
reliable enough that they begin to
depend on it and that's guy I think God
gives you a sense now another aspect of
these these natural interfaces is that
increasingly our offices and our
conference rooms are all outfitted with
you know touch displays that can
interact that we can interact with and
communicate with it's changing the way
we at Microsoft are doing meetings
certainly within the research of armor
we have a number of these now but it
also is opening up a whole new set of
possibilities about how can we change
the way we interact with these displays
using sort of natural interface
techniques in order to be able to do
better presentations and have better
meetings and environments I'm going to
bring out researcher function Kent
brunch and Lee who will show you
something called sketch in site where
she and her colleagues have been working
on on exactly though
so as Richter said we are creating a
completely new way for people to not
only explore but also presents their
data level using more natural interfaces
sorry I forgot turn the screen
leveraging more natural user interfaces
specifically pen and touch so sketchy
inside is a data enabled digital canvas
that allows you to create interactive
data charts through simple interactive
sketches so it extends the advantages of
the traditional white board by bridging
the gap between machine and whiteboard
so now I'm going to tell you a short
story about global energy consumption to
demonstrate how sketchy inside helps you
create more engaging presentations so
let's first see how much energy we
consumed over the years and say this
better here represent energy consumption
sorry pen didn't work well and see how
it has changed over the years the unit
here is a billion kilowatt as you can
see here the annual energy consumption
has doubled in 25 years why one obvious
reason is a population because more
people consume more energy so this time
let's say this stick figure represent
population and find out the population
change over the years and yes the
population has increased but not as
aggressively as energy consumption the
increase is from about 4.5 billion to
6.5 billion which is less than fifty
percent so let's consider some other
reason
like per person individual consumption
in this chart this light bulb represent
per person consumption and yes of course
it has increased and so far we've been
looking at things from a global point of
view but there must be some difference
between different parts of the world so
let's look at the consumption one more
time this time across different parts of
the world and as you can see here north
america and asia-pacific are the top two
consumers so let's focus on them and as
we all know Asia has a lot more
population than North America in fact
angels population is more than eight
times higher than North America's but if
you look at the poor person consumption
on average North American person
consumes about 7.5 times more energy
than asian average person but if you
look at more recent years then you
notice that the Asia started to consume
more energy than North America now so
this is end of my story and I'm hoping
that you are thinking of two things
first oh we are consuming too much
energy so we should probably cut back
and second more importantly wow that's
so cool how should how did she do it
yeah oh well for a full explanation
please come visit our booth later this
morning but for now I'm going to give
you a sneak preview of how sketch inside
helps us find a story to tell by briefly
switching to exploration mode so in this
mode we can load any tabular data such
as Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and here
you can see that i have several
different data sets available and using
sorry didn't work again using a small
number of simple sketchy gestures with
the system recognizing my text and
matching it against double over data
columns I can perform a wide range of
data manipulations to visualize and gain
insights saving any interesting findings
for later presentation so please come to
our booth to hear more about sketch
inside and try it out on a surface pro
yourself thank
that was great thanks this is a really
cool yeah I was I would I was telling
Washington yesterday that I really want
to take this with me on a trip and do it
do this for one of my presentations but
again you can see the the the
opportunity that now you know having the
sort of ubiquitous displays and being
able to build upon sort of much more
natural forms of interaction really
really create both for telling stories
but also for exploring data and being
able to analyze it now i'm going to tell
one last little story some of you may
have seen some of this already because
it got a lot of play on the internet
back in november back in late october i
was in China and for the last two years
I've been working with our speech
recognition and machine translation
teams with with a single purpose goal in
my mind which is I wanted to be able to
get up on stage in China and give a
speech and have it translated into
Chinese while I was talking it took a
while in a particular it took the
development of new technology which is
what's called deep learning or deep
neural networks for those of you that
are familiar with speech recognition for
a very long time now you know the the
recognition rates for general speech and
general settings I was our unrestricted
speech in general settings has been very
flat hovering around 22 to 25 percent
error rates meaning about one out of
every four words is wrong okay and that
that just hadn't budged for more than 10
years and about two years ago 18 months
ago some researchers working with
researchers to the University of Toronto
developed a new way of thinking about
how to do machine learning that could be
applied to this extremely difficult
learning task the speech recognition
task and this is that what's called deep
learning or deep neural networks and we
were the first ones to publish
a significant result in this new new
area in particular results around speech
recognition where would they were able
to show nearly thirty percent
improvement in speech recognition error
rates over previous techniques now
thirty percent in a field where things
had been like this for a long time
suddenly seeing the the chart go like
that that's huge but in particular it
got the system to a point where the air
rates were low enough that I that after
experimenting with it myself I felt like
you know I I could get on stage I could
actually try this out and I will say
that the team that was helping me were
way more nervous about being up on stage
to do this than then I was you know I
played around with the technology I was
feeling pretty confident about it they
were very nervous because of course
their jobs kind of depended on it
although you know one of the guys that
was helping to run the demo when we did
the rehearsal tonight before just to
test out because we were in this just
you know conference center in in you
know tengen China so you know it was the
first time we'd ever set the thing up
there and dealt with the acoustics was
on the night before he was kind of
nervous about and he said you know so if
you know if if this goes wrong do I get
fired and I say no no you know you don't
get fired your boss gets fired okay but
it was it was fun so I got up on stage
I'm going to show you a clip and the key
thing to keep in mind here is that you
know we're using the deep neural network
technology developed a microsoft
research to to do the underlying
recognition of my speech so taking that
to english text we're using the Bing
Translator technology which also comes
out of Microsoft Research to translate
that into Chinese text and then we're
using another technology developed in
Microsoft Research Asia which actually
uses my own voice and speaks Chinese and
takes the Chinese text and renders it
into speech in my voice so I'll let you
see the video can you roll video please
that I want to be able to take in this
process is to actually speak to you in
Chinese now the key thing there is we've
been able to take a large amount of
information from many Chinese speakers
and produce a text-to-speech system that
takes Chinese text and converts it into
Chinese language and then we've taken an
hour or so of my own voice and we've
used that to modulate the standard text
to speech system so that it would sound
like me so what you see now is the
result of that change I'm speaking in
English and hopefully we'll hear me
speak in Chinese in my own voice
again the results of our perfect there
are in fact quite a bit errors Jude will
improve on made there's much work to be
done in this area sighs your community
or consulate
with this technology is very promising
human to the T short videos you love and
we hope in a few years that will be able
to break down the language barriers
between people shooting info woman she
loved uncle taco
personally I believe this is going to
lead to a better world to of a Jew
Gentile champion thought that you I
hope you enjoy the rest of the
presentations today she moved into new
sea pups you had the chance
thank you all right so you get a chance
to see that you know of course i was
looking at lights I didn't really get to
see the audience very much the when i
was looking down there i was looking at
the monitor so i could see whether what
the things we're started working at one
point when i was looking off to the side
i was checking the guy behind the
curtain to see if everything was going
okay with the demo they were mics off
researchers in the audience though and
what was interesting was was the the how
affected the chinese students there were
about 3,000 chinese students there and
how affected they seem to be one of our
researchers said one of the young women
near him was actually crying you know
this is something they'd never seen
before you know and you know potentially
was going to be able to change their
lives so it's it's pretty exciting work
to give you a perspective on the error
rates by the way they they actually did
the the the recognition on my entire
speech and we had about a seven percent
error rate too that's really good I mean
to put that in perspective a human being
doing the same task typically gets
between two and four percent errors so
so we're getting very close to human
recognition rates with some of this work
and it's very very exciting
