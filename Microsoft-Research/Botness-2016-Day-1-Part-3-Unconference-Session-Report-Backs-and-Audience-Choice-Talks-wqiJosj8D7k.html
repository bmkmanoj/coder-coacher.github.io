about the need for and sort of strategy
about building shared resources that bot
developers can use so we talked a little
bit about I think to primarily two
topics primarily so one being like a
collaboratively curated open source set
of training data or like utterances so
just things like you know 5,000
variations on how to say yes or no or
stop or help so everybody thinks that
that's probably a good idea either for
use in like straightforward pattern
matching or you know training you know
bootstrapping your training training
data and then the other thing was
establishing some way of sort of showing
people the basic must-haves or like good
patterns that your BOTS should should
exhibit so ranging from things like
onboarding patterns like positive
onboarding patterns to things like you
know primitives for collecting certain
data types like a like a date or I guess
no or disambiguating you know an input
that needs to match a list so I think
the outcome was basically i'm going to
create a couple of github repos and like
seed it with some stuff and i will post
them in the botanist chat room and
various other places and we'll just get
this this going so if anybody knows of
these things that already exist please
you know feel free to share them and
there's some of that stuff that's
already built in like hidden away in
people's deep dark you know ten years
ago they built it and never never
released it so now the time to share
that stuff
so our group focused on personal BOTS I
will say that it was a bit of a sort of
like Wayback Machine moment for me
because I worked on the social web like
seven or eight years ago and I ended up
sort of going through this eka lilyc
moment of just kind of repeating myself
I don't know why it's sort of like this
tick that I have now and so we talked a
lot about kind of you know one what are
the use cases for personal BOTS one of
the useful when are they valuable what
do you want them to do for you what type
of interaction do you want with your own
personal bot how frequently do you want
to talk to your bot how often do you
want to update your bot do you want to
prove everything that your bot says
about you to the world should we ingest
all of your feeds and just sort of
automatically add all of your posts to
that bot and then have that bot repeat
those things when your friends come and
ask it things etc then there are some
other questions around what can you do
with a bot and how do you personalize
the output or the interaction of that
bot or what I might call your personal
agent for you so we talked a lot about
how one of the things that you know well
I'll put it this way if I think back to
some of the things that we were working
on with a lot of the OpenSocial web
stuff and I don't mean OpenSocial but I
mean social web that was open stuff back
in the day it was like how do you one
advertise the services that you use in
the web in a public machine readable way
to how do you identify reveal
information about yourself we developed
the number of formats for specifying
that information three how do you find
out where your friends are and where
your activities are we had formats and
stuff and specifications for that the
thing that becomes interesting is when
you can start to actually do
personalized output based on the viewer
or access ER of your bot so if for
example I access Esther's bot and I'm
able to prove to her that it's me let's
say because she gave me an OAuth token
because we just exchanged a lot of
tokens back and forth all the time then
the bot can actually personalize the
information or capabilities that she
exposes or shares to me in other words
if I provide the right token with the
right capabilities I could actually
write to her calendar and do certain
things so we sort of talked about a
number of things one what if we had our
own you know bought URL and at the end
of that bought your
I know Amir and I of again talked about
this a million times we had sort of a
BOTS text or me text or a robot subtext
that described yourself and in that
piece of information you had a bunch of
endpoints now I'm losing myself um I
just lost my train of thought hold on
it'll come back was I talking about you
know okay about Tommy and information
and accessing it oh right so the
question is how do you provide this
information in like a machine-readable
way well one of these you can do is you
could one type in the URL to your
personal information and then the bot
that's responding to you can personalize
its output to you right so here's all
the things that I want to use here's the
things that I know or your let's say we
build this little like bot tool this
personal bought tool it could generate
an image that you could share with bots
and those BOTS would know how to read
and just the information in that image
let's say if it's a picture of yourself
that has a bunch of QR code ish stuff
around it like the Facebook QR codes
then that information could actually
include information about for example
where you live one of the first
questions that a lot of bots asked me is
like where are you what languages you
speak well I'd like to be able to take
like 40 facts and just give it to these
BOTS or I could give it to a personal
bot let's say Esther's bot and it would
suddenly know oh this is chris oh you
can do these things so the question is
how do you make that information
portable how do you encode that
information what do you do with it and I
think that's kind of like where we spun
off into oblivion so that's that's where
we're yeah so our session was on on
killer BOTS actually was on the killer
use cases of bots not really apps as an
old at anyway um so we kind of went
around we went around and we discussed
and argued about things that were not
killer apps everybody basically proposed
something that they were doing that
someone else would like to shoot it down
and say that's not a killer app I
wouldn't use the bought for that so that
was sort of part of the conversation um
I think when we we then also may
distinction between sort of bots for fun
boss for fun entertainment to those kind
of things and then boss for function
where you want to get something done and
are these BOTS attempting to kind of be
faster better
/ basically some good increment on what
we have today or are they kind of 0 to 1
doing something that you couldn't do
will be very hard to do without thoughts
and now you can do without with bots
we're trying to make distinctions around
that and I think we came up with well
one one thing I think we talked about in
the end was that customer success
customer service was probably a very
strong entry point now for for BOTS
basically I've made a prediction
elsewhere that all brands within five
years are going to have their own bot
and in fact maybe we'll have many
different depending on function so I
think that's really a very interesting
on ramp and users are going to expect to
get through basically to talk to start
with bots and then ultimately get
through humans an interesting issue that
came up is that if you make it too easy
to get to people then there's you know
everybody wants to just click right away
and get to that person and then you get
the overload that we've had which is
what drove these hierarchical phone
trees and sending users away so I think
there's a tension there in terms of the
economics but that was one category
there were people in the group who had
onyx have a little a little star trek
communicator which opens up the power of
a voice-based group chat to everyone who
joins into this thing and has the
devices and then you can have BOTS
basically listening they made a whole
bunch of bots listing in context and
then triggering um I think another
category of things we talked about was
interesting is basically not typical I
asked the bot for this and get back some
response but basically proactive BOTS
you know bots that are pervasive bots
that are doing things passively in the
background so you know examples are the
things watching for when when there's a
discount on your Amazon product you just
bought and then they'll go and
automatically file for a refund or
things which are basically knowing
when's the right time to buy this flight
and they're just watching it happens or
I want this kind of department and it's
watching and proactively for you so
thinking outside the bot box not
something that we're always necessarily
having a 1121 dialogue but where we set
something and then the right actions
happen and then it can take action not
just learning us but possibly go through
the context that was the form of things
that people were thinking would be
really killer for them but I'll say we
were actually short of just like this
wide variety of amazing killer apps and
maybe that's because we only had
sort of eight or nine people in the
group but there was a lot of interesting
ideas and excitement what BOTS could do
hey so our group was just mostly me and
Greg and we were talking about Twitter
BOTS and basically what I learned is
that there's a lot of learning that we
can do from this history of Twitter bots
and he pointed out a few which I'll just
share some of the ones that stood out to
me is this one that spits out tweets
that are in iambic pentameter and rhyme
one that tweets pairs of anagrams there
was also a sorting hat one and yes I'm
in Gryffindor one that matches up logos
and what he pointed out is like I think
what a lot of people here when they're
building their BOTS are trying to tap
into surprise and delight and and humor
in conversation and a lot of these
people have been building bots on
Twitter for a long time that have tapped
into these things so just like thinking
about what can be what can be learned
from these art projects or fun things
that people are building on Twitter
short and sweet
hey so we did a platform versus startups
there's like a Royal Rumble now it was
actually really good so we had nine
startups and we had it's pretty
surprising actually had twilio Microsoft
Twitter slack kick and IBM I'll show up
and we asked basically half and half two
simple questions so we asked the
platform companies how are you
supporting companies and startups
building value on your platform and
there's really good stuff over there you
should go check it out I've just got a
quick summary one is just that they're
here they're showing up right which is a
big big deal there's some notable
absences and I think we should
appreciate you know the folks that have
shown up to work with us here on the
second one is that they're actually
working together right so you've got
microsoft and kick and slack and all
these companies actually interoperating
which is pretty weird actually I mean
it's actually really really good it's
good for all of us the tools I mean the
stuff that they provide for us to build
on is a big big part of it although you
know the early part of the discussion
was well we give you tools that's our
job right and like we need a lot more
than just tools from the platforms
another good point was there's they're
open sourcing stuff right so there's
this is also good so they're not not
every platform companies trying to
accrue all the value owned it and
monetize it which i think you know we
spoke about sort of saying maybe there's
broadly some thinking about where we
should open source and not open road
maps are good not every company is doing
it but every company probably should be
doing it although even that is not
sufficient right open enterprise sales
support so you know actually helping
train sales and BD teams about our
products and and start pushing them and
then surprising amount of the companies
actually have funds of you know
relatively large funds so that was sort
of how the company sort of the platform
company said we're helping you ever no
man where's Phil I just deleted my whole
Evernote ok so then we asked startups
what do you need from the platforms to
be successful move faster the first one
was money and everyone everyone who's
running a fund also it was kind of like
how do I get that money
I don't think there's ever an easy
answer to that but yeah this platform
companies who have fun should just tell
us how we can get it this one from Peter
it's a little harsh but it's true i
think the platforms are being thrown
together and you know stuff is coming
out really really fast and there needs
to be some more foundational thinking so
some of the stuff that's already been
said you know what are the specific
primitives and so you know we sort of
said this is like the web like the
webhead HTML and mobile had 20 year old
objective c and java api s and we have
send receive api's right so it's a real
problem and just like waiting for that
to get fixed and you know it came up
that we want to influence that right we
don't want to just wait for platform
companies to figure it out well everyone
in this room has ideas for primitives
platforms are shifting under our feet
just like more stability would be really
good I mean we understand that things
are changing but we need to know and not
just have stuff go down official partner
programs need to be put in place so this
is a solved problem right i mean we know
what partner programs look like from you
know a million years of enterprise
business like knowing where you are how
to get into the process where you are in
the process what happens timelines you
know we're all running on limited you
know cash so we need to be able to move
that along in my notes these are all
caps with four exclamation points
discovery how do you find bots right
monetization that's for ! how do we
influenced the design process like how
specifically do we get in a room with
you like this this is all this stuff
needs to be processed driven it's like
it's amazing that everyone's here but
like we need to know how do we push it
through and then lastly how do we build
sort of sustainable ecosystem because of
some of the things we said around lack
of transparency lack of ability to
influence we're all kind of building
there's probably a lot of overlap and
like nobody wants to compete with
Microsoft or slack we want to build
value that accrues there so being more
open so we don't have to do that would
be good but the main consensus was
actually sorry the last thing is we want
help from all the companies that did
show up
who after I stopped talking we have to
clap for because they're amazing for
being here have to guilt all the
companies that are not here which is
also on the board you guys should tweet
that directly at the companies that are
not here Facebook Amazon exactly so
that's it again thanks to all the
platforms that came and are here thank
you so there were two of us in the brand
marketing conversation we should observe
that the evaluations of Twitter Facebook
and snapchat are largely driven by
brands so brands are a other than the
VCS are a great source of money for an
ecosystem such as ours and so I think we
collectively need to start thinking
about ways to bring them into the
conversation because they have no idea
what we're talking about half the time
so the kinds of stuff that brands think
about are the cost of doing this stuff
the good news is every brand I talk to
is very uninterested in doing another
app because they understand what it
costs to build them and what it costs to
market them so this is a good time to
walk in the time to build it and to
build something interesting in terms of
a conversation and what does it take to
maintain it so when you think of brand
marketing you might think of just
advertising I don't think what we're
talking about for a while anyway has
anything to do with advertising I think
there's a lot of brand things that can
happen and one way to think about it is
to think of what chat as an alternative
to email and social media so if you're a
brand and you would like to talk to your
customers on a daily weekly monthly
basis the platforms that we're building
our great great way to do that
and so I think there's product
notifications there's people with
abandoned shopping carts there's lots
and lots of scenarios which people want
to track packages be a great UPS or
FedEx bot so that's what we think of
that's what I think of when I think of
brand marketing maybe marketing is the
wrong word but it's how do i maintain a
continuous relationship with a brand and
we happen to be sitting on a most
amazing interactive platform to do that
with all these modalities of talking
direct natural language although two
buttons to voice etc etc so this is
potentially a very exciting time for us
and so I think as we're building the as
we're building the railroad we should
think about the true the true client
which which are the thousands and
thousands of consumer brands around the
world thanks all right so we talked
about monetization and i think i should
note that this was more for brand or for
bots that were sort of platforms in
their own products and not bots that
were built as sort of like an ad so so
yeah i guess there were five five ways
that we came up with like traditional
app store sort of paper install like the
user pays to install the app but no one
really wanted to do that type of thing
traditional advertising like after an
interaction ends inside of an app you
can show them an ad there's payment and
sort of like a freemium model where you
get some stuff for free you have to pay
for other stuff that seemed to be pretty
realistic because everybody wants their
bought to have a lot of users I same as
apps you want a lot of users so you want
to offer it for free but then you want
to make money so you want to charge them
for whatever they're using it for it
there's a SAS model that we kept trying
to talk about but it didn't seem like
anybody had any really good ideas there
except for the sort of freemium SAS
model and then there were tools and tech
because we've experienced this and a lot
of other people experienced this people
go oh you got this cool platform why
don't you just sell that to people
they can make a similar bought but with
their brand and no one really wanted to
do that because we all want to own our
own our own brands and products and then
there was selling data which apps
consume a lot of data and it seemed like
it might be unethical in some situations
and maybe against the terms of service
it was actually called monetization and
when to do it because kick rent noted a
problem where they started they were
like okay we got BOTS we got a boat's
shop let's start monetizing this and
they ended up taking a step back because
it seemed like BOTS might not be ready
and so they wanted to get engagement
with bots up and get really engaging
BOTS into their store into their bot
shop and so that that's kind of what
they're working on now figuring out what
drives engagement before they charge for
it and they also realize this is
specific to their user base but they
don't have any money they're kids so
they introduced kick points and there
they're going to release an API to allow
you to consume those kick points so that
the freemium model could be done with
points that kids can actually get for
free because other brands have paid to
give them to them so that seems pretty
interesting one one thing that we spend
a lot of time on that kind of blew all
our minds when we realized it was that
monetization is platform specific as
different platforms have different ways
to monetize and there's one weird thing
that we that that we came across where a
certain platform some platforms charge
for integrations and so if you have more
than 10 integrations then if your
enterprise if your team on slack has
more than 10 integrations then you have
to pay so then the team goes in and goes
okay which of these integrations do we
not need because we're trying to avoid
paying and it's a weird situation where
if you're the 11th one you might not get
added or if you're the first one you
might get booted but you're not actually
getting a cut of that money even if they
decide to pay for unlimited integrations
so there was a weird thing there we
started talking about all the other
platforms that do it this was very
specific to one very specific person in
the group so but I think that it'll be a
symptom everywhere where you can
monetize like the platform's can
monetize on the bots but the bots need
to see some of that
money otherwise the bots disappear and
the then the platforms don't make any
money off of the bots you know you see
how that works so kind of that those are
the two main things that we came up with
it might it might be too soon to
monetize BOTS we got platforms got to do
a lot more learning and then
monetization is platform-specific thanks
hey run we run the metrics but metrics
talk I don't know a table and the
questions that were asked where how do
you measure bots what are the KPIs how
can we measure different BOTS and
different use cases and like what are
they clicks and views and users of the
bots so the questions that the answer is
that we came back with is that you can
have up like aggregate metrics which
don't tell you much but give you a sense
of the scale of the bots which is pretty
good if you're trying to compare
different bots in different use cases
but if you're going down inside
different but you'll start to see that
for example messages sent is not a
really good metric because for example
one bot can be just listening to the
conversation and sending one report a
day or a week and that would be a really
useful bod that you can actually pay for
like I know guys it's dad's but do and
another way that can be it could be a
conversational bot that leads you
through some kind of a story and there
could be like enormous amount of
messages and but you'll still have to
decide like is this like can you compare
those two so maybe like an even inside
10 but is it do you measure like the
total number of messages or are you
going to measure average number of
messages per user because there can be
one person who is really in gay
your character but who is talking a lot
to that bot and there can be a long tail
of people who just messaged one or two
times and never come back so what the
actual metrics of users retention are
actually similar to the apps the number
of messages you should question on what
is the actual use case there and is it
really possible to compare different
types of use cases like people were
talking about killer use cases of the
bots and as it's like can you compare it
two types of but I don't think that we
should do that like the answer that we
came up and like we're in our discussion
is that like you don't count Spotify
place against I don't know audible book
rats or something book listens so there
should be aggregated metrics at the top
and specific bot metrics for each of the
spots individually so yeah that's pretty
much it thank you
moderator excellent well yeah I have no
slides so chris messina actually already
said made a lot of the points I was
going to make so I'll try to enhance
them in some way I want to talk about
something really exciting i know it's
after five o'clock here i want to talk
about lawyers and accountants there's
this concept in the professions of
fiduciary responsibility and what it
basically means is that when you work
with certain kinds of professionals they
are obligated to represent your
interests and I'm a little bit concerned
and a little bit worried as I think
about this world that we're all talking
about here today about whose interests
the bots are going to be representing
I'll try holding this lower um so up you
know we taught we use this word agent to
sometimes intelligent agents is one of
the historical terms that bots have
emerged from and an agent is somebody
who represents you I am an author I have
an agent he represents me if he didn't i
wouldn't pay him and i wouldn't use him
when we first imagined bots a way back
we had this concept of the intelligent
agent that would represent the user go
out onto the net and do things for the
user and what i'm hearing and seeing
much more today is a vision of a world
where I the user remain a human being
out on the internet or you know in
digital space and I am surrounded by
this world of bots who are representing
all these other larger entities and I
wonder if I'm trying to get uh
particularly if we were talking about
transactions and purchasing something
I'm spending money or maybe I'm just
sharing some information how I as an
individual can have my interests
represented in a transaction in an
informational relationship I don't hear
a lot of that uh in in the conversation
yet here and I know that probably no one
in this room is interested in having
this become something that is in fact
legally regulated you know Congress
right now is having an argument about
the fiduciary responsibility of the
people who sell your retirement accounts
um you don't want to be in that position
five years from now after some scandal
or some story breaks about bots gone
wild you know kind of taking money from
people that they didn't intend to spend
and so you know to avoid that which i
think is a bad outcome for everyone I
think we need to think about now about
what kind of responsibility we have as
the creators of this environment to make
sure the users interests are represented
and Chris had some good ideas of ways of
starting down that road thanks Amy
Joakim amy-jo up oh maybe uh I've got
the list here if you're not going to out
yourselves oh wait Ben hello again oh I
love talking into microphones can I have
Scott sex for two and a half minutes
excellent now I probably won't need it
so you guys voted me up here to talk
about howdy and I don't really want to
talk about like you guys should use
howdy so I thought I would talk about
some really stupid problems that we
created for ourselves so howdy is a
slack pot it lives on your team and you
ask it to ask your peers questions so
one example would be like an agile stand
up what did you do today you know what
are your blockers whatever collects all
that information aggregates it puts it
on a wiki shares over the team that's
how it works so seemed like a pretty
straightforward problem to us when we
set
out on that path but we ran into some
really crazy problem so number one what
happens if to project managers schedule
a meeting at the same time or schedule a
check in at the same time it's a fairly
difficult problem to solve right because
howdy the bot dm's you when it has a
question to ask so if it if to if the
body is trying to DM you at the same
time with two different questions what
the hell happens you know by default it
basically just sends you two messages
and now you don't know which question
you're answering or and the bot doesn't
know which question you're answering and
there's no straightforward or obvious
way around that so we actually had to
build like a crazy queuing system and
micron job system so that it could like
not you know buffer that question for
later and then but then when do you pick
up later and like is the is your project
manager going to wait around for you to
answer those questions like later or
maybe you don't have time to do two
back-to-back so no no no good solution
it's actually a shitshow another one is
multi line input so sometimes the answer
to what you are you working on today
requires you to say more than one small
string and actually what we found very
quickly was that people would be like it
would say like hey Ben what did you work
on today and the person would be like uh
enter and now they're on to the next
question so and you know so when we want
to do this in a graceful way so like
what how can you how can you collect
several lines of input and then move on
to the next question without having like
an awkward like say done when you're
done like you wait 30 seconds and
there's no typing so you move on like
not a straightforward thing I have no no
solution to that problem at all time
zones you know time zones are difficult
to deal with any
days but um so one of the key functions
of howdy would be scheduling these
things right like 9am every day the
check-in happens well teams on slack are
distributed and they're not just
distributed around like Austin they're
distributed like you know it's half the
teams in India half the teams in error
in San Francisco so what does it mean to
schedule a 9am meeting and we thought
this was a fairly straightforward
question like it mean it 9am of in the
time zone at which the project manager
scheduled it but that turned out to not
be what anybody wanted they actually
wanted to run in 9am of in local time
wherever those people are and aggregate
all of those responses over like a
24-hour period into a one final document
how the hell am I supposed to do that I
mean I got a lot more complicated than
than we thought and then another sort of
similar one is like is the person at
work today like should I wait for this
person to answer before I move on to the
other people or like finish the job like
so you'd think that this would be an
obvious like something that's supported
in slack already right like there's an
away mode you could be offline you know
there's all these various signals and
and settings that you can have in slack
but none of them actually explicitly
mean I'm away so we we were again we
thought we were being really clever
we're just like if the person is marked
as a way we just won't send them any
messages and when they come online well
like say hey you missed some stuff while
you're away the we launch this thing and
like immediately people started yelling
at us because for a variety of reasons
right project managers were using howdy
to bring people online to get them to
come online and answer the questions
other people set themselves away to not
so that peace so that their peers won't
bother them or you know just as a social
indicator but that doesn't actually mean
they're away and then like what if
you're sick or on vacation like there's
not a route there's not our actual way
to say like hey slack I'm on vacation
for a week and I'll be back in seven
days and then you can send me messages
so really really
challenging problems to deal with from
an application standpoint uh yeah that's
it all right poncho
see if i can get this a screen fix up
there we go i think that's a lot better
so how many of you do not know what
poncho is ok we will solve this one very
quickly very easily ah poncho is a
weather cap it tells you the weather
pretty simple it is not a fox contrary
to what a lot of people ask we have a
lot of people actually ask is Pancho a
fox um yeah so for those of you that
don't know we just launched at Facebook
Developer Conference fa back in April
we've been doing the bot thing for about
two months now you turn that off I can't
I guess I can uh we have basically one
month to the launch of this Facebook
came to us and said hey we think ponch
is great you guys have been doing really
interesting stuff with SMS with the
email with your iOS app we want you to
do something on facebook Messenger we
had one month to figure this out it was
a big what the for us at the same
time we saw what was happening with
today's shall ice and some of these
other BOTS and we knew that we needed to
do something different we wanted to be
fun we didn't want to get caught up in
the bad feedback cycles that happen with
today so for us one of the biggest
concerns that we had was negative
feedback negative criticism and how to
deal with that one of the big things
with today was the screenshots actually
happen I mean I'm not going to pull up
any of those but you know it was
something that we were worried about we
did not want people taking screenshots
of Pancho's saying something bad
something terrible we wanted to keep it
pc enough but also be friendly enough so
one things that we actually did we built
an entire content management system
using reap script which is very similar
to rob superscript to allow our editors
to go in and actually write out a bunch
of different keywords phrases a raise of
things and be able to match on that so
this one for instance is a conversation
flow for how to deal with banned words
you know we don't want people coming in
saying a lot of nasty stuff so let's say
we're talking to Pancho bot and we say
the word panchal says hey that's
rude it will call you out the trick
though here is with sorry if you say
sorry it'll be like okay I forgive you
but if you say whatever we actually
ignore you for a couple minutes because
we don't want the you to continue trying
to harass the Bob trolling us whatever
else so I'll come in here L to say sorry
poncho forgives us um but you know we
can't do everything right people are
going to complain people are going to
find problems with us so for instance
this person try to talk to the bot got a
little bit uh carried away decided to
you know be like hey you keep on talking
to us typing us that happens um but it
then the day though like we are a
weather bot we're trying to do
interesting things let's see to do to do
now I'm not that one oh yeah so for
instance like you know there's a lot of
people that you know understand teen
lingo they understand things like BBL
you know LMAO lol there's a lot of
people that don't there's a lot of
actually old adults also using this
we're finding that to be a fun challenge
to do is how do we respond back using
normal language but also be able to feel
fun playful with our language yeah
that's that's about it I'm all
scatterbrained today so I apologize if
that was a big whatever um yeah if you
guys haven't talked to pancho you guys
should you should ask it the weather you
should talk to it we have a lot of
different conversation flows so you guys
can like say hey Pancho you know hey I
love you or whatever else so you know
even something as simple as sending
alike and be able to respond back and if
you guys ever have any questions you can
just hit me up you know G Looch you guys
can find me on the invite list for
botanist happy to talk to you has more
about this alright uh is the kick
conversation designer who looked very
confused still here but but willing to
give it a go awry that's the spirit so
my name is ali i work at kick as a
conversational designer i started off in
computational linguistics however the
issue with this topic is that it's
 broad so are there any specific
topics or specific types of bought
interaction
that you guys are fascinated with like
anything from health education gaming
okay so how do we avoid reinventing the
wheel is that concise enough around
conversation so when I first started a
kick essentially we started looking at
user inputs in order to create an AI
that would allow us to classify all of
this information into relevant fields
and answer them properly now that was
obviously a reinvention of the wheel
naturally but in order to avoid doing
this I mean we are in a stage of
tremendous collaboration which is
something that I've noticed here a lot
of the studies and a lot of the
learnings that we're having should be
shared so that would be one way of
avoiding that does that adequately
answer your question yeah
sure yeah right well now that since so
many of the platforms that are available
to create bots exist I would stress in
in my experience finding good creatives
now these are creatives that aren't
necessarily limited to just writing
stories but find people that are good
with improv find people that are good
with script writing and ensure that all
the conversations that you are creating
have the user in mind so yeah that would
be the that would be the ultimate
conclusion is fine great writers find
writers that really and truly give a
 about your audience so yeah does
that answer it a little bit absolutely
okay so I didn't realize I was getting
up again but I was paying a few minutes
ago to tell me apparently I was voted in
or something exciting and so I guess
I'll just kind of talk a little bit
about what happened with Esther ba why I
built it some of the things i learned um
and go from there so I built Esther
bought and the startup I was working at
so I'm a product market art if I was
working at was about to go out of
business we weren't able to secure
funding for the next round I've been
really interested in trying to build a
bot and I would have been playing around
with different frameworks and I was
trying to figure out what's an
interesting use case one that's not
necessarily business oriented but that's
more consumer-friendly something that
just like kind of like everybody could
relate to and I felt like well a resume
bought it makes a lot of sense and also
I'm going to be looking for a new job
pretty soon so you know timing so I
I built a strippa on top of smooch I
ended up open sourcing the code and it
was pretty cool almost 700 people have
since forked it and I've seen dozens of
variations of people creating their own
so a couple of things that I took out of
that experience constructing
conversation flows is pretty tough and
people love personality like gifts and
emoji and stickers and I would see that
because my initial bot was so basic it
didn't really couldn't couldn't really
respond to those things you just give
you like the same answer and over and
over again people just be like oh you
know terrible so then I implemented the
action buttons and i went from getting
an average of eight responses like you
know go go between back and forth and
that went up to over 20 and so I saw
buttons work just from like a really
practical numbers standpoint people stay
engaged a lot longer and also like the
feedback I was getting was more positive
I put it on facebook SMS and telegram
and I did a series of like posts about
it and I got the got some press and
everyone landed on the same landing page
where those three options were available
and it broke down to nine over ninety
percent of people chose messenger when
when given those three options and I
thought that was kind of interesting and
and so I decided to go all in on
building on messenger for the v2 which
you saw earlier today um let's see there
were definitely a lot of people going
off the rail and just trying to test it
and some of those conversations were
interesting to see I found scaling
conversations is really challenging
granted it was just me behind the bot so
when there were dozens of people
interacting with it in a day it was
challenging for me to then jump in and
and there was a connect with me option
and so people had an expectation of I've
been an immediate
answer and so having some kind of guard
rail there with here here are the times
or what not is what really motivated me
to add that feature in Chris's and just
from like some random statistics
standpoint I ended up getting over eight
got eight interviews and three actual
offers from jobs like intercom smooch a
couple other companies directly from the
bots like what I built and them
interacting with it and so yeah I think
that it proved that it's a like a use
case that's actually viable and there's
something interesting here so that's it
Thank You Esther all right Allison are
closed out talk for the day and then
we're going to be heading the Waxman's
hey guys my name is Allison behringer
and I host and produce a narrative
documentary style podcast called the
intern and I work out of beta works and
a Brady tag made to talk and so just
wanted to share a little bit about about
what I do so I do not have a tech
background at all I used to be a teacher
work in the nonprofit space so when I
was hired to make a podcast about what
it's like to work in tech and live in
New York City it was kind of my first
introduction to everything so I kind of
out a parade is like an insider outsider
to this world and and so kind of to like
really quick stories about that when I
first sat down in the morning and
everyone was introducing themselves i
was kind of taking notes on who I wanted
to talk to and just like kind of like
what they looked like or what they were
wearing and I looked at my list and
realized it was like you know this
person their name why I wanted to talk
to them like blue plaid shirt and it was
like pink plaid shirt like light blue
plaid shirt and then the other thing is
that so i watch Silicon Valley for the
first time like years ago and I just
didn't I didn't get it at all like i
didn't understand why it was funny and
then it came on after Game of Thrones
the other week and I started watching it
again like for the second time and I was
like this is hilarious I totally get
that so at that moment I was kind of
like all right I think I'm kind of
stepping in a little bit more to the
insider side of things so like in in
each episode I kind of asked a bigger
question about the tech world and then
kind of try to see it through the lens
of my own experience so like one of the
first episodes I asked the question
where does all this money come from like
why is it that i'm eating kind bars and
like stashing five in my backpack every
day and we're all drinking free beer and
none of these companies are making any
money and like I get it but like really
like where does that money come from and
like okay it comes from the VCS but
where does that money come from and in
so I kind of bring like a healthy dose
of skepticism I think the things and
also just make it relatable as someone
coming from the outside looking in I
think one of the best episodes I
documented my experience asking for a
raise so that's episode 5 you want to
check it out and so with that in mind
like the outsider perspective I thought
I'd just share some questions that I
have coming into this the botanist space
and okay so one thing I've noticed is
that companies in beta works and in the
space suddenly started incorporating bot
strategies into their companies and my
question is like this was touched on
earlier but in some ways it is fueled by
venture capital money but like to what
extent and how does that work why is the
bot bot topic so polarizing why are some
people so staunchly opposed to this new
thing and some people are so behind it
how is this different than smarter child
which I talked to in middle school on
aim like what what is new what is new
here and how our BOTS going to monetize
and why do people scoff when I ask this
question and also like what's with all
the jargon I'm really interested in like
how ideas come today and how trends
become something that we're all going to
jump on this train and get behind how
did the word bot come about and we had a
really interesting conversation about
that so that's pretty much it it's
really interesting being here with you
guys and yeah if you want to download
the podcast you can get itunes overcast
soundcloud it's called the intern thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
