of Syria extent to Siri which Siri works
on practically relevant syncs is about
drew me to computer science my PhD
original is mathematics and I in fact
started to publish in mathematics and as
I discussed it in our group mathematics
papers often start on with saying that
make x1 up to xn be some numbers without
any description of why I should care
about the problem that they are about to
solve here in a computer science field
you have to repeatedly explained by and
to the what extent you care about the
problems you're trying to solve and I
think this is really important it's
important to make this make people
express the reasons and think about the
reasons over and over again to make sure
that what they work on is relevant
I don't think computer science is I feel
this perfect and some of our research is
still not on the most relevant questions
but at least we are trying and making
people express it over the last twenty
years I think the computer science
community got more in many ways more
United and was appreciating Siri from
the other sites or from non citizen side
and also from Syrians working
hand-in-hand with people in other areas
putting theory to practice there's a lot
more we can do but I think we're making
progress and I'm happy about the
progress more than they stressed about
the remaining distance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
