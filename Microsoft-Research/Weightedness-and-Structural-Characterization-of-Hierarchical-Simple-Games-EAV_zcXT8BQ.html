hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
right so it's my pleasure to introduce
Tatiana Vaz Dava will be talking about
weighted hierarchical simple games to
give it up here so if you have questions
ask me don't hesitate so okay so this
dog actually will be about simple games
and secret sharing schemes so I will
tell you about both hold this and I will
show you a connection between them so
first let me start a very easy example
so this one 11 scientists working on a
secret project they wish to walk off the
document in a cabinet so that the
cabinet can be open if and only if six
or more of the scientists are present
what is the smallest number of blocks
needed and what is the smallest number
of keys to the locks each scientist must
carry so very easy question but the
answer is kind of not so easy so more
than 400 locks and more than 200 keister
scientist and this is the easiest upset
so you can guess it's not very pleasing
to carry around 300 keys just open one
door so it's not effective actually so
in practice no one will do it so it
means that if I have a problem so if you
want to lock a door and open it so what
we want we want to find an ideal way to
open this door so to find our secret so
it means that if you have non-qualified
set of player of people down ah yeah so
then they cannot open the door actually
and one more is that the size of bike
the number of keys cannot be such big as
more than 200 so it should be normal
it's not like do in
third four digit PIN number you need to
memorize 1 million digit number so it's
it's not reasonable in real life so this
is like what we want I will be more
precise in this but just the rough idea
what is there like ideal way to hide our
secret so let me start with some
definitions so we have a set of
participants salty as usual and we have
a subset of this set p 0 a subset of
power set of tea and it's called an
access structure so color sets in this
gamma are called authorized collisions
so now also we have a set of secrets or
a set of keys secret keys so this is
just key set also we have like in real
life usually maybe a computer or a
person so someone decides the secret so
someone needs to choose a secret and
after this this someone gives each
participant some information so there is
some guy who gives you so you give you
some numbers for example and we don't
know who is this guy maybe it's computer
but doesn't really matter just this
person exists and so this information
which is given to every person is a
share and all set of all possible shares
is called the share set so a secret
sharing scheme realizing the excess
structure gum is a way to distribute and
reconstruct the secret so it's like if
we have a look at these definitions
excess structure is actually our
situations there are our situation so in
the scientist example yeah in the
slightest example what we have we have a
set of participants it's 11 and actually
I will use this notation because it's
faster to write this and so the excess
she's just all these subsets which has
more than six six or more people in them
so this is the excess structure but how
we divide out how we hide out a secret
and how we divide shares it's just a
different story so in these keys and
locks so the key set is just an open so
this hour open door problem and a share
said is any subset from consisting of
252 keys so a lot of them so but we can
look so this is one way to divide this
secret and this is so this thing with
locks and keys is secret sharing scheme
so another way is I for example i will
say that my key set now is a number from
finite field and my share set is also
fine i feel the same final field so what
do i do so i just this dealership so he
or she generates a random polynomial
such that so we have so six person six
people can open the door so the order of
this polynomial is five and actually k
is the secret so now what does he do so
he gives to every person this pair so i
and p of y for example he gives first
person just be off one 2nd p of two and
so on and so forth actually if you have
numbers on each person you don't need to
give them i well so and in this way
actually it's very effective because you
can see that just our key is just a
number of some finite field and our
share is the number of the same final
field so it's kind of it's very good
situation and actually it's the ideal
situation we are looking for this one is
very well known scheme it's called
shamir scheme maybe you heard about it
and actually it's pretty funny
because if you have a look at some
newspaper it's only two pages and if you
have a look how many citations has I
think it's more than 10,000 citations so
only two pages and 10,000 citations so
it's very popular because if you write a
paper in secret sharing scheme you
always know how put his name in it so
there is this one is really popular and
actually I think it's the beginning of
secret sharing scheme so just because
this one shows a way to how to actually
hide your secret so effectively so a
scheme is called perfect if it satisfies
to natural properties so the first
property is that and authorized set of
people can actually determine the secret
so it's reasonable okay so if you you
are supposed to know this secret of
course you can actually determine it so
it's normal and the second one is that
any unauthorized set of people have no
idea about the secret so from their
point of view so they all even if they
know the possible secrets like the
possible field for example finite field
for from their point of view all numbers
in these fields are likely to happen so
the probability of every number is
absolutely the same so this is a perfect
so it's like natural thing we want to
ask from secret sharing scheme from any
secret sharing scheme and also usually
people think that access structure
satisfied monotonicity because it's
again it's reasonable if you have enough
our eyes set of people and some person
joins them of course they will remain
authorized so they can still determine
the sequence it's okay maybe this person
is very ugly and there
ad and who knows but it's not the case
so usually people suggest people think
only about monotone extra structure
there are some papers about non monotone
extra structure but only peel them so
it's not very popular okay so what is
the monotone is that if you have okay
it's correct if you have a set from
excess structure than every superset of
this set is ox is also an excess
structure so there is a theorem of these
three guys so they prove that for every
model x structure there is a perfect
secret sharing scheme so it is actually
cool so we have a reasonable way to
divide our secrets we always have this
reasonable way but at the same time so
if you look at the proof so they use
boolean functions to prove it so they
construct some boolean functions and so
on and so forth so in this proof yes
this traffic secret sharing scheme
exists but it can have these problems as
we had in scientist problem so it's like
to open to find out four digit number
maybe you have to memorize 1 million
digit number so it's like your share
maybe 1 million digit number and that's
that's the reason why it's it can be bad
yeah it's perfect but at the same time
it can be bad so from this point so we
have to look so we somehow need to deal
with this property so somehow we need to
do that our share should be reasonable
compared to our secret key and this is
the noting of informational actually
it's not the unique decision there are
plenty of them so you can check
different places and they will be
different some of them use entropy some
of them use this ratio is other way
around
and so on so a lot of different
definitions but more or less almost all
of them I experiment so what is the
information read rate is just the ratio
of number in of the secrets to the
number of this shares so it's not hard
to show that actually this information
rate is always less or equal to one so
if this information rate is one this is
an optimal solution actually it's the
best possible we can do it's like it
means that number of Secrets is the same
as number of shares possible shares so
and because of this this schemes a code
ideal so first you need to be perfect
and you have to have information rate of
one and after that URL ideal of course
in real word oh so we are highly
interested in idea of secret chain
schemes because they do everything we
want so they are very informational
efficient and they do all these nice
nice properties biggest so unauthorized
people can do nothing for our to our
secret and so on so it's really cool of
course we're interested in idea of you
could change skins but these guys so
they proved that unfortunately there are
extra structure which doesn't have ideal
secret sharing scale so even though they
have perfect secret sharing schemes they
can be not ideal so information rate can
be awful action
no no actually so everything yeah oh so
monotone so for non monotone just I
don't know much about it because there
are only few papers and I haven't look
at them so but this guy that just shows
an example there is example and it
showed that information rate is kind of
really bad in any secret sharing scheme
you can imagine information rate will be
bad anyway so okay so what's the problem
what's the biggest problem where they
have in secret children screaming just
to try to characterize all access
structure which can be represented by
idea of Secretariat schemes because it's
very practical we really want to know so
if we have some situation so we really
want to know that there is a way to to
share our secret efficiently and this is
a really big question and it has no
answer because no one knows how to deal
with that so but usually oh but they
have one there is beautiful tube in
secret sharing scheme so there was a
very cool paper by brickell and
devonport and they showed the connection
between I yield secret sharing schemes
and Metroid so if you don't know what is
metroid just think of it as the
generalization of linear independence ii
actually so it's kind of like that so
first of all a secret sharing scheme is
connected if every participant is not
dummy so that means just I mean so if
every dummy is a person who is
absolutely unneeded so it has no value
so if coalition was authorized
unauthorized we add this person it's
still on for rice so it has no value it
just unleaded person so it's like and
they proved that actually if you have a
connected
deal secret sharing scheme then there is
a connected Metroid which corresponds to
it so this this Metro it is unique and
you can find it in not easy but you can
find it so this relationship is not so
easy it's not transparent it's like you
need to play around with numbers and so
on but actually for small numbers you
can do it and to to deal with idea of
secret sharing schemes people actually
use this theorem so there is another
theorem which works in a different
direction and actually it forms another
open question is that they also these
guys they prove that if you have a
representable Metroid then it
corresponds to ideal secret sharing
scheme so it's like but only
representable not all Metroid's so and
this is the question so it's still open
is there a non representable majority
which corresponds to ideal sick of
sharing schemes it's unknown oh it's
kind of so metroids it's like it's a
generation during generalization of
linear independence II but actually not
also some of them you can represent and
as matrices can be represented as
mattresses also some field so not all of
them can be represented this way so only
like some part so this is exactly only
this Metro wastage which can be
represented as a matrix a special matrix
they are connected to idea of secret
sharing schemes so maybe there is known
representable but no one knows so guys
from Metroid theory they tried to do
something but maybe they were not so
serious about it and they didn't have
results love it
somewhat near functions so if your
access team is some modeler so if you
have an access that you can think of
your access function as a set function
right it's a set function is a movie you
give it a assess it and it will say 0 or
1 mhm this set will not get x axis this
set will get that movement and it has
more about properties that such that if
I said its value 1 than any element or
any other subset with a union which with
when it's sort of merged into this pit
will also get what anything is know if
this edge function is submodular so we
can discuss it official you are you
aware of some modular oh nope no
salience ok so I think that is a
connection there which is very
interesting between submodular functions
and Metroid that we can discuss probably
or crime yeah it'll be good idea so i
will tell you so for now I'm just
telling me about secret sharing schemes
so now i will start with game field as
well so this is all about secure chair
and stuff so i just said that people
actually use this connection and it's
not trivial so the this paper is very
technical and this work I it has very
bad intuition behind it so there is like
a lot of some strange objects and you
say ok this is your sets of Metroid's
and it's strange ok good now so let's
return to this problem so we have we
want to characterize all excess
structure which can be realized by idea
of secret sharing scheme so actually the
problem is like that something like that
so it's completely undescribable so try
to describe this picture ok good luck I
don't think I think it's kind of
impossible always so what do they do in
recent years they try to look like some
small piece of this problem so instead
of considering the whole excess
structures maybe they just can some can
consider only class of access structures
and in this case
so maybe it will be easy much easy so
this is the approach they use okay and
now we are going to games so this is a
simple game so maybe you know it in
different different definitions because
there are some of several of them so
what is the simple game is you have a
set of players and simple games is to
pair of two sets thirsty set of players
second is a subset of power side of P
which satisfies I which is closed on the
taking supersets so actually usually
coalition's from w codeine and coalition
is not from w cold losing so maybe you
know just the simplest thing you can
imagine in voting games so then your
function is from is to the just 0 and 1
so this is any small town this is a
simple game so how it's connected
actually CZ mother from simple game so
simple game is actually mod on extra
structure and that's the advice of their
sister the same object just we think
about different questions in game theory
and i think different question in sacred
sharing schemes so I'm on you so we want
it so they wanted to look at some
classes of access structures and
actually now I will be I will be using
simple games because it's easier for me
and I'm used to vegetation so okay so
these guys they actually did a very good
job so these guys in 2008 and these guys
in 2011 they published two papers and
this paper stake characterize our fresh
hold secret sharing schemes oh no fresh
hold excess structure this is the right
man and I will tell you in a moment what
is it what is threshold exit structure
so the main point is that they gave a
theory that threshold access structure
can be realized by I yield secret
sharing schemes if you
have these free nice conditions so it's
so it is hierarchical of type 1 so
doesn't really matter what is it so it's
highlight hole 52 and it is a
composition of these two so very easy
characterization so the proof is not so
easy by their character Henson looks
nice okay and very interesting things
that these two papers say they
characterize threshold access structure
but here they have different types of
hierarchical games and actually i will
show you why it is like that so fresh
hold excess structure all is the same as
pocket measure it again so just we have
non negative players Wade's we have a
real number quarter and the collision
you mean if and only if it exceeds
quarter so easy so now what do we want
okay just simple example with scientists
assign wait 12 every scientist and 406
very easy so now Indians a paper these
guys they one step of their
characterization was the characters like
characters okay to describe all already
did justify ecology so actually this is
a just the beginning of the work so a
caddy and Ally they go in service so
this is the beginning of the work we
want it to try so something which is
known which we wanted to try and
approach it from game theoretical point
of view so all these results they are
known but we want you to try and play
with them using simple games tools so
and this is exactly what we did so so
what is this junk is hierarchical simple
games like what kind of funny so
consider this example so we have a
monitor stone from one bank to another
and if the sum is really big then this
transaction must be authorized by three
senior tellers or two vice presidents
and
but you do sing your tailors and the
vice president can also authorize the
transaction so in this case we have two
levels of people in our bank so first is
very mighty powerful vice president and
the second class and senior tailors so
they're less influential but baby so how
can we represent this situation so we
have these two levels and to authorize
the transaction we need either two vice
presidents or three people from first
two levels so what so you can easily
check that if you have three people from
these two levels it means that either
you have two vice presidents and once in
your tellers and it means okay it's of
course you cannot rise or you have one
vice president and two senior tailors
and that one is good as well and
actually the last one the last variant
is three senior tellers and so this is
exactly the situation we have so just
represent the vice president's if we
have cajon from the same form or
everybody uses senior data but just the
vice president the four agents has
higher weight in the weighted voting age
so their ways will be 1.5 times the
weight of a senior and right because
then they big actually this is a tricky
question and I also it's the end I will
show you when it is possible and what is
not so so this game is actually actually
not always waited only in some cases
only in some special cases so and to
generalize this idea what do we do okay
just forget about this definition so we
have levels em levels of players so on
the top we have the most powerful guys
after that lesson and show and so on and
so forth so now to win in this game what
do we need to do we need
either k 1 players from first level or k
2 players from first two levels or k
free players from first three levels and
so on and so forth so it's like to win
in these gays gay you need to satisfy at
least one of these conditions so this is
exactly why it's called disjunctive
because you have or junction and here
you should be careful because we wanted
to to use this construction but it's
like we don't here in in our model that
who are these guys on this level so if
you have vice president's Bob Ellison
John so we don't care who is going to
sign it sign so just one of them is
enough and we don't care whose it so
it's like instead of looking at the set
of players like 1 2 3 blah blah blah and
so on so we are looking at multi set so
in this multi said we have like this one
it means we have in one place on the
first level and two players on the
second level and so on so we don't
distinguish between players on the level
so we don't care about that so this
notation is so we can actually use it
it's not hard to prove and now so we
want to work with this deed junkie
hierarchical simple games but they are
kind of tricky because we have one
situation but describe it in two
different ways so for example here to
make a delicious juice so we need to
either two oranges or six foods from the
there's two level or seven fruits from
the three levels so but if we have a
look at this second condition so if you
want to reach six from first two levels
even if you take all apples or four
apples you need to have two oranges so
it means you meet this thirst condition
so this second condition is actually
redundant it doesn't help at all so so
this is equivalent sedation
so we just have oranges and apples so
actually we want to understand so we
want to work with this one so we don't
care about that one so because it's like
you can divide these levels again and
again and again and make it so a lot of
different present a representation of
the same game but we are not interested
in it so we want to work in something
like something rigid and so we want to
find out conditions on this when there
are our game has this normal
representation short so what do we look
so we have this theorem okay just don't
look at it again and so this theorem has
two conditions first condition is just
that if you actually if you say okay any
two vice-presidents can authorize that
transaction it means you have at least
two vice-presidents otherwise it's
useless if you have only one guy who is
vice president's why do you why do you
need this room it's stupid so it's
redundant so this is the first condition
and the second condition is a little
more tricky so it's like you have em
levels and you take so it means that if
you take these collisions from first i
minus 1 levels and it is losing it
doesn't reach any of this threshold and
it contains this number so ki minus 1
minus 1 players so if you add the whole
eyes level then this coalition is win so
the meaning behind this condition
actually is that every new level add new
winning coalition so and that is it so
just standard notation but just in case
if you don't remember them so the
passers if all collisions containing a
player is a winning then these players
called the passer so it's like this guy
he is self-sufficient he's winning by
himself but at the same time you can
have some different winning coalition
which doesn't contain them so
and another one that i told you about is
it that mean so you have winning
coalition's if you remove dummy it's
still winning and if you have losing
coalition's you add dummy it's still
losing so no one cares about this guy so
what is this is characterization of
disjunctive hierarchical simple games
which are weighted so please memorize
everything now I'm talking so this proof
we are using just simple games so the
tools which are used in simple games
actually so I will picture this theorem
more nicely so it's like as you said if
you want to know so can be this
situation represented by weighted
majority games then you have only
several situation actually if you have
won only one level of care of course you
are waiting in a weighted vest if you
have two levels then this game is
weighted only in some special cases
first if your second condition is k plus
1 so and the second one there you have
two levels is that you have special
number of players on the second level so
this actually this number of players
means that if you want to reach only the
second threshold not the first one you
need to have all players on the second
level and only them so after that you
can add level of passers on the top so
take everything else and add level of
passers and after that just take
everything from here and add a level of
dummies and this is exactly all higher
disjunctive hierarchical wicked games
and nothing else so only like you can
see on this like few small amount of
hierarchical games are waiting so what
we did here is so like in simple games
if you want to show that game is not
weighted its you need just to find a
certain comet oriole object and okay if
you can find it
okay so your game is not weighted in
this case so what we did is just in all
other cases which is telling this object
and show okay this is it we are good so
all these games are not weighted and in
this case is all you can do just fine
weights and it's also easy so the proof
is very easy you don't need Metroid's it
hung any connection between my choice
you just need no to know some simple
stuff just to play we set a little bit
and nothing else actually so um now we
have a very similar game so there is
similar situation so they use UN
Security Council so it consists of five
permanent countries and in 10
non-permanent countries so message
requires at least nine countries and
every permanent country has a veto power
so in this case we can represent this
game in a different way so again we have
two levels so on the top we have five
perennial countries and the second level
non-permanent countries and but to win
in this game we need five players from
the first level and nine players nine
players from the two levels so you can
see instead of we have to reach all
fresh hold we need to satisfy all
threshold in this game so it's kind of
it's very similar but instead of all we
have end now so we need to satisfy all
conditions and you can generalize it
easily since like you have n levels and
you need k1 players so first level K two
players from first two and so on so
forth so all conditions should be
satisfied and this is conjunctive
hierarchical games so in any area you
how do you have dual objects and theory
of voting games is not an exception so
we have a dual game so n is defined very
simply they have the same set of players
but the set of wing collisions are is
set of compliments of losing colleges of
initial game so and you have this nice
property that if you take duo twice it's
the same as initial game so it's nothing
very surprising now actually and I told
you before that there are two papers
about characterization of fresh hold
excess structures so but two of them
they have different kinds of
hierarchical games in them so one of
them have these junkie and another one
has conjunctive so it's like they are
very similar but the games they use one
conjunctive another one disjunctive so
we thought it's there should be
connection and actually there is so
these two games these two types of games
they're duo to each other so there but
they're not dude with the same key so
the key changes so I you have a
conjunctive hierarchical simple games
and just slightly so you take a do and
it will be disjunctive hierarchical
simple games but with slightly different
King with slightly different threshold
you need to adjust this threshold and
there is a simple formula with for this
adjustment so it's like if you have this
duel property you can easily prove all
the series what which i showed you
before just using this duality so for
example these redundant levels you can
just simply drag it through duality and
show that the condition actually are the
same as in the previous case and also
you can get this weighted conjunctive
hierarchical games characterization
which looks very similar but now so it's
like the first case is the same the
second case is actually the same the
third case is the same but the fourth
one is if you remember in the previous
case we had pastors here but now we have
these special players which are very
very powerful it means that to win in
this game you need to have all
all these players in your collagen so
actually for example like in the UN
Security Council to win you need all
five countries otherwise it's no good
yeah they alway de Paris actually and
another one this the final situation you
add dummies so this one you can easily
get you just drag all the result you
just drug through the duality and it's
good so it's simple nothing really
complicated so after that we wanted to
think okay so this is what we try to do
do so we try to do some some stuff from
excess structure or some secret sharing
schemes using methods of simple games
but after that we thinking okay so now
again we done this characterization it's
easy to be done and but we have some
strange questions so all right go games
they are nice there are a lot of
examples in real life but at the same
time if you have a simple game so just
like simple game list of winning
colleges for example only but is it
hierarchical or not so how do we know
which one is hierarchical which one is
not and actually the answer is quite
easy and beautiful as well so there is
the desirability relation so maybe you
know it but I just reminded so J is at
least as desirable as I if for every set
which doesn't contain this I and J we
have that X with high winds than X with
j winds as well so if this relationship
if this binary relation is complete or
total we total other turn based game is
called complete game or linear games
sometimes so actually we need one more
definition so again winning coalition is
called chips minimal winning collision
first if every proper subset is losing
and if you take these coalition's take
out a player and put lessons
when shall one then it it turns losing
as well so this is a shift minimal
winning coalition so in similar way you
can define shift maximal losing
collisions is like every proper superset
is winning and if you take out a player
and put more influential one this car
collision will be winning so just every
complete game can be defined but
uniquely defined by its set either shift
minimal winning coalition's or shifts
maximum losing carnations so now it
turns out that actually hierarchical
games they are complete games so we have
an order so as you could see we have
these levels and top level is the most
powerful level so we have like one is
the most powerful 2 is less powerful and
so on and actually the most annoying
guys here are the last 10 or so there
they have almost nothing so and so if
you have a simple game and this simple
game has a unique shift maximum losing
collagen then this game is to junk the
hierarchical game and if you have a
simple game and it has a unique shift
minimal winning coalition then it is
conjunct fire game so it's actually it's
easy to decide which one is it and as we
can see in this case so if you want to
try and model the power of your players
with weights for example or in this case
with levels these two are completely
different approaches because they
intersect only in on like small amount
of cases as you saw so
I tell you that this is just the
beginning of this work so Arkady and
Ally they're trying to so this is it was
actually done so we just played a little
bit and try it is it good a lot is it
interesting honor so I know that Pedro
he is trying now to describe all
complete simple games which can be
realized by ideal secret sharing scheme
and Arkady and aleve they are trying to
characterize all roughly weighted simple
games which can be realized by the ideal
secure chains king so roughly what it
means that in weight it you just have
your fresh hold everything which is
below the first threshold is losing
which is above the threshold is winning
and on threshold you have only winning
coalition's but roughly where did it
means that here is losing here is
willing but fresh hope now is special
you have wind and losing conditions on
this first hole so it's like one special
point where you have winning and weights
of losing and winning coalition's at the
same time so they trying to generalize
these weighted simple games to roughly
weekly sinking games so they have some
results but it's not ready yet so thank
you that's it yep that's all just to
apply characterization to the access
structures so because they don't did I
help at all actually finding the ideal
sharing um no not now so I so I did only
this part of work but I know that Arkady
and Ally they are trying to push this
ideal stuff to simple games as well
because the object essentially is the
same so they're trying to figure out
maybe there are some conditions on
simple games which we can like say okay
if these conditions are satisfied then
there is an idea of secret sharing
scheme so they are trying to do it but
I'm not sure how successful they are
right now also it seems that this
duality concept so it seems that duality
it so if you have a simple game which
has an ideal secured sharing scheme then
duo of this game has an ideal secret
sharing scheme as well so we haven't
proved it but it seems correct because
from this like we have disjunctive and
conjunctive they are dual to each other
and actually they are ideal as well both
of them is it easy to find the ideal oh
yes of course so this is scientists
example with polygons polynomial yeah
chummy scheme is ideal so if you take
any game like like you have n players
and if you have K or more players in the
coalition then it's it wins so this game
is always ideal it's easy so there are
some generalization they have like
geometrical interpretation and the
simple games they are kind of more
complicated but still it's far from the
full customization so just some some
results there are some results this
direction so we wanted to try to single
it's not about metro it's only but like
simple games so that's it basically</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
