our first external speaker dr. Hermann
Hauser
so Herman has been around in Cambridge
for a very long time he's a what you
call a a serial entrepreneur so he's
been involved with many many companies I
believe in the early in 1980s he was one
of the cofounders of icon computers and
some of you will remember those times
because these were the years of the BBC
micro which was very big and UK school
education and is still very famous for
that afterwards Herman has been involved
in in many startups now big companies
for example arm and a whole lot of
company so a very successful career Ness
received many honours and we are pleased
for him to have come in today to talk
about the evolution of innovation thanks
so much thank you well thank you very
much for your kind introduction and good
morning ladies and gentlemen I'll talk
to you today about the evolution of
innovation and I innovation has been
around for a long time almost as long as
the human endeavor of improving our
lives and I will start off with a sort
of rush through history with 24
general-purpose technologies these are
the colleges that are so general that
they've affected all of our lives and
they've some people have counted 224 so
far then I will pick one of these
general-purpose technologies which is
computing and tell you about the six
waves of computing and then talk about
the the general aspects of these
computing waves how they clash
interestingly a new wave doesn't coexist
with an old wave it typically kills the
old wave and it's a it's a very
interesting case a historic case that
has repeated itself every time so far
then the peculiar unlikely story of a
local company called armed
it's a spin-out from my first company a
chrome computers it originally stood for
a con RISC machine now advanced RISC
machine which has become the world
most successful microprocessor but also
a company that hardly anybody has heard
of so Pat I will show you how peculiar
it is that a small Cambridge company
well not so small anymore is giving
Intel such a hard time and it's it's a
classic example of a flash of waves and
I'll finish off with some remarks and
artificial intelligence in particular
artificial general intelligence which
I'm sure you're all very excited about
because it is with without a shadow of a
doubt the most exciting thing that has
happened in computing and arguably in
the history of mankind and then end up
with some conclusions so let's start off
with these general-purpose technologies
they were first described by a professor
at Vancouver University called Richard
Lipsy and he said that a technology
becomes a general purpose technology if
it affects the entire economy if it
affects all of us
now it often has very serious
consequences
it makes the old technology obsolescent
it causes a lot of temporary
unemployment so far all these
technological revolutions have always
created more new jobs or bid different
jobs as it has destroyed old jobs and
one of the great fears that we have
about artificial intelligence and in
particular artificial general
intelligence is this that this might not
repeat itself because the changes are so
fast and I'll give some examples of that
so let's start off with the first seven
general-purpose technologies that Lipsy
described well you go back the mystic
ation of plants and animals and the
smell Turing of ore and of course the
whale I just pick one of them that I'm
sure you will all agree was a useful new
technology that people thought up four
thousand years ago but
note that it took the entire history up
to the first century to have seven of
these 1700 cups technologies then it
took just 20 centuries you know to get
to another eight and you know steam
engine would be of course a classic
example of something that completely
changed the entire economy so 8:7
technologies from the beginning of time
to the first century eight technologies
from the first century to the 20th
century and then in just a single
century we've had another eight and I'll
pick up computers as the one that of
course I want to spend most of my talkin
but before we get to that let me tell
you about this guy his name was Rudolph
pijl and he produced the leather belts
for the industrial revolution in Vienna
he bought the cowhides and I saw him cut
up these cow hides and glue them
together into belts and he was my
grandfather and look what he what he did
for the Industrial Revolution he
produced these belts because this was
the way the factories were organized in
those days so he had a steam engine
which isn't shown here right at the end
that produced the power that was
transmitted along these axles the entire
length of the factory system and then
somehow you had to get this power off
this axle down to the individual loom
and this was done by these large belts
and no-till there are two wheels one is
a freewheeling wheel that's not
connected to the loom which the belt is
on at the moment then you see this fork
and you just took this fork and you move
the belt from the freewheeling wheel to
the one that was connected to the wheel
so it was just like a clutch as the belt
gradually engaged with the connected
wheel loom would start turning and you'd
have the pattern so what happened then
well this is the
the factory system which was one of the
general-purpose technologies of the
Industrial Revolution is started all
over the world you know this is might
well be won in in Austria huh and then
came along electricity and this is what
a factory looks now as you see not a
belt in sight because it was much more
convenient to have these little motors
that that would provide the hydraulic
pressure for these robots and you didn't
need a factory and the steam engine now
why am I telling you this story and what
happened to my grandfather well because
this took a long time for these steam
engines to be replaced by the electric
motors he had time to adjust so he
realized that now these cars were
produced in these factories without the
belts but all the cars needed a fan belt
so he became a distributor of fan belts
and his you know his family had an
income and in fact his his granddaughter
ran that that company until ten years
ago so the speed with which you get
these changes you know is very important
so that people can adjust to the new
circumstances over a period of time and
that is my greatest worry with this new
rise of machine learning etc so let's go
on to a computing some of you have seen
this graph before it's quite a famous
graph those of you who are
mathematically minded will note that
this is a log scale now what sort of
line do you get if you if you have an
exponential growth and the y-axis a log
scale is it occur for a straight line or
come on guys if you've got a log scale
and you've got exponentially grown to
get a straight line right so but this
isn't a straight line so
the development of these are real data
points so the development of compute
power and this is compute power that he
get from for $1000 against time this is
linear has been super exponential you
know for very long time one of the you
can't argue with this part of a curve
because these are facts this is rate
from records well spoke about the
singularities near now this one you know
is raping the perennial optimist that he
is but this you can't argue with and the
remarkable thing about these points is
around 1900 there weren't even
electromechanical machines these were
mechanical machines these were typically
hand crank machines and throughout the
lots of different changes that we have
in computing you know from hand crank
machines to electromechanical ones to
valve operated ones to transistor ones
and so on and here we'll we'll have the
dorm of course of of parallel computing
it's always been super exponential it is
you know a remarkable effect and Ray
being Ray here then says well we're now
close to an insect brain will soon have
a mouse brain and around 2020 we've got
a human brain and then he as usual he
goes a bit over the top but hey that's
not you know it's not totally loony Sri
Ram 2040 or so we'll have processing
power we can buy for a thousand dollars
that is enough processing that's
equivalent to all the human brains on
the planet so a few billion human prints
so it is you know if you believe that
extrapolation we we certainly have
enough processing power to be super
intelligent so to the six waves of
computing now like every good computer
scientist of course I start with the
zeroth wave which is the EDSAC which was
actually the world's first user computer
they've been computers before in
particular the Americans believe
that they had the first computer which
of course is not true
does anybody know who now everybody
agrees has produced the first computer I
wish it was the first user computer was
in Cambridge and that's the attack
Charles Babbage yes but there was
actually never work to the first working
yes that's an interesting one
but again is it's not that it was not a
general-purpose computer but that's a
it's a very interesting point
Susie absolutely so it was a German I'm
surprised people don't know that go to
Wikipedia look at look it up it was a
German guy called Susie Susie three in
the late 30s I believe well below any of
the wide known widely known computers
like like EDSAC or the American
equivalent of a Bell faced computer was
ENIAC ENIAC normally people think it's
ENIAC but the Tuesday computer was
actually quite a few years beforehand
but because it was done during Hitler
Germany of course people didn't want to
believe that it was German high right
now it it is generally regarded to be
the case but all these very early
computers were either built for computer
scientists to prove something or for the
military so ENIAC you know as was made
all these computers were it was refused
to to calculate trajectories of of for
the artillery etc this one was built by
maurice wilkes who actually was most
remarkable guy he set up the
mathematical laboratory it wasn't even
called the computer laboratories called
the mathematical laboratory here in
Cambridge and his mission was to provide
mathematical tools for the University
and he then went to meet Ecklie and more
the American inventors and produced this
computer but he
always wanted to produce this computer
so that other people at the university
could use it so this computer actually
contributed to three Nobel prizes one by
Max Perutz for hemoglobin andrew huxley
for understanding how neurons work and
Martin Rao who discovered the little
green men which too with Radio Astronomy
- which turned out to be pulses rotating
neutron stars so moral young Morris here
produced this computer it's a wonderful
story and we are I asked somebody how
much it would cost to build a replica
and the head of the British Computer
Society David Hartley who was actually
working for my work said I didn't know
but I'll find out and so we're
rebuilding it we're almost finished it's
as Bletchley Park but we had a problem
with these valves the the EF 53s and we
were worried there weren't enough of
these valves around in the world anymore
so we rang out these valve people and
said do you have any air 54 with 53 s
and they said yes sure how many do you
want do you want one or do you want both
so and we needed 2,000 so we finally
rang up this guy and when we told him
that we needed 2,000 valves he was quiet
and then he said I have been waiting for
you for 40 years and he had them all so
we're now another interesting detail
apart from the valves are these mercury
delay lines there was no memory in those
days and to build a memory out of valves
you know would have would have been
thousands of valve just for a few bits
it was completely out of a question so
it Morris developed these mercury delay
lines so it was a pipe these are just
pipes about 2 meter long pipes and what
you did is you banged them the mercury
in the pipe at one end and create a wave
and that wave would travel down the the
mercury delay line and if there was a
way if it would be a one and
didn't bang it would be as zeros it was
this train of ones and zeros traveling
down now when they were at the other end
of course you'd use them unless he had a
microphone there that then replenished
the the bangs at the other end so there
were these mercury waves traveling land
in Israel and you could store 512 bits
in that and it was all the memory that
the computer had the interesting thing
is that this machine had 650 it's not
MIPS instructions per second which was
1500 times more than the best computers
at the time so as far as the users were
concerned this was the biggest
improvement in compute power for users
that ever happened in the history of
computing and my guess is it will be the
biggest increase there ever will be
because the subsequent improvements were
much smaller as part of all as
development here
Morris William David wheeler who also
was a professor at the computer lab here
invented the subroutine which turned out
to be very useful and this idea of a job
queue for example also appeared because
the people who lined up to put their
paper tapes into the computer it formed
a queue and that was called a job queue
but I want but I want you to concentrate
on is the user interface because that's
in many ways that's the the fundamental
reason why these waves kept coming it
really was a development that had the
computer come nearer and nearer to the
human and will later talk about voice
being the next really big step of a much
more human friendly interface to
computers but go back to these first
computers and when I did my PhD here in
physics I still used the paper tape to
put in my results and later on punch
cards you had to write in machine
which for those of you who've written
machine codes you know this is hard work
fortunately David Weill a mented the
subroutine so it didn't have to write a
program to calculate the sine function
every time you needed the sine function
in the output there was no video was on
a printer and this is where it is on the
graph now that we come to the six waves
proper mainframe mini computer
workstation personal computer then
surprisingly smart phone and cloud and I
used to give this talk and called it the
five waves of computing and everybody
always asked me afterwards what the next
wave is going to be well we're in the
middle of the next wave it's really the
Internet of Things and machine learning
but actually if you think about it in
terms of the user interface it is
actually no computers you know at the
moment we carry these surprisingly ism
the main computing platform now is is
these smart phones but what you actually
want is no computer at all you want the
environment to provide all the computing
for you and once we get to really good
voice interface is the only thing that
you really need is microphones that are
everywhere now it's easy to receive
microphones in rooms and built-up
buildings is also the most cars already
have microphones although there's a
revolution happening as well with beam
forming microscope mic microphones which
are very important and you might you
know have to have something like a
smartphone or at least a microphone
that's with you all the time so that
you're close to your computer companion
so let's start with the mainframe the
icepick sort of iconic examples of that
and the most iconic example for
mainframes was the IBM 370 mainframe it
cost about a million dollars they
produced them at about 10,000 units per
year it was multi-user I used to 370
years of showing my age here and let me
just point out a few characteristics of
this wave that's true for all the other
waves as well there was a thing called
the
I'm sure you don't remember way before
your time
it was the appreciation for barros
univac National Cash Register control
data and Honeywell these were all the
people plus IBM who produced mainframes
so at the beginning of the way if you
had lots of competition all these people
trying to produce wave films towards the
end you have almost a monopoly IBM was
the monopoly supplier interestingly
through a lock-in and the lock n was the
dasty disc they managed to produce a
hard disk huge hard disks were about
this big that we're the best disks at
the time and they were so good that all
the other ones that didn't have that
disk basically got cut out of the
business and we'll see this repeating
itself with the dominance of Windows
that had to be you know there was an
antitrust case against Windows bundling
the browser and now we've got the same
thing with Google and and the GAF are
becoming very dominant and then whenever
you see antitrust cases you know that
we're getting close to the end of a wave
and there's something new coming that
actually the antitrust case is normally
there was an antitrust case and IBM
actually had to open up the interfaces
for dasty disk so that there was
competition that other people could use
these disks as well but it was a it was
a case that wasn't relevant because by
the time they've won the case it was
many computers that really had all they
all over all the new business so let's
look at the user interface it got a
little bit better instead of paper tape
unit punch cards and these punch cards I
remember my program I carried around in
a in a card box that was as big as that
and you carry your whole program around
and you did not want to drop it because
we've dropped it all the cards were all
over the place and your program was all
monk over then came teletypes much
better you could type it in you didn't
have
punchcards then there was the beginning
of high-level languages like Fortran and
COBOL and science libraries and business
forms and of course we move up that
hierarchy then came any computers and
the iconic one there was the VAX 11 780
the price came down by a factor of 10 to
about a thousand one hundred thousand
dollars oh sorry
yep the numbers went up by a factor of
10 and again towards the end of the wave
we have a dominant supplier which was
Dec at that time and this is again true
for all the waves some of these waves
don't last all that long about 10 years
to say if at the end of if at the middle
of the dominance of Dec anybody had
predicted that then Dec will not exist
anymore you know 10 years later that
would have said you know you're crazy
might have this is the most important
company computer company in the world
how can they miss the next wave as they
did and the reason is the innovators
dilemma those of you who are interested
in in this innovation disruption there's
a Harvard professor called Christensen
who wrote this famous book called the
innovators dilemma that shows that when
a new technology is coming along it is
normally in the incumbents that miss out
on that disruption incumbents are very
find it very hard to embrace these new
technologies user interface got a lot
better videos appeared the software also
went up a level with CAD tools both for
the mechanical in the electrical sector
and a new phenomenon appeared which was
networks so what was his name Bob
Metcalfe at Xerox PARC invented the
Ethernet and the Ethernet spread like
wildfire and you could link these mini
computers together to make much more
powerful clusters will move up that
curve and then come workstations and
we've got a new phenomenon a computer
that s actually sits on your desk and
this was the Sun SPARC station became
the iconic computer same story price
goes down by a factor of 10 units go up
by a factor of 10 this new type of
microprocessor small hard disks
Winchester disks make made the entrance
and this machine is sometimes called the
4m machine we've got the best of
metaphor which was invented at Xerox
PARC but appeared here for the first
time the computer was powerful enough to
be a workstation especially for CA D
computer-aided design it was called the
4x4 M machine because it had one MIPS of
processing powers a million instructions
per second one megapixel these were all
black and white screen still was no
color one megabyte of memory which was
an amazing amount in those days and it
cost one mega penny and $10,000 and the
ethernet allowed you to have pluses of
them and it was very good and then we
come to the personal computer era and if
you don't mind I have humor me with a
nostalgic moment this is my first
company acorn computers with this this
was our original ad for our
microprocessor which microcomputer which
became the the BBC micro and the tagline
was the shape of things to come and it
was very successful we had 60% of the UK
market share it was a wonderful time it
was also adopted by British schools in
those days bridge schools children a
bridge schools had more computers per
school than any other country in the
world and in a way this is my proudest
achievement because lots of people that
that became successful in the British
software industry beat the games
industry or autonomy which is a second
most successful company here in
Cambridge in a ten billion dollar
company these people you know sometimes
come up to me in the street and say
thank you for the BBC micro because
that's where they learn how to code we
had a very elegant implementation
basic BBC basic which allowed you to mix
assembler into it as well so you could
write amazingly powerful programs so
this had a word processor spreadsheet
and everything all in 32 kilobytes not
megabytes kilobytes of RAM it was
amazing what you could do with a small
computer like that so it was a great
success and it was a wonderful time for
computing because in Britain in
particular because the BBC decided it
was time to educate the nation about
micro processors and computers so they
decided to put on the 30 part series in
computer literacy and an amazing thing
happened the nation responded to this
with great excitement and interest so it
is difficult to conceive this but people
would go home at 6 o'clock from the pub
to watch the computer programme so it
was like you know like Dallas or an
analysis know what said games of thrones
or you know something like that a house
of cards people were fascinated by by
this and they watched this and the BBC
then decided the only way they can
really educate the nation in computing
was by allowing people to buy a computer
cheaply and this computer cost 300
pounds and it was a fantastic success
became standard in British core and
created a generation of programmers
those of you who want to know more about
this era there is actually a very good
docudrama that the BBC produced called
micro man where those people that were
active at the time in the computer
industry including myself featuring in
in this drama because there was a lot of
competition for getting the BBC contract
and the BBC had worked with a company
called Newbury Laboratory for two years
for this computer that they wanted to
sell with the series and they still
didn't have a working computer so they
decided to open it up to
six companies including Sinclair and my
company Akon computers they went to
Clive Sinclair and Clive gave them a
lecture of how they would be totally
insane to talk to any other company at
all because he had the right a computer
with a with a Sinclair spectrum which
was a very successful computer very good
computer and then they came but BBC you
must understand has their own ideas of
what the computer should look like so
they had a specification that had
everything in the kitchen sink in had
been a typical BBC thing and they came
to see us on a Monday with that
specification we had another computer
called the Akon atom at the time which
was actually close to what they wanted
but they needed a lot more and weather
and design in our in our drawer called
the acorn proton which we thought was
close to what they wanted and the
designer was Steve further who later
became one of the two people who did the
ARM processor and Steve and Sophie
Wilson were my two key designers the to
that then did the ARM processor and I
went to Steven and I said look the these
BBC guys are coming back on Friday is
there any chance we could show them a
prototype and he said you must be mad
this is totally out of the question so I
then rang up Sofia and said Sofia have
just been talking to Steven he says if
we really try hard we could have a a
computer by Friday he says Steven is mad
this is absolutely no way we can do this
but if Steven is in I'm in so for the
next three days and three nights we
worked on this computer and that this is
part of the docudrama of the micro man
if you want to see the scenes it's it's
very well acted in fact the actor that
plays me apparently did such a good job
that some people after the docudrama
went up to me and said you can retire
there's a guy that much better than you
it's more you than Europe and so I hated
they were coming at 10 o'clock and at 8
o'clock in the morning and we had worked
all through the night
you know we finished the computer we
programmed it and it just wouldn't work
and I made the tea because I'm very good
at them about at 8 o'clock you know I
changed from the tea lady to the hotshot
designer that really I am and explained
to them that the reason why I didn't
work is that we derived the clock from
the development system through this wire
and it was the skew in the clock that
made our beautiful computer that works
perfectly not work just because the
clock skew so what they need to do is we
need to blow the program into a ROM cut
the umbilical cord and everything will
be fine
cross my fingers and it was so you know
we blew it into a ROM it just showed the
brilliance of Sophie in particular who
wrote the program you know that we
couldn't debug because the thing didn't
work and we switched the this thing it
would blew it into a ROM into a
read-only memory but you can't alter and
we switched it on it worked and it was
one of those miracles anyway they
arrived they saw a working computer when
they didn't have one working with
another company for two years so we got
the contract and it was it was a great
success there is now a a son of the BBC
micro that he might have heard of which
is the Raspberry Pi of which we've now
sold over five million it's a fantastic
new success in the same vein
however the iconic computer of the
personal computer well is this ugly
document link here called the IBM PC who
remembers the total storage that you
could have in this computer this is the
master it's not the internal storage but
the total storage that you could have on
two floppy disks anybody oh is this far
too early for you yeah but this was much
much later
this guy's the original guys were
actually 320 kilobytes so both of them
we're 700 a 640 kilobytes severe weather
the guy's 4806 yeah because they were
double-density did a double sided
they're always inventions later on sell
there was a total mass storage of 700 by
640 kilobytes
which is not enough to store a single
picture that you will take with your
mobile phones now and there's a total
storage of this computer just to give
you a feel for how things have developed
so quickly same story you know it got a
lot cheaper about a thousand dollars now
but the numbers went up a hundred
million per annum there was there's this
time not a monopoly towards the end of
this thing but a duopoly sometimes
called Wintel because more than 80% of
the cpu souls came from Intel
microprocessors and more than 90% from
Windows and then very unexpectedly in
this through the user interface you know
you had a personal desktop the early
programs that everybody used were these
Word Excel PowerPoint programs that made
these things more efficient however
they're worse than a time when one
program comes arted to completely
dominate the PC era which became the
browser and then we had the browser Wars
and we had the problem with Microsoft
trying to lock everybody out from the
from the browser business by bundling
Microsoft Explorer and I have to remind
you that it was the European Commission
that forced Microsoft to open up the
browsers and and open up the operating
system and that allowed other people to
to play in this in this field so when
people Lethe or European Union they owe
to note that it was the European Union
that is our only hope to be a
counterpart to
dominance of Google for example or
Amazon because at the moment the the big
fight is about data Google at the moment
uses all the European data that we give
them for free and then they sell our
data back to us and charge us for it so
this is going to be a big fight over the
next five to ten years and the only
organization in the world that has a
chance of breaking that monopoly because
the Americans are not going to do it
they say no and there might be sons of
bitches but for our sons of bitches and
we benefit from them so we're not gonna
do it we have to do so we're up at the
PCEHR and then very unexpectedly
smartphones became this always happens
with a wave people like Microsoft and
Intel became so excellent at serving the
PC market that they always missed the
next wave so the dominant player in one
wave always misses the next wave
so smartphone who would have thought
that this guy would cause this
revolution I remember when he got up and
said I have reinvented the phone of
Jesus in a Steve going off the thing
again but he did it was one of the most
remarkable comebacks in what the most
remarkable comeback of anybody in the
computer history those of us who knew
him you know were amazed by this because
it was not the nicest person on earth
but he was a total genius when it came
to having a consistent vision and then
he was willing to to stick with so what
happened how can the price go down
further well it did it were basically to
zero with with a contract and then the
user interface again all of a sudden
voice played this important role and you
had the computer with you all the time
in your pocket a big difference to even
the most portable of portable computers
but the interesting thing is where the
new microprocessor the arm about which
more later on and we have a new
operating system which is
really Android mainly now and Apple and
Microsoft a bit but you know these are
the two dominant ones and we also have
tablets and tablets interestingly and
again this is a wave phenomenon that
happened every time tablets are not
small pcs with the exception of the
Microsoft tablet which is actually quite
successful it's got a a clever machine
however the main market are these
tablets that are phones on steroids
rather than small pcs and it only makes
sense for the smartphone to be as
dominant and as useful as it is because
of the internet connectivity because of
the data centers behind it but the most
interesting new effect is voice and we
will see a huge revolution happening
just now
with voice you've all lived through the
touch revolution who would have thought
that touch would change the way we
relate to computers as it has well you
ain't seen nothing compared with voice
once voice really works people clearly
prefer to talk to a computer now with
thought that once ways recognition was
as good as human recognition that would
be it now we have voice recognition
that's better than human and we don't
talk to computers all the time so what's
gone wrong well the thing that has gone
wrong is our understanding of how humans
communicate humans do not communicate by
deciphering every word that somebody
else says in fact interestingly I mean
we've got one a one of a great voice a
research guys in the world here with
Steve Young who produced book like you
that was just sold to Apple as the
next-generation Siri and his view of a
Hume
to human conversation is as follows and
you will not be surprised by that so
what we do is we actually don't listen
what the other person says at all what
we do is we create these hypotheses of
what the other person is about to say
and occasionally we check off we don't
that's why you often convinced that
somebody said something that actually
they didn't say it just expected him to
say it and then forgot to check whether
they actually did say it or not now this
turns out to be quite important so our
ability to communicate with another
human has much more to do with our
ability to create the right expectation
you know you wouldn't expect me to talk
about plants now you've got a very
specific expectation that I will talk
about voice recognition and human
communication and you have you sort of
fan out your expectations in a fairly
narrow field of what you expect me to
say next and that's why human
communication works as well as it does
because I now just need to give you
snippets of information that confirms
some of the thinking that goes on in
your brain and you say I I know that's
what I thought you'd say computers don't
do this very well yet but there is a
technique called belief propagation
which attempts to do this for certain
limited universes of discourse a way you
build up this expertise of what people
are likely to say and it's beginning to
work pretty well in quite limited areas
like you know buying a train ticket or
buying a plane ticket or something
because the number of different ways in
which you can ask for attained to get a
plane ticket and the the number of
places that you can go to you know is
nice and constrained but this this will
scale so this is it's very exciting and
you know Siri Evie and Cortana actually
Cortana is doing very well here
leading the
field the next thing is Internet of
Things where again the numbers of things
will go up by a factor of 10 I thought
you know we were selling smartphones at
a billion a year how can that go to tens
of billions almost impossible but that's
what's happening however this is the
picture that I want you to remember it's
actually not the billions of individual
Internet of Things that will be
important but the trillions of
connections between them and they will
provide the data that will allow us to
do the machine learning to really create
intelligences and you all know about the
Google car the glass is the health
sensors which is probably the single
most exciting sector for on which to
work
machine learning programs thermostat I
just ought to say that you know this is
Moore's law but this is what happened to
gene sequencing with a local company
called celexa that we also supported we
reduced gene sequencing from 10 million
dollars to under $1000 now in seven
years this is the biggest thing that has
happened in healthcare ever and it was a
local company that did it let me just
finish on machine learning and
artificial intelligence because it's
such a fundamental change in our
attitude to computing you know all of
you of course have learned that at the
bottom of the computers are these zeros
and ones these bits that's sort of often
equated with true or false and it's all
very binary it's the binary system as it
turns out in this new world of machine
learning the most basic variable that
you should think about is actually not a
zero and the one of course really right
at the bottom it's all implemented in
zeros and ones but conceptually the most
fundamental a variable is a probability
and that's quite a fundamental change in
the way we ought to think about
computers because you gain some things
you gain a lot of power
but you lose simplicity in particular
you've got to give up determinism and
people rather like determinism you know
it's very predictable but that's
actually if you give up determinism and
make it all statistical probabilistic
then you gain tremendous power because
you don't need to program anymore but
you can teach computers the problem with
teaching is like with a kid you know you
teach a kid to do something and then the
kid might do it or not
so you have a bit of this determinism
problem but in order for a computer to
be taught properly I have lots of good
training data sets you need big data the
more data you have these here is it is
de teaching but the biggest problem with
this approach is that you determine the
goals you know throughout evolution the
goals for all the animals and indeed
ourselves for a long time we're given by
evolution survival of the fittest you
know can you produce more offspring than
anybody else was the implicit goal that
evolution has given these units now we
can choose the goals ourselves and
that's a real bummer because we're so
bad at it you know and this is what I
call the Gini problem we just do not
know what to wish for and it's one of
the biggest problems I can see for for
society that you will have to solve over
the next small number of decades this is
gonna bite us within a small number of
decades so machine learning you've all
heard about that of course being very
important there is a great project to
use a million arms to simulate a billion
neurons in real time that Steve Furber
who did the arm for me produced in
there's quantum computing which we can
also talk about then there's this clash
of waves
so the new wave always kills the old one
because it's rather the volume is so
much higher and the prices are lower and
the user interface is closer just wanted
to tell you about
armed vs. Intel when we did the arm the
acorn risk machine it's also one of
those funny quirks of history we were
looking for a new 16-bit or 32-bit
processor we looked at all the
processors we went to Intel and said
well you know we could probably work
with you 80286 you just totally screwed
up the pinout
you put both the data bus and the
address paths on the same pins nobody
can make a good computer out of that but
if you give us the dye itself we'll do
our own pin out and maybe we makes can
make something of your microprocessor
and they said get lost you know we were
a little cambridge company so we're at
all
you get lost we'll grow our own it's the
only reason why arm exists the two
technical reasons behind that we're low
latency we wanted a risk approach that
had a very low latency really low
latency interrupt and the memory
bandwidth we had this peculiar situation
at that time that the memory chips were
twice as fast as the micro processors so
Intel could not use the full memory
bandwidth which turns out to be an
important parameter in a computer
whereas we with our risk approach I
could do this and it's also one of the
few examples were an American invention
by Patterson and Hennessy at Stanford
and Berkeley was first exploited in the
UK normally you know it's the other way
around that we've dreamed up and the
Americans exploited well it was an
American invention these reduced
instruction set computers but we had the
first implementation and we've been very
successful with it
we now have a better than 95 percent
market share in mobile phones it's
become a most successful company in
Cambridge with a market cap of 25
billion dollars we sold 15 billion arms
last year we we sold more
microprocessors last year than Intel has
sold in its entire history
so we outsell them at the moment at 20
to 1 but people who say well the Army's
a little microprocessor you know
it's a cheap thing well it might be a
cheap thing but since 2010 the value of
all the ARM chips sold has overtaken
Intel revenue so even in dollar terms
arm is now more important a
microprocessor architecture than Intel
because of the licensing approached the
arm is the world's most successful
licensing company with 400 licensees so
the the Apple implementation of the arm
is an arm the Qualcomm Snapdragon is an
arm you know Toshiba Sony in fact even
Intel has an arm license well I'm sure
you're all familiar with artificial
intelligence Alan Turing a fellow of my
college share King's College asked the
question where the computers will be
able to think and rather than saying yes
or no he devised the storing test that
will decide will allow you to decide
whether a computer can really think and
although there have been lots of
attempts and lots of claims that there
is a program now that passes the Turing
test in my opinion none of these
computers has done so but AI is in the
news some of you might have seen these
films like her or of course
transcendence and terminator there have
been some very good books probably the
best-known is Nick Bostrom's super
intelligence Martin Rees those're
Kingsman was master of Trinity College
astronomer royal royal and the president
of the Royal Society at the same times
he collected all the gemstones at the
good you could collect in this game of
academia at the time he published a book
called our final century where he
pointed out that there are existential
risks associated with lots of things
including AI and then he wanted to
publish this book in the United States
and the publisher said now our final
century will not do you've got to call
it our final hour because the Americans
want instant gratification
and then we've got some very famous
people like Steve Hawking my neighbor
here in Cambridge and Elon Musk saying
success in creating a I would be the
biggest event in human history
unfortunately it might also be the last
unless we know how to avoid the risks
and Elon Musk says hope we're not just
the biological bootloader
for digital super intelligence
unfortunately that is increasingly
probable so this is a big problem and
that's why I also support the center of
the study for existential risk here in
Cambridge with Martin and and Hugh price
where are we we're with a world chess
champion with what some ham eat humans
in jeopardy and of course we now have a
world go champion with alphago now this
is actually very different from the from
the previous games programs because deep
blue in particular was very deep it had
a very deep tree search and they just
produced a very powerful piece of
hardware deep blue that could do these
three searches faster than anybody else
this is not how go works go is very much
a convolutional neural network that got
trained up so how did demonstrates demis
hassabis is also a graduate here from
Cambridge well he took a program that
was an amateurish go program but then he
started playing this program against
itself 30 million times and that's had
whittled itself up in its ability to
play go because play go has so many
different and configurations roughly ten
to the 170 which is considerably more
than atoms in the universe that there
was no way you could have any rule-based
program winning at go you really had to
have a sort of almost an
intuitive feel for what is a good
position and what is not such a good
position and humans are good at that
and he tells one story which I think is
is worth retelling mm-hmm and this is
the story of move 37 in game 2
normally I don't know how many of you
are go players and might have wasted as
many times playing go and your student
days as I did when I was here you
normally play on the 3rd line this is a
19 PI 19 grid and you pay on the
intersections and just put your stone
down to claim a certain space normally
if you pay on the third line you claim
all the area towards the edge of the
board if you play on the fourth line you
claim a space towards the center of the
game and this move 37 in game to the
computer played on the fifth line this
was so outrageous that Lisa Dahl who you
know is the most highly decorated go
player in the world at the time got up
and and and had to cope with this for 15
minutes and it turned out that this was
the move that finally won the game many
moves later because that line 5 moved
then had a an effect on a constellation
much further down the board as is often
the case in go now go you have to
understand it's a 3,000 year old board
game it's by far the most complex game
that humans have devised but it is
concerned is bait played by 40 million
people mainly in Asia but it's
considered not so much a game but also
an art form and these spectacular new
moves actually have names and they
create new eras of the game and dem is
described to me that people reacted to
this like the discovery of a new Picasa
or a new you know Michelangelo so it was
it was as much an an art form or a piece
of new art than anything else we see
that computers are
of now being accused of having
imagination which people never thought
computers would have so we have this so
what is still missing well there's not a
problem with common sense if you look at
this diagram here we've got no problem
understanding that these very secure
seat belts here wouldn't help this guy a
lot when he rolls down this but it's
hard to have a computer argue about this
consistently we will have super
intelligences is the consensus in
machine learning community probably by
2050 certainly by 2100
but the problem is potentially a jobs
problem and a problem with human values
so I told you about the 24
general-purpose technologies the six
waves of computing the clashes between
these waves than the local story of
David versus Goliath with Intel and
armed artificial intelligence in
particular general intelligence but I
would like to finish with a plea which
is it is far from clear what role super
intelligences will have in our lives I'm
a perennial optimist I think we will
come off with them sensibly but there
are lots of dystopian a stories one can
tell as well so my plea is for you to
engage in this conversation early on you
know you are our hope the next
generation to work sensibly
with these very very probably with these
tools that are more more powerful than
anything else that humanity has ever
devised and help us sort out these
problems thank you emerge
thank you very much Ramon for a
fascinating talk and on time - that's
also fascinating so we have time for a
few questions
yep speak loudly about the threat to our
culture that machines could pose but at
what point do you imagine we'd have to
have machine whites of some kind because
if we train a machine to be intelligent
and I could be some of the ones we have
now are getting more intelligent than
very primitive life-forms like a fly for
example and what point do you think
we'll have to address that issue of if
we can't just try it off anymore once
we've trained the reinforcement learning
agents because this is this is in in
many ways the core of the problem
because you know when when you tell
people a story the reaction is always
hot easy which is you know unplug the
computer and we're done you can't you
know fortunately we have these wonderful
virtual machines now we've made programs
that can easily travel from server to
server so unless you shut down the
entire computing infrastructure in the
world you can't turn things off anymore
so it's it's a real problem we've got to
think about this really quite carefully
because there there are lots of
dystopian stories in particular you know
as a physicist I think we totally lucked
out with the atomic bomb you needed to
have organizations of the size of a
state together the best physicists in in
the country lock them up for years to
devise an atomic bomb then we lucked out
again that uranium-235
is actually very hard to get hold of to
build an atomic bomb neither is true for
many of the biological things that we're
now developing like DNA synthesis and
machine learning because once they genie
is out of the bottle you know very small
groups of people maybe even individuals
can use these these tools
but relating to the right to an
explanation on the decision base you
made by insufficient intelligence on you
if that is considered to be significant
why was significant is something that is
sorry for the wrong question by the way
what a significant is a big way we can
sort of think how do you think this will
affect the artificial intelligence well
it's actually the core of in my opinion
of the next big step that we have to
take in artificial intelligence what
clearly work spectacularly well now our
classification and regression problems
so if we you know object recognition
voice recognition all those stuff that
ends up with you know some sort of
classification or regression many
Gaussian processes you know do
regressions even and functions that you
don't know and this all works a treat
the big problem is that the result the
the way you arrive at the result with
these convolutional neural networks is
given in thousands or millions of
weights which you cannot understand and
you cannot talk about so the next big
step is to sort of do the opposite and
how can you abstract out of these you
know millions of weights an explanation
a sort of an abstraction of how the
system arrived at the conclusion and
demin demis hassabis that deep mind has
a very clever approach to this and I
hope it works so as some of you may know
he got to this go thing by by training
his machine on lots of Atari games
well he's now having a game where two
BOTS have to talk to each other so if
one bot has to tell the other bot look
there is a guy coming around the corner
is about to shoot you
then it's got to be it's got to derive a
language from just the pixels that tells
the other part watch out you know what
how will machine learning abstract these
high-level concepts from the mess of
weights that are in the convolutional
neural network
in order to be able to communicate it to
another bot and I think this is quite a
clever approach that might might work
but nobody knows and then we might be
able to get towards systems that can
answer these questions where you say
well you know if it has gotten a
significant effect on the EU tell me
about it but at the moment we can't well
I mean it's it's it's spreading like
wildfire at the moment and next big
fight in computing is going to be the
the the personal assistant because and
once you have a good a personal computer
assistant with I don't know how many of
you have played with the echo got an
echo at Herman unfortunately I can only
bear them in the US but it's a jolly now
you her name is Alexa you say Alexa tell
me you know what my next appointment is
or where and cut down of course does it
very well but the the reason why echo is
such a phenomenon in the States are
selling in a million a month with the
man I think it's because of beef will be
informing micros microphones so this
echo is a boombox that's that is in the
corner of your room and you don't do
anything except say Alexa when you say
Alexa she wakes up by the way my wife
objects to me calling her sheets and it
access female : and it homes in on your
math so because the beamforming my
microphone and therefore wherever you
are in the room is it will actually be
able to do the voice recognition now
once you've got a personal assistant
like that that really got used to what
what your preferences are it's actually
quite difficult to switch to another
personal existent so that's why we see
this fight between Microsoft Google and
Apple and Cortana is actually from a
computer science point of view one of
the leading ones Siri gets a lot of
publicity but actually serious the one
that is farthest behind
