to you about the society of and
subscribe which I think we're actually
all members up i found this online it's
actually a hot words think it turns out
if you google for a family crest these
good as you get all hot words images um
so i get this beautiful joyous feeling
online every morning because i'm a new
habit and i unsubscribe from email
newsletters and this is what it feels
like it feels like diving in to clear
water as though there are new varieties
right there are things that I don't know
and a few years ago in friend Jeremy
Tanner who lives in Boulder of this
actually three years ago um said about
his Twitter policy that when he follows
you it's because your ideas are
intriguing to me and i wish to subscribe
to your newsletter and i'm interested in
how we can all the powerful actors with
our inboxes and what that means and
especially in terms of each individual
transaction of so my very first job out
of college was working for indirect
marketing and the ads looked just like
this one did ten years ago and what the
customer wanted to sorry plant one of us
to do was to shorten the transaction
cycle between the number of time between
when the customer would purchase a pair
of eyeglasses and what i'm seeing now is
new ways of saying that same exact thing
how do we short any transaction life
cycle so what we're seeing is the
content mullet strategy which happens on
a lot of sites is slowly starting to
disappear instead of that I think we're
going to get mr. sideburns and I'm about
to explain what I think that means the
content
strategies one that you're familiar with
from HuffPo where there's some really
beautiful our puzzle in front page and
there's a party in the back of farmed
content ok I'm going to share with you
two emails that I received this week of
and how they made me feel and what that
power transaction was like so the first
one and you'll see the title of the
email at the top is from a new startup
called skillshare and they were asking
me to come back and teach your class
again but it opened hi Kristin have you
been playing hooky you have a ton of
skill share class in a while so we want
to make sure you're still up that makes
me feel sort of bad and then this is a
different one from fab.com is the daily
deal site for fabulous stuff and this
says hi we need feedback from you it's
from CEO if you come and spend ten
minutes give us feedback we're going to
give you credits on our site it's a very
different kind of value transaction and
so to return to what Jeremy said i'm now
thinking more about the first part of it
when you follow someone or some read
online it's because their ideas are
intriguing to you and therefore you
should subscribe to their newsletter so
when i think about this and I think
about unsubscribing that thing that
gives me joy I think about it as
something like it's not me it's you that
are boring me right now maybe we can be
friends later but not right now it makes
me feel it makes me think about this
piece from a few years ago which is how
I feel what I unsubscribe from something
that's kind of what I'm saying an indoor
is sort of the level of what I need you
to do if you're going to make it into
the inbox right so I can feel that level
of control but I feel something that's
not that as a kid to dislike the
displeasure that I actually want to
remove it from my life
for my inbox and so then we get back to
this idea of what it looks sickening to
have hipster sidles up to you have a
hipster holy and that picture was mine
from on flickr about seven years ago um
and some of the things that I think we
can do to get rid of them all get closer
to Cyrus is to shop for content when
we're online so you're actually looking
for things when you want them and at the
level that you want them and not
necessarily that doesn't always mean
that you know what you're looking for
before you start looking the newer that
I'm thinking about what I work with
people are working with al-jazeera
working with both losses right now is
how do we make the content of boring no
matter when people encounter it how do
we get people in there and understanding
the whole story no matter when they
arrive right especially if they leave
and they check something else at and
then they come back and when they come
back the penalties for rejoining are low
because when you have a bullet you're
making poor life choices but when you
have your cyber I should probably lost a
bet in addis story there and that's what
I think is really interesting so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
