hello everyone we're going to go ahead
and get started so I'm a seam agrawal ax
from adobe systems and we're going to
start out with an invited talk it's
going to be a little bit different than
some of the talks you've seen already
I'm really excited and honored to
introduce Jason Sullivan Jason Sullivan
is a fine artist and a professor at the
University of Chicago I really been a
big fan of his work for years and I know
his work has come up in a lot of
conversations and talks that involved
computational photography inspired a lot
of work so I'm really excited to hear
what he has to say Jason thank you guys
um yeah this is going to be I think a
little bit of a different talk then you
guys have had so far this is an artist
talk it'll be a little bit of an
abbreviated version artist talk artist
talks typically are a little more maybe
a little more biographical span maybe a
little more time so i'll talk about
projects that go back even 15 years and
I'll while the my work sort of spans
maybe a broader space than just
computational photography I'll sort of
try to focus the conversation here in
that space a little bit more but just to
sort of give a little bit of background
I'm going to I'm going to dim the lights
also okay so this is a painting on panel
it was maybe half that size and so so
not that big but this hung over my bed
from like nineteen seventy five when I
was five too maybe a little 87 he's like
through Star Wars for sure this is a
painting my father made so I grew up in
yeah he made that so I grew up in a like
an artistic household he was a
practicing fine artist maybe a little
bit of a hippie household maybe some
recreational activities of they were
hidden for me but looking at this
painting I've seen their work
and that that sort of environment maybe
counter-intuitively I drew and painted a
ton as a kid but I actually was much
more interested in mathematics and
science early computing and maybe sports
and other things but that environment
while I was sort of steeped in it and
learned a lot of our history and sort of
first-hand knowledge of what being an
artist what that life might be like it
also sort of helped me find a different
kind of path one of fast forward and
talk about a project that I did in grad
school so this is from 96 and it's for
photographs printed acebo combs so
through a lens in a dark room about that
size each photograph is is pretty close
to that size the suite was called the
grand unification theory every second of
and then it was each film so these are
one frame per second of four entire
films so that's one frame per second of
Star Wars the f4 mention star wars and
the I was do I was using an SGI indie
and writing in C to sample frames at a
regular rate one frame per second and
then rearrange them and this is before
sort of photo mosaics broke big in the
late 90s like so it came to this through
a different path my interest was in
maybe a little bit of analytical and
also sort of purely art abstraction like
the arrangement of the frames is not
based obviously on narrative it's based
on luminosity so brightest frames in the
center radiating out I did this to for
film so this is every second of snow
white
this is every second of its wonderful
life and this is every second of deep
throat and in thinking about and I think
this is really important for an artist
the specific content so when we're
thinking about sort of algorithms and
processes I think from the artists point
of view the specificity of choices what
we fill up those space of possibilities
with is the crucial thing so it's not
just any for films for me these were
like I thought of in the sort of pillars
of genre film I wanted to sort of cover
these bases of sort of Americana and
speak to you know the blockbuster film a
majors of early animation the family
film and pornography and I wanted to
sort of cover that space in my hope was
my intuition was that the formal
properties of each image the the way
each image would look would very sort of
maybe unexpectedly so I wasn't
anticipating that that it's a wonderful
life would have such a sort of full
spectrum of luminosities and these
things and other other things I did
later really sort of tuned me into the
idea to think that in certain films the
director was really conscientious about
this sort of like range and dynamic
range of light that was that was used so
this is the brightest of the bright stew
the darks of the darks whereas you know
deep throat has a really different sort
of intent with with sort of distribution
of light at the time I was working as an
artist and programmer for Viacom new
media while I was going to grad school
and I worked on a beavis and butt-head
game and I worked on a bunch of icon
properties basically and they and I was
sort of faced with whether to sort of
pursue that route in the game industry
which was really fun and and viable or
sort of take a chance on being a fine
artist and I was lucky that my my
master's thesis show so artists
who go to graduate programs do a thesis
show I was fortunate that I had some
opportunities that sort of snowballed
from that and I spent most of the 2000s
just working as an artist supporting
myself by making work available to
galleries and museums and collectors and
things like that but my interest was has
always been in you know the CEO at the
studio we write software for pretty much
everything we make and in sort of
manipulating the bulk of him from this
bulk of information in different sorts
of ways this is a piece around the same
time treating sort of stacks of frames
in a different way this is this piece is
called the class of 1967 and it's too
large photographs this is the class of
1988 and they're all the graduating
members of the high school class is my
mother's high school class and my high
school class so you draw the men and the
prints are quite large and it's this
real simple mean in this case just
taking the mean of all the frames this
is this this piece sort of predates
layers and photoshop and things like
that so we did I did this all I think I
did these on the SG is as well these are
all the women from the class of 67 and
and this is in Fort Worth Texas so in 67
it's still kind of conservative Fort
Worth you can see like this ghost of new
hairdos coming into fashion right so
there's some you can actually look at
sort of you know anthropological and
sort of you know statistical evidence of
trend this is my graduating high school
class also in Fort Worth demographic
shift cultural changes although the Tuck
stops and these sort of drape things are
identical which is really bizarre the
wound of a TA so the these ideas were
pretty much simultaneous idea of sort of
taking a grouping of some class of
frames and sort of arraying them in some
interesting meaningful way for me at
least
then sort of amalgamating them as means
and again this is sort of late 90s
another way I'll play a little piece I
won't stick just a photography so I got
I got very interested in in sort of
thinking about classes of cultural sort
of objects and maybe this idea of
combining and compressing and I produce
this is a song I sort of made right at
the turn of the millennium I'll just
play it yeah just play a little bit of
it hmm I'd like to sing a song song now
that was
down by was written and recorded by mr.
Paul McCartney are the famous forcing
meals in English
is a good place to be
so this is the song of the century and
its many you know at the at the end of
the millennium ever where we were sort
of inundated by poles of this is the
centuries out of the century and and
many many different polls actually
identified yesterday is a song a century
most played song on radio most covered
song so I took 27 covers and basically
sort of did a similar mean on them but
the issue was they immediately sort of
diff if I registered them all from the
beginning which was sort of the way I'd
initially treated it you've got pure
cacophony and and so this sort of
alignment point became really important
so I used that sort of first yesterday
all the songs come in at different
points all the storm's songs sort of
begin to quickly fall out of sync but
there's this moment where they're
together and I thought that was a really
nice sort of way of there talking about
the turn of the century and about our
sort of desire to rank and those sorts
of things one of the other things about
this I didn't play it all the way
through its you have different there's a
kind of cacophony that builds but you
still have really interesting moments
where there's a moment where Marvin
Gaye's voice really rises above
everybody else and it's this sort of
beautiful tone and there's a sort of
until this moment where Michael Bolton's
voice rises up over everyone else and
it's quite painful
this there's a sort of 20th century sort
of exploration in setting up systems in
art this is in our setting up systems
and letting them sort of play out and
sort of accepting sort of the
consequences john cage as a composer
sort of very well known for articulating
this approach and I think computation
really enables this even to another
degree that we can set up processes and
systems really tune them tune the system
and then let it play out it's what I
seek to do in a lot of things I do this
is early 2000s it's a large print
photographic print it's called the top
grossing film of all time one by one and
it's composed of about 350,000 little
sort of pixel elements see this we're
here so this is every frame of the film
Titanic simplified to sort of a mean
across the field across the frame and
then in this case just arranged in
sequence from the beginning of the film
to the end of the film right so we have
none of the actual content of the film
except for this sort of residual
averaging per frame and yet you still
have a lot of evidence of the of the
narrative itself so you know this is
this whole little sequence here is a Leo
on the bow of the boat I'm king of the
world right and then this is where the
ship goes down
and that that this thing exists is sort
of an abstract entity and then sort of
sort of it still sort of so connected to
its source material is one of the things
I'm really interested in this
transformation through process and again
this were I think these some of these
ideas are being explored or more broadly
now but at that moment it wasn't too
much a sort of another branch my work
sort of takes different branches and I
think the one way to sort of think about
the bulk of the work is in thinking
about classes of things and instances in
those classes in the relationship
between groups of individuals and the
individual sort of unique identity
within those groups I think most of my
work tends to tends to interrogate you
might might say some of those questions
this a branch that sort of is about sort
of pure visualization pure data
visualization this is also a project
from the early 2000s it's for prints in
a video that graphically represent the
domestic production of shoes in the u.s.
from 1960 to about 2000 and I was I was
I came to this project with the intent
sort of out front to sort of take a dull
dataset like a dull but complete data
set and sort of render it as a
psychedelic right or render it sort of
in a special effects kind of manner so
it's a sort of sort of ironic idea about
taking you know the badal and sort of
imbuing it with you know graphic sort of
power and interest and legibility and so
a couple things could sort of come out
of this one is that I have been
corrected by especially the ladies many
times that shoes are not but now so I
totally I have that that
I understand the other thing is is I do
not come at this with any sort of
political intent or social intent but if
I'm being sort of Frank the shape of the
thing is sort of a mountain volcano sort
of shape let me play a little bit of the
video three dimensional graph in Maya
using Python or Mel to lay out the
points so as I said I was really I
wanted to be a clinical graph but I
wanted all the choices I could make to
be about sort of this optical
psychedelic sort of thing but the reason
that that shape is sort of this peak is
that down here is the 60s and here is
now or 2000 so that sort of narrowing is
a really clear sort of visual of the
lack of a manufacturing base in the u.s.
so sort of this becomes a graph of
outsourcing without even my intention
then it was a surprise a kind of a happy
surprise but one of these interesting
things that you know even if you sort of
really try to squeeze data you if you're
sort of consistent you might get sort of
some bit of truth kind of no matter what
you do it's an interesting sort of
experience let's hit on these is maybe
somewhat some people here my no abuse
works this is every Playboy centerfold
from the 1960s 70s 80s and 90s and I
broke them in two decades because I was
really interested in hopefully
illuminating some change in the way
these photographs are shot so in the 60s
this sort of all of this is hair where
the model isn't directly looking at the
camera but sort of more demure Lee
looking away you can almost sort of
think of these as animating over time
until you get to the 90s where you have
sort of full frontal
everything faced in the right direction
I guess highlighting it's much more lit
so that that sort of and then they also
exist as these amorphous sort of
impressionistic forms which is a I don't
know this audience might be interested
in this I keep having these thoughts
about impressionist painting and what
impressionist painting really was about
or at least one aspect of it was a
response to sort of oncoming photography
and that artists were sort of freed up
to be more to explore abstraction more
than that with one of the first branches
into that was sort of an impressionistic
approach and that these sort of mean
means of sets would have some
resemblance to impressionist an
impressionistic approach to abstraction
is an interesting coincidence and I kind
of I think about is it coincidental oars
or something else going on there just
especially in regard to like these
projects these are homes for sale in
different regions in the u.s. at the
sort of median price range this is
Seattle no editing either like I really
I did not make an effort to make see how
to look this way want to move ahead a
little bit here
I'm going to get up to sort of more
present work this is a 40-foot wall sort
of hanging cantilever wall we installed
it in the lobby of the new US Census
Bureau headquarters and two years ago
it's static it's just a single image
it's an Associated real-time multi-touch
element will be installing the summer
out of frame over here another view of
it this is similar to the shoes piece
and that I was interested in sort of
graphing the u.s. population from 1790
to present in a way that sort of was not
about teaching census about their data I
think since this is one of the most
talented interesting data gathering
organizations we have so rather than
that I was about actually trying to amp
lafai the aesthetic to think about a
data set as like a formal thing you know
artists have painted trees and painted
landscapes and you can start to think
about like a complex data set is having
sort of formal properties like that can
be visualized in in ways that are maybe
about sort of the aesthetic experience
of the thing so this is the just to show
you sort of how I did that in this case
this is a sort of digital version of the
one view of the data set I chose the
real time element will have sort of an
interactive of you'll be able explore
this really deeply but just to sort of
show how I got to this so here's a
population of Cook County where I live
from 1790 to present here's the
population of the 3100 us counties all
all the different population curves here
they are color-coded and i was using
sort of state flag information as a way
of sort of a type of assigning color to
each county and then some three
dimensional transformations and we have
sort of a final 3d object
so I work as a composer it's where we're
composing with data and I get how do you
you can remain truthful I mean there are
infinite number of choices one could
make about how to visualize this data
set 3,000 counties over over 200 years
you know this is one of the ones i chose
actually shows quite a few and again i
talked about specificity for artists i
think it's about sort of taking the
chance on this specific choice and going
ok this is the winner this is enemy i
have thousands of these sorts of views
and i had to sort of go with a little
bit with my gut like this is the one I'm
choosing but again I am interested in
the breadth of the say of the thing so
that's that's why the sort of
interactive element will be there too
far as the sort of this is a these use
the mean and the median combined I only
did that for a little bit of more
crunchy character I think these are the
last of the sort of amalgamation works
that I'm going to do and their old
master paintings it's a most all I could
find from the eaves boobs like all the
portraits that these guys have made of
France halls and Van Dyke velasquez
Diego velÃ¡zquez and Rembrandt and I was
interested in both the sort of
commonalities we would find in the
variety and i also thought they'd be
this really sort of warm handsome sort
of objects this is the the halls this
might be of interest to you the the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York
will be doing a show called after
photoshop in their in their contemporary
photography galleries this will be
included in this show but it just goes
to show that sort of even a staid
institution like the Met is sort of
finding a way to get engaged with and
think about sort of what I would call
computational photography and maybe a
sort of broader artistic sense so it's
it's it's interesting though the art
world is slow sometimes to catch up but
i think they they're aware now a fine
art world sort of aware of that both the
importance and the sort of fraud
capabilities and
and and sort of vista vistas of new work
that will be created in the future the
our boats are waking up to that so I
want to show one last piece and I'll be
happy to answer questions I just had an
exhibition open two weeks ago and I
haven't shown this work anywhere but at
exhibition and I'll just show one of the
pieces from the show this is called good
and evil 2012 and it's I've got really
interested in search I've skipped over
some of the work but I've done some work
with my own making public my own search
history of 20,000 searched items over
the last like four years which is an
interesting way to think about a
self-portrait there was a really nice
study done last year quantifying the
sort of most positive words in the
English language to the most negative
words in English language 10,000 words i
took that the top and bottom 100 and
basically made image search sort of hate
for the word photo mosaic but I'm tiling
25,000 images per panel and i'll show
you the word list so you know the good
words you know laughter and happiness
and you know sunlight and sweetheart and
then the evil words the bad the negative
words are terrorists and murder and
suicide and bankruptcy and it's where I
think it's very the reason i titled 2012
these these words I think changed
culturally over time but I was thinking
about a semantic gradient right we have
this what does search do with those
words and other patterns that come back
I think there are in some sense so
here's the good panel so this is you
know very high resolution pranitha it's
a over six foot tall sure you and the
words are sort of arranged in you see
this sort of raised sort of a little pie
raised so it's a basically a pie chart
so this is sky you can see that here
the evil panel and source see some
details here I actually had to use Bing
rather than google which might surprise
you guys the Google API caps caps image
acquisition at 64 or as being is quite
generous counterintuitive but true and
the I found the actual and i found the
overlap to be you know this is sort of
subjective I didn't deal of real
analysis but in the territory of sort of
fifty percent overlap the the engines
return of subjectively speaking of
basically the same flavor of set with a
lot of actual you know high degree of
actual overlap which got me thinking
about who works at these places and what
you know how are they coming up with
their their algorithms and then on these
these little monitors is actually over
say four hours all 25,000 images per
panel it's playing and the the evil
panel is actually quite difficult we
actually had to hang a parental advisory
there are and as you guys know me I'm
interested in the weirdness of the
internet that they're such gross and
disgusting stuff in this image and so
I'm thinking more and more about how to
sort of deal with this this idea of a
gradient simpler piece and I'll show you
one last piece on be done is a similar
kind of approach with search I'm just
trying to recreate the sort of standard
color wheel so this is blue blue green
so these are search terms all that you
know it's a thousand images coming back
for blue four blue green for green all
the way around the color wheel with all
kinds of oddities including over here is
blue violet and violet blue is an adult
actress so my color my color wheel gets
completely sort of
nullified with the international
interruption of flesh tone in here and
that this sort of like collision of of
semantic sort of truth and expectation
what the net does with these things was
my hope like I was interested it was
quite like you know this is what I
wanted something like this to happen i
was i was sort of looking for that so
those are brand-new pieces and i'll stop
there but it'd be happy to answer any
questions you guys might have I'll bring
up the lights any questions uh those
last two were pretty labor-intensive we
wrote a server to download all the
search terms we the thing was sort of
built with Python and Maya in rendered
in my eyes there's a lot of layers but
in this case like I feel I've got some
tools i'm going to use in future work
than really excited about it can depend
on the pieces i guess
thinking about art students
here diversity
yeah it's a good question I i have a
class right now called data and
algorithm an art that's five advanced CS
students and six art students basically
basically and I think three of the got 3
CCS seniors one's going to utah to do is
PhD in visualization next year so I've
got these fantastic programmers and some
artists that have never done a thing and
I think it's an interesting combination
where my interest isn't sort of how
should I say this loosening the
programmers up a little bit and in
teaching the artists a little bit of
rigorous craft and technique and their
work in collaborative progress that's
one of the things we sort of come to is
like these these guys need to work
together but it's been really
interesting I think I I stress it a
couple times in the talk i'm really
interested in talking about it's
wonderful to come up with this fantastic
new sort of general-purpose technology
who's going to be the person to sort of
make use of it and do something
interesting with it and you know I think
that's the conversation between artists
and technologists how do we sort of come
together on on really interesting
innovative ways to use interesting
innovative technology
it's a great question er um I guess for
my practice I'm just interested in
bandwidth and resolution like those are
the things i want the most I want like
walking experiences right I want to walk
in super high-res real time experiences
so I'm kind of and that may be a
generational thing I'm interested in you
know so I didn't show much of a but I've
gotten really interested in real time
stuff calling from the net and I have a
weird aggregator that I just sort of
made as an artwork so you know like
real-time 3d and super high-res those
are the kinds of spaces i think i'm
interested in sort of on a personal
level
and you know photography was trying
somewhere
this your friend interesting
why
and where is
take us
yeah I actually have the same sort of
questions my hope is that it's in this
almost contradicts what I just said in
some way but my hope is that it's that
developments of computational
photography won't just be all about
higher resolution versions of the same
thing you know they're I would love to
you know have more conversations even
about sort of transformative sort of non
intuitive ways to sort of crack that egg
I don't know the answer but I do i do I
do feel like I'm not that interested in
sin this is again perfect like real
personal I'm not that interested in like
more snapshots that are bigger and
better or whatever you know but that's
like a personal thing like I don't have
a flickr account it's not my sort of
like people think I'm I mean I'm in
photo collections and museums but I
barely shoot pictures it's not it's just
not how I'm sort of wired so I come at
it from a more sort of analytical and
maybe more painterly approach I think
I'm more informed by the history of
painting actually in many ways I guess
it's sort of an answer
a lot of things are having partly from
this research community but in general
is the far of entry for making things
that are like art from photos or digital
artifacts is going down yes there's you
know this good process of making
creative tools easier there's a certain
point is it too easy for we you know
removing the artistic element by adding
so much automation I just wondering if
no build obvious answer in there but no
I think it's I think it's a great
question and it's like it's sort of near
and dear to me I know I know exactly
what you're talking about I think it's
so for interesting artists especially
young artists their job is to stay up
front like and they will get swallowed
you know it will happen and you'll get
sort of you know the bar will be that
will happen it's good for me like it
makes me this is this is stupid sort of
thing but you know this you know Madonna
like changed her style every time
everybody else jumped on board when she
was actually like relevant sorry that's
the sort of like I'm leaving things
behind really conscientiously because I
feel like a crowd sort of in a space and
I think researchers do some of the some
research to do the same sorts of things
artists particularly I think are
oriented that way I say it's great like
make these things it will make them it
will make things at once were sort of
maybe almost incredible into tchotchkes
is the problem but that's like it's not
really the technologists problem that's
sort of the nature of things I think but
it is so it's a great question it's
something I do spend a little bit of
calories thinking about okay thank you
guys
hi so my name is your leg and I'm going
to talk about alignment and Messiah King
of non-overlapping images this joint
work with Professor Shimon Peres from
the Hebrew University of Jerusalem so
we'll begin with our quick write a quick
overview of mosaicing so we have a set
of we have a set of overlapping images
and we would like to align them and
stitch them together and to create this
single panoramic image now the method of
alignment depends on the amount of
overlap that you have between the images
right so if we have a large overlap like
in this case we can use either direct
methods or future based methods to align
the images and if we have smaller on
overlapping 20 images we will probably
use future based methods since direct
methods are less suitable for this case
now another case of Messiah King gizmos
I can buffer contiguous images in this
case the images do not overlap at all
but they are contiguous and this this
case is that a recent paper by Pomerantz
done like this with this case exactly
now what we would like to do in our work
is to deal with the case that the images
do not overlap and there are not
contiguous at all and we would like to
create a single panoramic image from
none of the lapping images I will now
give the method the outline so the input
in our case is an unordered set of non
overlapping images like here at the
bottom and the first the first thing we
need to do is to align these images and
since they do not overlap they do not
don't have any it showed features and
what we propose to do is to extrapolate
the images and by that make them overlap
hope to make them overlap then we
perform a multiscale beauty search for
the approximate alignment and you can
see here the result of such an alignment
process and once we got this alignment
we remove the extrapolated areas because
we don't want them a defined panoramic
image and then we have these gaps in the
image right and what we do actually is
in paint these gaps to get the final
panoramic image so this was the method
outlined I will now go into details so
begin with a metric stipulation our goal
is to make the images overlap and fewer
related works in this field I would
mention two important works the first
one is by how I frozen Liang from the
field of texture synthesis and as you
can see here are the show a way to
extrapolate images and the extrapolated
area contained contains the fine details
as you can see there on the right a red
marking now we wouldn't like to have
such fine details in the extrapolated
areas because they can damage the
alignment process another walk it's from
the field of video stipulation so far
Ida stunt was presented here last year
and as you can see in the red rectangle
in the middle there the center of the
image is the original video frame and
the rest of the image is actually
extrapolated the data and this is more
like the kind of acceleration would like
to live in our case in order to enable
alignment of non-overlapping images so
we basically follow their approach and
we now briefly describe the basic steps
so this is an example based image
extrapolation method and the basic step
in such methods are acceleration of a
single patch like a prime there and what
we're going to do is to look at the
neighbor of a prime and then search for
the closest patch to dispatch a and once
we found such a patch we look at its
neighbor and copying it into a prime so
this is how we separate a single pattern
of course we do it to all the patches
you would like to extrapolate one by one
now there is more to this in order to
get smooth and large except related
areas a few more things
need to do so what we actually do is
that we create the Gaussian permits for
the input images and then we look for
the extrapolated for the matching
patches across all images because we
assume they all come from the same scene
and it makes sense to look for matching
patches across all of them and across
all scales again because we assume there
are fractal elements in our world which
could which we could use in the
extrapolation another thing is that we
average all the overlapping images the
overlapping patches and this is
something that contributes even more to
the smoothness of the except elated area
and lastly we perform this in multiscale
steps as i described next so we begin
with the input image and we down sample
it and the extrapolation actually begins
at the course level that that level we
accelerate a band of k pixels around the
down sample image so here's the
acceleration and then we want to
propagate the result of the upper level
alright so we take this band of k pixels
we magnify them and attach them to the
upper level now at this point we re
extrapolate a band of k pixels around
this leg at this level and will repeat
this process until we get to the
original image resolution and again we
extrapolate alright so let's see some
results and so you can see the yellow
markers mark the width of the
extrapolated area and of course we have
some data flex from time to time and as
you can see here we have an elucidation
of hallucination of a complete structure
which creates a period a periodic
pattern and such effects can damage the
alignment process and would like to
avoid them this one specifically
happened because we used large patches
and the third process okay so now that
we got these the extrapolated images and
we hope the overlap we need to align
them and the first thing we try to do is
to align them using state-of-the-art
tools like microsoft image composition
editor and photo sent and before to
emerge now
these are really great tools and I'm
using them all the time all the time and
they produce amazing results but they
failed to align these images and the
reason we guessed they failed it's
because they probably use future based
methods to align these images clearly we
don't have any features in the
extrapolated areas at this point we
decided to go back to the basics and try
a direct grading method that works in a
course to find matter in order to align
the images so we begin with a simple
case where we have two images and we
define the alignment cost to be the sum
of the leb differences between in the
overlap area with three minor changes we
give lower way to dl channel to account
for elimination changes and we can
alized smooth areas because we would
like to maintain this one at the general
structure of the scene and lastly we
normalize the cost by the area of the
overlap in order to prevent preference
for small overlaps so once we got this
cost we basically evaluate this cost at
every relative shift and choose the
shift that minimizes this cost now if we
have more than two images then we define
the global cost to be the sum of their
wise alignment cost I presented earlier
and we have a problem because the
exhaustive search in this case is much
too expensive and this is where the
iterative good research comes in and
what we actually do is we begin by
piling up all the images on top of each
other and this arrangement of the images
we evaluate the global cost and this is
the initial cost views for the alignment
process then it's at each iteration we
try to minimize the global cost by
translating a single image so for
example at the first iteration we found
that moving that image to the left
reduces the global costs and in the next
situation moving that image to the right
reduces the global cost and if we cannot
reduce the cost any further than we stop
the key observation here is that
translations to the correct direction
usually give the best minimization all
right so let's see an example for
process so here is alignment of three
images in a single scale and you can see
the images lie to the approximately
correct location here is another example
this time in a multi-site multiscale
setup starting from the course level the
lowest lowest scale again you can see
the images slide to the correct location
approximately correct location this is
the original image resolution alright so
so far we assume pure translation
between the images and of course if we
have rotations we would like to deal
with them as well so if we have small
rotations basically we can ignore them
and the reason we can ignore them is
that the inpainting step at the end of
the process conceals dissertations and
simply we can forget about them but if
we have more significant rotations would
like to handle it somehow and the we
would not like to add the rotation to
the grady search because it increases
the complexity quite significant
significantly so what we propose to do
is create a sort of rotation violent
images and then try to work with them
and this is what I'm going to describe
next so suppose we have these two nice
input images and you see the right one
is what they did just a bit what we do
is we create a required to tell it
copies of these input images and we
simply integrate them by averaging their
color values into blended equal them
integrated images and then we try to
find the alignment over these images and
the same method I described the earlier
right so this is the alignment actually
it's only the translation between the
images and this is the translation we
found between the images and the at this
point what we're trying to do is to find
the right rotation between these images
so we looking for the best match among
the rotated the copies of the images and
this is a result so here is a real world
example these are the input images you
see the right image is rotated by 15
degrees approximately here's the these
are the input images after extrapolation
integrated images created from 21 copies
of rotated images the translation we
found between the integrated images and
the final result which is approximately
correct another example with the three
images so these are the input images
after the extrapolation the integrated
images this time created from five
rotated copies the translations we found
between the images and the result okay
of course we have some drawbacks the
main drawback is that this is a greedy
algorithm and of course it can converge
to a local minimum and we can't help it
really and the second major drawback is
that we are quite limited with this
rotation things we experiments
experimented with up to 21 different
rotations two degrees each and more than
that the alignment process a quite fair
now to the last step in our method when
we complete the alignment process we
remove the extrapolated areas because we
don't want them in the final panorama
and so we have these gaps in the image
and we use in painting methods to fill
in these gaps we tried the shift map and
content aware fill of dobie they both
produce very nice results so let's see
some examples these are the input images
after the alignment and after removing
the extrapolated areas and this is after
in painting and another one this is the
input input images after alignment and
after removing the
images and this is after in painting and
for this one we also have ground truth
this is the ground truth so you can see
that in the vertical axis we are quite
right in the alignment and in the
horizontal axis approximately right
correct ok so just let some up well we
saw how to basically we can align a
mosaic non overlapping images we have
three simple steps the first one is
image of circulation and that's that
will make the images overlap the second
one is multi image alignment represented
the method the equity method to perform
this and the last one is simply in
painting of the gaps between the images
and this is it thank you yes yeah
yep
so I didn't get it what happens what if
what
Oh basically I suppose it will have some
trouble in the alignment process so we
had the reason why we switched to leb is
because we had problem with illumination
jenny's and reducing the weight of the L
channeler quite handily to the right
it's not perfect but it's working fine
does this answer your question all right
okay yes please
okay so we use the inpainting just as a
black box and for example on shift map
it takes you can define the neighborhood
from which it takes the des pecheurs
it's not textured it's actually a single
pixels in shifts map and so we basically
didn't play with you the dog just use it
as a black box no no you throw it throw
the images we extrapolate them and try
to an island no user interaction oh well
actually where she started this is a
funny story we actually we didn't know
how to do this with the image alignment
and so we started by having a good guest
of the approximate alignment and then to
converge and then this one time we just
try to put them stack them up on top of
each other the images and we saw that it
converges anyway so we stayed with this
method okay thank you sankar scene for
introduction so our today's targets
about a contrast presumed document
decolorization is Miss topics about a
grayscale images so actually why do we
do this project actually if we look at
modern printing actually we still use a
lot of bright and white printing and
because fast and with low cost and the
post police remember more friendly so I
don't know you better ninety-nine
percent of my printing is on using black
and white printer so but recently we can
find that more and more documents AHA in
color so especially for the researchers
in communication criminal graphics and
the temptation of photography we have a
lot of
we have all our papers mostly containing
color figures illustrations and I think
post body in this iccp all paper is the
one with the most square scale figures
Lucas outdated so actually there's one
problem knowing for a pretty long time
we're putting some image or some
illustration using bag white printer so
we see sometimes we don't get what we
want for example if you have such a
great angle in this color image you
don't sit clearly in the printout so so
we devote ourselves to this product and
this question for the answer today
unfortunately so we can improve the
result and let you have a better black
white printing so if this is a special
case or it's just a general case to show
that actually I can tell you this image
is not a special image so we just
browsed the papers and find it just one
figure in the one paper published in
this EP so I think that also you can
thank me later the there's another one I
can show here so this is very good
Austrian showing you that there's a red
rectangle enclosing a broad character
trying to tell me on some information
it's very it's very smart way to do that
but what we get from HP printer is just
a leg the breath the root can go totally
get totally lost so it's not obvious at
least so this is not the example
actually from another paper present in
this SSCP so we have more examples
actually it's not a from our papers this
is a very complicated table and I think
this is very smart to use different
color to highlight different regions and
so the information is pretty clear in
the color version but if we print out
using our print HP printer we found this
no no difference so this is not really
what we want why it happens I think it's
because
the although the chrominance between two
colors I got the pink and green a card
debt different but actually the
brightness align these are really
similar so that is the main cause of the
problem so I don't think I need to show
you more examples to telling you how
important this problem is but actually
this is really a province that are
knowing for pretty long time so finally
I got an answer here and this is the so
you don't need to referring to the
original color image to know what
happened and though this is 10 give the
automatic method to find out what the
what is the best partition of what is
the color assignment and there's no
that's guarantee no video article can be
produced in this process so let's
formally define the problem so this
problem actually is called a
decolorization it's trying to find a is
trying to give in a input of color image
with Rick channels you're trying to find
only one imagery mentation with one
channel and this channel should contain
as many as information as possible also
in the meantime we hope that there is no
video artifact so this is the goal in
this process this problem looks very
very easy actually missing these kind of
intuitive is a straightforward but
actually we find is not there are many
issues in this process so this is a very
typical example of course its main main
example but i think it's it has chased a
hearing problem so we have a different
colors for example is there are two
different regions so this one we map it
to a grayscale so get this so for the
other region will also need to map them
to the gray scale so we get the mapping
process and this is a result we get so
based on this mapping process we are
able to get the result so it's totally
unacceptable so it's not a totaling here
in the province in decolorization so
there are there is previous work and
there are local Methodist trying to have
to tackle this problem you
in a two-layer methods for example if
you have for this input you can naively
produce a grayscale image by night
mapping so it gives you a result that is
not good enough but it's okay because
they also has a color contrast map which
is the enhanced version on mainly on the
address so the final result will be the
combination of these two layers and it
looks better than the naive mapping but
this process can give you some results
may you may think have a Halloween
artifact so their work trying to adjust
this issue and trying to improve the
province of their coded global methods
so this method is trying to find only
mapping from color to greyscale
regardless the position of the Carter so
this is koda go mapping so the process
is just finding the mapping one by one
and eventually the gives you are mapping
is defined globally for the whole image
and butter I I need to note here that
actually the previews using global
methods gives you has one major problem
that in almost all global methods the
color order is strictly such as fight so
what is color order let me just see
example I'll show you one example here
we have two color why is red ones green
so can you tell me which one is brighter
which one stalker so i think it's a it's
a it's not easy why because if we we can
have a very simple experiment if we put
this two colors in yov space we found
actually the brightness of the red is
smaller than the brightness of the green
but if we put it to llab space we get
the contradictive conclusion that the
lightness of the red is smaller is
larger than the line is occurring so
which one we should obey or we which one
which solution we should adopt that is
the question so also they are some
actually this is not a unique phenomenal
actually we have found a proof
or support from the psychology area
there has been started showing that the
order of different-colored cannot be
defined uniquely by people and there's
also conclusion that people with
different culture and the language
background have different senses of
brightness with Rebecca to cover so it's
a so this tells us actually is not easy
to define color orders for some colors
but not all of them so it's so this is
the hour this is primary our foundation
to construct a new system to make the
dacarbazine process fully automatic and
conscious preserving so because of this
color order some color orders are
ambiguous so we if we still enforce the
color order constraint on this ambiguous
colors so what we get so this is the
comparison so now given the input so we
human so we can see clearly the
difference between the red and the blue
sky and so this is very very obvious
there's difference but in all previous
global methods this kind of contrast
becomes weekend and if we look at this
information within those rectangle we
find actually if we can telling you this
actually totally different colors you
should preserve more contrast comparing
to comparing to the prisoners that only
prison part of them so so our
contributor actually is threefold in
this work so we try to relax the color
or the constraint so we hand the
proposed a bimodal conscious preserving
model and also for this unambiguous
calipers we introduced the week color
order and this is very very important
and useful in this decorating process
and also to make the problems solvable
efficiently so we change from global
mapping to the polynomial mapping so
this is another contribution in this
work so let me just begin with our first
object function so what is the object
function basically the D current process
in trying to make the
greyscale conscious the same as that in
the color image so giving that you have
to color pixel x and y so we hope that
the Crisco country the G X Y is very
similar to the color contrast in cie lab
this test but this is very intuitive
interpretation and so we make it to make
this claim not as strong so we make it a
Gaussian distribution and so basically
the distribution follows a Gaussian and
this tells you actually this is this no
this is very simple model and we may
adapt it so may see it for many papers
and based on it so the traditional way
traditional methods actually not only
enforce the magnitude similarity at the
same time it's also requiring that the
order are the same the orders are the
same so that means if the color order is
positive then the grease your order
should be also positive but this is
traditional methods we found that this
is not proper or correct for those
ambiguous peak color pairs so instead we
introduce a bimodal distribution to give
a better interpretation of this whole
process so we allowed that the
distribution follow a bimodal pigs so
they they they thought is allowed that
one pixel the one conscious for for the
grayscale pixels for in left or right
but a for the traditional method there's
only one choice you have to make it left
or right now this small change actually
make a big difference i will show you
later so this is based on this
information so we found is we're also
trying to find out whether all people
color pairs are ambiguous or not we
found is not actually they are an
ambiguous color Paris so how to define
it so we defined a very simple way so in
all three charla channels if the values
is larger than those values in for the
other people
the other colors so we say this is not
this is not ambiguous so I can show you
a few examples so you can clearly see
that actually the right color it should
be brighter than the left or why so
there is no ambiguity so this color
actually are ambiguous calipers and this
is another few examples so based on it
we try to incorporate two situations one
is ambiguous calipers the other case is
the unambiguous calipers then we
introduce the art form which is a
balance weight so this way it can be
11.0 of 0.5 so it's depending on whether
you define it as ambiguous or not then
we change our traditional bimodal
distribution a little bit so we copied
this averaging 2 so for every color for
every pixel you actually have choice you
can choose it as one model or bad model
distribution is the is it it's the
system decision or your decision so
finally to make the problem servable I
can show you that this the wreckage of
this function is not easy or it's not
efficient so so what a problem it is
actually if we try to solve for all the
grayscale image G actually this involves
a lot of variables so one every pixel is
a piece a variable so it's very large
for example for this simple even for
this very small this very very simple
image we can see they are contained it
contains around 100,000 tickets also
variables so it's not it's not it's
that's really too much because it can
easily make the result stuck in the
local minimum or it can gives you a very
very slow process to give the result
though it's not acceptable so we try to
improve the process insta by introducing
a parametric global color to greyscale
mapping so this mapping actually is
defined as a global mapping again but we
instead of half piece of ice mapping we
introduce Omega based the parametric
mapping so though the search space will
be much much smaller so what is the what
is the suitable parametric model for
color to greyscale so this is another
problem
we actually define one way to two gives
you the parametric model which is very
very effective and also is simple so
this is called a polynomial mapping
function so what is polynomial function
actually it contains the few monomial
terms in and this mondo matrons will be
sum up giving the weight of Omega in
this whole process and so we can
constrain the order of the polynomial if
the monomial order is to so actually we
are able to gives you a order to or
quadratic polynomial and so there are
only nine channels color channels can be
combined so if we look at this line
color channels they are they're not
linear actually they are actually learn
linear process to gives you more
information or new information in the
original color space so so how could
this be usable so let me show you
another example here is color image so
this color image can be actually
decomposed into RGB so it's very it's
what we know and there's no there's no
ambiguity it is no doubt about it but
actually we can give a better
interpretation so we try to continue
post it into a polynomial composition of
algebra channels defined by and
constrained by the order of this
combination and in this in this process
actually we can show you different
images so this different this image can
be computed quickly without taking any
computation time so giving that these
nine channels we are able to combine
them together so not only the for only
three things on the Omega now so you are
able to choose any Omega to give you
different results but our optimization
gives you the one that is most suitable
odd in terms of your object function so
this is the final result if we can
optimize the whole process and we are
able to give you grayscale image and
this image is is different from the
previous one but this one actually is
the one suit most the original color
image and maintains all the contrast and
the differences and structures and also
I should tell you that actually this
simple combination of different color
channels is a general
of all pervious grayscale mapping total
mean it means improvise we can define as
a tightness we can define intensity we
can define brightness but all of them
are special cases in this combination so
this is a fairly usable consolidation of
traditional way to combine color
channels now based on this information
we actually we change our model a little
bit changing from pixel wise computation
to a parametric based model computation
and so we only need to change the grid
scale contrast and make it like a
defining you know we can show the by the
Omega and then the final of the function
is still saying there's no change on the
final object function then how can we
solve it so we propose a method to
quickly solve it and it is very simple
we simply because we maximize this of
the functional equivalent to take the
minimizing the negative log reason of
this of the function then we define at
the energy function then we is very
natural that we can take a gradient take
a derivative and set them to zero now
because of this we can get expansion but
this expansion gives you a set of
equations and they note that in this
equation there's one strange variable
which called the beta so what up what r
beta is actually beta is defined in it
has a colorful representation it's an
addict inspiration because of this to
rev entation actually we are able to
have authoritative optimization process
now so firstly we initialize the army
car so you can randomly assigned 0 megha
anyway so this is kind of so our cuisine
is not sensitive to interest a shin and
then you because of you have omega
already then you put it into objection
and then you solve it and you get a beta
so because once you get a beta you go
back to estimate Omega again and in this
process just easier it just takes a few
passes and you get a result and it's a
pretty easy why we can have such a
simple algorithm to optimize origin of
the function it is because the the
solution space is very small because we
only have nine parameters to estimate oh
estimate so it's very simple so this no
this no much chance that the solution
will be stuck in a very unreasonable
local minima so this is our perturbation
experiment so we reiterate favorite
times we gather is out here is one
example initially we we have a very
simple installation so we say we let RGB
share the same importance in the
combination of the final grayscale
images as needed Asia then we start with
iteration 1 then we get Adrian too
quickly you find that result improves
and when you have that you have the
result containing more higher and more
conscious and more prop contrast in the
result and also you have it really you
get another one you find the result a
photo improves 45 13 14 15 so I become
stable and we stop so it just need just
a 10 just like a tense relations you
stop that that's just enough in our
experiments here is the result show up
so this is the input image and output
and this previous work in global matter
trying to produce grayscale image from
the color input and you can't even see
clearly see the difference I don't think
I need to explain to mark here and also
you can see another comparison here for
this this one system actually is very
deaf called why because generally
traditionally we regard at regarded blue
and red ads the same color all the same
intensity the same brightness but our
algorithm tells you actually this is not
necessary so it's not necessary we can
we can actually give produce a very
natural transition if we assign the two
colors to two ends in the in the gray
scale range and here's another one so
you have see the result it just show you
the comparison here and another one so
this one contains a lot of color
patterns see the color patterns can be
preserved better much much better in the
hour is out and so we have kind of saw
in this paper actually we propose a
quantitative evaluation so and so
because we don't hope to only let you
see the result and compare the results
this is may not be the best way for you
to understand whether this algorithm
works or not so we have we purposely
race
it's called color contrast preserving
ratio so actually the definition is very
simple it is the it is the ratio
regarding the high contrast great skill
pixel over and the number of pixels that
has that have the high conscious card so
that is the real definition and based on
this definition you are going to show
you why examples of this is input and
add is the color scale you can get a
large conscious gray color color pixels
and this is the comparison with the
large contrast color pixels and a large
conscious grayscale pixels and then you
count numbers and then you get a ratio
so in terms of these ratios I think our
method can preserve more conscious so
then it means the address or even those
structures transitions can be preserved
better in using our methods so we you
can even change at all which is
stressful trying to determine we what
kind of method or what kind of structure
you regard as sale it so this is you can
change how in so this is a curve why and
finally I show you one application using
this method so traditionally you you you
have different ways to enhance the
contrast of a color image now I give you
another one so of course this is not
proposed by us is a application in
previous color to greyscale papers so
actually this is this this is decoration
is very simple we substitute the our
briscoe image for the air channel in the
lav space then then we are done so
that's the everything we have in this
process but you find you can see the the
result on the right can show you can
gives you a better contrast preserving
comparing to the left ones here's
another example you see the difference
from the left to right and so you can
conclude this talk actually we have
proposed a new color to gray scale a
method that can will maintain the color
contrast and it's divisor we color
contrast and it is actually we also
propose polynomial mapping function I
think it's not only useful for color to
greyscale maybe you can use the
in other areas or other places yeah I
think that's it thank you so you do it
you a good contrast that's right in the
process I observe that you throughout
the diversity completely some colors
they don't have any correlation can you
try to preserve the luminosity as well
as possible because it's relative why we
have why we have led this algorithm to
choose the grayscale by yourself because
we found actually the people no matter
what a method we use we cannot recover
the color version image from the
grayscale why so basically no matter
what the method you use you cannot
recover the color image but so the
important things that you have to
especially for paper printing or or the
fingerprinting you may need to say oh I
don't really when why when i use a red
rectangle to enclose one character maybe
i don't care really marching in the
final grade scale version whether this
really is black or white but i only want
to see the contrast is large enough so
that's that's so then our method just
can give you such an illustration yeah
for natural images you can actually if
you look at our very first the very
first example you can actually notice
there is no no that's one next one next
page
right this one so actually the there's
no influence on the natural image is
basically because natural images already
gives you a very nice presentation so
you only need to in general only need to
put in them into the combination so so
that is also the advantage of our method
because we don't allow this parameter
space wildly change we only can string
them as a linear combination of a few
