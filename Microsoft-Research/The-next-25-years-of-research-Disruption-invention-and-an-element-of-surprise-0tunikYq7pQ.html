in the next 25 years
well let me say some obvious trends we
will continue to advance in the
foundations of our field by tackling
outstanding open problems and new ones
we have yet to pose we will continue to
produce new technologies that we didn't
even know we wanted or needed and our
technologies will continue to transform
other disciplines expediting advances in
those fields and our technologies will
continue to disrupt entire sectors from
agriculture to automotive from
journalism to law and computer
scientists will continue to team up with
other scientists and engineers to
address societal grand challenges such
as energy in education and healthcare
what do I see different in the coming 25
years from the past 25 I believe our
focus will not be inward but outward I
believe our focus will not just be on
ourselves but on others we will explore
how computer science and our technology
can better humanity the original dreams
of you know computers that help you get
things done that understand the value of
your time that understand the text that
you're sending you know we could go back
to the very beginning and say that
there's still work to be done on that
first thing I mean you as a user today
are still having to take all the events
all the communication activities and you
have a model of what you're trying to
get done that model does not exist in in
the software and so knowing ok I'm at
work I
ten minutes free which thing which new
news thing Instagram thing Twitter thing
email thing is worthwhile to you and how
do you assist the person dealing with
that that kind of what I sometimes call
alter-ego that has a model of
intentionality similar to what you have
including being able to read things you
know we haven't done that and so it's
whether it's navigating data helping
people make sense of things using their
time well the opportunity for software
to make us more effective is still
pretty phenomenal and it is exciting the
speed of progress coming out of research
that a lot of people here are doing the
speech the image recognition that the
text processing systems we're making
more progress now per year than ever I'd
say in the last twenty five years
there's an unpredictable element to what
we do sometimes it almost feels like
there can be a tipping point where after
many years maybe a decade or more of
work that there's suddenly enough
knowledge that's built up in our
community to enable and allow tremendous
practical progress to be seen and so
this is this quality that research is a
long game and as I look ahead over the
next twenty five years despite the fact
that there are tremendous pressures now
on us as a research community to create
results faster and more plentifully than
ever before there's no sign at all that
this unpredictable nature the idea that
research being a long game there's no
evidence at all that I see that this is
going to change and so for us this is
going to kind of create a challenge it
creates a challenge because at least in
today's world in fact now more than ever
if we look at the tech industry all of
the best CEOs are desperate for
innovation they're desperate for the
next big thing and where are they
looking they are looking
us that researchers at the research
community because there is a fundamental
belief in today's technology industry
that research is the foundation is the
fuel provides a spark for innovations
that may or may not be right I happen to
believe it's correct but what is
important right now is that the massive
investments in kind of PhD level thought
and research are fueled by that belief
and that imposes a kind of pressure on
all of us and it's important for all of
us working together to meet as a
community to understand that there's
this unforgivable nature and to ensure
that people are making smart decisions
so we always wanted to get to the scale
where we could do our own research and
that we were both giving back to the
field and seem where the field was going
by having top top researchers and
corporate research groups they're mostly
unique in that they're seeing needs of
the market and connecting up to products
that really are going to get shipped I
don't see a way to decouple the future
of MSR from the success of Microsoft
that is if Microsoft is successful ten
years now 20 years now 30 years from now
then I think Microsoft Research will
will do extremely well there are things
that are also timeless in terms of
general research themes reliability
engineering process security privacy
those ideas are bound if anything to
become even more relevant over the next
25 years especially as the number of
kind of protected enclaves in the world
corporate networks and the like starts
to decrease and the number of objects
that are just out in open networks
starts to increase especially with
develops like the Internet of Things and
those ideas are bound to drive
tremendously difficult research problems
and fascinating ones for all of us

I'm reminded of the mid-1400s
when Gutenberg printed the first major
book the Gutenberg Bible on the first
printing press made from mass-produced
movable type at that time around 1450 -
there were an estimated 30,000 books in
all of Europe in less than 50 years
after the printing of the Gutenberg
Bible there were an estimated 12 million
books in Europe it was really a Moore's
law of its time and the incredible
democracy of access to knowledge was
something that had potential to lift up
the entire world only a hundred years
after that new art forms like the novel
emerged but at the same time the
printing press was incredibly disruptive
there were powerful forces such as the
churches of the day that tried to own
and control this technology parents just
in that 50 year time frame their
conception of their obligations to their
children of what it means to be educated
what it takes to survive and thrive in
our societies suddenly involved this
incredibly challenging skill namely
knowing how to read and write and the
displacements that were created by them
we're incredibly difficult and sometimes
brutal for societies of the time what we
do today as researchers is every bit as
transformational and empowering and
potentially challenging and disruptive
as that time but now it's at internet
speeds and so what I find so important
for what we are all doing today yes I'm
a company man I want Microsoft to be
successful yes I want the tech industry
to be successful I want all of us to be
successful but what is really important
about what we are doing is creating this
technology this incredible democratizing
and empowering force
but at the same time doing it in a way
that is also thoughtful about the
potential disruptions and dislocations
in our society</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
