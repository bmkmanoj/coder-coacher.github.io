great pleasure and honor to introduce
next invited speaker dr. mitsuoka Otto
from advanced air communication research
Kyoto Japan the dr michio kobato
received a Bachelor of Science degree in
physics from University of Tokyo in 1976
and obtained PhD degree in biophysical
engineering from Osaka University in
1981 after that he became a faculty
member of Osaka University and since
1988 he has been with atl in 20 in 2010
he became the director of atl bringing
information communication research
laboratories he has led various big
project in japan on computational
neuroscience for example kobato dynamic
brain project from nineteen ninety six
to two thousand one computation brain
project from 2004 and 2009 and strategic
research program for brain sciences from
2008 so dr. michio kobato received a
number of research awards so just to
name a few international neural network
society cabal award in 2008 the okawa
price in 2009 and purple ribbon medal
from the Emperor of Japan in 2013 the
title of his talk today is diagnosis and
therapy of psychiatric disorders based
on brain dynamics ok please join me to
welcome dr. Mitsuko
so thank you very much new msn safe are
very generous I introduction it's a
great honor for me to be back to nips
after 18 years Blake and I like to thank
the organizers including singing the
same state for inviting me to this most
interesting ah workshop only one thing
which I miss from brick and each day is
snowboarding and skiing this is a list
of topics I'll talk about dynamic out
diseases and then I will talk about the
necessity of course out 24 system
neuroscience and then I'll explain about
decoded new feedback abbreviated as
decnet and then control of conscious
mind by dekhna then i will discuss
possible mechanisms of decnet and
finally I'll talk about SR PBS a project
to apply deck knife our psychiatric
treatments so 1978 was very important
the year for my life I made a fast
upload trip to united states of america
and was the first time met the late
Professor aza Winkley who was one of the
most creative persons whom i interacted
with and 97 28 was a first year when i
published a paper and the title is
biological oscillators can be stopped
topological study of a phase response
cup meaning that if you have typed zelo
phase response club by manipulating the
face in the amplitude of the stimulus
you can stop any biological ism and it's
related to other win please a proposal
that the heart sudden this fibrillation
could be chaotic dynamics
and professor langless located at McGill
here is another big proponent of this
notion of dynamical disease and finally
1978 was a fast and probably the last
year when I pile up the airplane without
license and i solemnly let me pilot this
airplane and professor ogee Suzuki was
my supervisor at graduate school was
scared in the back seat and this is my
definition of dynamical disease dynamics
could become pathological even without
substance of normality the dynamical
system might possess multiple stable and
possibly chaotic attractors and
transition from a normal attracted to a
pathological attractor initiates a
disorder and prolonged stay in the
plasma pathologic attractor would lead
to changes in substances that is leading
to chronic diseases so spontaneous brain
activity and intrinsic function
conductivity suggest that maybe
psychiatric disorders are dynamic
diseases now that now there's many
people ugly that Blaine is not a mere
input-output transformation system but
it's a autonomous dynamical system which
can generate in healing spatial temporal
patterns even at least without any
sensory input or invoking movements what
without any cognitive tasks so
spontaneous brain activities contains
evoked brain activities and actually the
e-book the brain activities in the
development construct a spontaneous
brain activity in human humor I
correlations of slow fMRI both signals
in the range of Japan's l3 health that
is SATA second periods between brain
regions defined so called intrinsic
functional connectivity or listing state
functional connectivity MRI and this
less
stay functional connectivity predicted
age of participants working memory
capability who with the intelligence and
recently even achieved individual
identification as listed in this
literature's and white among Institute
researchers many years ago have already
found this in animals actually in
anesthetized cats as they put both th
sensitive died in the broad month areas
18 that is the second visual area and
also Jesus anesthetist cats when the
researchers show only entation gratings
on 2 g's cats you can get this nice
gradation maps with pin field structure
but surprisingly even for anesthetize
cats and endowed outer darkness you
could see similar orientation map
structure utilizing self-organizing map
clustering of data and actually the
state of this anesthetized cat seems to
be slowly fluctuating this is one second
between different are blowing states a
more recently a pfizer gloop sticked 16
multi-electrode in the primary visual
cortex of vague threats actually at for
young and old stages and they recorded a
multiple newer recording in three
conditions total darkness no stimulus
natural seen movies and artificial our
visual stimuli and then they used our
kullback leibler divergence to measure
the distance between a statistical
distribution of g's are many newer
filings and to make a long story short
they found out that statistical
distributions are all different between
different conditions in young
and only in adult and between
spontaneous brain activity and the
evoked activity by natural beaches
cimolai use see similarity so G sources
are interpreted this invasion theory of
vision our equalizing the spontaneous
brain activity has a prior distribution
of the BG l word and posterior can be
computed in a bayesian way as a con as a
conditional probability multiplied by
the prior probability and this finding
is very nice on the encouraging to
people old people like me who has
already lost some vision in audition so
without good high signal-to-noise ratio
since I stimuli we old people have
already trained this internal for model
are try a likelihood of the external one
so I can correctly understand the video
see but at the same time many people
here can remind faces of old people who
are talking the same thing repeatedly
irrespective of what they hear or see so
in that case they do not depend on this
conditional probability and too much
depend on this prior probability that's
a shame and inhuman fMRI imaging people
found very similar us tuitions so in the
case of humans we call it not
spontaneous reality but listing state
are our activity so lasting state
functional networks are in responders
brain activity match well with those in
10,000 tasks so this is a combined and
task by this wall a 12 and leered at
well and this is the 20 independent
components are taken plans a listing
state
why and the main message is that 16
components are the 18 components are in
the task corresponding well to those
obtained from our resting state so in a
sense resting state our networks already
involve our task induced evoked brain
networks so based on these are concepts
of dynamic disease and the relationship
between spontaneous brain activity and
evoked or induce prayer activities
people including me tend to regard
psychotic disorders dynamical disease
because a small number of genes or
transmitters or limited brain lesions
fade to account for psychotic disorders
after decades of reductionist efforts
and listen tree abnormal functional
connections were found specific to
psychotic disorders so we might be able
to develop biomarkers based on brain
dynamics and it is also known that
normalization of pathological
connections were correlated with the
extent of improvements by different
kinds of therapy like pharmacological
drug or TMS or electro conversion
therapy or cdb cognitive behavioral
therapy so with these assumptions we
form Japanese is our PBS strategic
research for promotion brain science to
develop effective biomarkers and new
feedback sylheti based on Blaine
dynamics of all psychiatric disorders
are three years ago so this is a
caricature so nobody including me
believes that brain dynamics is
generated by client vector field so this
is just a caricature of our illustration
so in normal dynamics you might have sub
all at factors
representing depression normal was a
schizophrenia even the normal state
Blaine dynamics is always fluctuating
like this but because of some genetic
reasons some events in the development
or environmental change maybe this
normal adductor becomes weaker and
depression are attractor could blow them
it's a attraction of vision of
attraction and then this person might be
promoted in Korea or get divorced or get
ill for some different reasons maybe the
state I can close this amount and goes
into the depressed state and if it stays
in the depressed State Long mean are
probably because of synaptic plasticity
mainly because a heavier snap thick
plasticity this attractor becomes
stronger and stronger so it's better to
take to bring the state point back to
normal as soon as possible now I'd like
to talk about Cozart 24 system
neuroscience so Blaine dynamics causes
consciousness this is a hypothesis which
I like and this is a very fundamental
hypothesis long-standing and popular for
most serious but not yet experimental
examined as I have already said Blaine's
not a mere in put out a transmission
system that could function as an
autonomous dynamical system without
sensory stimuli movement or cognitive
tasks spontaneous brain activity is
generated as spatial temporal patterns
and G's special temple parents cause
behaviors learning and consciousness
this is the assumption which I would
like to some are experimental are
investigated we combine two modern
techniques of humans system neuroscience
one is decoding of brain
or mind or much books a pattern analysis
in fMRI so you guess kamitani who is a
colleague at ATR was one of the pioneers
of this field so the task is to the code
or read out or extract information by
looking into the activity so this person
is watching is this orientation or
disorientation gratings whether this
person just looking into the primary
visual cortex activity can tell which
stimulus are this person watches this
weekend actually most of the system
neuroscience has been dealing with
encoding problem if we give some kind of
Stephen I how our blaming activity
responds to this this is the encoding
issue and decoding is the opposite
direction computation from blaming
activity we would like to predict
stimulus and before you cast come Tanis
2000 of all paper people saw that it's
impossible because of the spatial
resolution a usually we use three
millimeters three-minute a three
millimeter book sale in a variety is
probably several thousands of
orientation clones so we have so poor
spatial resolution but collecting
thousands of boxes and apply machine
learning algorithm at this time support
vector machine you can decode
orientation that was 2004 paper after
that kamitani reconstructed arbitrary
black-and-white images from primary
visual cortex activity and another
japanese colleague nishimoto even
reconstructed colorful movie images from
where MRI and most recently a cantonese
gloob showed that dream contents can be
led out by this technique
while a subject sleeps in fMRI scanner
and the other technique which we would
like to use is traditional and lesion of
interest-based fMRI year time
neurofeedback this is not so much
different from usual fMRI but actually a
subject is connected to his own brain
activity by this feedback so suppose
that we define region of interest to
interior and do though cingulate cortex
this clean are bullying then it's
Appalachia activity is shown in real
time to him as a function of time and
during this ugly period this participant
is supposed to decrease the brain
activity of singulair Codex green up
great green up and what good it is for
actually by suppressing anterior
cingulate cortex activity people find
out chronic pain can be suppressed and
by increasing supplementary motor area
activity Parkinson's disease is somehow
improved and by going up and down for
orbiter under codex OCD
obsessive-compulsive disorder could be
somehow limited so this is nice but this
is controlling the apalach productivity
within a low I it seems to me a little
bit too crude so we decided to combine
these two techniques so system
neuroscience especially human systems
neuroscience needs a new causal to that
is a method to induce a specific
activity pattern in a limited region of
a human brain and the induced activity
pattern should be decoded as a specified
piece of information such as orientation
color preference confidence movement
images and soul and the induced activity
causes the conscious mind that caused
onto the decoded information and this
message should also be able to change a
pathological blame dynamics of a
psychotic disorder into a normal
dynamics that is the main objective of
our sr PBS project now I am going to
explain the decoded neurofeedback
abbreviated deck nav which is a
combination of this decoding and Leo
time fMRI neurofeedback so this deck nav
has been already applied to sell appeal
OSD and chronic pain and this method
needs a decoder for each patient and
this application is currently limited to
OCD and pain in cases of high decoding
performance the success rate of dick nap
is 10 / 10 hundred percent and sometimes
we observe the long-term effects so
after say four days of heat back
training we observed a long-term effect
more than two months is three months is
five months six but this long-term
effect was absorbed only in two out of
three cases so the essence of this
method is to compare the current spatial
matchbox a pattern with a desired march
box a pattern corresponding to some
specific piece of information and the
quota is used to measure the distance
between these two are boxer patterns and
it was embodied in the monetary reward
em and it is used as a feedback so this
is in a sense reinforcement learning
just the word and penalty is a fed back
to subject no more detailed instruction
to our subject or if you are in the
field of BMI brain machine interface you
could call this as a version of neural
operant conditioning neural instrumental
conditioning sue so we expect geez
participants can voluntary control
the spatial books a pattern to the
desired pattern just guided by the Orang
penalty how it is possible ah I will
explain that later so the first
objective of this study was asking about
a loss I of visual perceptual learning
in other words our question is are the
primary and secondary visual cortices
plastic enough to accommodate visual
perceptual learning there has been
long-standing controversy about Blaine
loss I or perceptual learning people
like the soggy a proposed that it simply
one primary visual cortex but other
people said that it's imperative codex
MTB 3 before what even snapped equates
between parietal cortices and higher
visual cortices now one of the reasons
why this controversy was not set to is
that all the previous studies are
correlational so you stick electrodes
into monkey subject what you scan fMRI
and ask your monkey human subject to do
perceptual learning and the behavior
changed and you try to find some neural
correlates of this behavioral change but
this is just correlational study so
maybe there's some blame lesion hidden
from you either by sticking electrode or
by fMRI that's a locust and what do you
observe in fMRI adjust the epigenomic of
the real thing so our goal is to cause
some specific spatial activity pattern
in a specified brain area and to induce
perceptual learning as a result so cause
and effect caused our neuroscience and
the experiment consisted of four stages
behavior pretest ephemera decoder
construction decoded ephemera new he
back and behavior post test and this
slide explains this behavior pretest and
behavior post-test
the behavior our test is three
orientation discrimination task we show
this 10 degrees 70 degrees and 130
degrees orientation double patch to a
subject a subject watches this fixation
spot and observes this orientation
ratings for 0.3 second and then needs to
report the orientation opposite we
change it the signal-to-noise ratio by
adding noise so it should be quite
difficult to see 70 degrees orientation
for this so we can do all similar
function psychometric carbs or
psychophysics calves are in this pretest
and posttest and by comparing these
psychometric functions are we can
quantitatively estimate about the amount
of visual perceptual learning so unusual
visual perceptual learning behavior task
we usually show this kind of very faint
or stimuli repeatedly to the subject
then even by repeated exposure our
people tend to increase the
discrimination performance but in this
experiment we did not show any visual
stimuli during these training periods we
first constructed a decoder by our fMRI
matchbox a pattern so this decoder is
based on monomial space logistic
regression which I will explain in the
next rise and the task of this decoder
is to compute the likelihood of the
three orientation is presented to this
brain to this participant for example it
can say the probability of 10 degrees
orientation 61 percent 70 degrees twenty
one percent 130 degrees eighteen percent
we used as part of this regression on
the web by October masta and this is
nice because it does not need to tune
any hyper parameters in algorithms and
it is a simple linear summation for each
class and then softmax function he put a
LD a Spanish Ness prior to this so
basically in primary visual cortex and
second division coatings we have several
thousands of boxers but we could get our
utmost 400 learning samples such
fastness is really a necessary usually
this much loamians pathologies
regression are selected only 200 boxers
out of several thousand to ensure good
generalization our supplies over 50 and
now this is the most important and
probably most difficult to understand
conceptually so about this blog online a
subject participant task is explained so
we asked our subject please manipulate
your hind brain to get maximum monetary
reward that's all what we said to a
participant so it's really the
enforcement learning we did not give any
bubble instruction how to manipulate
debris but I informed to a participant
we calculated the likelihood of the
target orientation allocated to each
participant for example for this
participant plane we allocated 10
degrees as a target orientation and if
this decoder computes a likelihood is 16
1% then the maximum monetary reward
patria is 15 am around fifteen cents and
15-year x 0.6 one almost equals nine Yin
so this participant and nine Yin in
addition to the basic r1r are you
but you may wonder we didn't present
them any our orientation gratings why
this blend of 3d pattern could become
similar to the that induced by 10
degrees orientation now you need to
recall this study by weizmann institute
even in the spontaneous brain activity
resting state your brain activity of
luck sheet and sometimes looks like a
deer bug brain activity by some specific
orientation so without visual stimulus
presentation the Blaine state flag
sheets and this fluctuation was detected
by our decoder and if the decoder said
our this brain spontaneous brain
activity is close to the desired brain
activity then we gave much monetary
reward and if this is so different from
this unlikely this cell person then we
did not give them any monetary reward in
destroyer so each participant did 180
trials in the day and because we saw
this is really high dimensional curse of
dimensionality the enforcement learning
task we set 10 days of training but we
are perfectly wrong our subjects were
smart enough to get statistically higher
than chance level performance on the
first day this was an enigma for us
until my good friend Ken Julia told why
and this was achieved anyway for 10 days
are the mean likelihood for each
orientation for the target orientation
was statistically significantly higher
than the chance level sati
three-point-three percent hundred
percent divided by three and every day
they seem to be better in inducing the
target orientation brain
activity so new heat back went well but
did it affect perceptual learning in any
way yes we had this nice result for
comparing pretest and posttest
psychometric cops for non-target
orientations minus 60 degree plus 60
degree we didn't see any difference but
was a target orientation we observed
quite large or affect twenty percent
improvement for the same signal to noise
ratio so accuracy is only in tired
orientation in boob in post test
compared with pretest the conclusions of
perceptual learning induced by decoded
new heat back as follows me induction of
spatial pattern revenue activities
sufficient to cause visual perceptual
line without visual stimulus
presentation William b2r locus of visual
perceptual learning demonstrating
William boots plasticity in adulthood
and most interestingly subjects were not
aware of what the new orthodoxy no
represents and which is a target
orientation so after all the experiments
were completed we asked about the
strategies for each subject and they
reported really superstitious are
strategies like I just focus my
attention on the fixation spot I
imagined about a large monetary reward I
switched my attention to write died and
left why and the funniest report is I
imagined my most favorite scene from my
most favorite manga anime and no laporte
has nothing to do with orientation or
gratings at all and then we told them
the mechanism are the new hit back
experiment and ask them please guess in
which orientation you were trained or
what was a target orientation for you
again
the report was total London SAT is three
percent for each orientation so neither
implicitly or explicitly they were aware
of what's a tip and we also certaine
that there's minimal information leak
outside by only two like bubbly for with
three other brain areas so this
manipulation of information was limited
in blue on boy too so we then try to
extend this to control of conscious mind
first we did manipulation of facial
preference so the experiment procedure
is very similar to the previous one I in
the psychophysical pretest and
psychological post-test we show 400 face
images and asked our subject to rate
their preference from one to ten ten
most favorable one least preferable and
then we used a sparse linear regression
this is a regression version of the
sparse estimation in this sparsely
linear regression decoder most
accurately predicted the preference from
the cingulate cortex entire cingulate
cortex and new helix experiment is very
similar to the previous one but we
showed a neutral face for a 0.5 seconds
then we asked to get maximum monetary
reward and in this case are this
monetary reward is directly proportional
to the estimated preference from the
cingulate cortex in the case of
increasing preference but in decreasing
preference we subtracted the output from
this decoder are from 11-2 invites a
sign then we can dig Lisa preference
again induction was successful for up
group we had larger preference for down
group we had
reference this is induction phase and we
could see a preference leitung change in
comparing pretest and posttest or up
group we had increase of preference and
download decrease of preference and most
beautifully for me is if we plot the
induced activity change in the new he
dog training period as abscissa which
should be a cause and plot the
preference leading change measuring
behavior has own innate which should be
the result cause and effect then the
linear fit was this which almost passes
the origin 0 0 and the slope was almost
one saying that cause and effect much
very well and each point is each
participant so conclusions of facial
preference manipulation is as follows
associative death nap can bi-directional
change facie preference without
conscious awareness and the cingulate
cortex is a central area encoding balls
like and dislike facial preference by
different matchbox activity patterns
actually it was not demonstrated in fmri
literature that the single brain area by
changing its a special activity pattern
encode both preference and non
preference for our sins like our face so
we found out that dick knife works also
for higher cognitive functions and in
the frontal cortex so we attempted to
apply deccan f2 psychotic disorders like
OCD PTSD and pain the next study is also
dekhna fabrication to exchange tinction
of fear memory and which is related to
PTSD therapy I koizumi hamana Colin a
little contest vikash de
samer and hagwon la caused us on this
and experimental procedures is again
very similar on the first day we
constructed a color dakota so this
decoder takes a much boxer patterns from
boo young boy to and discriminate excuse
me red vertical gratings buses green
vertical gratings and on the van we did
fear conditioning so for this target she
is plus red gradings we gave electrical
shock of all control CS plus green
vertical gradings we gave electrical
shock again and for this yellow bark
operating with listen to anything so
geez to a target CS plus and control CS
plus and this is CS minus so we expect
our subject to increase amygdala
activity and to increase skin
conductance reflex only by showing geez
are conditioned stimulus positive
conditioned stimulus CS plus and then we
try to extinguish eliminate fear memory
related to this rep grading by
repeatedly inducing red color by dekhna
in buljan butsu while physically
presenting automatic vertical grading so
this is a kind of association by
physical presentation we show bargarh
gratings by dec knife we induce color
information in blue on blue zoo in
associate these two so this is kind of
similar to so called exposure therapy so
if you have PTSD because of tsunami
earthquake even if you see our pictures
or videos of tsunami and earthquake are
your fear memory is likkle
so one therapy is to repeatedly Shoji's
until you do not feel any fear but
that's of course there is stressful with
this dekhna we can subconsciously
present our target cs+ repeatedly
without our hustle by our patients and
then we examine amygdala activity and
skin conductance reflects on day five oh
we trained our subject for three days
days two three four and then they
hundred thirteen plus we examine the
long-term effect and the result was like
a remarkable so before Dec nav our
conditioning went well so forth to CS
plus we had larger iming the signal
change compared with CS minus but one
day after dekhna the amygdala activity
was dramatically suppressed only for CS
plus and even for months is after that
we had this decrease and skin
conductance reflex was even more
robustly suppressed compared with this
emitter acted oh by the way amygdala
anatomic i define of orgies analysis now
the final 14 debnath so we used much box
on your feedback technique to
selectively manipulate subjective
awareness without changing perceptual
performance so this was just submitted
yesterday and behavioral task was to
alternative forced-choice discrimination
and perceptual confidence rating so we
asked our subject to fixate then we show
purely random motion pure noise then we
show either right word or left word
partially coherent London motion with a
coherence level of a threshold 75%
collect then we asked our subject to
guess whether the motion is right or
left and also asked their confidence
about this perceptual judgment from one
two three four one is least confident
and four is most confident so confidence
is defined as degree of certainty of our
perceptual decision in this experiment
and confidence is a hot topic as
metacognition and self-awareness the
coding window used was here are three TR
six seconds including this stimulus and
delay before response but we found out
that those lateral prefrontal cortex
containing ifs MF s MFG and evil peretta
lesion are the most informative brain
lesions for decoding and this confidence
so in using a target confidence state
without awareness of what has to be what
has to deal and was carried out very
similar to the previous three experiment
we asked our subject somehow my idea
brain I will give you a monetary
feedback and this monetary feedback was
defined by the decoder which predicts
the preference and in this case we did
both increase and decrease within a
single subject are two days for each
week and continuous two weeks and
correlation between in this brain
activity patterns and the confidence
change were nice again and perceptual
confidence was manipulated by
directionally without perceptual
performance change and the result eludes
a popular celery assuming confidence was
just an older non-linearly transformed
version of perceptual signals that
cannot explain this result so this is a
list of successful dekhna experiment I
explained this ball and phenomenal
consciousness treatment of chronic pain
OCD exposure therapy stroke patient and
also other labs
uses very similar method for contouring
attention and what as a possible
mechanism not dignify the next topic so
this is just speculation but we have
Sabelle data supporting this so deck
Neff works as the postman learning of
brain activity pattern guided with basal
ganglia activation and Blaine activity
always luck shit if activity happens to
fluctuate in the desired direction that
the coda detects it and the wood
feedback is given to a subject on the
brain and septic plasticity is induced
dependent on nmda receptors dopamine and
serotonin my colleague in SLP vs
professor UGK gaya at tokyo university
are implemented similar experiment
apologize to dick naveen mice and he can
pharmacologically manipulate a mice
plane and found our MN d receptor
dopamine and serotonin are essential and
then we have several computational
remarks are for the first one thanks to
ken j 0 so we first saw that this is a
curse of dimensionality problem because
we have at least 200 boxes many degrees
of freedom and we gave just reward and
penalty so it should be impossible for a
subject to figure out how to control
this brain activity pattern but Kenji
pointed out that because we use a
monotonically increasing function
logistic function and linear weighted
summation in Dakota this should not
exist cause of the ingenuity in the
enforcement planning almost like
supervised learning or stochastic
gradient descent if each book cell
behaves like a single neural we can ply
simple hebbian learning to make this
sorry enforcement learning possible and
then another big question we did only
boxer level control why it can lead to
neuron and static control because we can
manipulate many things it should
influence snap sees and neurons
and that's because i believe constraints
of brain dynamics in spontaneous brain
activity we have infinitely possible
blade state if there is no connection
but because of spontaneous brain
activity are constrained by internal
connections it is very well aligned with
a bugged streamline this is a diagram
from Ken Harris and with some analysis
MDS and the similarity analysis we found
out that our in display activity are
similar to those activity induced by the
target orientation so this does not use
our Dakota but still we can see
similarity in March boxer patterns and
SLP vs the Kinect project has been
working quite well and we know collected
1100 our participants are including
depression schizophrenia chronic pain on
CD SD and back pain and we use dekhna
for OCD and pain and functional
connectivity new feedback for asd
depression schizophrenia and the
connectivity new feedback is to heat
their functional connectivity between
your two blaine lesions to subject so i
do not have time to explain about a
biomarker project but utilizing a nested
features direction by l1 scca and one
leave out cause validation by SLR we
could construct a very reliable
biomarker of SD are based on RSS MRI
then we found out that the connection
between the light amygdala and the left
nucleus accumbens is existent and
positive for typically developed
controls but battery does not exist how
for SD patients and it matches well with
the notion that ASD is social motivation
theory
and anyway we've been trying to increase
this non-existent brain connectivity to
the positive direction so a summary
optic nerve and function connect in
there in SL PBS decoded new feedback and
function collectively new feedback and
non-invasive causal methods to alter
human brain dynamics and disciplinary
behavior in the consciousness on
biomarkers far as the depression
schizophrenia an OCD exhibit the
spectrum relationship in listing said
functional connectivity MRI dignify
effective for phantom pain in this case
15 patients were examined with nice
control and bas in blue and O's in da CD
case one patient with white box and FC
NFR effective for SD temptations and
depression 60 healthy and a BDI bekommen
depletion inventory include so
concluding remarks psychiatric disorders
could be better understood as dynamical
disease and dick knife and a functional
connectivity in your feedback icaza
tools in human system neural science
March biomarkers based on brain dynamics
lead spectrum of psychiatric disorders
the biomarkers of each disorder was used
in determining target functional
connections in functional connectivity
new reebok therapy and dick Nev and
function continued heber could
constitute next-generation therapeutic
treatments and already provided
preliminary but encouraging result I did
not have much time to explain about
function quality in your feedback and
spectrum of psychiatric disorders I'll
talk about it on Friday the day after
tomorrow from to saty mercy in machine
learning and interpretation of
neuroimaging workshop is a title
spectrum of psychiatric disorders we
beat by machine learning algorithms so I
would like to end with imaginary figure
showing a spectrum structure of many
disorders this is an imaginary picture
so please do not believe in this and it
is my midterm go to locate myself
by the resting-state functional
connectivity where I am located my guess
is around here I think thank you very
much for your kind attention thank you
very much this one yes please thank you
for your a very nice presentation there
is something I didn't quite understand
when you talked about leakage of
information where you had a decoder on
v1 v2 yes and I thought you meant that
may be the signal about the the correct
target was not present in the other
areas is that what you meant it's
exactly but then how does the
information go to the motor cortex so
that you personally does the action it
has to go from v1 v2 to the motor cortex
is simple so actually this is not a
usual brain machine interface like
experiment so subject does not need to
utilize this orientation information in
that trial at all o our decoder leaves
out disorientation information Ryan just
gives in a monetary feedback our penalty
or reward and regarding the technology
are we use trial to trial decoder of the
blue even with the likelihood by large
box of patterns of other brain areas so
what about dopamine neurons I mean they
would be predicting the reward
presumably yeah yeah yeah so you right
somehow this information should go to
probably dopamine neurons and certain
neurons but I'd say always a much book
sale machine learning our wisdom we
cannot detect that kind of information
leak to dopamine was held to a newer but
anyway we didn't use midbrain as a
target region for this leak analysis
thanks for education hello so it was a
really great time and I was wondering
whether you have any idea of how
information arrives to control low-level
visual areas you are suggesting some
strategy using high level representation
of images like imaging my favorite scene
so and then do you think something like
backdrop from from that can happen too
much too so I'm not sure with IVD
understand your question do you ask
whether we give a useful linguistic
strategy or conscious our instruction to
our participants I know the
neurofeedback works so i know that you
don't do it and you let them look for a
strategy right and now while you are
explaining one of the narrative of the
strategies is one of the subjects if
member well say that it was imaging a
natural scene nitin using the natural
scene which we hope he'll think of being
constructed by layer of future maps to
modulate one of the lowest level of the
future map right to modulate b1 or b2
what was your target so do you think
that like actually human subject can
have access to modulate their late
ventral stream areas and use these to
back propagate activity two are early
visual areas and this way they achieve
control or whether end there are
multiple erath that you can use for to
do those I still do not know which I
really understand you but if you are
talking about some kind of downstream
influence for example from our
prefrontal cortex or parietal cortex
maybe we have downstream control of the
March boxer patterns in the primary and
secondary visual cortex we believe it
does not exist in this kind of
experiment Koza we did some other
experiment which we are interested in
phenomenal consciousness so which is not
about consciousness but only when you
have attention or top-down control this
content of the information appears on
the surface so in that case we found out
that just manipulating b1 b2 does not
to the usual sense of consciousness
thank you ok let thank meat though again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
