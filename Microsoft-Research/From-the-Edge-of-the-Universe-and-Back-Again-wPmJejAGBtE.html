hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
so next speaker is Curtis Wong Curtis is
from our Redmond lab and he is a
principal researcher there and his area
his research interests include data
visualization user interaction
interactive television media browsing
and automated cinematography the demo
that he is going to show today is going
to literally blow your weights very very
interesting I hope that all of you will
utilize it later and you know just to
give you some more background on Curtis
he has been working on very interesting
projects like projects tour which he
worked with Bill Gates and it's about
the messengers it's a series of lectures
by Nobel prize-winning theoretical
physicist Richard Feynman which is
freely available on the net so you can
actually go learn more and he is also
part of various advisory boards and
committees of various research museums
museums and he's a faculty at Trinity
College Dublin and he's also associated
an advisor with Getty foundation and
Katie conservation Institute okay Curtis
please come on stream thank you well
it's exciting to be here yesterday we
spent some time at the the Maharajah's
observatory and as somebody who cares
passionately about astronomy it was an
amazing thing to see such an important
site some wearing pink for him anyhow
I'm going to tell you a little story
about my background since people seem to
be doing that today when I was a young
child somebody gave me this book it's
called stars and it's actually a little
tiny book and on the front it says 150
paintings in color that tells you it's
so old it's almost like before
photography or something but I remember
reading this book and I was so inspired
because it started talking about the
Milky Way
a so I grew up in Los Angeles and you
can see this picture there on the right
and it probably looks a lot like what
Jaipur and other cities around here look
like in the United States about seventy
percent of kids live in major
metropolitan areas and like me have
never seen the Milky Way so what's the
big deal about the Milky Way well the
thing dried red and the thing to know
what I finally ultimately saw it which
was amazing to me sort of an
inspirational moment was that when
you're looking at the milky way you're
looking at so many different points in
time from hundreds to thousands to
perhaps 50,000 years in the past you're
also looking at light those photons
coming from so many different sons that
are also lighting up alien worlds that
you'll probably never see and so I
wanted the opportunity to be able to see
that and actually I wanted the biggest
telescope in the world and I wanted a
Harvard astronomer there with me so that
they could tell me what i was looking at
and so that seems like a crazy pipe
dream and it was something that I've
just sort of kept in my head for a long
time about how many years ago I tried to
prototype something like that just to
see what the experience was like on one
of the very early graphic computers but
it was totally inadequate to the task I
tried again maybe almost eight years
later a little bit further along but the
challenge was that the data was just not
available to have all of those images
there and so in 1998 i joined Microsoft
Research and I did a number of sort of
basic research projects but around 2002
I came to meet somebody who was really
remarkable so this code at the top is
one of my favorite quotes it says if I
have seen further if by standing on the
shoulders of giants and I was lucky
enough to meet two giants one was Jim
Gray who was a database fellow a touring
Award winner and Alex Ellie who's a
professor of astronomy at Johns Hopkins
University and they wrote this seminal
paper called the world wide telescope an
architect for online science and to me
that was signaling the beginning of the
transformation of science because in
that paper they talked about this
history of astronomy where
primarily empirical which is what the
Singh was doing at the observatory the
transition to theoretical science where
we were modeling and simulating what we
believe what was happening in the
universe and then with the proliferation
of data the transformation to a
data-driven science so in this paper we
also talked about big data and a number
of things sort of struck me and one of
the things that was there was about the
importance of visualization so I went to
a talk that Jim Gray did in research and
he was showing this chart here which
showed the the growth in the amount of
glass from big telescopes was actually
growing only slightly but the growth in
the amount of data those being collected
from larger and larger sensors and other
other sources was radically transforming
the amount of information that was going
to be available in the field of science
in essence every two years there was
going to be more data created in the
field of astronomy then existed in
history and how are we going to deal
with that and his last slides hit if
you're a vis person we need you and we
know it and so I found that this was my
calling because the data and the imagery
was finally starting to be available so
I work with Alex at Johns Hopkins on
something called we call that sky server
which was this attempt to make astronomy
data images available to public widely
and the recent paper that they had
written called that we just mentioned
was called worldwide telescope was the
idea if you make astronomy data
available if everybody does that online
in essence they said you have kind of
like a virtual world wide telescope
because the data is coming from everyone
in the world and when we were good
getting to dr three data released three
I said to Jim I said you know just
having the data there is just the
foundation I said this is probably one
of the greatest educational
opportunities we have which is to bring
together all this data and imagery into
one environment and create a virtual
simulation of the universe and even more
important than that allow an annotation
environment so astronomers educators and
even kids can create guided tours of the
universe so
fortunately for me we had a really
wonderful leadership at Microsoft
Research and I showed him our Rick
ratchet who is our senior VP this idea
of building the largest virtual
simulation of the universe and also I
wanted to make it free as a dot org and
in most commercial labs you would have
you heard that thing you would pump the
lab manager would probably say well
that's really nice once you go back to
doing what you were doing but I think
the thing about Rick was and it's
consistent with our leadership today is
that that was not a bad idea that was
actually an interesting idea what can we
learn by bringing together all of this
information data and imagery and make it
widely accessible so this idea I put
together a mock-up of this which is
essentially to present the sky in a way
that is natural to people present the
entire context of it all of us have seen
images from the Hubble and the Chandra
and Spitzer Space Telescope you see them
as images on a webpage you have no idea
how big they are where they are and I
wanted to try and bring all that
together into one context so we get a
sense of scale that's what this little
rectangle you are here window is in the
bottom down below there a little
thumbnail so it would show you exactly
what's up in the sky you could click on
them and then sort of go to them so
these were just some simple ideas about
how you might represent and present the
context of things and then the idea was
that all these objects were then
connected to deep information that would
be all over the web and lastly there was
this idea of guided tours and also if we
built this large visualization
environment we can also bring data into
it as well so this is sort of the
information conceptual architecture for
it somebody might start in a guided tour
go down into the sky but the advantage
of the tour is it's not video it's a
fully interactive experience because I
can pause and then you're in the
environment you could look at that
object from a different telescope and
drilling to get more information perhaps
branch off and go see a completely
different experience in another way so I
had presented this idea to a number of
astronomers around the country and Alex
my other giant said you should go to
this visualization conference at the
University of Chicago
and I said Kathy I'm going to be a whole
bunch of astrophysicist I'm not sure I'm
prepared to to present this crazy idea
that I a veces trust me i like it so
they invest they asked me to give the
opening keynote and i did and the
amazing thing is that everybody came up
to me there were astronomers and said if
you do this we want to help and so now I
realized that we have the data we have
the expertise and we had the technology
so I hired a very small team Jonathan
work with me on a project earlier alyssa
was our our science advisor and then i
had a couple of interns who are working
with us and essentially like with a lot
of diet coke and a lot of work we
managed to build this thing and that was
two thousand eight so how many people
here have seen a TED talks can you raise
hands oh pretty good number okay how
many people have been to a TEDx that's
pretty good too how many people have
been to an actual Ted in Los Angeles or
Monterey not too many I don't think
there's anybody okay so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to simulate the
experience of when we launched worldwide
telescope at Ted we did a preview at Ted
we were invited to do that because there
was a lot of buzz on the blogosphere
about it and what I wanted to do is I
created a guided tour and Roy Gould
who's the director of the National NASA
educational forum wanted to speak about
it because he is very influential in
astronomy education circles and wanted
to give his point of view about what he
thought it was significant so I created
a tour and I've used the audio from the
actual TED talk and I'm going to project
it up on the big screen and you are
going to see what it was like to be at
Ted because that's what I was doing in
the back I was behind the laptop driving
this to her so if we can bring the house
lights down
less than a year from now the world is
going to celebrate the international
year of astronomy which marks the 400th
anniversary of Galileo's first glimpse
of the night sky through a telescope in
a few months the world is also going to
celebrate the launch of research which I
think it's going to have as profound an
impact on the way we view the universe
as Galileo did for centuries ago it's
called the world wide telescope and I
want to thank Ted and Microsoft for
allowing me to bring it to your
attention and I want to urge you when
you get a chance to give it a closer
look at the Ted lab downstairs the world
wide telescope takes the best images
from the world's greatest telescopes on
earth and in space and has woven them
seamlessly to produce a holistic view of
the universe
it's going to change the way we do
astronomy it's going to change the way
we teach astronomy and I think most
importantly it's going to change the way
we see ourselves in the universe if we
were having this Ted meeting in our
grandparents day that might not be so
big a claim in 1920 for example you
weren't allowed to drink if you are a
woman you weren't allowed to vote and if
you looked up at the stars in the Milky
Way on a summer night what you saw was
thought to be the entire universe in
fact the head of Harvard's Observatory
back then gave a great debate in which
he argued that the Milky Way galaxy was
the entire universe Harvard was wrong
big-time of course we know today that
galaxies extend far beyond our own
galaxy we can see all the way out to the
edge of the observable universe all the
way back in time almost to the moment of
the Big Bang itself we can see across
the entire spectrum of light revealing
worlds that had previously been
invisible we see these magnificent star
nurseries where nature has somehow
arranged for just the right numbers and
just the right sizes of stars to be born
for life to arise we see alien worlds we
see alien solar systems 300 now and
still counting and they're not like us
we see black holes at the heart of our
galaxy in the Milky Way and elsewhere in
the universe where time itself seems to
stand still
but until now our view of the universe
has been disconnected and fragmented and
I think that many of the marvelous
stories that nature has to tell us have
fallen through the cracks that's
changing I want to just briefly mention
three reasons why my colleagues and I in
astronomy and an education are so
excited about the world wide telescope
and why we think it's truly
transformative first it enables you
experience the universe the world wide
telescope for me is a kind of magic
carpet that lets you navigate through
the universe where you want to go second
you can tour the universe with
astronomers as your guides and I'm not
talking here about just experts who are
telling you what you're seeing but
really people who are passionate about
the various nooks and crannies of the
universe who can share their enthusiasm
and can make the universal welcoming
place and third you can create your own
tours you can share them with friends
you can create them with friends and
that's the part that I think I'm most
excited about because i think that at
heart we are all storytellers and in
telling stories each of us is going to
understand the universe in our own way
we're going to have a personal universe
I think we're going to see a community
of storytellers evolve and emerge before
I introduce the
person responsible for the world wide
telescope I just want to leave you with
this brief thought when I ask people how
did the night sky make you feel they
often said Oh tiny I feel tiny and
insignificant well our gaze fills
universe and thanks to the creators of
the world wide telescope we can now
start to have a dialogue with the
universe I think the world wide
telescope will convince you that we may
be tiny but we are truly wonderfully
significant thank you I can't tell you
what a privilege it is to introduce
Curtis Wong from Microsoft
so if you go on the Ted site you'll see
that we're about almost 600,000 views
which is good but not not amazing so I
pause this tour here and even though it
kind of looked like video is actually a
series of what looks like slides and
that's how these things are created
essentially like a PowerPoint
presentation of you've done one it's a
place here in a place here in a place
here and you could see these numbers
which tells you how long that snapshot
plays from but since it is just a path
within the data environment allows you
this great flexibility to be able to
pause and deeply explore we were looking
at this one galaxy here which is m 81
and in fact just a few days ago there
was a supernova that was appeared in
this galaxy right next door m82 the
other aspect of this is if you wanted to
be able to see other imagery from other
telescopes that's what these images are
at the bottom so they're automatically
brought to bear in fact if you wanted to
go look at the center of this galaxy you
could see this bright blue spot there
that's a supermassive black hole in the
center of that galaxy and what you're
seeing is colored blue because you can't
see x-rays but it's very very very high
energy and it's also very very very
large but it you know having something
like worldwide telescope gives you in a
sense superpowers now they were not
hooked up to the internet here so I'm
running it in cache mode but if Y were
connected to the Internet what I could
do is I could go look up information
about that particular object on a number
of sites such as from France I could do
a query on 80s which is the Smithsonian
Astrophysical database and would look up
for this galaxy every single paper
that's been referenced that references
this particular object or if I went to
the Sloan site it would go and get a
source image I could get other data
specific to this galaxy and it'll do
that for all the objects that we have in
the sky in essence it's kind of like a
giant
container for all the world's astronomy
information I'm going to show you some
other things that are that are here in
worldwide telescope so this is the solar
system so some of you how many people
were kind of upset that Pluto was no
longer a planet oh yeah good number well
let me show you why it's not a planet so
what we're looking at here is this white
line that white line doesn't have the
Sun directly in the center and if you
look at the plane of the solar system
everything lines up so those are all the
planets are the bodies that were created
when the Sun and the solar system were
formed and actually by looking at this
at an angle you could see that that body
that we call Pluto was probably captured
at that angle either from below or above
or something like that and that tells
you something just by looking at this
the wonderful thing about visualization
is that it helps you by exploring and
interacting to develop a mental model
about information and mental models are
essentially the wonderful thing about
them is that as you start to compare
your mental model with this data that
you have from the exploration process
like any other scientific endeavor you
get a better and better model until you
reach some inflection point where you're
able to extrapolate new information so
I'm going to show as an example let's go
take a look at a planet say we'll look
at Mars now Mars is pretty far away it's
very very small if you looked at it
through a small telescope it's smaller
than a pea but here we are were down at
the surface of Mars and we can
essentially fly over the surface of Mars
with the digital elevation mapping of
Mars showing you the terrain of the
valley here and you can do that for the
Mars the moon we have the latest
resolution from from the Lunar
Reconnaissance Orbiter as well as the
high-resolution digital elevation
mapping so when you're looking at the
moon
another two in here we are flying over
the moon it looks just like when the
command module was flying over the moon
because you see the craters there as
you're floating over okay well I'll take
a step out of world wide telescope here
and we'll go back to my talk so one tour
that if you I'll tell you right now that
world wide telescope is free that's f
ree it's a free download at world wide
telescope org there isn't time to show
this now there's a tour called John huh
Chris universe so if you download it you
should take a look at that tour because
what's wonderful about that tour is that
John huh crow was an astronomer from
Harvard who spent much of his life
measuring the redshift two galaxies and
part of that information was when you
look up at the sky you know sort of the
x position in the Y position in the sky
but if you measure the redshift you know
the Zed and from that you he measured
the redshifts to thousands of galaxies
and it was able to establish the
dimensional distance and he and another
astronomer essentially put together the
first view of the large-scale structure
of the universe and you can see that not
only as data in the sky but then because
worldwide telescope is a rich 3d engine
we actually show you the redshift
distance so you can see that data in 3d
and understand the large-scale structure
of the distribution of galaxies I'm not
going to go into that right now but
jeanette's going to show a little bit of
that when you'll see here talk next so
after I finished world wide telescope I
thought wow we've done quite a bit of
visualization of many things in the
universe but there's a huge opportunity
here on earth to be able to start to
visualize data and better understand
what's going on here all that data that
we're getting there's much more data of
course on earth and there is from space
and what kinds of things can we do to
help us so one thing that's an immediate
of mind to me because I grew up in LA is
that there's always you know some
earthquake going on it'd be really nice
to know more of the parameters what's
the mental model for earthquakes so I'm
going to launch a little tour and this
tour essentially brings in fifty
thousand earthquakes that were from all
over the globe for a period of two years
and plotted on top of the earth so
typically seismologists will take a flat
map on paper and plot a circle where
there is an earthquake and the bigger
the circle the bigger the earthquake but
there's two other bits of information
that they're not able to use in the
paper method one of them is of course
the depth below the surface which is
critical as much more dangerous to have
learned closer to the surface then of
course down deep the other piece of
information that's missing of course is
how do you visualize stuff over time and
that's kind of a not not an easy problem
I think for them but so what we have
here and looking at this data you can
see some larger earthquakes and some
more shallow earthquakes and you
actually notice that they tend to form a
line between the dark blue and the light
blue which gives you a clue that
something is happening there well the
dark blue is probably deep ocean and the
light blue is probably shallow ocean but
it still doesn't explain why that that's
there but if we add depth data to this
which I'm doing now you'll start to see
that data it's actually moving but
what's happening one thing our brain is
totally trained to do is to be able to
notice motion parallax so that data that
look like random stuff over the light
area is actually forming the boundaries
of a subduction zone in the middle of
the Pacific in fact this is the deepest
subduction zone on the planet it's about
200 miles deep so what I'm going to do
here is let's go take a look as I
mentioned earlier about date / time so
we're flying over California that's the
San Andreas and the san andreas dumps
into the Sea of Cortez there and we're
going to go look at some data which is
above the country of Puerto Rico or the
state border and you can start to see it
here now all those white lines those are
fault lines one thing you'll notice is
that there's a few earthquakes that
happen near the fault lines like the
haiti earthquake but most of them are
actually somewhere else so we're looking
at these earthquakes at over a million
times real time and things that might
have seen random
when you compress them like that you can
see that they're actually forming
structures like lightning bolts going
into into the ground and you would never
see that from paper so this process of
exploration again as I'm starting to
populate this mental model of the
location of earthquakes and like the
other tour that you had seen earlier you
know you could pause that tour you could
sort of explore I mean if we looked at
the haiti earthquake and try and
understand what was happening with the
haiti earthquake you can see that that
was very close to the surface and that's
at that fault zone here compared to the
other quakes that were we were looking
at in puerto rico so okay so i'm going
to quit that so this was an interesting
experiment for us to start to plot data
and think about various opportunities
for representing different kinds of
environmental data so this is a
cumulative visualization of 30 years of
precipitation in the United States I'm
not going to run this book a tour but
when you see it it becomes obvious where
the rainfall is the tour's actually has
it so the virtual camera flies through
these clouds but again you can pause and
stop and explore and any one of those
data points originally when I came up
with the idea for guided tours it was
really for didactic reasons I wanted
that astronomer to tell me what i was
looking at when we were exploring the
sky but actually in the course of
working with data visualization it
became really obvious to me that's an
idea of a guided tour is a really
wonderful idea of being able to control
this virtual camera and drive to these
observations where you can control space
and time you can richly annotate the
boise or graphics or text or images you
can put hyperlinks and make those go out
to other things so this idea of a
flexible way a very lightweight way of
communicating inside about data there's
a very powerful concept because we have
so much data more than we know what to
do with I mean if someone said okay I've
got like 100 megabytes of data can you
look at this thing and it gives you the
file what do you do well it's you know
just trying to describe what to look at
but if we visualize that and we
have this camera that shows where it is
he can see exactly what you're talking
about in fact he can rhiana tate that
bring in another data set and come up
with perhaps a different conclusions
share that with other people so this
kind of educational ideas now sort of
been malleable and it's shaping our
thinking about how we might deal with
large data sets by democratization of
access by making something so simple
looks like a video anybody can do it and
you can essentially spread it to very
very large numbers of people and so I
spent about a year talking about data
visualization of this idea of guided
tours and 3d environments too many
people around the company given the
growth and complexity of data from
static data sets to more complex ones to
data cubes and of course data over time
and so a couple of years ago I took a
little break from Microsoft Research and
we have something called the startup
business group which provided some
funding for me to build a team to think
about how we can develop this capability
and integrated into a product that
everybody could use and so the the
process of started with worldwide
telescope because we modeled a lot of
these scenarios in what I had showed you
but we really tried to expand and
envision what would be possible not
necessarily for scientists but for the
average person in an organization you
have a spreadsheet and I have say
companies over the world that I just
want to sort of see what the difference
is between sales and different countries
are different cities and that became our
sort of design goal and we built this
and it is actually going to be part of
Excel later this year so i'm going to
show you that process really quickly so
this is a you know your typical
spreadsheet this one happens to be a
health inspection data would you like to
know the quality of a health inspection
of the food and every restaurant you
wanted to go to in advance so here in
what happens here is this data file i
downloaded directly from the source and
it has address and it has latitude and
longitude and other data if it doesn't
have lon longitude or latitude it
automatically looked at what others sort
of
fields are there and then decides what
to geocode perhaps somebody had
something from Paris and you couldn't
tell if it was Paris Texas or Paris
France well we would look at other other
data sources in different places to sort
of correlate about the best to best
resolve that particular location so all
of that geocoding happens automatically
so what you get immediately is just all
the points plotted on the map and if you
pick something like category then it
automatically then generates these bars
in a 3d environment and you saw the tour
that we created earlier worldwide
telescope all you do is just snapshot
different scenes here such as so you
make this one and then this one and then
if you want to create a video out of it
you can as well just by selecting video
and the resolution and then what you get
is this it's a fly through into the data
space and it's that easy in a video of
course it's video you and you can't do
anything with it but this tour if you're
watching it inside of Excel it is fully
interactive at any time you could pause
and explore and drill into a particular
data and then come up with some
interesting observation and then bring
in other datasets as I had said earlier
so I'm getting close to near the end so
I thought we could either sort of choose
this if I was running out of time I was
going to go on the red pill but I
decided I have a little bit more time so
I'm going to do a little recap about
worldwide telescope so it's been five
years since we lost world wide telescope
at Ted I thought I would play just a
little bit of a summary it'll show you
some new things about worldwide
telescope that have just been added
recently
you
thank you so over the years it's been
really a remarkable engagement and an
adoption of worldwide telescope the
oldest planetarium in the United States
the Adler Planetarium Chicago last year
decided to abandon to traditional large
dome cinemas showing movies of the sky
and then use worldwide telescope in the
dome as a result they're able to do
these things that look like the
traditional planetarium movies but
because they're interactive at any time
it allows much deeper engagement with
the audience and it's been I think a
real winner for them the Rose Center the
largest planetarium in new york city is
also has it in there actually today the
california academy of science is doing
something which is in san francisco the
university of washington has built
transitioned from a traditional star
ball planetarium with a very small grant
was able to turn their planetarium into
a digital planetarium where graduate
students are creating guided towards
that that didn't sharing that knowledge
with undergraduates Warsaw Moscow State
many others so here's a picture of world
wide telescope at the University of
Washington here's a picture of the Adler
Planetarium and this is kind of an
engineer yum i was at Harvard back in
September and I met him to stronger
there and she said you know I used
worldwide telescope to teach girls in
Iran about astronomy I said how do you
do that she says why I get on skype and
they get on worldwide telescope and and
we have these lectures together and in
fact you know I said I couldn't believe
that you actually do that he says oh
it's hugely popular in fact your tent
mysm little mail that says I believe
many Iranian use thank you every day and
you know when we were
talking about why research you know
research gave me the opportunity to take
this dream I had of enabling every kid
in the world to be able to see and
understand the Milky Way and when I was
younger I never thought I would be able
to reach a poor kid in the south part of
around and I think computer science and
technology really have the ability to
make a huge impact I mean I think you
can take a job anywhere and you know get
enough money to buy car and all that
kind of thing but I think if you were
able to shape people's lives i think
it's it's really the most amazing thing
you could do I mean imagine I was
inspired by this little book right and
it motivated me to build this thing all
the world wide telescope I can only
imagine what you could do when you're
you know thinking about that thing that
really inspires you and the technology
in 20 years from now what that'll do and
the people that that will influence and
inspire and hopefully make this a better
world thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
