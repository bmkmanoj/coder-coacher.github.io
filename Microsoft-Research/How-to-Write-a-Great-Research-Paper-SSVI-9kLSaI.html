you
okay you good morning it's very nice to
hear this here's the plan we all have to
write write the big part of the fabric
of doing research is writing papers and
if you look at papers you'll find that
lots of them a bit and complex for a bit
hard to make sense of and what I wanted
to suggest you is seven simple things
that you can do that will raise you know
your own game and make your papers that
are easier to easier to understand and
more published publishable which is all
good now this is something about which
people nobody has a monopoly on truth so
I'm gonna tell you what works for me may
not work for you but also some of you
will have written papers already or will
have some experience of your own and I'd
like to encourage you not to sit very
passively and politely until the end
before you know the marks of the search
would rather to engage in some kind of
dialogue as we go so you can ask
questions you just make comments and say
yeah you know so this you know I do
something different here you know and
because my field is different another
thing that can be different is the
different fields have different
conventions so you know bioinformatics
might be rather different and climate
modeling like we've all the difference
to my field of computer science so but
the principal target that I'm going to
address is the framework of a kind of 12
page conference paper in ACM you know
two column format so but most of what I
say will apply to any paper that you
might write but but that's that's my
sort of prime mutargo I think it's easy
to focus on one thing to begin with okay
so you ready seven things
so here's number one when we like papers
we often think that we should sort of do
our search them like this you first of
all have some kind of idea and then you
do a word search you know you do a PhD
and towards the end you think right now
I've worked everything out I can write
the paper it seems only seem sensible I
do the work then like the paper this is
utterly wrong but I nobody should do
this this is what you should do like
first of all you have some kind of like
a topic idea then you start to write the
paper and that tells you the research
that you need to do so the act of
articulating something in writing even
if only for yourself is incredibly
helpful in crystallizing your ideas and
sort of make
forcing you to write them clearly enough
so that you know whether they they make
sense or not right and it's it's not
uncommon to if you do if you follow this
model it's not uncommon to get to the
end where I've been writing the paper
you know it's only six weeks before the
conference deadline and you discover
there's a whole pile of work that you
haven't done that you should have done
to write this paper and there's a whole
pile of work that you did do that was
irrelevant for this paper like so this
plan makes it much more task focused you
sort of start to focus on on writing a
paper and then it's like that lazy
evaluation in functional programmers
like you you sort of have to work on the
bits that are needed to deliver the
results does that make sense right so
the other really good thing about
writing early is that it it gives you
something you can talk to other people
about so when you interact with other
people research as a sort of community
effort is not really conducted by monks
in their cells each working individually
for years occasionally yes gave me but
not typically it's more of a community
thing and this is the mechanism of
communication in the community now if
you like some kind of draft of a paper
that's not finished yet then okay you're
not going to publish it in a journal but
you might share with a few of your
research colleagues to say here's what
I'm thinking about you know it does this
make sense er it gives you something so
much more concrete to discuss with your
colleagues okay so it's pretty simple
idea really just start writing early so
like you know you have to have something
to write about but but don't wait very
long you know a month or two is long
enough for where you can start writing
something it doesn't have to be for
journal or for conference it can just be
something to help you get your ideas
straight so I just want to articulate
the idea that the act of writing is not
a kind of output of the research it's
part of the fabric of doing research
it's the main forcing function that I
use so I think it casts your writing in
a different frame when you think about
in this play so far so good so it's
pretty simple right there's another one
yeah
this Pleasant part of the research
writing the papers and in the case that
you're wrecking the paper and nothing
comes out there then it might seem like
a waste of effort no waste of time and
why it's so writing may be hard right
and your point is that if it turns out
but nothing comes out of it then it was
a waste I don't think it's a waste right
so I would suggest for example you might
spend six months working on that dead
end and then discover that it was a dead
end as if you spent a month starting to
write you might have discovered it
earlier right - that the writing forces
to the surface the fact that maybe this
is not very productive line so I don't
know I can't deny that writing is
sometimes difficult and but in my heart
I think it's really worth it but you
know that if the trade-off is a good one
right so the question is can couldn't
you write a PowerPoint presentation
instead of writing paper that's fine -
yes it tend to be a bit less detailed so
there's a more of a danger that you
might skate over the the dodgy bits
right and deceive yourself we have this
great great capacity for self-delusion
right say oh yeah I understand that when
you like the paper to be able you don't
understand it so there's a bit more
danger of that but yeah anything to
articulate it so that both you and other
people like appreciate yes
an introduction motivation evaluation so
sort of set of headings great yeah then
I put in a couple of dot points gas is
counting what I'm thinking but the nice
thing about using a shareable whatever
is insurance is going with and they can
add comments anything and this helps
firstly it's kind of the skeleton which
the paper is going to eventually label
and then it also means that immediately
we're feeding back against each other
and when I say I think we can evaluate
it this way they say that's a terrible
idea because it will never work yeah
that's really early on in the process I
haven't looked at building anything you
know you a slightly different mechanism
for articulating ideas and sharing them
and by making them concrete invisible
yep that's right all good yes
okay so number one here's number two all
right which is here I said this what
about this idea but at the beginning so
it's very important in a paper to know
what the idea is at least by the time
you've finished so what is the purpose
of writing a paper here is the purpose
it is to convey a reusable insight or
idea from your brain into the mind of
what's your name Matt right so from my
brain into Matt's brain so my my paper
is kind of like a virus that is carrying
this infectious idea out of my brain and
it's going to infect Matt's neurons and
soon he's going to be able to think of
nothing else and then he's gonna tell
his friends and they'll tell their
friends or - my idea is going to
infected the world right so so it's a
it's a that the paper is a way of
conveying ideas that's its primary
mechanism by using mozart as my example
here because Mozart's ideas were so
incredibly seductive and compelling that
hundreds of years after he's died think
we go to concert halls to hear people
read his papers alright so so so so long
after we are dust long after the
artifacts that we build at us and in
computer science is vogue constructive
engineering kind of subject as well as a
scientific one so we build things but
long after the things we build are dust
the ideas that we develop will hopefully
still live on in some way yeah they kind
of reuse and I stress
reusable because because novelty of
itself is of little value in computer
science right simply tap something to be
new is not important it's going to be
new and somehow useful could be the
science is like a a fact all it's like a
snowflake everywhere you study ramifies
ahead of you so it's easy to find new
territory right but you just invent it
out of thin air but it's new territory
which is great interest to you and
mainly no interest to anybody else so
you must have some utility unlike say
physics where if you discover something
new that is a fact about the world so it
is of interest to other people and this
last point is just that however clever
you are however brilliant you are if you
sit in a windowless black box and
generate great ideas but don't tell
anybody you might as well not have done
it right you're just generating heat
sort of increasing entropy in the
universe so it means it's a worth you
actually need to communicate because
otherwise you might well not a bother
now so once you've got this idea even
then they need to know sort of what it
is when you finish writing your but when
you begin writing your paper it may be a
bit hard to articulate exactly what your
key idea is but by the time you've
finished you should be in no doubt and
you should leave your readers in no
doubt as well I can't tell you how many
reviews that I've written a paper as a
reviewer I've written in the review I
believe that the key insight of this
paper is blah blah blah blah blah a
reviewer should never have to write that
the author should say the key insight of
this paper is blah blah blah blah
so do signpost very clearly when you
when you have you know when you get to
your key idea and if you have lots of
ideas
don't try to slam them into a single
paper so then it becomes like you know
like sort of concentrated high bitumen
diet all squished together with a wither
with a clamp like then it's very
indigestion if you have lots of ideas
that's cool right lots of papers all
right so don't don't don't don't try to
overpack a particular paper so and this
is a sorry just just saying that this is
about signposting make sure that you
know and you'll readers know what the
idea is
so this is a good litmus test to apply
to your paper at a late-ish stage we
compiled in every stage but you don't be
too hard on yourself to begin with right
but also apply to papers that you read
when you read a paper think to yourself
what is the key idea in this paper what
do I take away a sort of reusable
insight most papers are that jammed full
of detail and Greek symbols and
technical complexity and tables of
measurement and who knows what kind of
carry-on right but when you read the
paper if it's a really good paper you'll
come away with something that's a clever
idea which I thought - that right so you
can apply that discipline to yourself
when you read papers and then that will
give you a greater sense of what other
readers would like to find in your
papers when you like them does that make
sense but so if you read a paper and you
think I've got a clue what the key idea
is that's not your fault
that's the author's fault okay so
knowing what key idea is very very
important is sort of dominates
everything else one other thing about
the key idea yes for combinations
well there's so many maybe I do have to
put more than one thing in but then
perhaps the key idea is the combination
of these two does more than you would
expect you know so and that perhaps
that's a bit surprising somehow so you
know a plus B is the one plus one is
more than two that's kind of what you're
suggesting here so say that - don't just
lay them out one two three oh ho hum
like they say o ones with the amazing
seven highlight it yeah yeah
which is you know it it is new but it is
a very very tiny kind of addition yes it
seems like too little oh very good
question you said we right into this
thing right so you have an idea but it
seems like a a very tiny idea you read
other people's papers they have good
ideas right
oh they're full of inciting you think
wow how amazing what brain they must
have brains the size of small asteroids
I'm a mere pitiful worm and my ideas are
pitiful and insignificant and nobody
would possibly be interested in them
right everybody feels this even the
people whose papers you are reading and
it seems so impressive they felt like
that to begin with at least if they're
in the sort of the 90% who are so
self-confident they don't have a moment
of their self-doubt
but believe me they are in the minority
so the truth is that what you must do is
you must start to write about any idea
no matter how we D and pitiful it may
seem now sometimes it will turn out that
it is indeed we didn't pitiful
in which case writing the paper won't
take very long and you haven't lost much
but my consistent experience which I'm
just feedback - for what it's worth is
that much much more often you take
something that seems to be fairly
straightforward and you start to work
out the details and think about
interactions with other things and it
turns out to be more complicated than
you thought it turns out to be worth 12
pages of two column format not two pages
that are maybe not a book berth and a
conference paper size idea so that
happened to me fairly recent you know
like only nine months ago I was writing
a paper with an intern it was kind of we
thought oh this will be the warm-up
project for this intern yeah I'm pretty
easy we'll knock it off in a couple of
weeks you know eleven weeks later we
were still going and we did end up
writing a paper about it initially I
thought oh well you know we'd better
document this it's not very hard but
then it turned out there's no
complicating we thought ended up in the
one of the top programming languages
conferences so and then so this is still
happening to me right after I were going
to tell you how many years of doing
computer science you so to start with
something weedy and you end up with
something interesting I can't give you
that confident you'll build that sense
of confidence after you've done it for a
while just let me encourage you to
believe for a moment that it is
worth writing even about insignificant
ideas sometimes it won't work sometimes
they'll turn out being significant and
then you just you know leave it as an
unpublished note on your home page right
you don't have to publish everything
that's fine right you just say here's
here's something a little something I
did it's not very big but it's but I did
write about it and here it isn't okay so
so much about the idea then it's just
repeating so two things right early and
identify your key idea okay so the third
thing I wanted to talk about was to do
what you want what to do once you've
starting to write your paper so and
let's see this in on Thursday you can
have a talk from what's-his-name David
David Newman
if you leave you talked about
presentation skills and he's going to
tell you tell stories now he's going to
tell you about telling stories about
sort of and it dotes about people this
is a different kind of story that I'd
like to tell here's the story that I try
to tell in my papers I like to say you
know my model is if I take a friend
what's your what's your name knock knock
if I take Marco and so about my ours
which are not very good and I say I've
got five minutes with you I want to sort
of tell you a bit about what I'm doing
then what am I going to do I'm going to
walk up to a whiteboard and I'm going to
sort of sketch a quick you know a couple
of examples of something and say look
here's an interesting problem and here's
the kind of web tackling it I'm not
going to give you theorems I'm not going
to write definitions and things I'm
going to do this kind of thing here's a
problem it's an interesting problem it's
an unsolved problem and here is some
intuition about my idea right so I'm
going to and if I do this to you in
person you can think about the kind of
storyline that you would do or those of
you are presenting posters you've been
thinking about how to do a kind of you
know a five minute capsule summary of
the story about what you're up to and
you've tried to put that on your poster
and you'll and doubtless over lunch be
explaining it to people as you go I want
you to think about your paper in the
same way just a slightly greater length
so here is you know your story line you
what you want your reader to think is on
page one they think well I can see
that's a problem and oh I have the
vaguest idea about how they're solving
it but it certainly you know if they
could deliver on these claims that would
be
think maybe I'll turn the page and read
page two and then you say oh it's a bit
more detail about the idea I kind of see
how that might work but there's a lot of
details I'm not sure about maybe a
little bit further - you're still doing
- you're joining them in bit by bit
rather than hitting them with them with
difficult stuff right away and then of
course the my idea worked details and
data stuff that's the bulk of your paper
to be sure this is not you know word
counts here and then a bit about related
work without more to say about there so
this is my overall plan for a story for
a paper and here's how it kind of breaks
down in size for me size and leadership
so the title is led by a lot of people
the abstract by rather fewer the first
page by rather fewer and the rest of it
by virtually nobody so and
proportionately so what does this tell
you this tells you should invest a lot
in your first page now a title titles a
bit tongue-in-cheek right so don't over
invest in making snazzy titles but do
try to make your titles informative
enough so that somebody flicking through
the proceedings is going to think it's
going to realise when it's about
something that they're interested in so
but the the introduct this first page
thing I think is really important I want
to say quite a bit more about what to
write on your first page because your
readership drops off very sharply after
the first page I think a lot of people
take a look at the beginning of a paper
and then move on quickly so when someone
is a little bit about some of these
pieces but I think starting with the
introduction and so the introduction
here this page that can be read by most
people what's going to be in the
introduction well it's going to say
something about what the problem is and
why it's important and something about
what the contributions of your paper are
so this fourth point is about
identifying your contributions so the on
your first page you have to say
something about the problem you're
trying to solve otherwise your
contributions to it wouldn't be at all
clear so you do have to set the scene
somehow but you do you want to fit all
of this on a on a page but you know
journal with tiny pages you can't hope
to do this on a page but a sort of the
a4 size conference format you can get a
lot on the first page and it's worth
really trying to do that and I want to
say a bit about what I mean by
contributions because that's the sort of
key
part here so I'm here's an example of a
paper that I wrote like here's my first
couple of paragraphs they're describing
the problem and I'm not describing the
problem in general terms I'm describing
a particular concrete instance of a
problem oh I beg your pardon so I have
I've mislaid myself I want to talk about
contributions but I want to say a little
bit about this describe the problem bit
because this is a place where people
often go wrong and this is the way in
which they go wrong they describe an
over-ambitious problem right so suppose
you come across an ant and the ant says
to you here is you know my life's work
I'm going to climb Mount Everest alright
and so and you think aunt you are never
going to climb Mount Everest it may be a
good goal many people are working on it
but there's no point in really reading
your paper about climbing Mount Everest
but most you're going to get up is you
know a tiny boulder or two on the way so
here's an example of a you know the kind
of introduction you sometimes see in
papers the outlines some vast research
area that is occupied hundreds of
researchers for thousands of man years
who say that's what this paper is about
so when you read this kind of stuff
right the many programs have bugs and
it's important to eliminate them and so
there's that make the blood pulsing your
veins do you think yes this is the paper
that I want to read in this proceedings
it's an it your knee isn't it your honor
sir okay yeah sure I know that like that
motherhood and apple pie nobody could
possibly disagree with this claim but if
you have a more focused claim like here
is a particular program that has an
interesting bug in it and you say I'm
going to show you how to detect not just
this bug but a whole class of similar
bugs and you can kind of perhaps
informally characterize what that class
is now you're you're encouraging your
reader to believe that you have an
achievable goal here one that you might
actually deliver in the skin the scale
of this paper does that make sense
so that's why I say mole hills not
mountains if you describe a mountain
people will yawn if you describe you
know a sugar cube they may yawn as what
you want to describe something in the
middle that seems achievable on page one
okay so don't waste page one writing
down motherhood
apple-pie statements that nobody could
disagree with their page one words are
your sort of golden words where you have
you know you have your big readership
don't waste those words okay all right
so then I wanted to go back let me go
back to contribution sense you've
described your idea and you've given
some idea that it might be achievable
and now you're going to say what this
paper delivers now most papers do
something like this a surprisingly large
minority fail to state their
contributions explicitly at all they
just say introduction they treat it as a
kind of general introduction to the area
and you're expected by the time you
finish reading the paper you might have
figured out what its contributions are
but no on page one you must I think
state the payload you take what is the
reader going to get if they read this
paper right so it's kind of like a
specification and the rest of the paper
is like the implementation so what
you're trying to do is to make the
reader think oh if you know the author
could deliver on her promises that she
makes on page one then this would be a
paper well worth reading and that at
least encourages you to to go on write
go on and reading so I always use
bullets for this so this is just my
style but I like this because it forces
me as an author to be completely
explicit about what my contributions are
so you know some of our introduction
state problems and then finally I say
and now we're going to get to the
contributions I may say contributions I
may say some sense it's like this firm a
basis and then I list out you know claim
one think of them as claims first claim
second claim third claim just list them
out you must not leave your reader to
guess what these claims are going to be
you must make the claim okay and when
you're making claims try to make them
refutable claims in science it's not
very interesting to study hypotheses
that cannot be refuted or that are
obviously true so here's an example you
know and your contribution say we are
going to describe a type system and
we're going to study its properties
of course you're going to study its
properties right
what has the reader learnt from those
precious words on the front page nothing
this is not a claim that could possibly
be refuted well as if you state you know
I'm going to prove that its sound and
type-checking is decidable these are
admitted by an abandon are using some
more technical language but you know the
people in that area will know what you
mean and they said ok so he's going to
prove some refutable facts about the
type system that he's produced by and
I've got a couple of other examples here
just that the kind of things that you
often see on page one and the kind of
things I would prefer to see so think of
it like celery rather than overcooked
spaghetti celery has crunch right you
bite it and get reliable right so you
want a crunchy first page not a soggy
first page all right yes desires if you
have just achieved well the fact that
even the very fact that you have it
you're saying if you've achieved
something that everybody wants what okay
so but but so you might say so this is
this is I have verified a C compiler
well that's a very that's a sort of
overarching kind of statement I mean it
does actually describe a lot of you know
10 or 12 year research project conducted
by dozens of people but nevertheless so
in a paper you might say specifically we
have you know a machine supported proof
of a compiler for you know sub dialect
of C that you know all the way from the
the ASCII source code to the you know
machine code you could be a bit more
specific about what it is and you could
say we have you know the Machine
supporter proof goes from front to back
so now you've articulated the claim in
rather more detail and almost certainly
there's there's sub detail in there that
you could articulate you know one but
you might say improving the you know the
chance for the the optimizer we had to
invent a completely new proof technique
that nobody we had never really seen
before it's described in section three
and it works roughly like this so you've
almost certainly got you know sub
achievements that you might want to
identify within which you're over so try
to identify the the pieces
so the fact that it's a goal that
everybody would like to achieve that's
good right that doesn't make it a non
refutable claim your claim is that you
you know you might not have done it
quite as thoroughly as or reproducibly
as you claim we do yeah yeah oh how many
bullets should you have so I this varies
a lot so some of my papers I have you
know two or three some it's more like
708 I would seldom have ten or twelve
that kind of yeah well yes yes yes so so
there's a good question so how can you
have many contributions but only one
idea right so I think often it's you
like there's some great gray I think I
think what you find is that there's a
there's a there's a sort of motivating
force or factor and the idea but to say
this idea really works often requires
you know little contributions of one
kind or another I don't think you'll
find that's difficult in practice but I
do think that let's see this is
sometimes what you find at the end of
the section at the beginning right at
the end of the introduction you have a
paragraph that says the rest of this
paper structured as follows you love
reading those paragraphs when you get to
that point in the paper do you think
haha what do you do you skip it where is
this paragraph on page one so you're
inflicting this paragraph which
everybody is going to skip on your
maximal leadership why are you doing
this
this is a self-inflicted injury that
many papers make now of course it seems
sensible right to give your readership a
road map but actually there are better
ways to do it and like I've shown you
some here so I make my list of
contributions have forward references
right so for every claim this is really
what I want to say each claim
forward references the evidence for that
claim right so when I hear I claim that
type sister I say Section four that's
what if you if you the reader want to
verify that I've delivered on this
promise go look in Section four
and now the list of contributions serves
and you can see another example here
not necessarily in all of Section four
or five and six and seven and so you
know it's not the sections that
necessarily appear in order but there's
some kind of narrative story for these
contributions that inter alia you know
among other things gives you a roadmap
for the paper
that's how make sense it's a great way
of subliminally giving this structure
without actually doing this kind of
nonsense which is a total waste of space
this is a fully explicit vote that yes
but is it ever useful to you as a reader
honestly well you can write it and then
comment it out later or sometimes on
long journal papers I mean I sometimes
do fine long journal papers sometimes
come with a pictorial vote map they say
section three you know there's an arrow
to section seven you know you must read
section three before section seven
there's sort of complex
interdependencies among a larger piece
of work or perhaps a thesis right you
might have some interesting
interdependencies so then and that
really is looks like a map right with
spatially laid out that can be quite
useful but in their smallest it smaller
compass I don't think that's so so
important that's my opinion so mate
there's no probably occasions when this
you should ignore this rule but I
encourage but because it's so much the
norm to do this I'm encouraging you to
question that norm seriously and only do
it it is really paying its way yes
what sure helps you to helps you to find
a bit that you need yeah so I think so
my my claim is that you can more or less
do that purpose
with your contributions bullets right
and moreover because they because this
section always seemed feels like a bit
of an overhead it's usually too short to
do you know each section is described
very briefly so it's hard to know if
that's a section was in a list of
contributions here you could you got a
few more words so it's easy so I think
that's a that's the place to do for my
money okay so yeah the question is the
key insights so I would say okay try to
figure out what you think the
contributions are right and write down
those don't just plot them out with more
to make it make you look just figure out
what you think your contributions are
agree write the narrative and hang the
contents on that if you can so so for
example if I have a related work section
I don't put that in the list you know
one of my contributions is that I have
related work no I don't do that I tend
to just I do add a little note often
after the contributions bit to say very
briefly you know one line I say we
discuss will they
work section 8 kind of is not a
contribution but I just mentioned it
chose to so the readers going to know
we're going to find that that kind of
thing so try to I think don't think of
it it primarily as a content list think
of it primarily as a list of
contributions and hang however many
forward references you can online that's
all I can say another good thing about
the doing this is that if you find a
section that is not referenced at all
you might question whether it belongs
there at all often it does you need some
background work or some mathematical
notation or something but not always
sometimes it can be like dead code
elimination right there's a whole
section you wrote that turns out not to
be delivering the payload of the paper
fine take it out put in another paper
when it is contributing yeah quite a bit
- yeah it's easy to sort of scan through
and see the large full letters yeah
paper without me to read them and so
even if you don't list all of your
sections maybe their contributions point
you know having a big related work title
of the end is pretty explicit right so
you're saying that the titles themselves
form a roadmap that's pretty easy to
find flicking through yes I actually
thought it's always easier to find than
this very dense little paragraph like
this yeah okay yeah by the way because
you're white at the phone here at the
back what they did as I said who is an
interesting problem all of the existing
solutions suffer from the following
things one two three and then they said
our system whatever is much better and
it has the following properties one two
three four word references to the thing
and that was the first page essentially
but the really nice thing about it was
it was in itself a summary of the entire
paper it was kind of the related work
although it was only three sentences and
it was kind of all of the contributions
although it was only three sentences and
from just reading that front page you've
got the entire paper crammed in more or
less in a in a very neat way having seen
that I mean it only really applies to
play
is where you have this kind of big body
of background work that is all all
contributing to the same sort of problem
but it it's similar to this but it was
the nicest format that I've seen in any
paper I've read and when I read it I
went oh great I get I get exactly what
you guys have done and the rest of the
PI paper sort of followed directly from
that so I just thought I'd add that as a
nice about doing things thank you and do
you do think about what you want to do
is if have a first page which somebody
get something from all by itself it's
not just some flannel which they have to
wade through to get to your paper what
you'd like is for your reader to even if
they stop at the end of page one you'd
like them to take something away with
them that's a good metric to apply to
papers wherever somebody leaves the
train do they take something useful away
with them or do they only get to them
the juice the payload you know if they
wade through mountains of the swamp
oceans of swamp okay I want to mention
one other thing that papers often do
write not not just this that's even
worse related work so it seems that good
scholarship right you you're about to
undertake some some you've identified a
problem and the first thing you should
do is to say we stand on the shoulders
of giants and you should describe in in
detail all the work that has gone before
it's a disaster when you have somebody
in front of a whiteboard and you you say
you know you're my friend I want to tell
you know I've got Marco in front of my
whiteboard right do I begin by giving
him a five-minute lecture on related
work before I get to the stuff of course
not so it's damaging in all sorts of
ways one thing is that you don't have
enough intellectual scaffolding to
understand it yet because they haven't
read the paper right so experts may
understand this kind of gibberish that
you often find in related work sections
but the bulk of your readership will not
and the paper isn't you know you want to
address more than just the the core
experts in your paper you'd like to
convey this idea to people although not
already experts in this particular field
the other thing is that because it feels
as if it's getting in the way of getting
to the payload related work sections
often start you know
two and a half pages and then a process
of squishing takes place which every
alternate word is omitted and sentences
are crafted to be shorter and more
cryptic until you have this sort of
dense incomprehensible gibberish that
nobody can understand even the experts
so the bad thing is that what it doesn't
do your readers any good right it makes
them feel stupid because they read this
stuff and they think this is only page
two I'm supposed to be understanding
this and I have no clue what is going on
right and also if they do take the
trouble to try to figure it out they
feel tired so they're exhausted before
they get to the main idea so in effect
what you've done is you place a sort of
concrete wall between your reader and
the main payload of your paper which is
your idea so what to do because after
all what we cannot do is to pretend that
there is no related work no no so what
you want to do is to just put it at the
end right so by the time you get to the
end you have a lot more intellectual
scaffolding you've introduced examples
you've introduced intuitions you've
described something about your work you
have much much more background to work
with when you're describing moreover in
introducing related work there you can
compare it with your own whether at the
beginning you can't because you haven't
introduced your own yet and I have read
related work sections at the beginning
that attempt to do a comparison with the
not yet presented idea it's just a
disaster so now this is not to say that
the two things this is not saying the
first is is not saying do not have any
references to anybody else until you get
to the end as you present stuff you
should make references to other people's
work you know we know so you could say
you know in developing this idea we
follow the ideas of you know of green
and white black at sea section eight in
doing this so what you give the expert
reader says huh I knew that you know the
green and white had this had this are
something an idea like this but I see
he's going to address that a little
later that's fine right so you've given
a forward reference that reassures the
expert reader that they will be covered
without distracting the non-expert
reader who thinks that's fine I don't
care about green and white I just care
about the payload okay the other thing
that it's not saying is that sometimes
in order to get to your idea you need to
present some background material I like
to sort of lead them up to it
like so when I'm with Marco on my white
board in order to get Marco to the so
the point of which is able to
contemplate the full glory of my idea I
have to help them a little bit by giving
a sort of tutorial to you know in the
background that gets up to the point but
the goal there is I'm giving the
tutorial to Marco it's not to enumerate
all the related work now in giving the
tutorial of course you should mention
ins you know in site site all the people
whose work you are in effect describing
and again your forward references to
section eight work will be discussed in
more detail or compared but your goal is
the tutorial with side references to a
later book does that make sense and this
is flatly contradictory to at least some
common practice and even to some
explicit guidance from some of your
advisors and supervisors I suspect right
so you may have to fight on this one and
in the end you will have to do what your
advisor says but you can fight hard
right fight hard yeah Oh what is the
reason that this is common practice I
think there are I mean the reason is I
suppose just that it seems like good
scholarship doesn't it first you
describe neither the status quo and then
you describe you ain't comment on it
it's just and you are going to by the
time you finish the paper you are going
to have done that so this is purely a
presentational thing so I think the the
the fact that it's common practice
presentational e I don't think really
does have a good justification no in my
humble and entirely unbiased opinion
yeah yeah I think that's fine but the
purpose of background is not to
enumerate everything that's gone before
the purpose of background is to set the
Rideau up so that they can appreciate
your idea end of story that's the
purpose of background okay that's all
you've got to remember
because you're trying to lead them to
that point by the shortest possible path
somebody else
yeah disconnect between writing papers I
guess it's for people to read them in
writing papers that reviewers will like
because they could see what are the
reasons you personally first is no this
really is novel don't spend the rest of
the paper sort of thinking there's
nothing to it when tagging it to the end
of the people you just sort of a bitter
taste in your mouth
no I think you couldn't so I think you
can make claims to novelty right there
in the contributions right and in your
background section you can make claims
to you know here's you know hiss among
on solve problems so do you make those
claims with forward references again you
know so avoid distraction but make the
claim so I don't think you need to
amplify that claim to novelty too early
just make it yeah like you know but you
combine them into introductions oh I
would never put related work in the
introduction whoa so that would be kind
of like remember the introduction is my
precious single page I don't wanna use
my single page on this right it's it's
it's the good scholarship bit that isn't
key to understanding the idea that is
key to understanding how it fits in the
content the landscape of computer
science all right reasonable people can
differ about this but I feel it quite
strongly so I'll just presented to you
and you can make of it what you work and
I'm in this whole talk I am erring on
the side of being more opinionated to
then know you know just to make you more
fun but but this one I do actually
believe here is one other thing about
related work in a related work section
some people think that their goal is to
make other people's work look bad right
so they can make their work look good
right you know green and white did this
work it was completely useless right and
worse so much better were faster were
smaller better in every respect
there were idiots really
but the truth is that it's not only is
that not good scholarship but it's
almost certainly false right but also
it's like um it's like that the credit
is not it's not like money so so so uh
yeah right
so if I um if I have a hundred pounds
and they give you fifty pounds how much
do I have left
fifty right so so I'm poorer and Sarah
is richer but if I have some love and I
give you some love
do I have less love no infinitely
divisible resource in fact it grows the
more you give it away is now wonderful
how it's like what's not to like so
credit is like that too right so so
giving credit to other people just
diminish the credit that your paper will
get you'll be judged on your new
contributions saying nice things about
other people does not mean that your
contributions will be judged less good
but actually for to the country right so
don't be sick of antique you know don't
sort of but do do you know take a moment
to say not just antiseptic pros say you
know in Sarah's inspiring paper of you
know 2006 she says this and you know I
will let our work relates in in that way
and just by adding a couple of
adjectives for things that have
genuinely illuminated or inspired you
know given you insights you you make the
world a better place and you give other
people a signpost to say actually that
paper of service is really worth the
read right which also makes the world a
better place but then people Tino's like
recommending systems they tend to bubble
up the rankings so don't do not stint in
your plays about other people because
actually we do stand on the shoulders of
giants it's actually true the other
thing is computer science is it because
it has this multi-dimensional subject
it's very seldom you do a piece of work
that is better than the competition in
all dimensions you know you may be
faster and smaller but you're less
secure you know you're better on X &amp;amp; Y
and Zed but not on P and Q right if you
only mention X &amp;amp; Y and Zed and you
simply fail to mention P and Q what are
you inviting your readers to do your
reviewers to do you are inviting your
reviewers to say what
P and Q that White's work is actually
rather better in that sphere you know
for if the transactions are small you
know everything's going to go to Europe
you're fine for big transactions but
when you're lots and lots of small
read-only transactions your system is
going to be absolutely terrible right
now you don't mention that that's a very
bad thing to allow a reviewer to say if
you say it it's quite disarming to a
viewer they cannot complain that as a
criticism they may say overall the
contribution is not big enough what they
can't say is they didn't appear to be
aware of this problem right so
acknowledge your weaknesses and the
related work section is a good place to
do that
because it's part of saying actually you
know who 98 is really rather good in
this dimension you should go read it ok
but this is an easy lesson to deal with
because it's you know it's all it's all
joy right how we doing we have 10
minutes and 2 points oh yes so you want
to say something yes before you go on
yeah yeah there's some multi-dimensional
thing I found in a couple of the papers
I've read and written having a table
that has all of the related work and all
of the dimensions and how and and that
just puts in the beginning of the
related work section gives you this
really fast reference where you go oh
okay they're good on these dimensions
and not so good on these dimensions and
they are aware of all of the other
people and how they fit into that space
and it's really compact and reacting to
read people with sort of rows and
columns is very cool if you could if
your subject is well enough sliced and
diced to do that
it isn't always something to avoid
though is often we related work sections
it simply has one sentence for other
citations it just simply says you know
foo and white did X I mean you know
brown and green did Y anything oh so I
would know know is there's no evaluative
or value judgment stuff or comparison
stuff done at all that's a real shame so
simply listing related work is not very
cool but that's that's quite separate to
your point which is if you can do a
table that bullet yeah and sometimes
very powerful yes
which witnesses in your in your approach
and I felt from some senior researchers
that it actually can be the reason for
injection of your paper if you really
honestly honestly and acknowledge all ah
so so the question is if you acknowledge
the weaknesses might that lead to your
paper being rejected oh no so if it's
well reviewed then the reviewers should
spot those weaknesses and it's worse if
they identified them than if you do so
in your best case then you would have
poor reviewers who don't spot the
weaknesses in your paper would slide
into being published anyway and that may
be good for you personally but it's not
good for the field so I'm not conscious
of papers being rejected because they
acknowledge their weaknesses sometimes
it may be because having now having a
clear understanding of what the
contributions are and what they're not
you say the contributions that will go
into net contribution is not big enough
to justify publication in this journal
in this conference
that can happen undoubtedly so I think
that's life no go for you have to go for
a less glamorous venue yeah future works
yes yes like this so often with related
work we also say and here are some
things that I'm planning on doing sir so
we're actually not very good on small
transactions but we have six good ideas
for how to do it and we're working away
hard on it that's that's what er often a
good positive spin too busy it's
probably even true
an additional merit of papers okay yeah
and now also balancing with that
acknowledging your penises that's not a
paradox but I think you can be massively
enthusiastic about the thing that you
have spent your last you know six months
or maybe three years of your life
working on while being realistic about
the fact that it's not going to cure
world hunger you know I don't think
these are incompatible you can be
enthusiast about things that are not yet
perfect that's fine that that's called
being human
yeah yes a lot of scientific writing
stew you away from from writing just in
a descriptive way you know he gets this
and I've been inspired by so and so not
considered professional together and
makes you sort of look like you're
sucking up to someone you know saying
that you know I'm inspired oh you mean
they could be very wealthy reviewers or
you wouldn't know so so it indeed often
the assumption is that scientific
writing should be somehow very what's
the word passive and unemotional indeed
people often sometimes say you should
write in the passive voice an experiment
was performed rather than I performed
this experiment I always write in the
first person this experiment was
performed it just makes you want to lose
the will to live so but as far as this
this kind of stuff is I would err on the
side I mean obviously you don't just
want to suck up to people right but so
you'd have to say I did find it
inspiring it's true right if you're just
saying it to be nice to the review don't
do that right so just say it how it is
in your heart I think if it's if you're
speak with your own voice and you're
speaking the truth in love then you'll
get a long way so just realize it's all
you five minutes I know points to very
quickly fast forward right two more
points which are we will we will finish
by noon absolute
without without doubt nah no no we will
not no very bad practice as I'm about to
tell you in Thursday's talk proven
leaders first what does this mean so
here is what many people do when they
present them when they finally get to
the payload of their paper they start
with something like this you know that
they draw a deep breath and say consider
a bifurcated semi-lattice and such a
thing doesn't exist because what they've
done is they've done a lot of work that
worked through examples and so forth and
then they thought some general idea and
they present the general idea first this
is that right this feels like good
scholarship again but it's very poor
presentation right so you've got to just
remember that when you're talking about
your readers you want to convey the
intuition first when I was within marko
with my white board I did not write up
this right I said here's an example all
right I said and I I sort of tried to
convey to him the intuition so again the
initial stages of your paper should be
to convey the intuition leaving the
formality in the details and all the
Greek symbols for a little bit later in
the paper so I would always start with
examples and move on to generality and
almost never start with generality and
then illustrate with examples that's my
suggestion to you I mean yeah and here's
an example of me doing just that in a
paper that I wrote a little while ago so
this is part of the background section
I'm trying to set the scene this isn't
my idea yet I'm setting the scene but
I've set the scene by starting with an
example program right away the other
thing about putting your readers first
is that when you are writing a paper
that that's the result of quite a lot of
work you have been through many blind
alleys right so your temptation is to
carry your readers down the blind alleys
because they are drenched in your blood
right you spent hours down that blind
alley so you take your reader down and I
I've just done that very often but I
have read papers which I have struggled
through two pages of technical material
I'm a review of light so if you'll have
to read it and at the end of the two
pages the technical material I get to
the point which he says this turned out
to be not a good idea in the next
section we present a much better I think
you sort of tortured me for two pages
and now you tell me it was all for
nothing
you're wrong as an author is to point
out the HEPA to say there is a very big
painful place don't go there right and
leave me swiftly past the only exception
to this is when there is a place that is
so obvious about you in a maze and
you're leading the the reader through
the maze and there is a big door that
says exit right and you lead them
straight past I think right that's bad
for your Vitas too you have to say look
this door here marked exit is just does
it turns out not to work well so you may
have to make a brief digression but only
for things that are so obvious that
they'll be distracting if you don't
though it is very frustrating on your we
dissolve or always and follow them to
the to the end last thing in the last
120 seconds listen to your readers by
which I mean get people to read your
paper and get feedback from them so
particularly your friends writes your
friends they're like guinea pigs so what
you what's your name
like most so supposing most is a good
friend of mine then he's I'm going to
inoculate him with the drug that is my
paper and I'm gonna listen for what kind
of squeaking noises he makes and how
quickly he dies right but you have to
tell your friends what you're going to
do like you don't want if you left to
themselves they will tell you about
spelling mistakes and grammar this is
not what you want to know what you want
to know is I got lost on page three
right they will not tell you this unless
they are told very explicitly that's
what you want because they will get to
page through they will get lost their
thing I'm just too stupid you know Sam's
very clever fellow and most things so
you know this paper obviously wasn't for
me well done Simon great paper you know
you misspelt this thing on page two it's
very important to tell your friends what
you want to know is where you got lost
and then you then you I bought them you
like you most comes to my office or I go
to Moses office more likely and I said
where did you get lost on page three and
he says what got lost and then I say oh
but it's like this and then mo says ah
now I understand and then I just have to
remember what I said we put that in the
paper right so it's a feedback loop that
you must do repeatedly you can read this
slide about getting expert help but um
later if I just want to say one thing
about reading with
use so when you get reviews back for
your rejected paper you will think those
bastards they have no clue
those referees they have no idea about
this subject they're ignorant and and so
you'll you bleed right you should set
them aside a week later you come back
and you have to try to read the review
in such a way you want to say how could
I rephrase this paper so that not even
the stupidest reviewer could make that
mistake that's your goal is to be so
clear that even stupid people could not
make that mistake and the other half of
it is to remember that the reviewer has
done something really amazing right they
have given for you something that is not
like love a completely non-functional
commodity their own personal time they
have spent an hour that they will never
ever get back in your service don't
think that's quite amazing a stranger
who you may never meet or certainly you
know you may never know who they are
they have given you an hour that they
will never recover and they devoted it
purely to you don't think about that
when you read the review
think about it in that way and you know
if you ever meet a reviewer regardless
of what they said thank them if you do
get to meet them say you know how could
you know could you help me write this
better better you know you get the idea
you've got a it's really hard to do it's
very very hard to do because they really
have got the wrong end of the stick but
nevertheless you must do this it's the
key to getting constructive information
from your views and then we are seven
things that's all you got to do and then
you're back so the good news is that I
think if you do just these seven things
you'll make a marked improvement if your
paper that will you'll put it above the
herd rather than below the herd and
that's always good right because then
you get published as well but most of
these things are things that are good
for the world too but they communicate
more clearly and more accurately and
spread love so there you are
so will he assignment again on Thursday
afternoon when you talk about research
talks
there's probably time for a couple of
quick questions otherwise I'm sure there
the opportunity in the course of the
week to ask her Simon when he hopefully
attends some of our lunch sessions lunch
today okay any sort of quick questions
you wanna give in microphone yeah there
are some papers who have discussion
section
do you like discussion sections there's
not in section what's it discussing you
mean discussing related work or just
call it discussion and they they usually
say the weaknesses of their systems and
it's kind of discussion together session
might be sort of okay so now we've seen
the idea let's stand back a bit and see
compare with alternative approaches and
how it might fit into so it's a bit like
related work that's a bit more broadly
so that can be good right so because
that at that stage you're thinking well
okay so presented you one specific right
so now you've got a bit more
intellectual scaffolding but there are
many variations of this that we might
have chosen but didn't so often it fits
in with the related work section so yes
if it makes sense to do it yeah you know
if you'd like to read it if you a redo
of the paper then go for it yep yes
DeVos most-most yes right in the first
person you say aisle we I usually say we
and it's easy because I almost
invariably co-author papers even with a
single author paper I think we is a bit
less sort of drawing attention to myself
even though it's sort of techniques like
The Voice the Royal we the Queen does it
and single authored paper sometimes do
but also sometimes you mean what you
mean meet mean we meaning myself and you
the reader you know we are now going to
look at together you know we're standing
alongside the reader
that's a good thing to convey again yeah
knowing that it will be rejected just to
get reviews to improve it for tomorrow
should you have a submitted paper that
you know will be rejected just to get
reviews well I think so reviewing is an
expensive process like to which as I've
been referring reviewers are devoting
their you know most precious commodity
so I would be very cautious about
submitting papers that you know have
deficiencies that you could fix and want
to fix if you had a bit more time so I
think that's kind of gaming the system
I'd encourage you not to do that wait
until you've got a paper that you're
actually proud of it'll be perfect
you know because there's all you can
always make it better so it's a bit of a
continuum here but don't do something
that you know has major deficiencies
that's a bit naughty because you know
you're poor reviewers what do you want
them to do you're burning up their
cycles nobody will nobody will ever call
you on it but you shouldn't do it having
okay time to close the session I think
thank you so I'm gonna stick around for
lunch with you I belong here thank you
