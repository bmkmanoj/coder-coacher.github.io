researcher from Microsoft Research
Cambridge in the UK and today I'm going
to present to you digitize your world
it's a really cool technology that makes
connect cameras really come alive
allowing you to scan in freedom models
3d geometry of your entire room very
quickly in real time just using this
cheap Kinect camera and some clever
software so I'm going to jump straight
into a demo here we have a Kinect camera
and behind me we have the 3d model
that's generated as we're moving this
kinect camera within our space and
scanning in the 3d geometry so in front
of us we have a coffee table with
various objects on it and you can see
this high quality 3d model is being
generated in real-time and updated in
real-time so for example if I move up
close to the keys on the phone you can
actually start to see that detail on the
3d model behind us or if I actually move
the fruit bowl out of the scene you can
see it fade away and it's not just
afridi model of very you know of objects
within the within the space it's
actually a 3d model of the entire space
so if I actually pull back you can see
we're generating a 3d model of a large
area of the space so for example we're
actually capturing the keys on the
keyboard or the monitor another example
might be freely scanning a person so if
my colleague actually walks in we behind
us we can see a 3d model being generated
in real time of him and we can actually
see that we can capture details such as
smile or facial expressions right down
to the wrinkles on his shirt so we're
really excited about the possibilities
that this technology enables one might
be new types of gaming scenarios where
you can scan in physical objects and
have them within the digital game so
imagine being able to scan in a
skateboard and have that appear within
the game or even scan in your whole body
and have you as the Xbox avatar so this
is really about bringing the physical to
the digital
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
