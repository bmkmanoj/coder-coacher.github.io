plenary of the summit the first keynote
which is by Rika Marvel and recommand
were is going to talk to us about the
recent recent advances in information
technology so we had already an
introduction by Paola let me maybe just
redo it a little bit that put some
information now in English so Rico is
the batteries of distinguished engineer
and he's our chief scientist at
Microsoft Research based in Redmond and
he's currently leading a new team which
is developing technologies to help
people with disabilities Rico has been
with us for many many years I think
almost twenty years and and actually
he's been I think part of all pretty
much I think all of them of the Latin
America Summit so he's definitely a
friend of us comes to Latin American
summit he has also when he started
actually at Microsoft he was working on
signal processing and a lot of the
technologies and the research that he
has been leading with his team found her
way into products at Microsoft such as
Windows Xbox Office and more recently
some format has been working on which
are being used by Skype Netflix YouTube
Rico is also an AI Tripoli fellow
receiving many many awards and more and
more recently he has become the
technique called he received sorry the
technical achievement award for the I
Triple E signal processing Society so
with that please let's give a warm
welcome to Rico for the first plenary of
the Sabbath thank you
obrigado wrestling Thank You Evelyn in
tone the scope of assays massive
opposite ringless for hemella property
Brazil irrespective a similar origins so
I'm gonna go in English I think it's
easier for everybody if I do so so I'm
gonna talk to you a little bit about
advances in information technology but
of course this is gonna be a biased view
this is not a view from the whole world
of you from Microsoft Research so
naturally I will try to show you a few
things they're very much related to how
Microsoft Research is driving advances
in information technology all right so
we tend to say that it's kind of a
golden era for research I touched on
that briefly before because now we have
this whole capacity of cloud computing
together with devices that's why as
Paula said the the company has this moto
mobile-first cloud-first because both
matter and that's how we can build very
powerful things combining the computing
of the device you have with you with an
enormous computing that's behind the
cloud so you're not limited to the
capacity of the device in your hands
there's so much more you can do as long
as there is a big cloud to support that
and it's very important for the company
and for other companies as well to
invest in that cloud so Moore's Law is
kind of ending I mean there's some
argument about that but we're not gonna
have Moore's Law running four five six
ten more years because the cost of
producing chips will get unbearable at
some point when the cost of a factory
gets to fifteen or twenty billion
dollars then it's gonna be hard to build
such a factory so what we're doing now
is inventing new ways to create new
architectures that different
architectures for the computing chips so
even though the size of the number of
transistors on the chip it's not gonna
grow by Moore's law anymore
but we can still grow the number of
processors in a computing architecture
and get a lot of power all of that and
I'll talk a little more about that
computers that can see here understand
I like to highlight that because we
actually going through a big change and
many of you are living through this
change already your grandkids will talk
to you and say what did I have to learn
how to use a computer what what is that
I just talked to a computer right I just
asked the computer first stuff and the
computer does stuff for me right there's
no such a thing as learning how to use
the computer so that's the thing that
we're really wanna drive and artificial
intelligence machine learning natural
language processing those are the
technologies that are going to create
that shift the computer learns to
interact with us not the other way
around and then computer gets to be more
fun right like for example when you have
your little device tablet or phone that
tells you oh your next meeting is far
away from here and traffic is bad don't
you want to leave a little early so
anticipates your needs does things for
you and talks to you in your language
not you talking in the computer language
right so one model that I want to share
one specific thing about Microsoft
research is what we call the quadrant
model Microsoft Research has about a
little over a thousand people all over
the world in several laboratories as
Paula said we have even a team here and
I see members of our team the directors
here Louise Anand is here as well in
Brazil and we have all over the world
and we do lots of collaborations we do
research in many areas in we also manage
research in many different ways if you
ask me what's the right way to manage
research I'll say there is a bunch of
them there's no such a single model that
works for all kinds of projects in fact
there's a whole variety of them but we
use this model as to give you an idea
just to cluster all these models in what
we call the four quadrants based in two
dimensions one is whether your research
is open-ended or if it's focus on a
particular well-defined problem that's
the vertical axis and on the horizontal
whether you're trying to do something on
schedule oh I really want to finish this
within a year within two years or
it is unscheduled right so and then with
us we divide these squadrons has blue
sky disruptive mission focus and
evolutionary so let me look at the two
extremes just to explain to you
for example mission focus on the bottom
left basically says I have a specific
problem to solve and I really want to do
it fast so usually involves a good
combination of advanced research and
some engineering to try to make that
work
on the top right is that I don't know
when I'm gonna do this and I actually
don't know very much what am i doing so
it's very open very open-ended that's
what we call blue sky so a good research
organization should have some amount of
blue sky research even though it
shouldn't be all blue sky research it
should be just part of the portfolio and
if you ask me do we spend exactly 25% of
the time on each one of those quadrants
no it varies over time but we have a
fair amount significant amount of
projects in all these areas so just to
give you an idea a good way to drive a
collection of research projects which
can apply to a company can apply to an
institution that is trying to foster
research some kind of support
organization like cnpq here in brazil or
any many others try to drive a portfolio
like that because you never know where
the most benefit is gonna come from
right so just to give you some examples
of some blue sky research machine
learning algorithms in the past decade
or so the new concepts of deep neural
networks came up in the first driving
for the researchers not just at
Microsoft but the whole community in
those were like wow if we use these very
big neural networks we can make these
classifiers that can learn all kinds of
stuff why are we gonna do with all of
that I don't know but let's build them
anyways it turned out that they became
fundamental to do speech recognition at
the level we can do today including
enable things like speech translation
which I'm gonna talk about later for
example in the middle and I'm gonna talk
a little more about that project is what
if I can act
model pick a system that can see in 3d
your hands and then build a model as you
can see in green in the bottom there of
where your hand motions are are going
what you're doing with your hands and be
able to capture the fine movements of
your finger what can I do with that I'll
talk a little more about that and so
forth for example theoretical
developments in math computer science
are a few years ago we had a major
mathematical theorem having been proven
at Microsoft Research one of those
things that takes a hundred pages to do
so and you say wow what am I gonna do
with that I don't know but maybe at some
point it's still part of blue sky on
disruptive I don't need to tell you
about hololens you all heard about
hololens the core idea decided behind
hololens is if a computer wants to show
me something why do I have to look at a
display like that
why aren't displays all around me why
can't information be all around me and
related to the other things in the
physical world and that's what hololens
does I'm looking at a person oh that
person is Louise if I had forgotten his
name then hololens could tell me oh this
guy sitting over here that's Louise and
he actually reports to you so you better
know his name in and so forth but it is
disruptive for example the second one
artificial intelligence bringing you new
things not just the idea that I can
recognize that there is a person in a
picture but who's that person and in
that one in particular all dimensions of
emotions what are the emotion features
for example the system is telling that
in that particular picture the lady
seems to be somewhat happy somewhat
neutral that might be an OK description
of Monalisa right so the idea that you
get more semantic higher-level
information from the data you have at
hand so machine learning artificial
intelligence can bring you or can bring
these disruptions and enable you to do
things you couldn't do before
like in Skype we just shipped in
Portuguese a few months ago real-time
speech translation capabilities and
please stick around because we'll though
is will
present more about that and we'll have a
demo of the system in our demo session
tomorrow and the idea that you can
translate speech in real time can open
all kinds of new dimensions for example
we broke the barrier of distance with
Skype you can call people all over the
world for essentially nothing and now
we're gonna break the link we are
breaking the language barrier you you
want to talk to somebody in India you
may not or China you may not be able to
know to speak Chinese but through Skype
translator sure you can have a
conversation some mission-focused thing
which i like to say to mention that
because it touches on the what I
mentioned before Microsoft research
really trying to help the business as
well
for example databases making databases
faster run faster is an important thing
to the company we sell database products
and systems it's important for the
community databases are used for all
kinds of things if we can make them
faster that's a good thing and recently
we did a hackathon project that the
latest version of SQL Server supports
that we basically elapsed a lot of the
engine run in memory because now you can
easily have a computer that has a
terabyte of RAM for example then you can
run everything the query processing
everything in memory and some jobs can
run 50 times faster but it's more like
as I said mission focus I want to do it
fast and it's an incremental advance and
and that can apply to other things as
well
catapult is one that is really important
which is making the cloud more powerful
because as Paulo said is not just about
having the cloud but having an
intelligent cloud which can really do
good things but intelligence costs a lot
of processing so a lot of what we're
doing with machine learning has deep
neural networks which actually require a
fair a very large number of operations
to run even small things so unless I
build a very powerful cloud there's no
way I can we're going to build an
intelligent cloud and I'm not restricted
to just buying computers from whoever
sells computers I can make my own
computer I'm making this presentation
from a laptop that
produce design and produced by Microsoft
for an example but in the cloud if we're
buying if we're putting in the cloud
hundreds of thousands of computers and
in fact millions of computers in the
cloud I can actually design whatever
computer I want because I have economies
of scale to justify specialize so the
catapult project I'm gonna talk a little
bit more about it later actually uses
FPGA which is a different kind of
architecture to bring the computation
efficiency in terms of how much
electricity gets in and how much
computation you get out sometimes to a
factor of fifty or a hundred times
higher so that what enables you to
really do an intelligent call because
you have a very powerful cloud to begin
with in so forth for example some of
them are evolutionary I talked about
natural language processing I'll pick an
example here the example of the latest
version of office I just took a little
bit of a screen shot of the help window
that not many of you pay attention but
if you are powerful especially if you're
a powerful Microsoft Office user you may
not have noticed that but sometimes when
you have a sophisticated application
such as Microsoft Office or others and
you need to ask for help the help system
is a gigantic thing and you know when
you ask for help on anything you get all
these many links on things and you can
be lost in what we've done recently by
using natural language you just go there
and type what is that you want to do I
want to change all my section headers to
boldface
you literally say that in English in
human language and then office can come
to you change all the section headers
and say is that what you want you say
yes so you didn't have to go to a menu
drop-down select and and do all kinds of
things you're just expressed in inhuman
language why do you want it to do and
the computer is able to understand and
perform that for you
it sounds like a small thing but if
you're dealing with documents on a daily
basis a small improvement of every
document that you try think it's gonna
save you hours of work every week so it
does make a big difference right another
thing I want to highlight
I've used this light before in a
presentation I did in some poll last
year but I want to bring it again
exactly as it is because it has an
important message have any of you heard
of Connect hey okay you all have heard
of Connect many of your students you may
have played with the Connect SDK of
course you know what Connect is do you
know a little bit about the history of
Connect I'll tell you one bit about it
three years before he got launched
another Brazilian who's a technical
fellow at Microsoft Alex kipman came to
us and research Rico we want to do this
Connect thing because the game video
game controls are evolving and we need
to get an edge we need to push Xbox
ahead of everybody what if we didn't
have a controller what if we just do
gestures and voice and that's how you
control the game can you do that and
then I put together meeting with Alex
and researchers and they told me no see
okay
but Alex didn't want to hear no so he
kept pressing on us and then by the
third time we're like okay maybe we can
do it and then we realized wait a second
we actually can do it and that's what
the slide says we've been doing
microphone arrays for 15 years we've
been doing computer vision for so long
so that the idea that you can have a
device that can actually see in 3d and
differentiate the people in front of you
build skeleton models as we're showing
here of what the people are doing and
filter the voice in a way that even in
the middle of the game if you wanna stop
the game in an xbox and it's playing it
with Kinect how do you stop the game if
there is no button to press you just say
Xbox to stop right and it responds to
that and it stops the game because you
may want to do something else and pause
the game for example right but then you
need an array of microphones because you
need directional hearing because more
than one people may be speaking you want
to filter all the noise that the games
themselves are playing and all of that
stuff so the day we decided then with
that critical meeting with Alex and say
do you want to do this we realized that
we actually had the assets not only that
it took a lot of research to develop
that so a message for you
research is a long game and it does
matter and you can bring disruptions
such as connects by leveraging on a lot
of very high-level very sophisticated
research and computer vision signal
processing systems all kinds of things
that you need to put together to create
a device like that so sometimes what
appears to be more theoretical can be
more applied right so as I mentioned
before with this idea of on the blue sky
research the researchers developed this
system and we just published this a few
months ago where you can actually figure
out what you're doing with your hands a
sensor and the sensors actually connect
using connects we can actually model
what your hands are doing how do you
control a computer today you type in a
keyboard you touch on the screen you use
a mouse what if you could do gestures in
the air so let me show you an example of
the system we present a real-time system
for tracking the continuous articulated
motions of the users hand with only a
commodity depth camera our system can
reconstruct the complex articulated pose
at the hand whilst being robust to
tracking failure and supporting flexible
setups such as tracking at long
distances without over constraining the
user to close range forward-facing
scenarios our system offers new levels
of robustness and flexibility for
interactive applications so you see the
virtual hand is being controlled by your
hand here we show a wide range of poses
that our tracking algorithm can
reconstruct notice that our system can
deal with vast michelle's everything can
recover why do we do us without up there
and you can do this example whilst the
user is moving under the extended ranges
beyond existing hand tracking just stops
the video and for a sec right so here to
ask what can I do with this technology
the images on the bottom show you some
examples I can actually now think about
things and do gestures in the air to
control the things I'm thinking
well imagine a doctor who can now
operate all the instruments doesn't even
need to take his or her hands off the
glove the gloves off while with the
gloves I mean in the middle of a surgery
can control all the information
technology associated to that imagine
sign language translation if I can
detect your gestures I can probably do a
reasonably good job and you imagine are
we thinking about that yes of course
but further beyond that today do any of
you use touch on a surface of a device
to control that device yeah I'm kidding
of course all of you do that as soon as
touch was reliable enough you can't go
back you have to use touch and what I
predict to you here and it's risky to
make predictions but I'll make one is
that we're gonna do touch at a distance
and once it works we can ever go back
which means if a computer is farther
away and I cannot reach and touch it
doesn't matter the computer can see my
hand and I can control from a distance
once I can control from a distance I'm
not gonna go back it's gonna be a new
mode of controlling computers and
there's a lot of research and a lot of
research and computer vision machine
learning graphical models and other
metric modeling as well that goes into
building that technology but it enables
a new form of interaction so yet another
example of new kinds of interactions
with the computer so I'm going back to
now to the catapult project I mentioned
to you before because this is actually
super important to us as I said we have
today in being we are using those new
computers we basically pick up for those
of you who understand how data centers
are built you pick up these rack
computers you take up this blade just
this big board of many processors what
we did if we put a coprocessor in that
sometimes people do coprocessors with
GPUs for example GPUs you can have 700
cores a thousand cores and it can do a
lot of computation for you with the FPGA
is you can actually make the hardware
programmable you can have codes that
controls very small pieces of hardware
interconnected inside a chip which
allows you to
now have a hundred-thousand course
200000 course in one chip now you put
several of those chips in a blade you
have her several blades on a data center
now the economies of scale you get into
billions and trillions of processors
doing things for you
so being brings computation to a new
level sometimes 50 times faster so some
things that Bing has to do that take
days to run they will now take hours to
run some things in in in in your
practical life in your business life
that take a lot of time to run they will
run much faster the cognitive services
that I will mention later will run much
faster on an architecture like that
another example is security I I claim
that if anybody has a question about is
the cloud secure well the cloud is more
secure than trying to do computation in
the premises because at the economies of
scale I can have the data centers
replicated so a data center can catch on
fire and you don't lose a bit of data
because it's being replicated in other
ones physical access to that data center
is much more control than physical
access to your typical company so
nobody's going to go in and steal the
data from a hard disk and I we can have
actually stored the information in the
cloud totally encrypted in a way that
only the user holds the key so the user
has to give the key to the cloud for the
cloud to be able to use which means if
any other entity comes to the cloud
provider and says I want to have access
to the data of that user
it can't happen because the cloud
provider for example us for example
Microsoft cannot decode the data without
the key from the user we have to go to
that entity without naming who that
entity would be and say sorry I cannot
no matter what legal terms you may have
I cannot give you the data of that user
you have to talk to the user right and
in fact one thing we're doing recently
with the advances on cryptography
there's this thing called partial
morphic computing which allows you to do
some kinds of computation on data that
is encrypted so you can have for example
select fields on your database that you
want to process on I can do the
selection in the cloud on data that is
encrypted without having to decrypt
based on the rules you gave me during
the query about selecting that data I
don't have time to explain that here but
it actually works you can do some level
of computation on data that does not
need to be decrypted but of course you
can only see the result of that after
you decrypt but I can do things like
data selection and some other things in
the encrypted domain and again with that
I can build a cloud that is super
powerful much more secure than anything
else
and now intelligence because of what
we're gonna say later so when you have
things like Azure machine learning and
in pollination for example the program
is your for research where we bring this
capability to you this is just an
example of a diagram that shows that you
can build powerful applications you know
just just like as you do with Visual
Studio you can do things in a very easy
way the development the integrated
development environment is very easy to
use these things and now you can tap for
example you can make with a few lines of
codes you can call an API that will do
data classification for you that will
find new clusters of data for you if you
have your own machine learning algorithm
that you've spent years developing let's
say in the language R or Python you can
easily integrate those so that now you
can build an API that calls your
preferred algorithm not the ones you
have if you're not an expert and you
just want to use deep neural networks
fine just call our API is and you can
now apply the power of deep neural
networks to your applications right so
let me nation for example cognitive
services which is something that the
technology and research arm of Microsoft
is putting a lot of effort on which is
really a big step as Paula said of the
intelligent cloud and you can go to da
da da da Microsoft comm slash cognitive
we're now in beta testing a few things
and hopefully by the summer or I mean
I'm not in the product side
give you dates but very soon these
things are gonna be available as systems
you can integrate in your applications
but the idea is to be able to bring
different kinds of data like speech
natural language images and video and
the cloud can do intelligence analysis
on that as Paulo said the lab in Brazil
and I'll say a few more about that is
already doing something along those
lines by doing analytics on video you
can do things like for example send a
piece of text and ask the API to
transfer translate that to speech for
you you can send some text and ask the
API to tell you what's the emotional
content of that text for example imagine
that you build an app where in your app
your users go and write a bunch of
comments and suddenly you have this log
of all these comments that people type
it in by text you can use the emotion at
the eyes and go in and see are those
positive comments are people happy what
they're seeing are is there positive
comments about this topic but maybe
negative comments about that topic so
all that intelligence the cognitive
services can do for you
so you don't need to worry about writing
a bunch of codes to analyze the texts
that you're collecting in an application
for example so in the idea in the good
spirit of Microsoft is built a set of
API is a platform that allows you to tap
on all these capabilities and that what
it really means to build an intelligent
path that can bring you all of this for
you you can build small apps that are
incredibly powerful because they have
does intelligent cloud behind them right
for example caption bot is something
that we just launched recently still in
beta which goes beyond the idea of just
tallying something that is in an image
for example are there people in the
image is there a face in an image
probably even your phone or your camera
can do that right it can identify faces
can you say who's that person but can it
make a more meaningful description of
what's in an image so what caption bot
can do is for example you put that
picture like that and it will produce
the caption I think it's our heard
cattle standing on a field right so you
you can see there's now a different
level of semantics being done
there's more than one animal it's at
cattle so you say what kind of animal on
the field so it's not just a bunch of
green pixels it's of huge right so we
can bring that level of intelligence
another one you put the city of Seattle
I think it's a city with tall buildings
didn't catch Seattle June but it did
catch that it is a city with tall
buildings right another one there since
we're in Brazil we do love football here
I think it's a group of men playing a
game of football and they seem to be not
happy my that's not necessarily what he
wanted to learn about that picture but
it's a reasonable way to describe the
picture and you can imagine what you can
do with that both on the fun side of
life and also in the professional side
of life on the fun side do any of you
take pictures do any of you take
pictures of your phone with your phone
or camera do any of you take thousands
of pictures with your phones in your
cameras now the key question do any of
you really see all those pictures
afterwards after you posted on a social
network or sent them via email or some
text messaging interface do you actually
see them because it's hard to find them
usually you put in a folder by time or
by place or something is very hard now
you can imagine it for each picture I
can create a description like that I can
now index them for you and then later I
can build a very powerful retrieval
system based on all the semantic
metadata I had about the pictures so
imagine that now for an insurance
company for all other kinds of potential
applications where you have collections
of pictures and now the captioning can
help you index them at a much higher
level than you could do before and this
just started the system is very brittle
sometimes it produces a beautiful
description sometimes it misses it
because it's an evolving technology but
it's exciting to see where you can go
with this intelligence over images so
Paulo mention our lab
year in embryo the advanced technology
lab and in collaboration with the other
Microsoft research labs and in
particular with the cognitive services
team the lab here is doing some very
interesting things about analytics and
video what do you want to do in video
for example you want to identify people
who the person is if there is a person
in the picture what kinds of things the
person are wearing are they wearing a
head are they wearing a helmet I could
be like the policeman that looks at
video of motorcycles if you go by a
motorcycle and you're not wearing a
helmet as a UPS ticket for you you're
not wearing a helmet I'm kidding but you
know all kinds of applications like that
general behavior for example if I'm in
some kind of public area in somebody is
walking in a in a way that they seem to
be injured for example if they start
tumbling or walking like this can the
system recognize and raise a flag look
there seems to be a person in trouble in
your environment the same applied to
cars can identify the vehicle can
identify the plates plates is actually
very easy today commercial tall systems
are already do the talling just by
reading the you don't need any device in
your car anything it just reads the
plates of the car and then you get a
bill later but what kinds of cars and is
the traffic parlance reasonable for
example Rio and many other big cities
have a lot of traffic issues and you can
by doing video analytics identify
specific patterns or the tag the traffic
is bad but is normal bad or there's a
really bad traffic in here and there's
these kinds of things happening or some
robbery has happened in a bank and it
was a blue van where where's that blue
van going let's search for the blue then
all of those things you can do so the
lab in here for example pick this
technology implemented it in real time
so now the system actually can track
vehicles and detect events what kinds of
vehicles are going by are they stopped
in the middle of the road if a vehicle
stopped in the middle of the road and
they're not supposed to it's a good idea
to set up like that
oops something is happening
here and Louise was just telling me that
after about a year of work on this the
the precision of the events is very high
it's above 95% that you can get that the
flags raised by the system actually do
corresponds to notable events happening
in real life and they've also integrated
that on a on a bigger Paula mentioned
the detector system where we can
actually correlate the video events with
other kinds of events data that III may
know about specific events that are
happening or that I know there's going
to be a gathering of people at some
point and all of that can be put
together in a panel that allows for
example police departments like in a
state to sell off some power now the
system is running 24/7 generating events
it doesn't generate events all the time
but it's running all the time collecting
data all the time and at prescribed
intervals it will generate events and
now the police department can use that
for a much higher level of intelligence
of what's happening in the city right so
I want to close here by talking about an
area where we started to do more which
is an area that I'm particularly a
little more involved on which is
accessibility research the idea to use
technology to help people with
disabilities remember the mission of the
company as Paula said empowering every
person now let's highlight every spray
so if you have a disability having a
normal life can be a difficult thing
right and technology can help compensate
if you have a sense meter missing or a
capability missing maybe technology can
help you with that so I want to talk
briefly about three projects that are in
those it's not the only ones we have but
those are relatively recent projects in
this area one is guide dogs and you can
see an example here where the lady is
wearing a special kind of headphone
which call a bone conducting headphone
is not produced by Microsoft as a
partner of ours it does not block your
ear it does not block you from hearing
the environment but can add
to it but if your blinds the system now
can guide you to some points because we
can use the three-dimensional audio
technology that Ivana chef will be
describing to you in our demo session
please stop by there to actually play
sounds anywhere I want so instead of the
sounds being in your head the sounds
will be in the environment and the
system basically says follow the sound
you follow the sound because the
headphone also measures the position of
your head and by following the sound
instead of following a map which is
displayed which you can't see because
you're blind you can follow the sound so
we can guide you by sound and this
picture is taking in the train station
in reading a city near London in the UK
where we've instrumented the the train
station with additional Wi-Fi hotspots
because now the system can guide you
within a building so not only I can tell
you how to get to the train station
once you're there I can tell you how to
get to the precise gate where your
particular train is going right so now
you can't see but you still should be
wearing a cane and other things that
you've been used to but now I can give
you additional information right and
this is just an example in the in the
middle of us the city of reading a
person going around and we can also do
things like because we know what the
city are we know what the locations are
and we know where you are we can tell
you there's a coffee house to your right
and then you walk to the car and I can
ask you do you want me to guide you
there if you say yes I can I can guide
you to gets to the coffee house so it
brings a new level of Independence to
people another one is seeing a I imagine
I'm wearing glasses just like this one
and again a partner company makes those
glasses in the middle of the glass
there's a small camera so you put that
glass on imagine you're blind but now
the system can see what's in front of
you and can tell you things about what's
the world so and there's an app on the
phone so even though you can't see the
screen you can touch the screen and
muscle-memory is enough for you to know
if you're on the top of the screen or in
the bottom of the screen
so and by that you can do things like
for example suppose there's a big sign
in front of you the system can read the
sign for you so you know what's in that
sign so it gives a new level of comfort
you don't have to ask somebody what is
there's a sign in there what does the
sign say if there are people in front of
you and they are smiling the system can
actually tell these people are in front
of you and they're smiling and then you
can make a comment oh you seem to be
smiling what's the joke they gonna have
a kick out of that you see how do you
know smile I imagine that the the
bumping quality of life that we can
bring to people right another project
that John Campo will be talking more
about and will be in the demo session as
well is imagine people would have motor
neural diseases imagine you're in a
situation for example folks who suffer
from ALS and similar diseases where you
cannot move your muscles so your bounce
will chair you cannot move anything you
cannot move your vocal cords or your
vocal tract so you cannot speak your
brain works very well your muscles don't
so how do you communicate it turns out
that in most cases the muscles that
control the I don't get affected you can
still move your eyes and now by using
inexpensive sensors that can very
similar to how connect works by using
infrared they can actually measure where
your eyes are looking at and you we can
actually display and John will tell you
more about that in the demo session we
can display a screen and you can gaze at
the letters of the keyboard and you can
actually type that way you type with
your eyes and the keyboard at the top
right has a play button once you typed
what you want you press the play button
in a speech synthesizer just like the
ones we have in the cognitive services
will speak that sentence out and in fact
that makes a lie
that is a life-changing technology to a
person instead of being locked and not
being able to communicate now you can
communicate communicate with the system
and as John will tell you tomorrow you
can actually communicate at a
enough rates that you can maintain a
reasonably good conversation so for
these people with this kind of
deficiency the system like an eye gaze
keyboard really makes a big impact in
their lives okay with that I want to
close and I just want to reiterate to
you that it's really exciting to be
working in computer science and related
technologies see how information
technology is changing the world we're
living in
very much in many ways and changing the
lives of users for example so for all of
you in academia all of you have
interested in computer science keep
pushing because we're gonna do a lot
more in the world 1020 years from now
it's gonna be very different from what
it is today thank you for the
opportunity to talk to you
Thank You Rico thank you for this great
talk I think it really shows how
Industrial Research can help advance
science and also having real impact in
society so we have some microphones in
the room so if people want to ask
questions please yes
while the mic come so we have also
actually in the audience quite a few
students and I want to pick your brain
and just recommendations for the
students in the room on what they should
they become specialist or general ease
and when we look at the area in
particular which is the topic of the
summit a lot of there are examples like
the kinetic samples that you gave where
actually there are different experts in
different areas who work together to
make a scenario come to reality then you
gave on the other hand you gave examples
like the cognitive services where now if
I am let's say an expert in natural
language processing but not computer
vision actually I can still benefit from
some one of those services if I needed
to accomplish one of the scenarios I'm
working on so as a student in computer
science maybe other areas what what's
your recommendation based on your
experience but also where you see AI go
the way things accelerating research in
industry do you have recommendations for
our students here
yeah on your question about whether to
be a generalist or specialist I would
say very simple answer one word yes yes
basically of course if you really want
to have impact and many of you are
thinking about or going through
graduation a graduate program for
example to get your master's in a PhD it
is a good idea getting a PhD is a good
idea because you can actually get
specialized enough on a particular area
to really make a difference on that area
that's what I did that's many people
that you get your PhD and you know a lot
about something small but you really
know a lot so you can make that
something small
I'll change or be big but then don't get
to focus on that go deep be a specialist
on whatever takes you or wherever you
think you can make an impact but always
save some time in some of your brain to
think brother what if I could do other
things how could this be combined with
something else for example as you saw
that the caption bots the idea that I
produce a natural language description
of an image it's clear that I need to
have some combination of machine
learning computer vision and natural
language processing so I need top
experts with PhD level capability in all
of these areas but if you look at the
team working on those everybody actually
knows a little bit about the other topic
as well because otherwise you can't put
it together so in short I would say yeah
go deep into whatever takes you but
saving off of your brain to also look
into other things not randomly I would
say for example the way I approach in
many of my colleagues approaches think
about scenarios think about for example
how can I make a person who can't move
anything speak write think of a scenario
and think of the technologies they are
in there if the space in which you are a
specialist there's a space for that you
go there and you try to motivate other
people as John will tell you for example
the eye gaze project came out not
because me said we shall do I guess it's
because a bunch of engineers and
researchers saw that scenario they start
talking to each other and say look you
do this you do that you do this other
thing we can make this work
and it was actually a heck it was a
hackathon inside the company and that's
how now the project is more formal but
it started as a hack it started as a
bunch of people within the company
because actually but just to say a word
about Microsoft the company actually
motivates us to do such things so we
actually set a whole week during the
year where you're not supposed to do
your work you're supposed to hex so you
came up with you put those things
together and you were always going to
need to do impactful things more than
one specialty but then one person is
really hard for one person to be a
specialist and everything so go deep but
also look at other things so that you
know
how your thing can be combined with
others to achieve impact thank you right
we have a question thank you very much
Neil from Mexico thank you very much for
your thought things are very nice and
interesting vision and ICT talking about
a general question you show us different
models of research and from the point of
view of Microsoft my question concerns
the interaction between industry and
academia from your point of view in
which instance or timing it's a nice to
work together and in which others you
are going along for instance for poor
technique to connect the technology you
what's your point of view on that that's
a good question in the same way that I
very good actually the same way that I
talked about the managing research
there's different models interacting
with academia there's many different
models this is an event we are here we
put this event together we bring you to
talk to us it's an opportunity for you
to talk to each other talk to us and in
exchange our ideas for example you may
have an idea about something about a
project and suddenly you may find a
colleague even from another country
right not necessarily Mexico who has had
similar ideas and you can interact that
way
so there's many models there are models
where our researchers go to conference
and talk to you and talk to their
colleagues and that's how we get to
interact another models that through
those interactions we discover the
brilliant students that some of them are
here that we can go and hire as interns
not just us Microsoft but the whole
industry right there's an enormous
market for interns so I would recommend
anybody as a student if you find if you
have an opportunity to do an internship
you know in a company that invests in
advanced development and research do
that you're gonna learn a lot because
the real world is always a little bit
different to put it mildly from why do
you see in your courses so and you learn
a lot from that experience including
broadening your views a little beyond
while you're studying so the students
that get the internships can be also a
bridge to talk to the
also we have ever linens in our outreach
team in the outreach team has a whole
portfolio of initiatives and programs
including programs for example as Paula
mentioned where we team up with other
institutions such as fat ass and we
actually try to help foster including
putting our own money to help support
research in some particular areas so
there is many mechanisms and Microsoft
is actually very open to interacting
with you and discussing project
possibilities right hi thank you very
much for the inspiring presentation my
name is Francisco Cantu tecnológico de
Monterrey so this my question is also
about collaboration but this is with
academia rather that with respect to
industry and academia I would like to
refer to the AI communities the
logic-based community the connection is
based community discloses the needs and
the various AI communities around the
world so how is Microsoft dealing with
the different 8i communities in order to
advance this project that are changing
the world my standpoint and how are you
follow the strategies that you have to
help them work together if they are
working together and what would be the
strategies that you have in mind in
order to take advantage of the talent on
the various AI communities around the
world in order to to achieve this goal
that's a very good question in
particular because AI is such an
important and fast-growing area but I'm
gonna take that one and pass it to my
friend Emily
so actually I'm very glad that you asked
that question so we started indeed even
in the outreach program and working with
that or our researchers at looking
specifically in the context of AI what
can we do working with the research
communities we started some events of
course we go to some conferences the
existing one triple AI ishka nibs and
and again we're not again but of course
in when you talk about AI so broad area
and people as you mentioned are
different community sometimes in silos
so we are looking at all that and we
have also started some specific programs
which are just nascent and I think I
don't know if cafes in the room but some
just behind you and so we have an effort
that we will talk a bit more catcha will
present it I think Friday morning which
is one aspect of AI of course many
researchers here are working in the area
of AI so but there are specific programs
we are starting and would love to get
your input we are really here to have
also a conversation that's what is going
to make this event very rich and also
for people who are streaming this is a
talk which has been streamed if there
are some ideas please reach out to me I
think we can take a last question hello
hiko I think first pitch
I'm patrols from unicamp I work with the
laborat of about security and
cryptography and if you don't mind I'd
like to make my pet my question
birthdays it's okay oh that's funny
for me I ask you I prefer a Carioca
accent but always fine
what Sacramento so Bernie Ecclestone
cryptography Oh mark Python which one
more Africa adjusting but switched
traveler breeding special secure
Microsoft Research to maintain Mars
knows not M solutions are applicable
across boots geometry disease were
ginger and ass opinion found they were
year pursue and overland reduce receiver
well Marcus tonight Austria a browser as
a barrage a racemic inches a team okay
can I repeat your question in English
the way I understood your question is a
very good one because I mention on
partial homomorphic encryption and in
you're working in that area so I'm so
your question is about what more do we
need to do to embrace that kind of
technology in in the real world and you
probably know most likely better than I
that homomorphic encryption is
incredibly expensive computationally
right it takes a lot of computation to
do it in a very simple operation because
I'm trying to do that on encrypted beta
and there's a bunch of reasons for that
so there isn't that much that you can do
however in the same way that that you
can do on a normal computer but in the
same way that deep neural networks take
a lot of computation and we're building
them and we're using technologies such
as catapult to be able to do them in
practice the same thing applies to
partial homomorphic encryption because
of the power of the cloud I can actually
do some operations fast enough that
they're they're not gonna be a
bottleneck in your application you can
still build some kind of new database
access thing or something and it's
relying on partial homomorphic
encryption so I think there is back to
your question what is there to be done
there I think there is room on the
theoretical side of cryptography to do a
little more research on how can I evolve
it and find some reduced complexity
solutions the same thing happens with
deep narrow networks
it started as very generic and very
complex and now because we are restrict
in the form of the matrices that
connects the neurons from one layer to
the other we're now using constrained
shapes that reduce the number of active
nodes then the complexity is going down
so first you start with something
brilliant but it's too complicated to
compute and now you start reducing I
think there's a space to do that
in homomorphic encryption and also ways
to knowing that I have to do a lot of
computation can i implement them
efficiently on very parallel
architectures like tens of thousands of
parallel processors doing something can
I use that to accelerate BPHC right and
I think the answer is yet is yes but we
don't quite have all those answers yet
so it's very much an active research
area that we're going to thank tricot
very very much thanks folks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
