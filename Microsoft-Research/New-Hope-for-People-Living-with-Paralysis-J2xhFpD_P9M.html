this design of the platform allows you
to innovate quickly it allows you to
test out a design it tests out your
ideas very quickly in real environments
collect data and then say if your design
is working or not working which is a
very big motivation for innovation we
are developing a textile based
capacitive sensors that could be built
into clothing bed sheets pillow covers
and even wheelchair pads so the idea
here is to use these sensors as
proximity sensors to detect gestures for
people with paralysis so people with
paralysis can use these gestures for
controlling the environment whether it's
lights switches televisions making a 911
call or even making a North Scott lab of
things essentially provides the software
framework on top of which we have built
the data collection unit data processing
unit and gesture detection unit my hope
for this project is with this technology
to have folks to have injuries of
quadriplegics or other types of
impairments of there may be upper
extremities to be able to be more
independent to have a confidence that
they don't have to rely on someone all
the time this way they can live their
life as normal as possible and to be
able to just get out have fun and
enjoy life lab of things brings down the
barriers of doing research with
connected devices it brings down the
barriers by allowing people to deploy it
skill and deploying diverse geographies
and that is the power of the novelty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
