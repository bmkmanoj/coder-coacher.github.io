you
alright we are going to have a quick
presentation / d baby silly Aragon and
Michael Bernstein on the dystopian and
utopian views of crowdsourcing and then
we're going to have a few people from
the audience that we asked to come up
and kind of we're going to assign them
either at the stop inside or a utopian
side and kind of debate among them as
we're gonna start with Cecelia and then
Michael is gonna talk about all right
thanks Andres so when Andres and Michael
first approached me to be on the other
side of the debate I thought okay i
decided i was going to take this a
little bit literally and present a
dystopian view so i wrote a science
fiction story it takes me eight minutes
to read it so I'm going to read it out
loud with this old-fashioned technology
but before I start I wanted to just give
my background I mean so I actually
started out as a as a crowd worker I
became disabled some years ago and I
actually worked on Amazon Mechanical
Turk for a little bit found I couldn't
make enough money on that I mean I was
in a wheelchair and I was told I would
never walk again but I actually survived
by going to ebay and buying and selling
a particular type of doll so all right
so on with the story i was born in debt
well all children are nowadays in the 20
70s it costs money to install an oracle
rfid to install a Google I the surgery
is delicate on a newborn but it has to
be done how else would you survive
there's no way to connect to the net no
way to work no way to earn your living
no way to pay for food water air since
the taxation ban of 2041 signed into law
by the First World Bank president a
fundamental tenet of our Constitution
has been that no free citizen should be
required to pay for another's upkeep we
are all free to make our own future to
live without the owner's
burden of providing for someone else too
lazy to work so as kids we start getting
out of debt as soon as possible we're
lucky that with the passing of the
children's freedom act of 2049
co-sponsored by the oil senators we're
now legally allowed to work from birth I
was four when I worked my first hit my
parents were so proud of me they told me
my debt counter had gone down for the
first time in my life they pointed out
the blinking red numbers on my wrist but
I didn't really understand yet all I
knew is that I'd flicked my eye over the
dasher just like I've been practicing
and i typed in the blurry numbers i read
from the image captcha on my ice cream
60 seconds of work and it earned me my
first dollar my mom smiled for the first
time that week and took me into her warm
arms for a big hug and my dad tapped my
head with his knuckle saying this cocoa
tea works my debt counter which had
barely reached a mega counter by then
had taken its first downward step the
first of many I vowed when I was old
enough for kindergarten every day I
would skip down the hall from our cube
to the elementary school on corridor b6
scan my wrist RFID at the Big Blue Door
get it debited for my daily education
charge and join a hundred kids from our
neighborhood sitting at carols learning
to read I type do math and program
before ours or if we were lucky playing
on the shaggy orange rug in front of the
window just like all the other kids I
love pressing my nose up to the window
and looking out over the city as far as
the eye could see tall buildings spirit
up into the pale brown sky until their
edges were lost in the distance
shimmering in the heat the Sun glared
down like an old-time furnace and you
could feel it searing blaze even through
the thick filtered Plexiglas every now
and then an outside worker and all their
protective gear would come rattling down
but past the glass waving at the
children who cluster
around an excitement I'm going to work
outside when I'm grown bragged Willie a
tall boy whose debt counter was
amazingly below a mega dollar Kim
sniffed you'll never be able to afford
the year she scoffed nobody looked at
her everyone knew Kim had the highest
debt counter in the class how she would
dig herself out of that hole enough to
qualify for a loan on the hugely
expensive outside gear especially when
everyone knew she was behind on her hit
homework was pretty much impossible she
didn't work enough hits fast enough even
to pay for her own education much less
starts slowing her debt counters
ballooning growth but still we all had
big dreams don't all kindergarteners
have them I worked all my hit homework
and then some studiously avoiding the
game tab on my eye until I had surpassed
my goal for the day still my debt
counter crept slowly upward school food
oxygen all took their daily bites out of
those numbers on my wrist I just wasn't
good enough at six years old to work the
higher paying hits but I played the hit
lottery every day dreaming of working
that magical hit that would make me a
big winner play the Amazon lottery it
only takes one hit to win imagine your
debt counter and that of your entire
family being reset to zero you two could
join these lucky winners in the world of
green numbers the images of laughing
families proudly displaying their wrists
with those astonishing winking green of
the rich flashed across my eye and I
side and closed my eyes to work faster I
would be rich one day anyone could be
rich if they worked hard enough if they
earned a high enough rating to qualify
for the more lucrative hits of course
you had to be careful at six years old
Kim had already been blacklisted by many
of the major corporate
patience for doing poor quality work if
her rating kept getting lower she
wouldn't have a chance to ever get out
of debt and even worse she might be
crowd shunned blacklisted by other
workers who wouldn't want to work a team
hit with her once you were crowd shunned
that was it there was no chance of
turning the numbers around when she
turned 18 and couldn't stay with her
parents anymore she would be kicked out
of their cube and sent to one of the
lower floors where they couldn't afford
to pay for hallway air conditioning and
where the oxygen levels were low I'd
been there on field trips seeing the
people slumped in hot dim corners their
wrists blinking red with unimaginably
high numbers and returned with a
headache from lack of oxygen sweaty and
scared but I was going to be rich not
only would I be rich I would be an
employee one day actually drawing a
salary from JPMorgan or Comcast or
Microsoft my favorite net show was green
employees a sitcom about a group of
friends who worked in one of the domes
who play games on real grass swam in
pools and had private toilets who
actually drew a salary every week that
made their green numbers go up the main
character was a kid who had once been
just like us just like me he lay in his
slot at night with a panel closed and
worked hits until he fell asleep the
villain of that show was a terrorist who
had once been the friend of the main
character when they were kids but he had
tried to get the workers of the
neighborhood to organize to refuse to
work hits they said that he said paid
too little but that made the requesters
complain that if their labor costs went
up too high they would go out of
business and stop creating jobs they
started withholding hits to that
neighborhood so the other workers crowd
shunned the terrorists and he ran away
hiding somewhere in the city and trying
to sabotage net
access for his former classmate the main
character was always getting in trouble
because he had a soft spot for his
terrorist friend as I caught the latest
episode i grimaced that the antics of
the main character as i stood in line
for the toilet in the morning when I
grow up I'll never act like that after
all I'm from an upper middle-class
family and we have a responsibility to
those less fortunate so this is called
45 million 45 million human lives that's
what labor economist have estimated are
the stakes of what we're looking at and
what we're talking about here so i think
when we have thought largely about
crowdsourcing and crowd work we've
really framed it in this very micro
TASKE way even all the way up to some of
the more advanced platforms you we are
talking about on the order of like a few
days at most of what people are
contributing to its this micro tasking
movement it's relatively limited in its
framing and you know nowhere is I think
there's more visible than on platforms
like Amazon Mechanical Turk you know
it's been an incredible boon too many
requesters for data collection for
cleaning for research but it's also as I
think Lily irani has put it really well
hidden a lot of the workers and sides of
inside of a steadily humming computation
infrastructure right so there's this
infrastructure of people now not just
technology but when we are talking about
the future of crowd work I think this
view is actually much too narrow when I
when I look ahead what I see is a vision
for the future of work it's complex and
it's interdependent work it's people
coming together on demand at scale
elastically and to tackle complex
problems we've seen this achieve some
incredible things with peer production
with Wikipedia with open-source software
and I think what we want to think about
is where could this go if it went well
just to give a sense of that kind of
vision my group has been thinking about
things like take a napkin sketch of a
design pull together
a group of experts off of platforms such
as odesk or elsewhere computationally
gather them and guide their efforts and
pull together a working mock of your
design in about 24 hours computationally
all we've done is brought these people
together and coordinated their efforts
the 24 hours is just because we've been
able to pull them together in an
effective way or maybe we take a prompt
we bring together other workers
computational and we're able to pull
together in about now 48 hours an entire
animated video we can take multiple
groups of these of these participants
combine them with for example videos
education experts and excuse me and
software developers to create an entire
platform say if you wanted to build your
own MOOC competitor again in about a day
and all of these things are really
fascinating because at some level
they're being modulated by computation
they're growing the teams are growing
and shrinking on demand they're able to
be recombined like Lego blocks and we
can even pull together teams that have
never previously existed by looking at
little independent pieces of other teams
that we can we can wire together this is
work led by daniela ruah tell me with my
group here at Stanford and so this
future is technologically mediated I
think this this is why we can create and
fashion it we as technologists and
designers can rethink its core tenets
right the markets are no longer
somewhere else we in this room have the
ability to actually envision what that
future of work will look like and I
think if we do nothing if we do nothing
then that dystopian view that Cynthia
point pointed out will come true so I
think that we have not only the
opportunity but the responsibility as
designers and creators to think about
what a productive future would look like
Liz Gerber who's in the room and a few
others of us put it this way what might
you design if you knew that your own
child would grow up to be just to sit on
a panel like they like there was this
morning would you feel comfortable with
that right now and if not what do we
need to do between here and that time
period
to make it happen right we might think
about what what might we design is a
future of reputation right right now I
can say I went to Stanford or I work for
Google but when you're in a platform
like odesk that kind of thing simply
doesn't work so easily here are a couple
examples from odesk and nothing against
yiannis but I think we have a while to
go I see this as a huge opportunity
anytime anyone is advertising their
skills using all caps I start to get a
little worried but we can think what
should reputation look like in the
future what might education look like
right now people are thinking about just
tossing out video lectures online with
automated quizzes I've myself
participated in some of this work but
could we enable people to actually work
on real needs to support their learning
could there be work studies micro
internships things that allow people to
learn better or more effectively could
we create such a future collective
action my student Neela far who spoke
earlier is I think started to think
about this what happens when your entire
set of people who might join your Union
or your collective are turning over at
such a rate that they can never even
come together and make a collective
decision what might that future of
collective action look like when
mediated by the internet and what could
we design and again staring at llanes
who's a lot of investment in a platform
but I wonder could we collectively do
better could we create the next platform
one that gives voice to the workers and
help them overcome the years of social
science research that demonstrates the
kinds of struggles that we have and the
kinds of how poor our intuitions are at
thinking about how we organize people
and draw them together and get them and
help ourselves get things done so I
think when I view a potentially utopian
outcome for crowd work I'm thinking not
just about crowdsourcing I'm thinking
about work i'm looking i'm reading the
tea leaves and seeing that all work or a
lot of work might eventually be
digitally mediated so what happens when
it grows up from micro tasks to
something where where we are doing
creative analytical and engineering work
and many of us are doing it and it's
normal right could we make that
something that we are proud that we are
proud to say that we helped create
so now we have the sort of interesting
part of this we've tapped I think six
individuals if we've talked to you can
you come up here so while Cecilia and i
started this debate we're not going to
end it all right so I've got a coin
Thank You Nate so one two three if this
is heads you're going to be arguing a
utopian view if this is tails you're
going to be arguing a dystopian view and
the opposite over here well we don't
know yet heads so this side is arguing a
utopian view this this side is arguing a
dystopian view and we're basically just
here to help moderate you have a mic for
them I'll give you the Mike so we
encourage for this to be to be
interactive so we need to prod them with
questions sting testing one two three
can you hear me all right right here so
I will hand you the mic I could I can
give a statement okay so this is the
utopian view so I I'd like to address
this from the workers experience so um
you know there's been criticism that
people that work on sorry could you
speak up my my google ear is not
installed cuz I couldn't afford it so I
just sell out there there's been
criticism that that crowdsourcing
dehumanizes work people have workers
have a lack of identity um this is
really a positive thing because you know
it enables people to not tie their
identity to the workplace you can go out
you can have have a life you can have a
personal life without with a real
identity and there's also the the
criticism that crowdsourcing it d
contextualizes work so people you know
they're working in small tasks and they
don't have a
to the hole and they can't get
gratification and fulfillment that's
completely wrong because there's so much
research that shows that routine work is
very satisfying and by working on these
these small bits it removes the pressure
from people to have to worry about the
larger picture they just have to worry
on that that small task and think of all
the stress that this relieves well that
makes some sense except with the global
cast ranking that you start with and you
can't ever get away from it makes it
very difficult because the the tasks
that that I have to do being at the
untouchable owest of the untouchable
ranking that I was born into that and
there's no way of me ever getting out of
that so I won't ever be able to find any
any kind of micro test that's even
remotely fulfilling so uh you want to go
yeah okay oh is it and so in terms of
some of the things that you can develop
though I mean yeah like you start with
micro tasks but with so many different
tools out there to actually help you
maximize your performance over time in
terms of your micro tasks you can
actually create strategies and plans
that will enhance your performance and
hopefully get you to those more better
paying tasks I mean in the future it's
quite possible that all of us will have
achieved a level of data literacy
I'm required by status to be down here
I've also broken my back because I've
been my physical body is decayed because
I've been staring at the computer screen
for so long and I don't have any
insurance I'm also having I was arguing
a hard time comprehending what you were
saying because I I I haven't had a lot
of education so and I haven't been
deemed worthy of having that level of
education because my DNA 23andme told me
that I was only capable of so much so i
guess i don't i don't have anything to
say so if you if i might step back from
this kind of fictional context um like
access to labor is really important and
a lot of the dystopian stories are
actually experienced by people today
like this taupe dystopian story is
basically what would happen if middle
class people suddenly were faced with
the constraints that most of the people
in the world have um you know around
limits of education limits of resources
that like day jobbing problem like these
are all things that people right now
like are making life-and-death
differences for people like my dad grew
up in the western highlands of Guatemala
no electricity no running water like
these are things that matter to people
and like it's possible right that the
outcome of crowd labor and micro tasking
might be to kind of extend like
precarious labor more widely across the
economy but it's also possible that it
could also extend work opportunities to
vast numbers of people who haven't had
those opportunities and if you look at
organizations like samasource that
actually offer crowd work to people who
otherwise would have you know
difficulties having access to the
opportunities to learn how to use
computers
and use them gainfully like there's a
huge amount of work being done to
broaden like access to labor for people
who couldn't otherwise like actually
like like experience social mobility and
advance and the world and I think that
it's going to be important to work on
both sides of this to expand this access
as well as contend as we've seen
wonderfully with the like various
projects we've seen here with the
employers just like the labor movement
has over the years so I'm going to jump
into a particular part of this dystopian
future with crowdsource work and that's
what I kind of got at with my question
which is breaking it down into lots I
actually was a target of crowd-sourced
revenge a few years ago I wrote a story
that somebody didn't like and they took
my cell phone number and put it into a
Craigslist casual encounters ad along
with my facebook photo and so all these
people start calling me because they
thought I was like down to have sex in
downtown Manhattan and I couldn't use my
phone all day long because it was
apparently those ads really work I got a
lot of calls and a lot of text messages
and this is something that's been on
this idea of crowd-sourced revenge has
happened a lot on craigslist much worse
than in my in my experience of it but
like people saying putting up an ad for
somebody else to fulfill a rape fantasy
encounter so this is something that
we're already starting to see with
Mechanical Turk and freelancer another
crowdsource site where people use them
to to commit fraud so basically you have
people solve CAPTCHAs or send spam or
try to place malware and they don't know
what they're doing so on when you are
doing this discreet task and you don't
know the whole there are basically
nefarious or bad things that you might
be encouraged to do and you'll have no
idea
can i address Nathan's point which is I
appreciate your optimism however I just
walked here in this very wealthy city
and passed at least 30 homeless people
sleeping on cardboard boxes and I think
if we can't figure this if we can't
figure out systems here why in the like
why in the hell would we care about
figuring out what's happening to people
behind screens and these people are I
saw them I looked at their eyes so i I'm
I'm not optimistic about what we're
capable of actually doing so I actually
want to you know say thank you to Nathan
for saying that and I want to address
that specifically my partner is a cook
he works for eleven dollars an hour he
has no benefits he wouldn't be able to
afford to live on a day-to-day basis if
he didn't live with me and he would love
to have TaskRabbit in our town as a way
to be able to increase his income and he
would love to have more opportunities to
be able to say I have a range of skills
so that if this one isn't going to do it
maybe other ones can that's a real world
right now problem that's solvable if
these systems are more broadly available
and I you know I like some of what
Michael was saying about you know how
can we think about this yeah how can we
fix the system make it better rather
than saying it's just a bad thing I mean
we are also privileged sitting here
we're all saying well this crowd
sourcing thing is so different from this
really good thing that I have but there
are all these people sitting in the
middle they're not homeless but they're
they're absolutely in need of a better
system than what we have and they're not
all going to get tenured professorship
right they're not all going to have
full-time jobs with all of the benefits
so how do we make these systems better
to provide support for them rather than
dismissing them as dystopian dismissing
them as dehumanizing instead of
dismissing them how can we make them
better because I would like to be able
to say that if one of my kids did this
that
it wouldn't be a depressing thing for me
that that could be an enabling thing
that that could mean that they have
better choices so you know I it's easy
to dismiss it in a broad dystopian way
but I think they're they're bigger and
more important questions and ways for us
to think about making it better instead
of just saying it's bad let's like okay
let's let it pass around a little bit
society community you can hold I love
this conversation because i think it's
raising some of the really important
underlying issues and you know i also
agree that when viewed from an
individual perspective what Liz and
Nathan have said is absolutely true that
we have to recognize the potentially
expensive and empowering access that
these platforms are providing but I
think what I'd like to surface a little
bit more in the conversation is what I
think Michael was alluding to is the
responsibility of our organizations and
collectives because ultimately that's
where the rubber is going to hit the
road so is this new trend and crowd
source for giving license to our
organizations to create you know less
protections for workers to you know
really capitalize on the precariousness
of the work we're already seeing and i'm
sure people who are seeing it in
corporate i mean i don't know what's
happened to temp agencies for example
but you know in the Academy we've
already seen this progress towards the
destabilization the growing insecurity
of work with you with the advent of
things like MOOCs and all of these other
things the crowd sourcing of education
the lack of security for you know tenure
is probably going to be gone in the next
generation of academic labor and not
that we want to hold on to the old
modernist notions of Labor necessarily
but I think it's really incumbent on the
new platforms to really fulfill the role
that our historical organizations have
provided in giving you know some level
of responsibility to taking care of
certain aspects of work
one of the things that struck me in this
conversation is the i guess the
conflation of labor with like one cent
digital tasks and i think one of the
things that's really interesting is how
these platforms like my introduction to
Amazon Mechanical Turk was through Mary
Gray's work she's at Microsoft Research
and thinking about like the really low
paying like what she calls digital piece
work in that kind of grunt work but if
we think about the Steve who was in
front of us earlier I mean he's making
it like he makes more money than I do
for sure like fifty dollars and hours a
lot of money to be doing physical tasks
and I think you know one of the things
that Liz brought up is the the type of
work that is is compensated not just
behind screen so i think one of the
things that we need to think about in
the future is how is the nature of crowd
work and whether it's just behind
screens or if it's you know i hate to
talk about the online offline divide but
like how what would is crowd work
exactly and like how how are we crowding
and and how is that sourced and and all
of that yiannis well and then let's
sorry yes I wanted to also like as user
it's like a difference after which is
how in organizations and how
organizations like think about work in
general and whether this is going to be
the future of the future something else
so like one of the things what was
talked about is how we live in this
bubble and Silicon Valley companies they
compete for talent there they're willing
to pay amazing amounts of money and two
people just do so like come and move
here and work for them we're at the same
time that all these people out there
which are equally skilled i can select
work remotely so like I I i come from
grace I my best friend was getting made
over the Christmas I couldn't go there
there's no reason why I should have been
here and I wasn't able to like to work
from grace right so I think also
switching the Croatian you know how
organizational strategy tax structuring
work and there are there's like there's
the Silicon Valley the bear thing where
you have to move here and you have to
get these high salaries everybody has to
compete about it
but at the same time you can do it in a
different way and so some of the things
that we need to start thinking about is
how organizations or cells think about
work and there are some things where you
need people to be locally but there are
many other things where this is just
because of the culture there is no
actual requirement for it so I really
wanted to say thank you for bringing
this together and it seems that we have
a call to action here because there's a
different kind of piecemeal activity
that goes on which is the academic
piecemeal activity of small bits of work
that don't get threaded together and
specifically I think what you've got
here is a really nice action for
platforms where a lot of the CSC w KY
kind of work can come together with a
focus Mary's just presented some
beautiful work which was an intern
project but actually could be a much
bigger project around accessibility
through literacy as well which dan was
talking about yesterday like my dream
was to help down make that problem
better I think there's a lot of people
in our communities for whom the
application in a systematic way of the
small pieces of work could come together
in collaboration with platforms like
yours to really bring value another I
don't know if there's anyone here who's
working on reputation systems until
recently i was at ebay and working with
a lot of economists and computer
scientists to think about what is the
right model for reputation between
sellers and buyers I myself did a lot of
fieldwork in the summer with interns on
how do our sellers actually reach our
buyers and how do they represent
themselves and what happens when
algorithms prefer big box retailers and
push your search results down what
happens when that happens right and a
lot of these little pieces of work could
come together very nicely in this
particular agenda if we can be
systematic about pulling them together
rather than doing them individually and
publishing them as separate Kai papers
and cscw papers and whatever and if we
can partner with platforms like yours to
really say what are the consequences of
these abstract research activities in
the hole if we are more programmatic
about it and so Michael
thank you Irish thank you because I
think what we have here is a potential
really kind of systematic agenda that we
can use Liz's methodology to sit around
in a circle and say what are you going
to bring to this as a bigger systemic
agenda that we can actually start
talking to each other about bigger
consequences of our work than a chi cscw
paper or a blog post end of rent so I
was going to say that to respond to um
not sure but we respond to Liz's quip
about seeing homeless people on the
streets and all these different societal
problems the thing is that is not an
either-or situation it's not like we can
trade in 11 work world for another work
world in my mind at least this is going
to happen and so the question is whether
you step in whether you have
interventions we keep talking about
independent contracting as the status
it's things like well if the employee
paradigm is shifting a lot into this
independent contractor paradigm then
what sort of protections need to be
there for independent contractors if
we're talking about dynamic workforces
where you can pull together a team to
build a product in a day how do you make
sure that that team continues to accrue
wealth rather than the original person
being the only one to accrue wealth
right like if you're only selling your
labor you're never going to get ahead so
those are some of the things to consider
also another thing is like what the
women who used to work at ebay was
saying um with Elizabeth um is that
there are actually a lot of people who
are interested in this area not just
academics and you have to kind of
consider who are the various
stakeholders in this area I work for
city government and I think one of the
things that people often forget or
otherwise often overemphasize are people
who are low-income in disadvantaged
situations and there's such a myopic
view of like how do we help these people
which on a certain level is kind of
paternalistic but on another level is
like this is actually a result of income
inequality rather than being a low
income issue and to address these sort
of inequalities you don't just start
from the bottom up like as in bottom up
being like the lowest classes up you
actually have to address the whole
system so yeah it's just it's basically
that even if it's something that we
don't want to come like it's going to
happen in the question is whether we're
going to go out there and create some
interventions yeah so I just want to
come in on a couple of things here and
everyone appears to be cool is so I'm
sorry if I get the wrong Liz but I think
what I want to talk about a bit is sort
of visible versus invisible dystopias a
little bit like you know like many
people here I've had a fairly privileged
background you know I've had parents
with some money and a decent education
despite that you know at various times
when I abandoned my PhD and ran off to
try and join the web circus you know I
had to get some badly paid jobs like you
do when you run out of money so I've
worked in in supermarkets you know I've
pushed trolleys around I've worked in
warehouses in supermarkets I've worked
in temp agencies two years in temp
agencies till I was trying to find this
kind of stuff and I just like to say
these jobs are incredibly degrading and
they were already here you know that
these people treat you your employer's
treat you as if you are essentially
nothing you know you're you're you're
just you are labor you know the amount
of times I had someone in some realty
office say to me like is this really all
you want to do with the rest of your
life like write letters and print them
out five times a different color bits of
paper it's like well kind of patently
know that's an obviously stupid thing to
say but i think that the interesting
thing about this is that we we don't we
don't notice that as much as we notice
this new technology that comes along
with the new pants so you know we don't
notice on a daily basis that pretty much
everything we live and where and use is
made by incredibly badly paid labor
overseas we don't we don't somehow
notice that you know the people who
surround us who do these jobs around us
in supermarkets in fast food joints
everything are incredibly badly paid and
have very few opportunities so I find it
kind of kind of bizarre that we would
look at this kind of new emerging
scenario and go this is somehow to humor
amazing this is somehow worse in a way
than no job or these terrible jobs that
already exist the the factors that come
in the important things are the
individual companies are they treating
people decently and the canned the state
what we approve of as a country or as a
culture and what we put into law to
protect people these are the things that
actually matter the the specific
mechanism of the work I don't see
anything anymore dehumanizing about
TaskRabbit or any of these things than I
do about working stacking shelves in a
supermarket every day without choice
with that opportunity without
flexibility is this on yeah I don't know
that I particularly need to contribute
anything else but I'm sort of a bit
fired up so I want to it and I think
there are sort of two Silicon Valley
hacks one is to talk about the
inevitability of stuff and everyone's
doing all this is gonna happen you know
no not everything is inevitable and then
the second one is to talk about
everything is completely new and I think
some of this is what tom was touching on
but this is a new way of work actually
it's not when I look at what's presented
they're just temp agencies and temp
agencies have been around for a very
long time the difference is they're
subject to labor laws and they don't try
to resist that anymore and so that means
that they are responsible for paid leave
for people who are doing temp work for
them so it's not the companies that are
getting temps that have to pay for the
leave it's the temp agency looks at the
work that's done and sort of does that
has a responsibility for health care and
other contributions and so these two
great hacks to say it's inevitable so we
don't need to question the premise of it
and then it's new so all of these
existing labor laws and sort of models
don't apply is absolutely genius and it
works all the time but it's really
irritating and I just think a group like
this that is so much more critical
should try not to fall into those two
kind of rhetorics all right I am on um I
just want to say my small intervention
for most of us in this room we live in
countries where good jobs are the
exception right so the jobs that
have are the exception not the rule and
so that seems to be in some ways missing
from this conversation where we're
talking about a set of jobs that are on
a spectrum of collapsing middle-class
wages right so fifty forty percent of us
adults say they cannot get two thousand
dollars for an emergency forty percent
cannot get just two thousand dollars if
they have a car accident health
insurance problem a medical emergency
what are the ways that we're thinking
not about smaller platforms and
technological systems but sets of
arrangements that allow us to reconsider
canned how we do it the idea of thinking
about taskrabbit outside of a larger
historical trajectory of what's been
going on in nineteenth and twentieth
century Western labor markets to me
seems absurd because some things are new
the technology the structures behind the
ways people are getting paid are very
old and they're very problematic and
have been for years
hello oh it's it's extremely directional
turns out starting to gather a few of
the recent comments just thinking out
loud one thing that might be
particularly fueling both the fire and
the worry here is that I feel this is
intervention that has already happened
in many many domains and in a sense
what's happening is that it's now
occurring to information work which is
us in many ways and I wonder if that's
what's firing a lot of both the sort of
enthusiasm and the worry and maybe if we
can identify with the rest of our own
humanity around what's working well and
doesn't work well and what we need to do
it will help us ease this transition if
it occurs or if not more more readily um
so it this kind of more of a question
than a comment along the line same lines
of talking about labor and I was just
wondering if this is going to kind of
change what is more valuable as labor
and what is not like is are we going to
at some point think that okay this kinds
of jobs are going to now start becoming
less valuable and you get paid for it
less and less and for other kinds of
jobs more and more I guess the first
thing just echo is what Tom and Fiona
said witches on some levels you know we
should probably all go back and read of
mice and men and just think about it as
imagine that but like at a distance the
other one is that civil society civil
society in the service of a polity by
definition has to operate in the
abstract like we're trying to organize a
heterogeneous body of people in a
general direction which is loosely
labeled opportunity which you know means
different things to different people you
know we could have public sector
organizations that get in your junk and
be like well you need to do this to me
but you know I mean on some levels
that's the sort of dystopian work model
I think government says two plus two
equals five all the
time in the service of a public good
there is nothing you know if we just
fall prey to the inevitability of our
own worst instincts I mean what pretty
much everyone in this room is I I
one for now from the dystopian from
either side but but it seems to me that
this is a great group to think about the
role of culture in all of this and that
with if we had a culture of pro-worker
of if we had a culture of health if we
had a culture of what was possible if we
looked at the the things that we know
that make that make work meaningful and
if those can be baked into these
platforms so that you felt like rather
than doing a single disaggregated tiny
piece that you knew that it was part of
something bigger that you in some way
could could be a part of that you feel
like you've got some meaning so a
culture of meaning but thing but the
role of culture in this all of this
conversation think is really important
um I wanted to add something super
practical which is I met this sabbatical
center this year and there's actually a
funded research project going on about
the future of work and workers in which
they're bringing together a lot of
social scientists and policymakers and
they're doing a massive survey that's
been funded of what these kinds of
people who do have the kind of data
about the system our thinking is going
on including these trends so so if
anybody really you know wants to follow
up and thinking Michael you probably
ready know about that initiative i hope
it's margaret levy doing it but if not i
mean let me know because they're there
literally is a distributed survey going
on right now to try to ask some of these
questions towards envisioning future
practice i just want to say really
quickly back to the utopian view I mean
there there are real world examples of
how crowdsourcing has solved problems
for example I reCAPTCHA has helped
google books with the optical character
recognition innocentive has helped
companies solve real world problems and
I feel that we haven't really got
reached the potential of what we can
with crowdsourcing and says
for example you know why rely on
diplomats to do peace negotiations why
don't we do crowdsourcing to solve world
peace I just want to make a quick
comment about what people get paid for
the same labor essentially I was going
to say there are technology platforms of
transparency out there like glass door I
nearly said glass ceiling and that
brought me to the second thing which is
that we know that jobs very frequently
are very gendered and so when women come
into the workforce and get paid they
often get paid less typically for the
same labor I loved your example about
you know I put up 15 and 500 an hour and
then I saw what happened I think again
back to the excitement I have for us
working on some of these technologies
the technologies of transparency are
often around what can I ask for this
work well when I'm talking to my
girlfriend's about jobs we've started
sharing what we get paid because we know
that there is not parity gender parity
that kind of transparency i think is
really really important so thank you for
bringing that one up so I just want i
want to make a couple quick points I
mean first of all one of my colleagues
Daniela rosner has written a really nice
piece on crowdsourcing design and what
can happen there there's a they're not
everything I mean there's a whole
different set of things some things can
be crowdsource better than others
crowdsourcing design tends to result in
mediocrity and the other point I want to
make is that companies now are going to
have to start there have been lawsuits
right who have people here heard about
the lawsuit against crowd flower which
was successful right Michael knows about
this yeah I mean so workers sued crowd
flower for not paying minimum wage and 0
and 1 a settlement for it and so it it
this is happening but again I think I
think the answers that people have
brought up you know we need to think of
policy culture you know we we need their
their need you know we need to legislate
it I mean this is a system will not grow
naturally as you know it needs to be
guided right by hopefully wisdom so I
hope that yeah that we can all be part
of that discussion I mean this is not my
research area but I'm just interested in
it
yeah so I wanted to pick up on this
theme percolating about you know the
fact that work and labor is not
reducible to work that's monetized so I
think that's also very important to keep
the overall spectrum of if you consider
work and labor to be contributions to
society whether they're monetized or not
the crowdfunding platform crowdsource
work platforms are interesting because
they're kind of dealing with the
monetization in a new way but this is
also happening in parallel with
platforms that allow for contributions
to collective value which are not
monetized which of course have been
talked about a lot but need to be looked
at in parallel so when I do research
with young people who are systematically
excluded from the monetized labor market
there are actually extremely
enthusiastic contributors to non
monetize forms of labor which actually
are very interesting places for the kind
of collective action and education and
things that Michael is advocating that
the monetized platforms also address but
I think those things need to be looked
at in parallel and I've been doing a set
of interviews with young people who have
recently graduated from college and are
confronting a really shitty labor market
and often they're highly educated
creative class kind of kids and they're
uber drivers they're doing TaskRabbit
and so on so that they can continue to
be artists and do non monetize forms of
work so there are ways in which you know
the dehumanizing aspects of certain
forms of work you know pragmatically are
being balanced by the fact that okay
what you do for money may be different
from what you do for love and we may be
encountering a different landscape for
how people navigate that opportunity
thank you and so it's five past noon and
so lunch is here but at first I want to
thank Cecilia all of you for being here
and especially Michael Bernstein will
help this thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
