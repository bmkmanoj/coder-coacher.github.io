to our field correspondent Josephine
Chang I've named her the senior hallway
bureau chief Josephine a great spot to
reel in some researchers right right
there and always liked that promotion
gonna get raised to thank you it is
after lunch so people are feeling really
rejuvenated and I managed to snag in the
hallway here jack sank of it from the
University of Virginia welcome thank you
I know your specialty is in sort of the
network of wireless sensors that are
everywhere I mean there are mechanical
things like cars and airplanes that are
in health care systems in the hospitals
and they're starting to be in the home
yes so I give a talk called Smart Homes
smartphones and beyond and so in that
work we're trying to establish the
collection of physiological and
behavioral information for elderly and
that we can use this to look detect
anomalies and detect say medical
problems early and this is really the
future I think and the smartphone is
also wellness and we've developed
techniques for example to control heart
rate with music and so you can really
try to improve people's lives in this
way and you were saying that with their
phone you could even target to within
ten percent of like if you want aim for
a specific heart rate to what's healthy
of course right so the idea is that if
you're wandering around and your heart
rate is too high and you're not doing
anything and it shouldn't be high then
we would recommend music to lower it and
if you're doing cardiovascular exercises
then you have specific target heart
rates you want to achieve and we would
also be able to achieve those heart
rates for them and then as far as the
home I mean our homes are getting
starter all the time with the smart
appliances and so forth but you're also
talking about sort of tracking or
monitoring people's behaviors and
emotional states yes and well by taking
different kinds of parameters about
persons say voice their their skin
conductance and many other factors you
can detect what behaviors they're doing
and how they feel about it
from voice you can get mood and stress
so you can take all of these factors
into account and getting a big picture
of a human being and we found that it
takes even for elderly who are not that
active saying that we end up with say 10
to 35 models that describe a person's
behaviors and emotional states and that
way you can tell when something is
different when something's off that's
right and the real trick though is to
avoid too many false alarms so any
system if you deploy it and it requires
lots of folsom or results in lots of
false alarms then nobody's going to use
the system right so crying wolf too many
times that's right yeah so we have a
very sophisticated semantic anomaly
detection scheme that will determine
when a false alarm is really a false
alarm and it includes semantic rules and
it's probably I think the most
sophisticated system available
interesting well you know Harry Shum was
talking about how we all have so many
devices now like up to 27 devices per
person so how do you avoid like one set
of sensors telling you one thing and
another set of sensors tell me something
else right so that so our vision is that
a home would be a sensing an actuation
infrastructure would be a utility like
electricity or water and then people
will build applications and run those
applications on the system now what we
thought about is you can think of this
as the right app doesn't know what the
left app is doing yeah and so what we
doing is identifying how apps interfere
with each other automatically and try to
detect and resolve inconsistencies so
you wouldn't have one appt opening the
window like to say to improve the air
quality in the house for medical purpose
and another app closing it for energy
and the windows going up and down up and
down so our schemes help detect those
conflicts and resolve those conflicts
and they will happen more and more often
as Warner apps or put into homes I can
see how this is great for people who
want to age in their home you know
that's a real trend these days people do
not want to go to nursing homes they
want to stay in their homes
and having a smart home can really
enable people to do that that's
absolutely true and I think this is the
first case where technology can actually
lower medical costs yes almost all other
medical devices increased costs they may
improve your health but they increase
costs and here I think there's a chance
of reducing costs so not only staying in
your home is more amenable to people but
it's going to be a lot less expensive
than putting them in nursing homes or
assisted living even right and also
sometimes that detecting problems early
you can treat it earlier yes absolutely
and you know you want to inform the
system's into a wellness version so that
people are healthier longer and if
problems are happening then the system
needs to be adaptable today and people's
medical conditions change so you can't
build a system that simply looks for
depression for example because later
they may have Parkinson's disease and so
you need to be able to have a system
evolves from as a person's medical
condition gets better or worse that
sounds fantastic how far down the road
we'll be looking when are we going to
see these things smart homes that some
of them are there now but they are
somewhat limited in the sense what I
call that they don't address real isms
very well and what I mean by that is
take an acoustic sensor that's listening
for voice to detect mood well we have
very strong signal processing algorithms
that can do that in quiet environments
but you put it in a home and you have a
bus driving by of the TV on so then the
signal processing algorithms tend to
fall apart unless you have good filters
and and other techniques to handle real
isms so we have to deal with that maybe
in a few years huh some levels you can
start to see results even today and
there are thousands of homes now with
smart sensing for elderly but again
they're they're somewhat limited in
detecting Falls or you know some simpler
technique simpler problems important
work though thank you so much Jack I
appreciate you talking with us
this all right we are also trying to say
more researchers as they come by here
Manuel come over here hi this is manuel
for many gildo from madrid spain wow
thank you very much you know redmond
washington you know i'm i know that you
work with em dia software institute
which is also does joint research with
microsoft tell us about him day what
does it do we are a research center in
Madrid which we concentrate on building
the tools and that the techniques on the
science the technology that essentially
the real tools to help programmers build
applications that we can trust
applications that we do have preserve or
our privacy that we can that don't break
on us that don't you know end up gigot
of the wrong data etc so how do do that
in an efficient way in a cost-effective
way so you build the tools for software
engineers software developers and
programmers to be able to do their work
how about your research in particular
what do you focus on that that's correct
well we work in the Microsoft in their
research center there is research is a
very exciting development that is very
recent as far as our own research we
work on energy analysis energy
consumption analysis we working a lot of
topics on programming languages and so
on but energy is probably the most
exciting thing we're doing like what
what what is the energy consumption
analysis really energy comes energy is a
big concern is you know if you think it
from large computing centers to small
devices you're worried about how much
it's costing to consume too much energy
how much your heating the environment or
you're running out of battery on your
wearable devices it's a very big deal an
exciting thing is that the you know that
the savings that you can do in energy
consumption come a lot from the software
I mean a lot of Graeme done by the fire
but I can also be done on the software
side so that's that's what we work on
this is joint work with pedro lopez
there in madrid and with xmas and I'm
and also Risto and what we do is we have
models of how much energy individual
instructions need and then we integrate
that over the whole program and get
functions that tell you how much the
program consumes and that allows you to
do things like half specifications of
how much energy discuss to consume and
verify them or find energy buds so this
program is has a bug because it's using
too much energy or how can i optimize
this program so that in my timing
constraints I only use the minimum
amount of memory and that might require
lowering the voltage or going slower etc
etc so if we target programmers tools to
be able to do this in a very simple way
just pushing a button the same way we
check types nowadays for something
that's good i wish there was these
institutes for all kinds of professions
but you know programmers their work is a
little bit changing because the amount
of data that's you know out there and
and the amount of computers they have to
program for does that change you know
the the work that they do and how they
do their work oh these tools are are
absolutely a game-changing i think
because it you know the there's been a
tremendous advance in the quality or the
complexity of the properties that we can
that we can check the programming
language have also evolved a lot
obviously but these two this
environments and the analysis and
verification tools that we are starting
now to build and to attempt to progress
they really have changed like I said the
game in the sense that programmers now
are much more confidence come much
faster find bugs they can also and were
much closer to the elusive goal of
having oral software being certified
this is a this is one of the main
focuses of this joint research centers
that we cover with Microsoft where we do
things like the verification we do
cryptography we do privacy analysis we
do memory models concurrency and web
security malware detection sensor other
things aimed at making building the
confidence of the user in the in the
software so do you like coming to the
faculty summit because it lets you have
access and you mean you could hear from
so many of the people who are working on
you know who are going to be using your
products oh yeah yeah there's a lot of
interesting people here very this this
this is really a very good selection of
top people in in computer science in
nineteen general and it's a great
opportunity to work with people at
Microsoft and outside Microsoft to start
collaboration to continue previous
collaboration so yeah it's exciting to
be here do you get new ideas when you're
you know among among intellectual peers
like this oh yeah that's where we come
to these conferences on target yeah
definitely definitely yeah every time
you know we come to a conference like
this you know we start you know around
the table we catch some ideas and papers
ideas for other types come out all the
time that's great well I hope you enjoy
the rest of the faculty summit so
pleasure talking with you man well thank
you very much for cooking this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
