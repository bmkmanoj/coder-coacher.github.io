with opus connecting parents and
children with the power of story so hi
everybody we are kind of Carnegie Mellon
University School of Design and my name
is Dixon and these are my teammates
Sarah and Ji Young we were thinking we
might start with a little bit of
audience participation so with a show of
hands how many people out here are
parents all right so how many of you
have asked your children the question
how was your day and gotten back some
sort of answer that sounded like okay
all right keep your hands up so for
everybody that's left how many of you
are guilty of giving your parents this
answer okay so this is the problem we're
trying to solve that may be rich
conversation doesn't arise from
questions like how was your day they
come about when parents have a bit more
information to ask a more specific
question about a child's experience so
we were thinking how can we deliver this
deliver this information to parents and
this is how we're going to do it this is
opus and it's a augmented reality
magnifying glass and an e-paper a bounty
paper storybook and what it can do is it
can take the experiences the child has
during the day and kind of slip them
into story time later at night and this
is how we arrived at our at our final
solution it's we started out with
interviews both individual and group and
then we went on to do some generative
workshops and then the insights from
these we generated almost a hundred
concepts and then with our users we
narrowed them down to just a few to
prototype and then we came back to our
users again for validation and
throughout this entire process we came
up with I think are three key insights
so insight number one is the existence
of our problem that how is your day
doesn't actually generate a rich
conversation and if there's only some
way we could give parents a bit more
information so they could ask something
specific about their child's experience
inside number two is that maybe
storytimes actually a great place to
deliver this information because story
time is a ritual that many families have
almost daily and within story time
conversation is already a natural mode
of interaction between parent and
children so it's not a big step to try
to augment story time a little to
encourage parents and children to talk a
little bit more about themselves or ask
a bit more about each other and number
three was that some of the parents we we
were talking to her a bit concerned
about technology coming in between them
and their kids so we found that when we
when we wrapped up our information in
the familiar vehicle of a story and a
familiar physical form of a storybook
they suddenly became a lot more
comfortable using our technology our
system is a sr our system is a symbiosis
between three actors stories are
co-created with input that is one third
from the child 13 from the parent and 13
from the opus framework for this to work
the child explores our date with the
magnifying glass Beast their discoveries
are archived in the story for you for
later use um focus framework relies
heavily on databases for storytelling
structure for pros and illustration
style as well as child education really
material or research and finally the
parent joins the child with opus to
imagine these stories here is our
concept video where we
so she uses opus an augmented storybook
and magnifying glass that helps parent
and child share experiences through the
power of story while her mother is at
work the daughter Riley discovers things
with the magnifying glass how are you
guys today she finds things that
interest sir it's beautiful and she
finds things that she wants to remember
each time Riley focus is the magnifying
glass on an object it comes alive and
talks to her hello Riley my name is
George do you know who I am you're a
ball yes i am a tennis ball i bounce
here and bounce there let's go on an
adventure together look for me in the
book later later that night story time
begins opus actively listens to Jill and
Riley's conversation are you ready for
the story yep once upon a time there was
a what was there Riley a girl and that
girl's name was what was her name me
Riley Riley lived with her where did she
live with Teddy and Riley and Teddy
lived on a farm they were best friends
no what do you mean no you love teddy
bears we're enemies now oh I see Riley
and Teddy were enemies oh what's that
it's a tennis ball I found it today oh
really have you played tennis before do
you want to try yeah let's plan to do
that for the weekend Riley and Teddy
were rival tennis players and this is
their story later the story is done and
Riley
gone to sleep Jill sets up the next
story my focus focus hello Jill would
you like to talk about the next story
yeah I noticed that Riley is very
concerned about way that is fairly
common for her age the possible solution
is to emphasize the qualities that
helped her get there not the result
itself should we add that in for the
next time good to know that sounds
fantastic great i'll save that do you
want to review the summary now I will
read it for the first time with Riley
now that jill has opus story time was
taken on your meeting with okis the
telling of each news stories a chance
for parents to teach for children to
reflect in a chance for both of them to
bond so you just saw a day in the life
with opus and the experience of opus can
be categorized into five steps let me
take you each scrap in more detail first
is discover the child uses the
magnifying glass to discover the world
around her and as a magnifying glass
recognize that chosen object it
initiates a conversation through
interactive air characters to keep the
child engage in the activity second is
co-create during sort time parent and
child can call Chris stories by
completing unfinished narratives fight
on Nerdist this feature was modeled
after an actual observed behavior from
parents when they make up stories for
their children and also opus uses a
three-act source structure set up
confrontation and resolution to combine
these seemingly random elements into one
cohesive narrative third is experience
opus is actively listening to the
conversation between parent and child
and creating the next content in real
time so although opus is not
contributing vocally the story is still
taught by three actors child parent and
opus and forth is Sharon learn the
previously captured element appear in
the story to become a starting points
for conversation allowing parents to ask
more engaging questions to find further
further insights into the child
experiences and last is reflecting plan
many of the parents that we interviewed
with wanted to learn more about the
child's experiences and interests so
they can help them better so the so the
active planning the story together with
opus is a great opportunity for parents
to learn about the empirical research
behind the plot points and also to carry
that knowledge into real life and also
here is where parents can review content
and select narrative illustration author
sales and Sarah so up to this point
we've only discussed opus within an
immediate family environment involving
parent and child but we envision opens
to be in a bigger context so what if
extended family members aunt
grandparents uncles friends are
contributing in storytelling it would be
a great way to connect distant family
members and also an opportunity for
parents to teach children about family
rules and values so for us the biggest
takeaway from this project was a renewed
respect for storytelling and this
respect is why we've created opus a
system that enhances the ritual of story
time and also helps families to connect
with one another through the power of
storytelling thank you
Thanks so congratulations on your
project I i will say that insights that
you guys led off with i felt really
powerful and succinct and really clear
clear in their presentation and it the
quality of your process and your
research really showed through and I
think set you up for a lot of success
later on right as you gave this
presentation like I started wondering
like why would anybody want to go
through their day collecting this
information and then when you showed the
magnifying glass actually personifying
things in the world around I thought
that was a brilliant solution to
actually making somebody want to do that
giving some reward in using the project
product one thing I did wonder though is
it like I thought that there was a
little bit of ambiguity about whether or
not the product was about co-creating a
new story with the child or letting them
reconstruct their day in story like form
right and those two aren't necessarily
the same thing like they would suggest
different prompts a different UX for
that story book right and that was one
question I had is like had you thought
about the UX of that story book and why
would were prompt you because one thing
that's interesting about conversation or
UI is that the tenor of the conversation
the content of the conversation actually
becomes UX write the words that you use
the blanks that are there and that kind
of stuff so I'm wondering if you guys
thought about what that what that
interaction was like I think it's we
actually only presented one one scenario
in this book but then when we were
designing we were thinking there were a
few levels of possibility some parents
might actually feel really tired and
they don't want to to like make a story
so then the book would just write it all
for them to answer your question I think
that this is more about creating a new
story rather than talking about the
child stay and that the tenor or the the
language in the book is actually set up
at the end of the book where you could
see when the parent was talking to the
book she could actually choose
illustrator style and kind of writer
style and those were kind of dictate how
like you could choose the dr. Seuss
version of the
look and then they would talk like dr.
Seuss and yeah yeah beautiful amazing
presentation and I i love the premise
and i agree with cliff that the way you
set up there's initial this kind of the
strategy the principles was really
strong so strong in fact that as a
parent I kind of immediately wanted it
to be a particular thing and I don't
know if this is useful to state but um I
the illustration part kind of threw me
in the actual sort of creation of the
story because I think even if it were
now I'm just kind of brainstorming with
you if there's just something an aid for
parents you always have to come up with
like a new and better story at bedtime
and I think something that would aid
apparent that also again sort of brings
the child into the story revealing
something about his or her day was so
powerful you had me kind of there and
then again i mean i love the ambition of
bringing in the illustration and the
book but it it probably i think it would
be successful even with less and but
again for the spirit of this project i
understand the desire to sort of keeping
keep going i mean i think that that was
the case with a couple other projects
that we saw as well but i hope i hope
you continue with this and i think there
is something really valuable that
probably would be less work even that
could come out of this so i totally
identify with the problem statement as
it was both my daughters are actually in
the audience future future designers and
every single day is the how did that was
your day and the nothing
except the output of their creativity
and that's where we actually have great
conversations and yesterday my younger
daughter was showing me her Sims
basement house that she damn you know
designed and you know third floor of her
15th house that she's built and she was
imagining the persona of the person who
lived there and decorating it
appropriately for this particular
individual and and it reminded me of the
exactly what you're doing which is the
point is to engage the parents in a
conversation through creativity and how
can a conversational assistant to bring
magic to that so it reminds me a little
bit of a last project we saw in terms of
you know just immediately providing the
sort of starting points for a
conversation and stimulating that with
provocation and all sorts of things i
think there's so many levels I could
talk about your project I could go on
for like 20 minutes but I'll stop there
but I really liked it and some really
very deep and thoughtful thinking about
the future of sort of guided co-creation
and I really enjoyed it thanks
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
