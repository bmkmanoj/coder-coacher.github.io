of quiz located in the northeastern
aegean sea
the island has a very steep topography
and flammable vegetation the biggest
problem is that we have a large area
there are many wildfires in Lazarus
the thing that excites me about my job
is the possibility that we can change
the way science is conducted in order to
run our models and algorithms we require
a large amount of input data
laughter the data tsunami is changing
everything in science so we do collect
data on vegetation three kind of these
shrubs our station collects many data's
whether measurements are also with water
tanks every discipline is now confronted
with a vast explosion of data that comes
from instruments from online sources
microservice has provided us with
computer resources analyzing this data
can't be done on a PC this models we use
for fire risk and fire propagation
require high spatial and temporal
resolution you need a large cloud
infrastructure such as Windows Azure to
be able to bring all these sources
together
the model we know about the fire
behavior more than will help us to do
our job better
we started collaborating with the fire
department of Lesbos every day I look at
the maps and fire risk and have to see
where the most dangerous places are
application uses Windows Azure the Bing
Maps and the Silverlight application all
this three are assessed in order to
provide a unique truth the firefighter
Personnel Manager wildfires it allows
users to be able to see the big picture
of an emerging fire or the potential
when the firefighter looks at the system
you can see first the fire risk for the
next one happened change your house and
secondly how the platform will propagate
in the next house also as an animation
producers or providers in a live way to
keep this data safely of course this
only can be accessed by us even if we
don't know where these virtual machines
are located before the cloud we'll have
to do a lot of work that lasts an hour
and tomorrow now we can take the same
job in a couple of minutes so my hope is
that this program can be applied in the
whole country of Greece and some other
areas around the world so because of
this system and the cloud that supports
the system the firefighters can respond
quicker more reliable more efficient to
a potential wife allegation I really
like to protect our environment in
special forests and I like saving
mine fires we have the best results you
can you can see
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
