you
okay I think we're ready I'm pleased to
welcome Sarah Gallacher who's
interviewing here for a postdoc position
in hxd Sarah's at UCL currently and
erstwhile did a PhD at Edinburgh in
computer science so welcome Sarah and we
look forward to top thanks very much and
well thanks for inviting me here today
and thank you for coming to listen to my
talk and so yet my name is sarah i'm a
postdoc researcher at UCL at the moment
previously I had been working for about
10 years now on different areas of
ubicomp and mostly under the ubicomp
umbrella and beginning back in 2005 when
I started my PhD and I did that part
time when I worked on various EU
projects full-time as an RA at the same
time and whenever I started my PhD I was
thinking very much about machine
learning algorithms and about how to
make them as fast and efficient for
problems like personalization and
autonomous adaptation and smart spaces
like homes and offices and to be honest
the user didn't really come into my
vocabulary very much at that point and
towards the end of my PhD though my
thinking had started to change a lot
more towards why are we personalizing
why are we oughtn't autonomously
adapting this for the user does the user
even want that and how can we bring them
back into the loop so then i moved to
UCL to do a postdoc two years ago and i
met Yvonne rogers and she was talking
about user empowerment and user
engagement rather than just autonomously
adapting everything around them and it
was really eye-opening and really
enlightening for me and my current
research now falls into the future
cities demean and I work in the i CRI
cities lab for sustainable and connected
cities and there I typically consider
the technical and social challenges of
cities and technology for future cities
but from the viewpoint of the citizens
that live in them so to describe myself
in one sentence I would say I'm a
computer scientist but I care about the
end user as well and I've also put
together this little word cloud that's
just from a number of
so I used to describe what I do and who
I am and you'll notice that computer is
quite a common theme so and I'm a
computer scientist I also do work in the
area of human-computer interaction and I
do physical computing but today
ironically my talks actually called
uncompetitive the computer baggage so to
describe what I mean I've put together
this little sketch this is something
that happens me quite regularly so
friends and family will ask me what do I
do and I tell them I'm a computer
scientist I used to try to give them
some literal explanation but that took
far too long and it just really confused
everyone and so I don't do that anymore
I just use simple terms like I work with
computers I'm a computer scientist and
the response i get is something like
this or i don't like computers i can't
use them and i always find that quite
funny because i know they all have
tablets i know they all have smartphones
some of them even now have smart watches
a lot of them are into quantified self
in a big way and they use all these
technologies and tools very easily and
in concert with one another so it's
interesting to me how the computer has
become more and more embedded and at the
same time more hidden behind these
familiar forms that don't seem to carry
the same baggage as comes with the term
computer which seems to make us think
about these frustrating interactions
with the desktop PC and instead and I
were talking about smart phones and
smart watches and we use this prefix
smart to hint that there's computational
and networking capabilities there but
we're also talking about phones and
watches things that people are familiar
with that they don't find scary that
they know how to use and it's
interesting how these metaphors are also
used to introduce us to new technologies
so the little handheld computers that we
all have no our smartphones they were
introduced through the phone metaphor
and imma interested to think about you
know if they had been interested as they
had been introduced to us as portable
internet terminals or handheld computers
would their uptake have been so quick
and successful perhaps this term
handheld computer would have been too
close to the metaphor of a desktop PC so
the term on computing in the way i'm
using it really refers to this illusion
that were not using computers anymore or
we're not doing computing anymore when
an actual fact where we're integrate or
we're using computers more now in their
various forms and we ever did before and
it's also a bit of a nod and a reference
to this some growing trend of uncraft
Anor unmaking so I've attended quite a
few on crafting workshops now we're
typically you just take old technology
apart and you learn from its design and
you learn from how the bits work and
then you think about how you can put the
bits back together and combine them in
different ways to make new things so am
in my talk now I'd like to talk about
two fields and that I've worked in and
that are really significantly impacting
on the forms and functions of future
computing in that ciety the internet
things and tangibles are tangible user
interfaces and they're quite interlinked
but crucially these fields both
introduce us to new technologies and
they do this by embedding computing and
networking capabilities into familiar
objects very often so I OT is thought of
as a recent phenomenon but the terms
more recent the concept goes way back so
over 30 years ago in 1982 some students
connected a Coke machine I'm not sure if
this is the actual one and to the
internet and they used ARPANET this is
before world wide web technologies
because they wanted to know when the
coke machine was full and when the cans
were called and most people agree or
that's widely agreed that this is the
first connected appliance or IOT device
and since then the number of IOT devices
has exploded so in 2015 at the minute we
have know about 40 million in the UK and
by 2020 it's estimated they'll be 50
billion in the world and that's three
for every person on the planet or so I
six for every person in the planet so
what are all these devices and what are
we using them for well it's across a
broad range of demands so from health
right through to city and environment
and if you look at some of these
individual applications you'll notice
there's a common thread of gathering
device and sensor information and data
and feeding it up to the cloud and
combining it with big data and analytics
to learn some new information and there
are a lot of potential benefits too
so I would say I'm more healthier now
because of what quantified self devices
have taught me but what if we're just
building a very large surveillance
network so as we start to put more
sensing and monitoring technologies into
things that were previously mundi in
everyday devices they can start to take
on a last benign appearance in nature so
for example in 2012 I don't know if you
remember the smart been Fiasco in London
where they had installed extra
computational power into the bins to
capture MAC addresses for directed
advertising but in comparison to some
other potential IOT initiatives bins are
the least of the worries so I was a
recent board of advisors meeting for my
lab a few weeks ago and there were a lot
of heads of technology from various
companies and organizations there and I
was a bit taken a bag about some of this
really excited talk about swarms of
autonomous drones that were becoming to
cities near us very soon to monitor
traffic all for good reasons but you can
imagine all the other scenarios that
could happen as well and I see them kind
of as like a former CCTV two point oh
well now the camera can actually detach
itself from the lamppost and follow you
down the street and there was also a lot
of discussion about IOT enabled consumer
devices like washing machines and
fridges and Samsung have dedicated that
by 2020 all their consumer appliances
will have IOT capabilities and I think
that's that's fine that's exciting but
for me the question is for what purpose
so how does it benefit me as the end
user of this washing machine if my
washing machine tells me the spin cycles
done and I was interested to see richard
banks as a panelist on one of the smart
salons on the internet of why and for me
that's one of the key questions for some
of these initiatives why what's the
what's the benefit and I'm also
interested about the question of can we
do something than to engage the wider
public in these kinds of discussions
about some of these IOT initiatives in
the future of this kinds of technologies
and their potential to actually impact
on our own privacy in the future of
surveillance and monitoring well imagine
you walked into a public toilet cubicle
and you were greeted by the sign so it
says this is
is proud to participate in the healthy
building initiative behavior at these
toilets are being recorded for analysis
access your live data at quantified
toilets calm it's pretty horrific and
then imagine you went to the website and
you saw there supposedly live analysis
theater it's even worse well this is
exactly what happened to some delegates
at k in 2014 in Toronto and thankfully
in this case it wasn't an IOT company
gone crazy and it was actually a thought
experiment that I put together with some
of my colleagues who were also a
workshop okay and the aim of this
workshop was to provoke discussion and
discourse around the future of
surveillance and technol and monitoring
technologies and what we wanted to do
was try to give an an environmentally or
an ecologically valid experience of what
it might be like to live in an
environment in a world where these kinds
of technologies did exist and to do this
we piggybacked on some hot topics like
IOT and quantified self and big data and
we used concepts from them to create
this fake company called quantified
toilets that had supposedly installed
their monitoring technology and all the
toilets at the conference than you and
we hope to spark some discussion between
conference delegates on privacy and
future surveillance that actually went
way beyond that it reached a global
audience through social media so what 8
a.m. on the first morning of the
conference one of the delegates tweeted
this picture that they just find in
their toilet cubicle and they say
started my day at k literally facing
this I'm sure it's not as bad as it
signs within half an hour we were
contacted by major media corporations
who seemed more excited about the fact
that we might be a real company but we
told them we weren't and we give them
interviews anyway and we recovered in a
number of publications and Twitter
continued to snowball and these really
interesting reactions and comments kept
coming in what was really interesting
about this thought experiment was that
it did seem to give people a hint of
what it might be like to be in a world
where this technology did exist and was
implemented in this way some people
thought it was true for a little bit and
then they realized it wasn't or they
were debriefed properly
we also saw lots of considerations then
after everyone realized it was just a
thought experiment people reflecting and
weighing up pros and cons of life with
these kinds of technologies and actually
there were quite a number of people who
really love this and would like it for
their own homes so they could monitor
their own health as long as the data was
private and secure and not connected to
the internet this person comments on
their realization about a lack of
concern when it comes to surveillance
and their general willingness just to
accept it and they say I'm worried about
my own reaction to not even take it
seriously that's kind of scary in itself
to just go on about my business not
clarifying what's happening here exactly
is kind of shocking what kind of
surveillance I'm willing to put up with
and I think an interesting thing about
the quantified toilets experiment was
that engaged the public in discussions
on the future of surveillance and
privacy and monitoring which are
sometimes topics that can be quite
inaccessible or quite academic and may
be too dry for some of the rest of the
public and but it's a thread that I
think we should consider to continue to
look at down the IOT line as new
technologies and initiatives emerge and
we need to have these discussions in a
much wider and broader audience and not
in response to the installation of these
technologies but before the fact so like
before drone swarms start to become a
reality or before a real version of
quantified toilets gets installed in
some public toilets and it does actually
exist in some degree and the concepts
behind the quantified toilets company
there are companies in Japan are already
doing this not in public toilets and if
you want to see more you can still visit
the website or you can still see the
tweets which continued to come in this
is almost a year later but as well as
potentially putting sensors into toilets
IOT could potentially put sensing in the
power of sensing into the hands of
everyone and a growing trend that stoked
by the maker movement is that of citizen
sensing or participatory sensing using
these little sensing platforms like the
smart citizen on the left here the wasp
bolt and the little Intel curry
and my question is high and where my
citizens use these little sensing
platforms and for what purposes and also
what responsibilities fall on us as
honors of these kinds of technologies if
we started to deploy them in public
spaces how transparent and how visible
do we need to make them so to explore
these questions further I organized a
workshop but ubicomp in 2013 it was
several of my colleagues and it was the
sin city workshop and we had about 25
participants on the day and they ranged
from designers right through to sensor
fusion experts and engineers and we
split everyone up into five groups and
we all give them this Sin City kit each
and this is a kid that was designed and
built specially for the workshop by
Vachel Nikita and it's based on
Microsoft gadgeteer and you can add a
number of sensors to it like light and
vibration and temperature and then also
comes with this built-in actuator in the
form of a camera and there's a number of
knobs and sliders on the device allow
you to set a threshold on the screen and
whenever the sensor input goes through
that threshold then the camera takes a
picture and these are a number of the
pictures that the camera can take so we
give the group some time to think about
how and where they might deploy deploy
this technology in an urban public space
and we give them some thoughts about how
they might want to use it like they
might want to take pictures when a door
handle gets opened or they might want to
take pictures of the heaviest traffic
rumbling across a bridge and we also ask
groups to think about what it should
look like in its urban environment and
we give them lots of different types of
materials to make a kissing around the
kit and we ask them to consider if it
should blend in or stand out and we give
them even some camouflage material to
and we ask them also to think about
metaphors that they could use in their
design that might make it more
transparent about what the device is
actually gathering and sensing and the
idea was that we would then take these
creations are into the real city outside
and use them in the afternoon to see
what they were what the acted like in
public spheres we had some fantastic
creations and two themes emerged so this
was the first theme this is the
 zoomorphic ships and they were
typically in at encouraging public
engagement either by shaking aliens hand
were shaking the Ducks leg to give some
response in raphy back to some question
that was posed the other theme was these
box like creations that were typically
used to capture environmental data this
particular team used a vibration sensor
and took their sensing kit onto public
transport around zero and tried to
capture pictures of the places with the
worst road conditions nobody made their
kit blend in at all they were all very
out there I think one of the most
interesting outcomes from this workshop
was the way that the public reacted to
these devices so the duck an alien ships
attracted a lot of positive attention
and people would actively proactively
come across and want to investigate and
interact with them and these are some of
the many pictures that were taken by the
alien of members of the public and
what's interesting nobody at any point
asked why has my picture been taken
what's it going to be used for they
didn't seem concerned at all there was
one couple who were a bit disappointed
they couldn't get hard copy as a
souvenir but that was the only problem
in contrast the Box ships attracted this
really suspicious reaction from the
public and there were a lot of
suspicious and anxious glances and in
one instance the this group over here
they tried to board a bus with their
device and the bus driver stopped them
and asked them what they were doing and
what this strange object was and he
explained he was from East Germany
originally and he was very sensitive to
spying and monitoring and once we
explained who we wear what we were doing
what this device was he was finally let
us come on but actually after that
happened this group decided to hide
their box in a jumper because they
became so anxious about what the public
were were thinking and how they were
reacting so following on from this work
we questioned why the design of current
sensors has to be this gray box what if
urban sensors could be more transparent
maybe showing more about what kind of
data they're gathering may be showing
some ambient feedback about the data
they've gathered and I've used these
little numbers tag devices just to show
this in a kind of an
triple morphic or the morphic way and
maybe urban sensors could be more of a
spectacle that encourages curiosity
about the data something that
contributes to the urban space rather
than just benignly clinging to the wall
what is the sensors could also encourage
interaction like the ducks and aliens
where the public can interact to provide
some input either their feelings or
their feedback on some issue or their
thoughts and we often talk about this a
soft sensing where you're no longer
sensing the environment know you're
sensing the sentiment of people and
maybe they could also get something in
return for interacting with these
devices like the couple that wanted the
hard copy to take with them but maybe it
doesn't have to be a physical saying
maybe it could be enough to see how
others think and feel perhaps in your
local neighborhood about a local issue
or maybe even in your workplace and on
this I'd like to show you a quick video
of a soft sensing project that I did the
aim to create a much more open working
environment by encouraging people to
think about how they felt at work
expressed that and then talk about it
with their employer with their
colleagues
so this is the mood squeezer project
unfortunately it got better known as
squeezy balls in our in our department
and the aim was to encourage a much more
open working environment with more
discussion between employees and we're
possible where those discussions could
have some depths so going beyond the
typical weather chat than the elevator
so after quite a few rounds of
brainstorming we came up with this
concept and we built five of these
squeezed boxes which have six different
colored squeezy bowls on top and we
placed each one of these on five
different floors in the building in the
workplace and beside each one we put
this sign that just simply said squeeze
the color of your mood and we left this
quite open-ended we didn't give any
further instruction about how moods
related to colors and we did this
because we didn't want to first of all
alienate anyone who didn't agree with
our mapping of mid to color we wanted
users to put their own rules onto the
device but crucially we wanted to see if
it would act as a trigger towards
discussion between colleagues about this
relationship between mood and color and
their own subjective views on it and we
also hope that it might also lead to
then them talking about how they were
feeling and maybe why they felt a
certain color to visualize all these
squeezed colors we use this gorgeous LED
floor display and it already existed in
the workplace building so I just wrote
some new cord for it to repurpose it as
a big mood visualization and it showed
what colors were squeezed on each floor
and I also showed what colors have been
squeezed the most that day in the
building and this was situated in the
middle of the building on the middle
floor so we wondered we were we were
thinking would people wander along to
this floor and have a look at what the
results were and maybe bump into other
colleagues and then have a discussion
about the colors so we left the
installations in place for about eight
weeks we wanted to see whether first of
all would people use them or would they
ignore them would they go to see the
floor display would they go out of their
way to squeeze a ball would they discuss
the mood and color relationships and
more importantly would they discuss
their own moods to investigate we
collected all the squeeze results from
the boxes we also did observations in
the workplace both at the installations
and also in other communist
cases and we also interviewed a number
of employees and the first thing we find
was that there was an awful lot of
squeezing and especially at the start
and then that dropped as the novelty
wore off which we expected it would but
when we asked during the interviews why
they squeezed people said sometimes it
was just because they loved the tactile
feel of the balls sometimes it was
because they just helped them to
destress and others just said that they
really enjoyed just having a chance to
take some time out of their working day
to just self reflect and do something a
bit light-hearted and fun and while
visiting the boxes and the floor people
did talk about having conversations with
their colleagues and we asked what this
was about and sometimes it was about the
how the technology worked but also there
were some in-depth discussions about the
relationship between mood and color and
also their own moods so why were they
feeling yellow today and what did it
mean that the fifth floor was pink this
participant said and I also think we
have been more open about how we've been
filling whilst it's been out there and
that in itself has to be a good thing so
it's had quite a lot has had a lot of
maybe indirect effects that are actually
quite substantial and conversations also
extended away from the installations to
other public areas in the building like
the coffee room like outside smoking and
in the left where it really did replace
all weather chat so now people were
asking heavy squeezed yet today or what
color have you squeezed and participants
told us that they also talked about
outside of work so in personal and
leisure spaces so at home with their
friends and family and a lot of
conversations took place down the pub
after work sorry this person said it was
like intensive discussions and several
times not only one and not only with my
colleagues here also back home with my
family and my friends significantly it
also generated this buzz around the
workplace which was traditionally quite
a steed and serious workplace but it did
it in a light-hearted in a non enforced
way so it wasn't the same as organized
fun like going for pizza or going to an
away day which are often facilitated by
management instead it was a much more
organic thing that anyone can decide to
opt into or
totally ignore and they wouldn't feel
pressure from bosses to engage and it
was also all inclusive so it was
something that anyone could do in their
way past they didn't have to stay late
after work they didn't have to take time
out of their lunch break and also it
didn't distract from from serious
workplace matters so we run the study
again this time at commercial offices in
Canary Wharf and they didn't have this
lovely floor display so instead this
time we created these mood lights out of
repurposed ikea lights and this time we
place them adjacent to the boxes on each
floor and they show what colors have
been squeezed on the box beside it not
for the whole building and at the start
of this study we saw very similar
behaviour to the first one but then as a
study progressed we started to notice
this very different behavior emergent it
first of all came through in the
quantitative data so we're getting these
huge squeezed kinds and as the day
progressed the colors that were being
squeezed got less and less varied and at
the end of the day very often the light
was all one color so we queried with the
employees we interviewed what was going
on and they told us about this
competition that had broken i and become
the main reason for using this in the
office so the idea was that some people
wanted the light to be all one color
like this one and there was another
group of people who were trying to keep
it multicolored like this one but what
this what this group would do in the
morning they would decide as a group
what color the light should be that day
and then they would actively try to
recruit other people to squeeze that
color for through the building to make
the lights day that color and then
between the floors they're also grew
another rivalry as to who had the most
beautiful or who had the most active
light so people would go between floors
and compare and feedback to their floor
all we need to squeeze more or we need
to do this color so mid squeezer was an
example of a very tangible interface and
it encouraged people to think about how
they felt and then squeeeeeeze to
reflect and express themselves and I'd
like to turn just a little bit more now
towards tangibles and tangible user
interfaces so I chose this picture
because for me it sums up one of the
challenges of tangibles that of
personalization and I attended an
entrepreneurship intangibles panel at
tei in January and they discussed the
two main issues personalization and
scalability there are a few
so on scalability it's not so easy and
cheap to scale up tangibles it's not as
easy as just releasing software or a nap
there's physical materials and
manufacturing there and what if you want
to upgrade on the personalization side
it's sometimes not so easy to adapt to
tangible once its form factors decided
sometimes it's not adaptable enough to
put your own personal interest on there
or your own personal design however one
area where we find that tangibles do
work very well is gathering feedback and
opinions from the public as a kind of a
physical questionnaire and in this case
we're creating a one-to-many device so
issues like scalability and
personalization are mitigated to some
degree and our first exploration into
this area is the voxbox and this is the
Volks box it's basically a very large
physical questionnaire I also put a
little picture as voxbox team up here
and there are two more that couldn't be
there that day so this has taken at the
first iting of voxbox in Canary Wharf or
sorry in Green Park at one of the Tour
de France fan parks when the Tour de
France passed through from Cambridge to
London hence the cycling thing but I'll
show you a short video of it in action
hopefully
without signed oh well there's no
talking in it any way I can talk you
through it yeah so this was this was
videoed at the second outing of the
voxbox we took it to Canary Wharf which
was the second tour de france fan park
and we just took it there too we were
working with the organizers of the fan
parks and to try to get feedback from
the crowds that were there on the day to
know more about how they felt about the
event what the experience of the event
was for them and what could potentially
be changed so you'll see we had like
families and individuals using it this
girl's just going through answering all
the questions at the minute and she
moves along from box to box and then the
last box the foreign rings at this point
and asked her a question what will you
must remember from today and she said
that she remembers that it's very hot
and there was lots of food and and then
whenever she hangs up that's her
finished and you'll see that she gets a
little reward at the end for finishing
so this ball has been falling down the
tube as she's been answering the
questions and then at the end she gets
as a takeaway so we created the Volks
box as a means to gather opinions from
members of the public at events and we
wanted to do this in a more engaging way
and in a bit of a less awkward way then
is sometimes the case when you try to
approach people with a clipboard so it's
basically a five foot high questionnaire
and people use physical buttons and
sliders to answer questions and they're
grouped so the first box was a big green
button that's demographics then to the
right you have asking questions about
your own nude then the next box below
that is how you perceive the mood of the
crowd the one to the left end of that is
how you perceive the event in the
atmosphere at the event and the final
box is this phone box that you saw the
lady use and it's like our open-ended
question like you would get a text box
on a paper based questionnaire and then
in the reverse side of voxbox we have
these three portholes with tablets
inside and they just show real-time
visualizations of all the data that
we've collected so the ideas that you
interact on the front and then you can
immediately walk grow in the back and
see what the data is and how it's been
collected with Fox box we also wanted to
address this personalization issue or in
this case customization in other words
how can we make voxbox modular and
adaptable so we can take it to different
events without having to do any major
rebuilding or any major recording so we
did this in two ways so firstly we
physically designed it to be these
drawers that can slide in and I of this
physical freedom these look we called
them question boxes and you can move
them around as necessary and take one's
oh and add new ones and we also use
detachable levels for all the questions
and answers so again they can be easily
removed and replaced with others
secondly in the software side we also
wanted to design voxbox to be quite
dynamic so each question box has its own
microcontroller inside that controls the
i/o for all the questions on that box
and then as well as that we also have a
master micro controller that controls
the order in which the question box has
become active and it also controls
communication with a back-end server so
I wanted to make it so that if we move
these question boxes around or added new
ones are removed old ones you wouldn't
need to record anything on any of the
microcontrollers in the Vox box itself
so to do this whenever the maker or
whenever the master microcontroller
starts it connects to the backend server
and asks the server for a list of
question boxes that it's attached to and
their order so that means if we move
them around if we take ones out if we
add new ones all you have to do is
change the list and the backend server
and you can do this through a web page
so it means no recording needed at all
and the Vox box and that came in very
handy in a few occasions so we've
deployed voxbox now at four different
events in the UK so this was the first
one in green park at the fan park we
also took it to another fan park at
Canary Wharf we took it to Cardiff to
digital democracy event and then finally
we took it to the electromagnetic field
event near milton keynes this is a great
event it's just a big hacker fest in the
middle of a failed and you camp and it's
a whole weekend of hacking and making
and from the various deployments we
understood more about how the voxbox
worked and what we might need to
reconsider for a future
and here are some of the key findings so
first of all attracting attention it was
very good at drawing people in we didn't
ever once have to go and encourage
people to come across and use voxbox
they came themselves so they self
selected to give us their opinions on
their terms which we see is a benefit
over this slightly awkward trying to
approach someone with a clipboard and we
even had people forming queues to use
voxbox I've never seen a queue for a
questionnaire before but we had them on
a number of occasions it engaged groups
and all ages so we had groups use it
individuals use it and they ranged in
age from very young children right up to
adults and whenever I think in about
two-thirds of the occasions when a group
approached Fox box they were a family
and we see this supporting of group
interaction is a very positive thing
because it doesn't mean that means that
nobody has to isolate themselves from
the rest of their group to come and
answer our questions they did it as a
whole so they would discuss it with each
other and then one or many of them would
would do the physical interaction we
collected closed and open questions so
the telephone worked very well in
two-thirds of occasions when people
interact with his Fox box they left
something relevant on the telephone
sometimes it was a very long answer
sometimes as a bit shorter but the ones
that didn't say anything very often they
didn't understand English so we had a
lot of foreign visitors and tourists
especially at the fan parks and also
sometimes they were young children who
loved answering the phone and they need
to do that instinctively but the minute
they heard this strange voice they
panicked and then handed it to their
parent and it also encouraged meaningful
interaction so because it's such a
playful interactive thing we weren't
sure if people would leave us honest
opinions so we analyzed the answers from
the two days at the fan parks and on the
day they were two very different events
so the first one was very positive there
were loads of people there this was the
day that the tour was actually passing
through London so there was a real buzz
and a very positive atmosphere and that
came through in the answers that we got
through the box box box and in contrast
at Canary Wharf it was very quiet it was
a weekend nobody goes to Canary Wharf at
the weekend it was a strange
earth for a fan park so there wasn't
this buzz that the tour was already in
France by this time so I think that
excitement had died down as well and we
had a lot of vendors who were getting
increasingly frustrated because of the
lack of crowds so there just wasn't a
positive atmosphere and we saw that
again coming through and the answers so
on that day the the answers were much
lower for things like mood of the crowd
positive experience and excitement and
we also saw people deliberately choosing
their answers so sort of exploring the
answer space and making a very
deliberate choice and they would think
aloud they would talk to themselves why
liver making their decisions and they
would talk to whoever they were wet and
they would discuss it and decide so we
feel that volks box can collect honest
opinions and it can do so in a very
engaging and playful way so following on
from this volks box deployment we got a
lot of interest from various different
parties and we set up two more
collaborations to build two more opinion
gathering systems and this is the first
one of those this is small talk and it
was in a collaboration with the young
vic theatre in london and was fevered
sleep which is a production company and
they wanted to get feedback from four to
seven year olds about an interactive
play that they were putting on in the
young vic so we developed this set of
five simple question boxes and it uses
simple interaction on each box and audio
so it can support the children who can't
read yet and we positioned the boxes
along the back of the theater and after
the play had finished we got the
children to come and give us their
feedback and their reflections on what
they'd seen by using the boxes and we
had about sixty three children user in
total one thing we learned from the
Volks box was this issue of the
telephone and her children wouldn't
answer back so we were trying to think
about how we could make it so that we
could get more open-ended or spoken
answers from children so what we did in
this case I think there's another video
involved here so it might take a little
minute yeah so in this case we tried a
video box so we we videoed this is the
main character in the play and he looks
directly at the video and asks the
children a question they asked a total
of three and at the end he pretends
listen to try to encourage response from
the children and the idea was that they
would answer our Westboro speak their
answers into this big fluffy microphone
that was at the side of the box and it
worked very well so out of the 63
children that used the box 43 of them
gave us a really good answer for all
three questions that they were asked I
think there were only six children that
wouldn't answer any questions and they
were all very young they were all just
for the second project is the census
project and we created this in
partnership with the Civic workshop the
British Council in Somerset House and a
TMS to rethink the UK census &amp;amp; Howe
collecting census data could become much
more dynamic and maybe more localized
and again it's a set of five boxes and
they explore different things like trust
and health and we're exploring how much
data people are willing to share and for
what purposes and what data they would
like to see from others in this system
we've also developed ID cards so that we
can track the same user at different
boxes and you can also slot your card
into this data column and see how your
data compares to everyone else is it's
currently deployed and it's open to the
public at the moment in somerset house
until the end of februari so if any of
you are passing by please give it a try
so far we've had about 500 people use it
since it opened about three weeks ago so
that's a brief overview of my past work
and recent current work but what next
and I'd now like to think about how like
to continue on computing in the future
and it's nothing to do with embedding
technology and toilets but this is
actually one of the japanese companies
who have done a real quantified toilets
in for real so generally I think my
future thoughts can be summed up as
technologies to rethink the imbalance of
IOT empowerment so to me at the moment
power seems to be falling much more to
cooperate corporations or governments or
the people who actually provide the
devices and then store and on the data
that comes from those devices and I'd
like to explore how users could become
more device creators d to owners sense
makers rather than just the data
producers and this also includes
exploring the balance between making
technology just really accessible and
easy for anyone to use and the need for
some level of external orchestration or
purpose to use the technology pardon me
so firstly following on from sin city is
this idea of citizens sensing but an
even more accessible level so much more
accessible than the sensing platforms
that i showed in a previous slide like
the smart citizen kit already in
kickstarter there a number of IOT
startups like this one who are trying to
make sensing in the policing of sensors
as accessible as possible so this is
mother sense and you get this kit you
get this hub the mother and she comes
with these four cookies which are simple
little sensors I think there's light
temperature vibration and another one
and the idea is that you can just plug
her into your Ritter and then you can
place these sensors anywhere around your
house to solve your own problems so it
might be to check you've taken your
medication or to know when the coffee's
done or to check if anyone's going into
the fridge at night I'm curious as to
who uses systems like mother sense and
for what purposes and we're in
particular I'd love to know if mother
sends users use it for their own novel
reasons rather than just the promotional
ideas that come along with the till kit
and also how long term is the engagement
so with the smart citizen kits they saw
that typically after a month eighty
percent of them were turned off and this
was from within the community that
actually crowdfunded that technology in
the first place with smart citizen
though there were some extra technical
boundaries to overcome and some people
had trouble configuring it etc I'm
curious to see if accessibility alone is
enough or if you still need to provide
users with some more orchestration or
purpose to drive youths and continued
use of the technology secondly on the
other side of sensing is actuated and
incense to some kind of sense data or
sensed event and in systems like mother
sense the actuation is typically
constrained to your mobile phone so the
features of your mobile phone like
taking a picture using the camera or
just showing you some feedback or
visualizations through an app I'm
curious about how we can extend be
on the mobile phone so in other words
could we provide a little tool kit of
actuations that allow people to decide
where and how to place those around
their home for their own purposes like
mother sends does with sensing I'm
inspired by these proverbial wallets
from MIT and they visualize your bank
account data in three different ways
using three simple little actuations so
the first one vibrates when a
transaction happens in your account the
second one gets harder and harder to
open when your account balance drops and
the third one grows and shrinks in line
with your account balance and I'm
interested about this idea of how users
could embellish their own personal
spaces and their own personal things
with simple actuation to give them
ambient feedback or to physically
visualize some data but in a much more
personal way to them it's kind of like
crafting actuation into your own
personal things I'm also curious as to
how this might affect engagement and
commitment where there's some behavior
change intended so some people might
want to add sound or light actuation to
all the taps in their home to reduce
their water usage or they might want to
add heat actuation to a cushion so they
know when I loved ones logged in on
skype or they might want to embellish
their wallets like these MIT ones just
to reduce their outgoings every month
thirdly following on from volks box and
related projects I'm curious as to how
these opinion gathering systems and
visualization technologies can be
brought more into everyday environments
and closer to the public rather than
just events or an exhibition or museum
spaces so imagine if opinion boxes like
the Volks box became as familiar as ATMs
where people could easily enter how they
felt on a local issue and then in return
maybe see more about how others fail and
I'd love to put such technologies into
the hands of local groups or our civic
community groups to help them gather
opinions and maybe to also increase
engagement with local issues so these
pictures are of a local group in my area
where I live and they tirelessly campion
for increased resources and to protect
the heritage of Peckham and they're
constantly out in the street and they're
spreading the word and trying to
encourage engagement by getting people
to sign up
petitions and things and groups like
this could find these technologies
opinion gathering and visualization
technology is very useful to support
their own causes and perhaps a much more
distributed and less manually mediated
way and I think these ideas resume it
was a lot of the work here like the
Tennyson Road project where I see that
technologies for opinion gathering and
visualization physical visualization
have already been created like the post
revolt and the little bullfrog devices
and I think there are additional many
additional questions here so if we were
to deploy volks boxes on local street
corners who owns them how can local
groups appropriate them for their own
needs where does the data go how does it
get stored who owns it and how does it
get shared and who maintains these
devices and at the moment it's it's
still very much us as the researchers
who are coming in with the technology
and the design no hi and therefore we
still maintain control so how can we
sort of hand that control over more to
the communities well maybe the
technology doesn't always need to be
that complicated so it could be
something much more focused like the
post revolt system and here I see a lot
of potential prefer providing maybe a
toolkit with IOT capabilities that
communities could use to allow them to
create their own opinion gathering
systems and visualization systems and
designing and developing such a toolkit
it does create a lot of interesting
technical challenges related to like
adaptable physical interfaces and maybe
some of the previous work of the devices
and sensors group but what's interesting
is that many of these civic groups do
have a strong community champion they do
have orchestration structures and pro
own place and they have clear goals and
purpose so here perhaps the challenge is
really about exploring the accessibility
of the technologies for for more
non-technical people and finally then
what about the visualizations so can we
go beyond screens and investigate more
physical and more engaging ways to
visualize theater so this is the mill
road project that I'm sure you're
familiar west by Lisa Coleman and very
50 Cal Nikita and it did a really nice
job of using physical visualizations to
create lots of public engagement and
discussion around a local issue in a
very distributed and eye-catching way
and I was very interested also by the
physical visualizations from the
Tennyson Road project so I've started
working on a sin city to proposal for
you become 2015 West fiver and this time
instead of focusing on participatory
sensing we're going to be looking at
data visualization in urban spaces and
particularly this notion of co-creation
of physical data visualizations so we
plan to have another very hands-on day
and we'd like to provide a toolkit for
the for the participants of basic
building blocks with different
actuations that would allow you data to
be visualized using different mediums
like maybe water and smoke and bubbles
and movement etc and I'm interested to
see how creators are how the creations
might emerge in terms of how
participants link different data sets
with different mediums to physically
visualize them and how some of these
links might use metaphors to to make a
closer link between the data and the
visual the physical visualization so
that's my last slide and thanks very
much for listening and yeah happy to
take questions
we have time for a few questions thanks
for the talk it was a very interesting
I'm sort of interested in the philosophy
behind machines like box box which is a
fascinating machine but I'm sort of
perhaps seeing a bit of a gap in the in
the philosophy because you put a lot of
effort into designing the machine but
you don't really seem to be interested
in the data that comes from it so I'm
just wondering if you know are you
playing with these people who are coming
to your machine are you taking them
seriously no so yeah in the presentation
I focus very much more I didn't go into
detail in the data so a key reason one
of the key drivers behind coming up with
voxbox in the first place was because we
were talking to the fan park organizers
and they wanted to know more about how
they could improve the experience on the
day and we had ink at the same time been
thinking about more tangible ways to
encourage engagement and get feedback
and so all the data that we collected
from voxbox went back to them at the end
and they have been using it and
reflecting on it possibly to think about
how future events could be improved see
him with the the small talk project it
was a very collaborative effort between
us and fevered sleep the production
company so they had a lot of input into
the questions and the design of the
questions and how they were we also
worked with the child psychologist to
make sure that the way they were worded
was correct for the age of the children
and again all that data is going back to
them so they get funded based on how
they can show that their performances
have been experienced and appreciated by
the children that they're for so this is
a very crucial thing for them and we're
now writing reports with them and
collaborating on how they can show their
funders about you know the potential the
benefit of this latest interactive
performance that they did with census
again it's still running but it's going
to be all about the data with that one I
think yeah and that's what the Civic
workshop who are very
tested in the census questions yeah I
want to pick up on that a little bit you
could say and if you kill me you'll find
that i'm the personal say this sort of
thing but what you've described is his
theatre and you make me think of
augustine Brannigan's review of the
social psychology which he argues social
ecology in through the 50s and 60s right
they threw into the 90s was essentially
the business of using that the notion of
science to actually do theater and all
the theater did was articulate common
sense knowledge about social values and
things and hear what you've been doing
is I don't see any computer science here
what I see is theater and the theater is
becoming a pretext for making devices
and the question there for me is not
whether the theater is entertaining or
not because evidently theater is
entertaining one might feel like saying
that if you allowed and accept the fact
you doing theater you might work with
people like Steve Benford but one
consequence of theater is that theater
is essentially ephemeral and for me even
though I'm a sociologist I'm searching
for the computer science in what you're
doing yeah well I suppose um so yeah in
a way we are very much and trying to
create like theater does an experience
around the technology here so with rocks
box a big part of that was not just you
know taking a questionnaire and making
it physical but it was actually about
how you could improve the experience and
make it more engaging for the end user I
can see what you mean by a computer
science I feel there's a lot of
technical issues that so these devices
like voxbox they might look quite
simplistic on the outside and they might
look very you know they're very easy to
use but behind the scenes there's an
awful lot of technical questions that
need to be answered questions you know
so all of these devices are IOT pretty
much because they're all connected to
the Internet and they're all feeding
back to like back-end databases and
servers and things like that and I
suppose yeah it's maybe not answering
any specific like hard computer science
questions but I would see there's a sort
of taking the technical know-how from
computer science and
vining it with like HCI and more user
experience questions and that's that's
basically I think that's where it fits
other questions um hi I really
appreciated the fact that you have this
manifesto it was about empowering users
with their data but then I was thinking
about the examples that you gave the box
box and these other devices and actually
you know you sort of mention that the
purpose of these devices or to collect
data from people and then give them to
the organizers of the event yeah and it
makes me think that they're more like
honey traps really like particularly
sweet and you charge to Tran and entice
people and answer to lure them in today
so how do you reconcile yeah you're
certain I think that's definitely where
I go in my previous slide one to the end
where I'm talking more about you know I
appreciate that we are still in control
we are the researchers who bring this
technology and we use it but at the
minute we're exploring how this
technology is used or how it could be
useful and now I think one of the
biggest challenges is how we can make
platforms or tool kits that are so much
more accessible that they're not just
being you know like they're not just for
us as researchers to use they could be
opened up maybe more to the maker
community maybe more to like civic
action groups so and there are lots of
different issues there at lots of
different levels so technical issues
there's all these like sort of policy
and governance issues about data and
about the device itself how's it all and
Jose appropriated and high as the data
stored and shared and I think there
again I mean some of the previous work
on like digital possessions also comes
into play so these are like community
digital possessions and where do they go
and hire they stored and shared I think
it's best question
thanks very much fascinating talk and I
was interested in your voxbox that you
had these mechanical sliders and which
are obviously quite engaging and
attractive to people compared for
example to touch screen where you could
with your finger slide something like on
a smartphone and I just wanted I mean
are those sort of retro mechanical
devices more engaging and fun and
enjoyable than a touchscreen and if so
why are they do you have any thinking
about why the retro technology is more
engaging yeah and so yeah definitely I
mean you could have used screens to make
the Hall of voxbox I think so a lot of
research has shown that there is this
screen blindness and you could you could
try to incorporate that into physical
shapes to try to reduce it so like have
a sort of a curiosity object that draws
you and then you can interact with the
screen in terms of how they're better or
worse than tangibles it's I think it's
still really up for debate and I was at
tei just in January there was a lady
talking there from the exploratorium and
they did this very sort of specific
study on a tabletop device and in one
situation so the idea was that you could
use these little round portholes to move
around this table top and see more
detail underneath and in one case they
just use a digital one that you just you
know pull across like a big touchscreen
and another they use the tangible object
and it was a really interesting talk she
said that in all the areas that they
tried to find a difference they didn't
find any difference actually for this
specific application but saying that
there does I think we still need to
fight figure out how to pull out the
nuanced differences intangibles and
screens because there does seem to be
some serious differences but it's it's
hard to extract that in a more
quantitative way and so people did there
were lots of sort of nostalgic
expressions about voxbox like it's like
the TARDIS or it's like a willy wonka
machine or it's like some big fair
growing machine and you could there was
a lot of people talked about the ink
credible machine which was something
they had played with whenever they were
children and it really did evoke all
these emotions and i think is really
trying to figure out how we extract that
and make it more sort of and something
we can we can show in a more
quantitative away maybe okay great
