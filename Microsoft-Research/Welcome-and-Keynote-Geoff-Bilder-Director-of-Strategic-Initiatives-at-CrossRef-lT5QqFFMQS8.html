hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
good morning everybody welcome to
Microsoft Research affectionately known
here as the New England research and
development center or nerd my name is
Alex Wade I'm based at the main
microsoft campus back in redmond
washington this is one of about a half a
dozen Mike's up research locations that
we have worldwide and thanks everybody
for coming and joining us today thanks
to the people who are watching this
online we are live streaming this event
today we will also be recording the
event for view after the fact if you
want to do that the main thing I'd like
to do today is really thank my
co-conspirators in organizing this
digital science Amy and Caitlin also
stand up where's Chris and Margie and
Patsy and and also the panel chairs that
you'll you'll get to meet throughout the
day that it takes a village to put
together an event like this and I really
appreciate all the work that went into
it so on the logistic side of things
very quickly the restrooms of people
didn't see them when they came in as you
got off the elevator and came into the
reception area they're off to the right
just past that coat closet there should
you need that the Wi-Fi code information
is on the top of page one of the agenda
the hashtag is also on the front of the
agenda here so please tweet freely
throughout the day I will also try and
monitor the Twitter feed so those of you
who are watching online and have really
really important pressing questions feel
free to direct messaged me my handle is
Alex Wade or tweet them publicly and
we'll try and relay those to the
speakers in the room I think that's all
I had I want to pass the mic here to a
me to introduce our first speaker for
the day let me just add my welcome on
behalf of digital science to everybody
here in the room and everybody attending
virtually we're just so pleased to have
you all here and in many ways this is a
reprise of a meeting that was held here
at Microsoft three years ago on
transforming scholarly communication and
several people that were involved in
that meeting are here Alyssa Goodman
Harvard had been the the main brain
behind pulling that meeting together and
like that meeting this meeting is
focused on showcasing the best new
technologies for use in scholarly
research and the communication there of
our hope for the day is that this be a
really fun informal discursive day we
have a lot of rapid-fire presentations
but we also have a lot of time for
networking and discussion and I'm really
delighted to have as our keynote speaker
Jeff builder jeff has been director of
strategic initiatives at crossref since
2006 and I had the pleasure of working
with him there and then before that at
in genta Jeff is is a force of nature he
is known among other things for being a
black belt in PowerPoint karaoke but
whether he is ad-libbing or presenting a
plan he's his passion for our field
always shows through and he never fails
to impress and today is going to talk to
us about why our cyber infrastructure is
so bad or to use his word White's oh
crap and what we can do in terms of
governance of cyber infrastructure
development operations to change that
direction so over to you Jeff first of
all thank you for inviting me here and
that whole thing about the PowerPoint
karaoke the deep dark secret is that
every presentation i give this
powerpoint karaoke unusually just as
surprised as anybody else by whatever
the next slide is it comes up hence my
poor the expertise in it um okay so I'll
start again now um so when uh when Alex
asked me to give this presentation he
said he invited me to give this talk
he encountered a and you know we just
met each other in DC at a meeting and a
few days later he sent me this things
that could you speak at this and I did
my usual trick I said absolutely said
great send me a title so I sent him the
most open-ended title I could think of
in order for me to be able to then
decide much much later what I'd actually
talked about and I never really expected
them then to pursue me with an Absa the
request for an abstract but they did and
they were quite insistent about this and
eventually they actually got me at the
end i was particularly grumpy mood that
day and hence the abstract that you have
before me the good news is that i've
been grumpy ever since on this
particular topic and so i decided to
actually stick to the talk and so we're
going to talk about i also by the way
expected them to edit out the word crap
but so i'm going to talk a little bit
about scholarly cyber infrastructure and
and one of the things that you should
know about me is that I work for
crossref and if you know what crossref
is congratulations and if you don't know
what crossref is that's probably pretty
good because it means that what we're
doing at least isn't annoying you it's
in the background um but in addition to
working at crossref I've recently well
relatively recently was very involved
with the orchid initiative and so a lot
of the things that I'm talking about
here actually come from the work that
I've been doing working on
infrastructure projects both crossref
and orchid and in talking to various
other people who have been working on
infrastructure projects and comparing
notes and in particular one of the
things that I'd like to do is make sure
that people understand that a lot of
what we're talking about here our ideas
that I've formulated with camera nailin
and jennifer Lynn from PLoS over the
past few years every time we meet we
talk about the state of scholarly
infrastructure the problems with fun
funding infrastructure projects and so a
lot of the things that we're coming that
I'm talking about here are actually
ideas that I developed in tandem with
them so this is cameron Ailin and
jennifer lynn and a reach
since writing retreat that we held in
which we were working out some of these
ideas so let's talk about infrastructure
infra I think the group means below or
under but basically we're talking about
the basic organism physical plant in the
in the in meatspace we're talking about
things like roads tracks all the stuff
that enables us to actually build a
civilization on top of it to build
cities to build communities to build to
build civilization and when we talk
about cyber infrastructure independently
I don't know I think this is probably a
dated phrase I know it was very popular
for a little bit of time I'm not sure
it's as popular now but it's still
useful because it does something it
talks about the relationship between
exactly well it talks about exactly what
we're trying to do and I think that
there are some interesting things that
you see in this description of a
distributed side of a sort of a cyber
infrastructure and one of the key
phrases in here is that it talks about
fundamental processes and tools things
like data acquisition data storage data
management but it talks about how in the
case of cyber infrastructure these
things are supposed to transcend
individual institution and I'll get on
to that definition a little while
because I don't think it goes far enough
but that is an interesting starting
place it talks about how these kind this
kind of infrastructure electronic
infrastructure should transcend
institutions so why am I talking about
infrastructure at a conference called
shake it up and that features cocktails
as its theme um well one of the reasons
is that I routinely get asked to give
talks about the future of this in the
future of that scholarly communication
science tool kits you name it and one of
my experiences has been that inevitably
these conferences tend to start
descending into the mundane we come in
with the idea that we're going to talk
about how we're going to get rid of
yes we're going to create a new dynamic
workflow where everybody is not locked
into this bizarre facsimile of paper
that we've been stuck with for so long
we talked about collaborative tools
collaborative editing about social
networks about all of these fantastic
things about integrating with data about
integrating with lab equipment and then
inevitably somebody comes up with a
statement like but I don't know where to
upload things and how do i get an
identifier or something inevitably
almost always these conferences start
descending into the mundane they start
talking about the fact that they can't
actually just do simple things like
store the stuff that they want to be
able to make available for long periods
of time to allow people to identify it
to cite it and this is a you know a
source of considerable frustration and I
think one of the problems that we have
is that I think that there is a
reluctance to address infrastructure as
a first class problem in our industry
that is in I mean and there are a number
of reasons for this the first of which
is that fundamentally infrastructure is
boring right I mean infrastructure if
it's working tends to be invisible the
only time that it's at all interesting
is when it's broken and not functioning
right when the lights go off when you
are trying to plug in your adapter and
you're in a foreign country and you
realize that the adapters are
incompatible when a DOI breaks when you
try and go and retrieve a data set and
you're not allowed to or you can't find
it or something like that that's when we
notice infrastructure the same thing
happens with you don't generally sit
there I'm on a highway i'm on a highway
i'm on a highway when the highways got
pot holes in it when it's falling down
when it's falling apart then you notice
that you're on a highway and you wonder
what on earth happened here so one of
the problems with infrastructure is that
if it's working you don't tend to notice
it it's not particularly sexy to fund
things that people don't notice um
another problem with infrastructure I
think is that its associated very much
with huge bureaucracy
the idea is that if you have
infrastructure you're going to have some
gigantic behemoth bureaucracy that's
unresponsive to you that to end-users
and that and that and that you know you
can't figure out why they do the things
that they do and so there's a sort of a
general built-in hostility to the notion
of creating these bureaucracies to
administer something that ultimately if
it works is invisible you've got a whole
bunch of things working against you and
one of the patterns that I see is that
when we talk about infrastructure
particularly when we're dealing with
funders there's a classic anti pattern
that we see play out time and time again
a funder will invite the best and the
brightest in a particular field to talk
about the future of scholarly
communication talk about how you're
going to advance scholarly publishing or
scholarly you know data citation you
name it we we have these things all the
time I get invited to one a month at
least and what happens is something
almost entirely predictable the funder
has invited people top researchers in
their profession and they start talking
about about projects and they and and in
the case of a lot of these things they
say oh and by the way we need
infrastructure and then something
interesting happens all right because
mind you you've got researchers
researchers by and large are interested
in pushing things forward they're
interested in the cutting edge they're
interested in in the in the in the
things that we're not even thinking
about generally temper mentally the last
thing on earth they ever want to think
about is infrastructure it's boring it's
dull but one of the things that happens
is a certain pattern kicks in and that
pattern is a simple one if you've got a
funder and the funder is saying we're
going to put money into a
and you've got a researcher and they're
studying be what do you think happens in
that situation what does any reasonable
researcher do in that situation they
triangulate they try and figure out how
it is that their research interests
intersects with this other in research
interests and then they propose projects
that basically propose that they will
address a through be in some way and you
see this with infrastructure all the
time you'll see people say as we did
recently at a big conference in DC say
fantastic there's a lot of money out
there to fund infrastructure I have this
fantastic project that's looking at at
phenotype genotype relationships and um
and if you fund this a byproduct of that
funding will be that will create an
identifier system and storage system for
actually tracking this stuff and
allowing to cite it and allow you to
include it in papers now how many
research projects have you seen that
have actually produced infrastructure as
a by-product that is n go not gone off
to live there are probably one or two
exceptions you can think of some of the
big gene banks and stuff like that that
have come out that have been funded
separately but by and large asst almost
never works what happens as the
researchers develop some software some
concept they put it up on a server and
when the grant runs out the server goes
down the data goes down with it and the
so-called infrastructure that they built
disappears now imagine for a second that
we funded physical infrastructure this
way your grant runs out your lights go
out your water gets cut off you're stuck
there without any of these things that
you depend on this isn't a way to run
infrastructure it's actually getting a
little bit worse because now people are
saying that one of the solutions to our
infrastructure problems is to use the
cloud now in the past if you didn't pay
your electric bill
they come and their turn off your power
and if you pay them they turn it back on
when you start using the cloud it would
be the equivalent of not paying your
bill them coming turning off your
electricity and ripping out the wiring
at least in the past you had a hope you
had a hard drive stuck in a closet
something that you might be able to
revive now we're actually putting our
faith and infrastructure into something
even more ephemeral something that
disappears or 10 disappear even more
quickly if funding runs out so this
pattern that we've already seen of
trying to fund infrastructure with
through grants for fundamental research
and then being surprised that it doesn't
work seems to me that this could
actually get a lot worse in case you're
wondering this is a salad and it's time
for me to dress a little bit because one
of the other things that happens in our
industry is what I call the the you know
salad or honey roast syndrome there are
a few words and I just noticed this
really when I moved away from the US and
I come back and I realized that there
are some words in the food industry that
people will use to make the most
unhealthy thing on earth sound
appetizing salad you can get roast beef
salad you can get taco salad you can get
potato salad you can get and many of you
will have this probably no doubt later
this week marshmallow salad basically
they try and make things that are awful
for you sound healthy and conversely
there's this perverse other trick that
happens which is that they'll use
phrases like honey roast to try and
describe something that is actually
helpful healthy for you and make it
sound appetizing so you'll find honey
roast salmon all I kid you not if you go
to Whole Foods and you look at their
whole wheat pita breads they are
flavored with molasses so we've got
these two things and the technical world
has almost the identical thing if
you use words like open distributed a
lightweight framework and you throw them
at anything you can almost make it sound
reasonable try it I'm going to create a
lightweight open distributed framework
for DRM the worst bloody thing on earth
but you can make it sound vaguely
reasonable by throwing those keywords at
it and the truth is a lot of those words
of fact they don't really mean things
their code words for saying we lack
trust in our ability to judge things and
therefore we're deferring a lot of
complicated decision by saying well
distribute it or it's a framework we're
not going to nail you get them to an
actual API or god forbid an application
we're going to create a framework you
know we don't trust each other to run
this thing and we certainly don't trust
a central authority to run this thing so
we'll make it distributed and this
doesn't really work here's another
challenge for you it's the coin this
rule while distributed to get
centralized I cannot name a fundamental
internet communication mechanism
distributed that was not distributed and
then centralized in order to make it
usable including the web itself the web
would be virtually useless if we didn't
have google and if Google wasn't there
it would be somebody else so every time
we try and pull this little trick of
saying okay we'll distribute it and
funders love hearing this they're like
you know the researchers go okay well
we're going to have this fundament astok
research project and we're going to
create this little bit of infrastructure
and rather than held us to actually
creating an organization and something
to run this for some time we put we say
it's going to be distributed and that's
going to solve our problem and so often
it doesn't now this is the salad
digression a lot of times what you hear
is people trying to punch difficult
decisions about infrastructure
by using you know technical jargon by
trying to pretend that a lot of the
difficult decisions about running an
infrastructure can be deferred or that
they can be washed away simply by saying
it's someone else's problem we're going
to let lots of other people running and
the danger here the danger here is if
you don't acknowledge from the start
that it is very likely that if you
distribute something somebody else is
going to come and centralize it then
you're basically ignoring a very
dangerous reality which is that the
whole thing can be co-opted and enclosed
and so that all of the progress that
people are making in opening up content
in opening up data could ultimately be
reversed by then in closing the very
infrastructure that we use to gain
access to this data and to this content
and of course if anybody recognize these
we've got several plugs
european-american and i forget what this
one is i think it's actually a washing
machine plug the other issue is that of
course when we talk about a lot of this
distributed stuff what happens is that
it's distributed at a minimal way it
requires tons of shims tons of adapters
in order to actually get the stuff to
work with each other and this is one of
the other problems that we have with
distributed effectively when people are
using a lot of these terms when they're
using terms like distributed and
framework and lightweight and oh yes
before I forget a new one that I keep
encountering is fabric fabric have you
heard this in the technical world oh
please don't use it it's just appalling
basically it just means tightly
interconnected as far as I can tell
these are all trust issues basically
what people are saying when they say
this is we don't trust somebody else to
run the technology we don't trust
central organizations we're not sure
that we know what we're doing and
therefore we want too late buying these
decisions by making it into a framework
instead of an application and so a lot
of these things I think deep down are
actually about trust
now trust was something to get back to
the topic at hand that we encountered
big problems with when we were starting
up orchid orchid actually started as a
crossref project when I first joined
crossref about 20 days later Amy had
arranged a meeting I think it was at PSP
in February to talk about what at the
time were called author do is the idea
was can we assign identifies two authors
to deal with the disambiguation problem
that people are having with author names
in the scholarly literature and this
project started and one of the first
things that I did was I started going
out and interviewing various
stakeholders publishers obviously
because there are main members but also
librarians and researchers and funders
and other kinds of you know third
parties to talk about what it would take
to actually build this infrastructure
for dealing with scott with identifiers
for authors and at the time one of the
things that we learned was that the
things that were required were at the
time things that crossref couldn't
provide and one of them was trust and
the simple reason was a crossref was
managed by publishers and a lot of the
stakeholders a lot of the people who
would have been important to buy into
this system we're already concerned that
crossref was running a system that
identified content and that they didn't
have any say in that system and they
were certainly very concerned that
something is fundamental as authors was
similarly managed so the message that we
got back was yes this is a fantastic
idea but whatever organization that you
develop or whatever system runs us it's
got to be trustworthy it's got to be
something that represents all the
stakeholders in a way that's transparent
principle that we understand and this is
where we are
so we started thinking about okay given
that there's this you know unbelievable
pressure to reject centralized systems
or infrastructure and most of these are
probably based on mistrust of said
centralized system is there anything
that we can do to address the concerns
about infrastructure and particularly
centralized infrastructure that might
help us move forward and so we came up
with the ten principles that are
currently orchids principles and I think
that these principles and I think that
other people who are involved with
orchid at the time uh we're hugely
important in garnering trust of the
community and getting people to invest
in this fundamental infrastructure for
the community so it was at this stage
when we when we formed these principles
after that occasionally I would meet
with as I said Cameron or Jennifer and
we talked about those principles we
talked about why other people weren't
doing similar things and why we couldn't
build an infrastructure that wasn't
quite so specific that only dealt with
author identifier but also an
infrastructure the dealt with some of
the other fundamental problems we had
and we were still encountering sort of
resistance you know about this notion
that oh gosh but if we did that you know
how would you govern it how would it be
how would you run it it would be a huge
bureaucracy would turn sclerotic and so
we came up with what we think because we
think that the orchid principles are
very good but we decided to document
some of the other concerns that were
raised as we started talking to people
about these issues and so what I'd like
to do is talk about some principles that
we could use if we were to found fund
found and fund an organization that
managed fundamental scholarly cyber
infrastructure because I think that if
we actually created one of these
organizations if we were able to do it
we might actually be able to solve a lot
of the problems that plague us when we
talked about trying to advance scholarly
communication over the next several
decades so the first one is coverage and
this is
basically straight out of the out of the
orchid principles research transcends
discipline the research infrastructure
should transcend disciplines geographies
institutions and stakeholders okay that
is it makes no sense and this type ins
time and time again I go to a meeting of
chemists and they talk about the fact
that they need mechanisms for
identifying and citing chemical
structures and that this is a
fundamentally different thing from the
biologists who are talking about how
they want to be able to identify insight
proteins and and other research objects
in the literature every one of these
things starts off with the assumption
that that discipline seems to have a
unique problem and that if they solve
for the discipline then everything is
all right but then what happens if
you're doing any cross-disciplinary
research it falls apart and so one of
the things that we have to do is get
beyond this discipline site silo
fixation that we have geography
geography is the other bugbear because
so many funders our national you
inevitably have somebody come up and say
we will create a gigantic database of
the biomedical literature for the United
States and then what happens is that you
have to clone this thing in Europe to
create the exact of virtually the exact
same thing um with some other you know
of knobs and add-ons and things like
that ultimately you do that because and
again this is the fundamental issue if
you dig deep down inside the issue is
that the UK and Europe think wow this is
a really important resource but we can't
trust another government to run this on
our behalf we have to have some sort of
say in this too we have to have a copy
of it and that's the solution that they
use so transcending geography is vital
research transcends geography all the
time institutions we have the
institutional repositories out there
which in my mind are a classic example
of the centralized of the baguette of
decentralized baguettes centralized
where some of the
only you know effective search engines
if you look beyond Google and Google
Scholar are things like oai stir and
what is it open door or something like
that one of which is based on Google
anyway and the other witches OCLC right
so we have to also think beyond
institutions and then stakeholders the
number of times you sit there and we go
we're going to build an identifier
that's going to be useful to publishers
and you think well actually this is
going to be useful to funders as well
and it's going to be useful to
researchers and it's going to be useful
the institutions we have this repeated
thing that we create these little silos
infrastructure has to transcend these if
that's going to be truly useful cyber
infrastructure governance now these
things seem obvious and they beg lots of
questions first of all it should be
stakeholder govern and this seems you
know clear if you have an organization
that is simply run by libraries then the
publishers are probably not going to
participate with huge willingness and if
you've got one that's run completely by
publishers and librarians and
researchers and funders are not going to
you know participate with full
confidence so one of the things we have
to do is actually try and get something
that represents the varied stakeholders
in the infrastructure and find out and
and allow them to govern the system and
in order to do this quite frankly
because you can't predict who the
stakeholders are you should have a
policy of non-discriminatory membership
that basically if someone's interested
enough that by definition makes a
mistake holder and that somehow you have
to accommodate them in your governance
structure transparent operations within
the confines of privacy law one of the
big fears that you have with any
organization is that it starts working
for itself that it starts trying to
perpetuate itself that it loses track of
what's going on and that it is basically
plotting in the background so without
transparent operations you're never
going to gain trust in the organization
and trust that the organization is doing
what people want it to do now this is a
controversial one cannot lobby and again
the reason for this principle is that
lots of people fear organizations just
trying to keep themselves a lot and
rightfully so lots of organizations just
seem to self perpetuate even when
they've gone beyond their immediate
utility and one of the ways in which
they do this is they might go in lobby
to change laws to make sure that they
still are necessary now we're not saying
that the membership can't go out and
lobby if their constituency cares as
much much about that infrastructure as
they should then the membership should
go out lobby not nessa itself the
membership should be driving an
environment that enables that
infrastructure to work not the
organization itself a living will if
you're talking about infrastructure you
need to know what happens if all things
go wrong what happens to the data what
happens to the infrastructure who does
it get passed too how is that documented
how is it going to be enabled living
will is an essential part of gathering
trust in any kind of infrastructure and
this last one this is a very
controversial one but again it goes to
this concept that so many people are
worried about organizations just
becoming unresponsive and existing to
keep themselves going now a
mission-driven organization there's a
funny thing about it it might be able to
fulfill its mission isn't that a concept
now how many organizations do you know
that have gone off and just fulfilled a
mission and then have not gone right off
and traded another one or two find a
mission so broad that they can never
fulfill it and therefore they
effectively you know guarantee their
their their permanence so one of the
worries is is there a mechanism that we
can actually use to actually to
encourage this organization to solve the
problem even if it means disbanding
itself in the process sustainability you
have to be concerned that the thing is
going to be there in the long run and
this gets back to the funding cycles and
you know you don't want to fund
on a grant cycle time limited funds are
used only for time limited activities
there have to be other revenue streams
that are more predictable it could be an
endowment it could be services that you
charge for we're you know completely
open about that but time limited funds
are not something that you should use it
you can use time limited funds for extra
stuff but not for the fundamental
operations of the of the system the goal
should be to generate a surplus and this
again is a controversial thing the
number of times that you see people
building infrastructures in our industry
and saying it's sustainable which means
it's breakeven that means it's barely
hanging on this is an incredibly fragile
position to be it it means that if the
if the environment changes if new
technologies come out you don't have the
wherewithal to respond if you don't
generate a surplice your brittle a
healthy organization one that's thriving
as opposed to just sustaining itself
needs to actually generate a surplus and
one of the first things they need to do
with that surplus is create a
contingency fund and that contingency
fund should allow them to operate for at
least a year and again this is to deal
with the inevitable changes in the
environment changes in technology and
when these things occur that's the
hardest time to try and go out and get
grants and to get extra money in order
to whether these these systems so having
some sort of responsible contingency
fund will help to build trust in the
permanence and in the sustainability of
an organization this one is a big one
and this is something that we learned at
crossref back when amy was there and
that is it revenue based on services not
on data okay so one of the things that
we often see is that we're building new
infrastructures to handle open content
and and to handle open data now the last
thing we want to do is be in a position
where the way
that we make money is by enclosing that
very data again so we want to make sure
that again metadata and data unda mental
to the research endeavor is actually
remains open which basically means that
the organizations that are running these
services and these infrastructures need
to raise their money off of services and
not the data itself revenue generation
should be consistent with the mission
and again this sounds a little bit
bizarre but when crossref was founded
all right and remember our mission is to
enable people to link in sight the
literature one of the business models
that existed was that we charged
publishers to look up references and
resolve them to do AI which worked
almost exactly against our mission and
so for the first few years of crossref
and amy was there and she can tell you
about it growth was flatlining and it
was a hugely hugely important debate in
the board when they actually changed
that business rule to lift that charge
and then all of the sudden the entire
organization took off and started to
hockey stick if you actually start to
try and raise revenue on things that
actually go against your mission you're
going to be in big trouble and finally
and I am wrapping up insurance because
inevitably again when I outline all of
the first principles people are still a
bit queasy people still think wow do we
really want to have an organization you
know one central organization in charge
of infrastructure that's so important to
so many in so many different countries
and so many different disciplines
institutions and so on and this is one
thing that I think orchid really got
right and it got it from the open source
movement and that is that they have the
ultimate insurance and that ultimate
insurance is portability now for those
of you who have worked an open source
you'll know that in theory anybody could
download the source code for a major
project like
like you know Apache or OpenOffice and
they could just create their own version
of it but there are such big sort of
penalties to doing that because suddenly
you lose a momentum of the other
developers who were working with you of
the other of the entire community that
working a major project is actually a
fairly rare event still sometimes it's
necessary as is the case with openoffice
as has been the case with some other you
know major open source projects and so
making sure that the fundamental
infrastructure is run on open source
that the data the fundamental data in
this is actually open data within
constraints of privacy laws that the
data is available in a practical way
that is that you at least create dumps
of it periodically these things in the
orchid case are the insurance policy
that say look if all else fails if
somehow even with all the checks and
balances we put into place we turn evil
you can take the code the data and you
can go and start up your own system and
if you can bring the community with you
you will win this is a fundamental
insurance policy the only other
principle that I think we would add to
this is a patent non assertion principle
because in still in theory somebody
could actually release the code and
release the data and still tie it up and
make it unusable because of patent so a
patent on assertion would be a critical
addition to that but this concept of
fork ability we see as the ultimate
insurance we don't want obviously this
to happen but this is the thing that
holds the organization to you know
responsible to meet the needs of its
stakeholders because ultimately they
know if they don't meet the needs of the
stakeholders if the stakeholders get
upset enough they can actually take the
whole thing and they can create new
organization to fill the Mandate of the
stakeholders and
the unresponsive organization run yet so
coverage governance sustainability and
insurance these are the biggies and they
represent a huge gap now it's
interesting to sit around and think
about some of the organizations that
meet some or a few of these principles
there are you know obvious ones that you
might think of like cern or wikimedia or
Duras base or you know if the cut they
meet some of them they don't meet all of
them and maybe it is an aspirational set
of principle but if I were a funder and
if I saw time and time again that the
major projects that I was funding that
you know depended on there being
infrastructure in order to make them
persistent to make them permanent to
allow other projects to build on them if
I saw infrastructure failing time and
time again I as a funder would be trying
to work with other funders to figure out
how we build an organization that meets
these needs and they can actually
provide the infrastructure services upon
which so many interesting new
boundary-pushing research projects
depend now the Maslow's hierarchy of
needs is kind of a but ultimately we
really cannot yet to some of these other
things until we have this straight and
we don't have this straight we have bits
and pieces of it we have gaps but we
need to build a stone foundation the
infra the underlying part and finally
I'm going to close with this in the
large tract i use the term Quonset hut
and my english colleagues said what the
hell is that and for those of you who
don't know a Quonset hut is a temporary
shelter they were particularly popular
in World War two as temporary shelters
during World War Two and this is
basically a glorified parts at HUD
anybody know what it is this is building
21 the famous building 20 of MIT this
was a temporary structure put up during
World War Two to house some major
research projects research on radiation
more importantly the tech Model Railroad
Club but some of the most interesting
research projects ever came out of this
sort of dilapidated Shack that was put
up and it was only torn down in
something like making it 98 or something
like that it lasted way longer as a as a
but it was an infrastructure it was the
seed for many many research projects but
today you can see people making promises
will put up a Quonset hut and as a
by-product you're going to get an
electrical grid you're going to get
infrastructure that hasn't worked this
produced many many many research
projects many you know breakthroughs but
as far as i know the infrastructure it
produced was perdido piano was
negligible so effectively what i'm
trying to say we said we've got to stop
this process we've actually got to stop
asking researchers how to fund
infrastructure they have very little
affinity with the process with the
responsibilities with the requirements
of infrastructure funders institution
publishers all stakeholders need to
seriously think about getting people who
actually are good at running
infrastructure to think about these
problems and they have to get over the
fear of funding infrastructure as a
separate line item as something
independent of independent of research
projects and if we can do that and I am
optimistic then conferences like these
where we're trying to shake it up we're
we're trying to think about the future
of publishing will be able to actually
move forward instead of getting bogged
down in the day-to-day routine tasks
that seem to stymie us all whenever we
try and advance scholarly communication
and those issues almost always have
to do with infrastructure thank you very
much and again I'd like to thank Cameron
aylen jennifer Lynn are their input on
this couple questions if anybody has
them and I'll give you something to chew
on while I take the microphone over here
which is you youth are there areas of
the maybe the insurance policy that you
may be right that you see organ knock
knock I argument time when we brought up
the issue of patent rights was that we
have no patent which you know it seemed
a bit odd um i'm not i mean you know i
think that this it would be fantastic i
think any organization that meets some
of these principles should be aiming to
meet more of them and i'm the first to
say that you know I you know same thing
with crossref crossref doesn't meet all
of these principles Cameron will point
out that plus does not meet all of these
principles um orca doesn't either and
but you know these are these are things
to aspire to I think that the more that
they adopt the more trustworthy the more
faith people have in the system so you
know by all means I mean the big issue
with orchid is that I think that it's
you know vaguely shameful that funders
and institutions haven't invested more
in the organization because it does
represent something you know that
they've been trying to do for ages and
there it is it's out there it's ready
and and all it requires is a bit more of
a kick and it will it will really help
to transform scholarship by the way I'm
not affiliated with orchid anymore
oh I had a question you said um that
they should have incentives to wind down
yeah but how do you have a sustainable
organization that sustains
infrastructure if it winds down well I
mean the this gets back to the idea that
if you're a mission-driven organization
presumably you might be able to fulfill
your mission so the idea would be if you
could make yourself unnecessary you
should wind down now it's interesting I
mean you know a commercial organization
as a perpetual sort of responsibility to
try and make returns or its investors
and so on and so forth a mission-driven
organization right um doesn't have that
kind of requirement I but if the mission
is to sustain something essentially
forever how does that ever lie down what
if i came up with a with a way of not
needing dia wash that would be a
fantastic advance it would be wonderful
for the entire scholar ecosystem it
would say publishers a lot of money um
and it would be a good thing so the
issue is you know there could possibly
be ways to actually make yourself
unnecessary or less necessary and I just
don't think that organizations are in
fact incentivized to explore these to
look them they you know they like any
organization or the organisms they tend
to try and grow yep Eric you get ur so I
would argue that the most successful way
to to build Internet infrastructure is
not the Builder model but rather the
Google model but I can see where the
Builder model is also useful in certain
situations the question is which kinds
of infrastructure our best attacked with
a Google model and which kinds of
problems are attacked best with a
builder model so absolutely don't get me
wrong the Google model manifestly
succeeds the commercial model time and
time again
succeeds sometimes I think to our
detriment and by our detriment I mean
this you know the people stakeholders
and scholarly communication if we have
an organization that fundamentally
controls so much important data that
researchers are used and it's utterly
opaque and has no stakeholder governance
and and could be cut you know basically
cut in a budget swipe you know tomorrow
this should be of concern to us so I'm
not arguing that the builder model is
easier it's much harder but I'm arguing
that the other models that exist leave
us vulnerable and leave us in a
situation where we you know open data
we've opened publications and suddenly
all of the mechanisms that we need in
order to access them and use them
effectively are enclosed behind our back
hey I think without another round of
applause for each year microsoft
research helps hundreds of influential
speakers from around the world including
leading scientists renowned experts in
