Excel for research power bi and the
cloud Kenji you now have the floor hello
everyone and thank you for joining us
for one of our windows agile for
research webinars we're really delighted
to have jeff zhang here to talk about
excel and particularly some of the new
features in power bi which is really the
great tool for dealing with data and
visualizing an understanding your data
so we're really really happy that Jeff
is joining us to take you through that
our windows agile for research program
is a global program where we're working
with the research community to help help
them understand get on board and really
make use of cloud computing for their
work so we have a website actual for
research calm and you can follow us on
Twitter on at Asheville for research and
also for the power be
I team at Microsoft bi is the Twitter
account for that so with that I'd like
to hand over to Jeff who's going to talk
a bit about XL and power bi and then do
some great live demos and then I shall
catch up with everyone at the end so
thanks very much and over to you Jeff
okay thank you Kenji hello everyone this
is jeff john I'm a program manager from
Microsoft Excel t today I'm going to
show you the power of Excel power bi
walk you through a couple of scenarios
of using cell power bi to process and
visualize the research data and get
quicker data insights in a more
intuitive manner hopefully after this 40
minutes demo you can help you to see the
potential of the cell power bi and
probably help you to start making use of
it in your daily research work so I'm
not a researcher I'm just an engineer
but here is a diagram that one
researcher from Microsoft Research in
grandma here told me that doing research
because a lot of the interaction force
power to get insights from complex multi
source data or through different or
combined perspectives the more data you
have the better you can develop ideas or
insights collaborate in real world
there's a dilemma that the more volume
or complex data you got the more time it
takes you to process it and make it even
usable so the majority of your time from
what I heard it's about eighty percent
or consumed by working on the tedious
they'd have discovery creaming or
formatting job you can help me if that
is the case in your daily work what we
really want is to use the tool that you
are probably already familiar with to
greatly shorten the time of data
pre-processing and quickly generate
meaningful in the interactive visuals
help you can quicker data insights about
massive data you got and what you really
want is to save your time on shaping the
data only
your empower and put it down the real
research work we think the power bi
tools that we produced from Microsoft
can help you out so P I would not give
the presentation to some of the
conference in the research people they
don't quite know what is P I actually bi
stands for business intelligence
Microsoft have customer BI solutions for
over a decade for enterprises to digest
the sheer volume of data that's
increasing each day power bi is a reason
offering from Microsoft based on office
365 that empowers individual users to
interactively process and visualizing
the data in the data processing tool
that already familiar with which is
Excel so actually power bi is composed
by set of features and there are power
pivot which is a highly efficient in
memory engine compressing and the
indexing data in Excel and allows Excel
to handle millions rows of data and then
its power Curie which is a tool help you
to find connect you and compile data
from various resources and and then its
power view essentially Power View is
nine active dashboard help you to gather
data insights from combined perspectives
in the last one is power map which
allows you to put a special time series
in one view to generate geo base active
diagrams
okay that's enough talking let's put our
hands on some real data see how to make
use of these powerful tools so here on
this slide it's a set of streamflow data
from what Rogue River where is the rib
which is the river resizing the texas
united states so i got this data from a
professor from university of washington
who is doing the environmental study so
i believe he got his data from some
public website which recalls the
streamflow on different spots alongside
the quadrant believer in Texas as on
this line you see that these different
tables shows the raw data from the
devices and I'm not sure whether you see
similar data that your daily work
probably is even better format it that
ones that you got so I'm just take a
closer look at these data I want you to
take a moment you think so with the
tools of doing data processing that you
are using today probably also excel how
would you process this data and the
answers the questions like what's what
was happening on the guadalupe river in
terms of stream flow during a period of
time says that from june to october in
tucson 30 so i'll just give you the
seconds to think about it
so I see I'm not sure what kind of
solutions that you have mine already but
I see that a few challenges here first
you see that this on this sheet you see
that the name of the sensor the latitude
longitude which is the position
information and the stream flow is
putting the same column so if we want to
produce any visuals we probably won't
you move the latitude longitude into to
the column is that instead of the row
and also the name of the sensor as well
that's the first thing that we need to
do and the second thing take a closer to
the daytime you see the data here is the
raw data from the device I'm sure that
you promised see the similar data which
is something like data that's kind of
program in this way with the device was
installed however this kind of data
format which is a few attacks doesn't
mean anything the charging to Lakeisha
this is not normal or understandable
date time format that can be easily
understand by Excel need to do some
process on that at the last way that I
can see is that these time intervals
which is like every 15 minutes it's
something that we can have but the
non-naturally that we need to have this
grand energy so we may need to do some
recreational data so those are things
that are coming to my mind when I first
touch this data so I'm not sure how
would you realize that that we process
today how you utilize that the data
should be presented maybe it's a like
two dimensional line chart that
represents the stream flow of one sensor
or average stream flow across different
spots on the river on different time as
the axis so that could be a possibility
but another possibility which is
something that I produced using our
power bi is something like this
so I'm not sure whether you notice that
but here is a video that is essentially
putting a chart on our map so this
different spot represents different job
position of the sensors alongside the
guadalupe river and the height of each
column actually means the stream flow of
that moment when you place so i'll play
it again you can take a look again to
see what it is so i'll see that when i
play it the time actually is standing
over here indicates which day that is
the data we present at at the moment so
you see the animation and probably you
see a spike sometime in the middle which
is actually happening in October so this
actually tells not only that how the
streamflow holiday looks like on a
different part of the river map very
directly but also I'd act at the x axis
tells you that the different time across
the year how the stream flow changes the
spike that you see in October is
actually something happening only on
this response but not on upper streams
so there must be something happening
this area play that again notice when it
comes to october there's a spike
so once we see this kind of innovation
we started thinking further are beyond
the data we got like the spark i just
mentioned you ask yourself a question
why this is happening what happened over
in this area during that time frame as
you have presented same thing to some of
the researchers in the conference they
called aging you say they told me some
of them actually from that area texas
they told me that during october there
was a heavy rain last year young Tober
happening just in this part of the of
the state that's why the stream flow has
spiked only in these two spots but not
in upstream just the downstream so tell
me what if you're interested I feel it's
always very very fascinating grab the
data insights so this kind of visual way
so to generate something like like that
video we need to put everything as I
mentioned early that we need to put
everything into one table for example we
need to put the the name of the sensor
in one column and then the latitude
longitude and daytime and stream flow in
different columns Sims is very easy
right but from the raw data that we just
look at second ago it's actually not
that easy just to handle that so maybe
you think you can sink a lot of ways to
do that but it's not just easy you know
next time so how can we do that so let
me show you some live demo how to use
the power cure it
go back no more data so basically in
this book cuttest several spreadsheet in
each scratch it essentially is the data
that we got from the sensor and this is
a original data that I didn't process at
all so those represents two different
sensors allow that the river so to
handle that well we are used to call
power Curie you make use of that I just
make a table first you see that even
just for this one sensor is for most
data is like more than 12,000 groves
it's a lot of data
and then when i switch power theory
which is something that you will get
when you have power bi offerings
together with your office 365
subscription then you will have this
park yuri time so on Mercury tab you can
see that you can get data from different
places you can get data from the
existing book book and also some other
data operations now what we want to do
is just you put this data into power
Curie to the pre-processing creepy
spider to import data from the table
first and then go back to park theory
input is data power Curie and then you
see there's a separate window coming up
so this is separate window from excel
but looks similar in terms of the layout
of the one so this party is the cameras
shows the three data with the data you
just imported and this part is the
ribbon shows all the functions that you
can use to operate the data and on the
right hand side cutter it shows the
properties of the data set as well as
the steps that you can you can see that
when you perform the operations will
shows the different steps over here so
what I want to do here is that so I want
to do several things you remember i want
to put these in two columns I want to do
some data processing for this day time
column data and I also want to do some
aggregation first of all I I don't need
these several rows of data because I
want you Oh gasps the data into a calm
manner let's say that I want you just
remove them for a moment so it's very
easy I can just choose to remove top
rows and remove the first six rows
because this is six rows over here and
then just two clicks I have this pure
data of the data and Chris pounding
streamflow data that I got here so I
just double click to change the title to
be
a time and stream flow that's the first
step and you see it as a step over here
it shows that what I did and I can
navigate through the steps to repro what
I was doing see this is the original
data and do the first rule first columns
and then rename the column title so next
what I want to do is to there's a bad
and then what I want to do is to process
this data column so as a measure before
you see this day time it runs the date
and then with the tea and then time and
there's some members at the hotel
probably represents how much time it
takes to record the data so how can we
handle that first I think I need to
extract page from this text so what I
want to do is to slag his collar and
supply the column a some delimiter so um
/ Curia Lau's you to split column by
different two characters like column
call my equal sign and in this case I
want to speak common color use the
character because you see T is
essentially the separator between the
date and time so I'll type T here speed
from the left and then automatically the
generous to column for me why is the
column represents the date and the other
is the column represents the time but
the time itself doesn't really price
looks right because if you like go back
to the previous lab so it says that
power Curie intelligently change the
column part for me after I speed column
however the change of the
second column is incorrect because this
represents the like 12am is now 10
instead of 2pm so i think is because of
this messy stream format here what i
need to do is to river back and don't
let it change the time for me
automatically and if i want you further
process to extract the time without
without what I can do here tell me from
what I did just now yeah probably
already see that I can speed the column
again by using the character of dot
right you see the dot here which
separates the time and the time station
are collecting the data so i can use to
start but here i just want to show you
show you another power or another way of
doing it which is using the level of
characters because you see the time
always use the eight characters here i
can say that i used the eight number of
characters to separate the color from
left slack is gone
it by eight and you see this happen is
right because now it can crack it
understand this is 12 a.m. and this is
the time so this is something I may not
need to do the representation because
it's all the same all right so i can
just delete it and here you see the data
time so i mentioned earlier that we want
to do some aggregation for example when
I represent these four months data which
is like more than 12,000 rows of data I
may not need that granularity so I just
need a data average by day so what I can
do here is that i can say that group the
data by my daytime point 1 which is the
first column and i want to make a new
column called flow average and do the
operation of average out the streamflow
color so once i click ok you will see
that there's only two column left why is
the original day type column which is
sorted by date and the other is the
stream flow call which is a new column
that I creates the data by date see that
it's very convenient right before when I
want to do that I mean you try some like
algorithms in the using vba or use
complicated formulas in excel to do that
but now you see that to achieve this is
very easy i just need a cup of clicks
and then the progress is achieved so let
me report back say that I also represent
is to some of the graduate students they
asked my cousin says that hey sometimes
I don't want to see the data by date
because i was only see like in one day
was the average stream flow across
different hours so what I can do here is
to instead of goodbye day I can also
come by by time right instead of by the
first come back
but second column says that taken by the
time that are calculated atta and also
aggregate the second column and then you
achieve the same goal so I'll just save
that snap here I'll just save that step
here because you know essentially while
going to use these data okay so the next
thing that I only do is to add back to
columns that I mention earlier that we
want you added the latitude data and a
longitude data how can i do that i can
just simply insert a column and a pool
of the value as let's say name the empty
set of data as what room at counter
click OK
plus I I enter the street here I need to
add the string indicator and then it's
done you see that all the rows of this
new column or space by with the value we
just I just worked so i can change them
titled you name and I if I want you just
reorder it I can reorder it and do you
remember I still have the original
latitude and longitude data over here i
can say that i only insert another
column and put the latitude data which
is 29 and then okay and then at it at
latitude same way i minus
large
so the data looks much better now and do
is to click a prior close and this data
will be saved back q Excel you knew what
 and you remember that we used
to have more than 12,000 rolls now we
only have like 10 39 rose is because
we've already aggregated data by date so
when you slap the data that you just put
in here you see the right hand side pass
band coming up since that this is the
table that you just produced if you want
to do further added you say that i only
do aggregation or I want to do data
processing a combined data and time I
always go back and see the data over
here as well as the steps and they can
freely click back to replay the steps
that you just did okay that's that's the
step that I showed using power Curie to
form a twank a roll data and I can do
the same to the rest of the columns so
what I'm going to soon show you next is
that with this data what you need to do
is to combine the tables that you made
from white sheet up another right so for
example these are the first table that
we just made and then this is the second
one and essentially what we need is to
put all the data in one table so that we
can use this one table to produce some
of the graphics that we think could make
sense so when you do here you see when I
select the data here on the right hand
side has been the power Curie a
selection will be shown here and then
you can just continue to add a that
double click on continue at it and to
append one table after another I can
just simply click is a pet button and
select append the first table I've made
to the current
which is the second table click OK and
it's down and you don't see the data
change here because every time it only
shows one hundred rolls but if we click
apply and close go back to the original
spreadsheet and you will see that you
will see that we have the like two
different sensors data you one table
ready and you we had asked you the same
to the rest of the sensors data and just
like 20 minutes you get your data so
after we got a data how can we produce
that fancy visual and video so here's
the data so I just shorten the stabs due
to the time constraint but you can see
this is the final data after I combine
these seven different sensors data into
one table so another tool that I'm going
to use is called power map which is also
part of the offerings with Microsoft
power bi so happy you have that offering
installed with your office 365 then in
the Excel the insert tab you will see a
map button over here so with the data
that you have a new spreadsheet you just
need to simply click that is map button
and then into a prenup power map and
this is the tool it's called to go which
is the visual the interactive visual
that I just show you you sulo video so
that's the existing one but i just want
to show you how to how easy it is to
create a new one I just click this new
tube so once I click on that
particularly instantly understand the
data that I have you might sell
spreadsheet you see this is the separate
window from excel in the also similar
layout the operations and properties
that you can see the right hand side
lemon sized see the different tools and
here in the middle you see a map so this
map is actually powered at the back by
the beam maps the maps engine
the power map was it digest the data
from my spreadsheet it's my free pass
that oh there's latitude longitude that
you can use represents the position on
the map I can use either one because
this other thing in terms of counting
the graph visual position on a map so
what I need to do next is to specify
what I want to put on the on this map
the first thing I want to add of course
is the stream flow the average swim
through data I just click check the
button you see because all my neighbors
that this is kind of a measurement data
it will bring you the height of the
column chart I can I can change from
these four different chance the bubble
chart keep em chart but not region chart
because we don't have a region in this
data sauce so I just check it back to
the column chart and you see the stream
flow has been aggregated what I want to
do is that because i have already done
aggregation mercury so i will just sleep
test em there's no aggregation and then
the second they only do you remember
that we already have a time-space final
table i just want to check this time in
mercury power maps market attack this is
the date time format that they can't
stand it kind of stands in the power map
and add another axis on bottom which is
a time axis also here you can see the
template has been a specified here the
last thing I'm going to use to put the
sensor name on top and then it
represents a different color on the map
you can see the different color
represents a different place and
different sensors and here we go we have
we have active and it made it map that
we just saw before very easy right less
than three minutes get expensive video
and if you don't like this kind of map
you can also change from even themes of
maps example what that I use
think it's this one so this is what we
use and you can navigate it soon to mean
zoom out while you play time series and
another fastest in that you can do is to
not only capture a screenshot but also
you can create a video from this place
or to you by just click this button you
can play different quality of videos
just you same time I'm not going to
reproduce this video but it's very easy
just choose the color of the video that
you want and click create and power map
or study create videos and they are with
the video which is in that packed full
format are you get a share that too many
place like a cute way any other place
that you want to share or through email
okay so this is power map so um the next
thing I want to talk about also back to
power Curie's that you see that when i
get a data from power Curie's actually I
just pack a table in the Excel
spreadsheet and the receiver data from
that table into power Curie to do the
data processing however Parkers ability
is much more than that not only can
retrieve data from grab from lucky sell
different files from different type of
data sources or databases or even from
like Facebook please all data fees or
like as your marketplace just to show
the power of the cloud connection or
just to show you that you can make use
of the Windows Azure blob storage for
example I already have a blob storage
called a show data click OK and then
pearl Curie open up the category and the
container from my actual storage block
and from the different block you can
load the data into pearl Curie directory
see this is a binary that is loaded from
the asha blah
and this is essentially the same data I
just processed and you can start over
from them in process the data empower
curing so just to show this is the table
is the same one okay so that is our
first demo today so I'll give a few
minutes for you to ask crashes
Jeff so far I don't have any questions
for you to answer so if you'd like to go
ahead and get in go ahead okay so um
okay so we'll just go ahead on to the
second demo so the next one I'm going to
show you yes I actually I actually do
have one question for you I'm gonna go
ahead and send that to you now
ok the question that I've got is that
just wondering whether this is an
additional charge for power bi offerings
or this is part of office 365 for Asha
so this is the new product that's just
newly released by Microsoft and the
current offer is something based upon
Office responds but it's a separate
offer so after a cursory perusal I've
subscription you need to pay some amount
of actual money to get these offerings
that's the offering for now but I think
for the edu users for the education
sector users what I know is that
probably obvious a paper but just take
you and I believe that you that will be
something coming out ok so shall we go
back to our demo yep and you have a few
compliments to it's a great demo so far
so the next I'm going to show you is
powered view so power view as I
mentioned early is that interactive
dashboard I remembered i mentioned that
a lot of times well battered data
insights come from combining the
different perspectives of data so per
view although is served s like the
canyon creek business inside and making
business in decisions but to me from
what i see it also helpful for the
researchers to doing the research by
seeing the data from different
perspectives so here's an example this
is another kind of like environmental
study data which is the marine data
that's gathered around Puget Sound which
is the area around Seattle Seattle where
a pic Seattle area so on the left hand
side is map also based on pin map shows
the different marine data and you can
navigate a map actually this is active
and you can navigate zoom in zoom out
and see the different positions of the
Marines or sensors plus at the Puget
Sound area and see well the data is
actually gathered on the right hand side
this is the data actually from also
similar with the time of that we show
just now is the raw data of the
discharge data or the streamflow data
that we gathered from the Marines so I
got his data from a website from
environmental comfort that shows the
like different eyes if changes or the
waves changes along different rivers
around Puget Sound area the cool thing
of that is that you see the two or three
different perspectives on one map for
example the job precut your positions of
the different Marines and you see the
discharge data the each sensors as well
as the streamflow data in another cool
part is that the data between the chance
on this dashboard is actually associated
what I'm embarrassed that food
if I click on this big spot over here
means that you are slacking the story on
the right hand side it only shows this
marine I which is more in this cabbage
and this is a sad that you have seen
kind of geo down gioi view of the data
in a for this print sensor so if I want
you only see for example this to DC is
charged data is too prominent I want to
see the details of this stream flow data
what I want to do is very simple it's
just you like I'll select the disk a
chat later for a moment and then I can
see the stream flow data so actually
that power in the shape of the line
chart of these two different bashment
you can see they're essentially the same
it's just that the attachment is
different right and I can also unselect
this specific marine from the map and
you can see the overview okay so it's
kind of very fancy some other physician
that you can do here is to you like for
example can change if I don't like the
background of the pocket change to the
wrong man and if I only see the name of
the ring directly on the map i can also
do that here if I don't like the line
chart I can also change the chart I'm to
be column chart just by couple clicks
it's very calming it so some of the
power that we can do here is that for
example that go back to none
lactis so for example that I only want
to see these three Marines data in green
on this quarry and pick up so what I
want to do is select it shut and the
filter the charge by only choose these
three aureus and I'm a compile this the
discharge data of these three different
worries oh if I only want you as I
mentioned earlier only wanna see the
stream flow data I can also see that
here so just by purely seen this shape
of the line you probably can ask
yourself a crushing it looks like the
stream flow of these three different
Marines news similar in terms of the
pattern right they must share a similar
pattern especially between instinct
rihanna's quality and then in terms of
puyallup you know the pattern similar is
just have a larger volume there must be
something happen behind that so why is
that when asked myself they're crushing
and I go back to the map come back to
this view as I said that down you just
want to take a closer look at the data
of these two three different worries and
figured that there is here a similar
pattern and I just ask myself across
wide every single pattern I go to the
pap I check the position of these three
different worries the green is here your
love is here and its valence here so I
see there's a big snow mountain over
here which is water right here I need me
this area and know that so probably the
reason that they shared a similar
pattern is not only in the geo geo
position of history marine or the river
is all like the data source or the water
source is mostly from the mountain
also but also is that you know there are
some of the researchers who study the
story data in Tucson area they told me
that actually the water comes from the
snow mountain and these two rivers go go
go through green and a nice quality and
they will just go back concentrate in
this point and paola that's why you know
the order comes from these two rivers
that the merge to be PG some through
pure lap that's why we see this pattern
so isn't that interesting I feel is very
tasty just by these through creeks so
are you may wander in this message had a
dashboard how can I create that it's
actually very easy i'm going to show you
that so also with the power with the
power bi offering together with
obviously just five and once you have
that you will see a battle here in the
insert tab in excel says power view yeah
i'm just going to click on power view
and create a new one in the space pirate
name first
so 100 question later just put the leg
first and then what I want to do is I
want you added the orange data onto a
map so you see the data over here you
can always take a one for a moment this
is just the experimentation data that i
put early but essentially the data
throughout the previous power of you
coming from these two tables why is the
facts table which is this table which is
the signal data that we got from the
previous devil averaging the data
aggregated data by date the name and the
second table that you use is the
metadata which Maury which represents
the latitude and longitude and the
property of the name which represents in
this simple table okay so go back to the
power of you are going to create first I
want to create that map so what I need
to do is to use the marine radar data
put everything on to the map and you see
here it's a raw table B put on the
dashboard so thanks I want to make it
back just click on map button and then
change to your map on the right hand
side you see we need to specify the
longitude and latitude so it's so easy I
can just do that by dragon job
and then you see the apartment apps
shown here but we may not need that
particle maps so what we need to do it's
simply change the location name to
rename and then I don't need these
critical marbles so here you see the map
and through the layout button I can
adjust the data legend maybe I don't
need the title for this one and here we
go we got a map that we saw earlier the
original devil ok that's the map and
next what I got on your gala is a set of
chats the line charts so before I do
that you see that probably all of those
dots doesn't really mean anything right
because the the dots here the color of
the dots represents a different type of
worries but the size of the Dodge we
still need to have some specification
for it so you see the data them using
here are the data that i got from once a
same table but i actually i can use the
data from two different tables and show
that into one chat what i want to do is
that here you see the size is use the
latitude data which is wrong I just
remove this sphere for a moment and then
I can select for example just use the
discharge data for the size of the
circle so you see that's represent on
the map you may have a question how can
i connect these two tables together you
know just from the Excel these are just
two simple tables the facts table and
the metadata how can i connect them two
together actually powerview you can do
that iraq leading by clicking this
relationship button obviously our
creativity relationship here but what i
want to do is I'm
create a new relationship between the
two tables says that in the facts table
here i'm just using the name and make
sure the name is that that he could
between the two men q tables and choose
the beta table and then use the name day
i can create but powerreviews is smart
enough to tell that this relationship
has created before hand so I don't need
to recreate that again but if you are
starting from scratch you'll have to
recreate this table now sound okay let's
quickly proceed to the second one now
what I need to do is to use the data in
the facts table again I put everything
I'm a dashboard and then I'll change the
type of the charge to be a line chart
yeah I will use the value value
discharge and quantity state is right
and access actually I don't use name AZ
axis I just use date proverbs right and
the legend is value of sprite in the
vertical Martin post which is the
vertical like different tire of the chat
I don't use date then here we go so see
how easy it is to create is part of you
altogether it only takes like three
minutes five minutes and then you can
get the videos you want and a statue
jury in the gr data to gather the data
users that really want help for your
research so that's that's order demo for
today so while leave two minutes for Q&amp;amp;A
and then I'll hand over to kenji ok I
got a question of is there a way to save
power Curie and apply it to your
different data set with the same
structure and a format so
I think the question here is that
weather can likely repose using the same
steps actually you can show that
so we may not have enough time to do
that but essentially the power Curie
data is a set of scripts that you can
program myself so with om interface that
you do so you can just reproduce other
steps and do the patch at it against the
different data sources and not another
cool thing that I miss to mention is
that empower Curie not only that you can
not only that you can process the data
but also you can share the data to other
people for example for this day that I
just produced because I log into a power
Curie with my corporate Microsoft
credentials so I just show this data
directly to my co hoc co workers in this
enterprise or too many people that I
want to specify here which I share that
the other memo can discover that by
search the data from this place for
example I can just quickly search the
inner from this online search since that
I want to search data the population by
country actually this is the data brief
has been bind and also formatted by some
of my colleagues like you can explore
data attribute data in this way I can
also let the data into my current work
sheet by just these few clicks so yeah
that's the way that you can share and
reuse the data mercury
okay I we don't see other question come
in yet so okay I think that's all the
demos for today to quickly sum up we
went through the usage of power Curie
power map at the power of you by walking
through a cup of research scenarios
using the real environmental study data
hope through these demos you get a stay
pic of the power of Excel power bi all
the tools that we demo today was billed
under the philosophy of self-service now
business intelligence and data
processing so which we believe that only
buying power individual users which is
you he said data analysis tools that you
right now which is Excel that you can do
more and normal and become more powerful
by yourself so that's all I have for
today here I'm going to pass it to you
Kenji oh how Excel and I think you know
a lot of people maybe have not seen you
know the full power of XL and what it
can do and so you know it's great to see
how you can quickly just pull in data
you know we talk about data science and
data wrangling and that term you know
implies a lot of pain and I think you
know you've managed to show how Excel
and can make that really really easy and
particularly around you know mapping of
the data so I'd really like to thank
Jeff Jeff for that great presentation if
you want to find out more the best thing
is just to do it do a web search on
power bi and that comes right up and
you'll see a lot more in terms of not
just how to get hold of power bi but
also some other demos of it one of the
ones I love on there is actually some
open government data
being pulled from the UK open government
portal pulled into power bi and then
visualized and then also again mapped to
show actually some sort of traffic
incident data and it really shows how we
can use sort of new features in Excel to
really unlock some of that some of that
data so this webinar is part of a series
in our agile for research program and
the reason we included the Excel power
bi was you know as Jeff showed how you
can hook to data in Azure and that could
be created from something like Hadoop it
could be from the marketplace could be
from something like storm or calf go for
streaming real-time GPS data and being
able to show that sorrel for research
program you know has many facets
including our awards training which is
taking place around the world and also
coming online these webinars some
technical papers and also research
community engagements that were at
events and running our own own events
really the best way to keep in touch is
on linkedin we have a Windows agile for
research group and of course on Twitter
as well and the website actual for
research com you can go to so with that
is really like to thank everybody for
joining sickly thanking Jeff you know
for a great run through on all the new
features on excel and power bi I soham
thank you very much and I hope to see
all of you online or live at one of our
events or one of the community events
