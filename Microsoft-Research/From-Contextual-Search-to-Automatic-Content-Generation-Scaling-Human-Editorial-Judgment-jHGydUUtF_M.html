you
my pleasure this morning to introduce
Larry Birnbaum from northwestern
university where he heads the night news
innovation center that he may say a
little bit about during the the talk
it's a recently funded effort by knight
ridder to do lots of exploration about
how to present textual and maybe
multimedia information in ways that are
very different than we currently do with
with news feeds and so today Larry's
going to talk a little bit about some a
couple of things that he's been working
on one is a general notion of context
and how that's important in understand
we worry about it a lot in understanding
queries but also in presenting results
to people and I think you're going to
talk about a fun project on text
generation that takes raw data feeds
typically numeric and tries to generate
an interesting narrative around them
mostly for sports sports scores but for
lots of other things and so I think
historically Larry's work has really
been at the intersection of AI and
natural language and interfaces with
people doing real tasks on real web
scale system so Larry it's a pleasure
Susan thank you very much um Eric
claimed he would watch this later so uh
five dollars Eric if you actually do
watch this later thanks for having me
that this talk will be a little bit
personal and I know you can either
solipsistic or narcissistic as the case
may be but talk a little bit about kind
of our own struggles and by all means
chime in with your struggles as they
pertain to to it so you know I started
out doing sort of big semantic modeling
of the old school in natural language
and I love those models models we built
like 25 years ago I think they're there
was a lot of beauty of those models and
even a lot of truth of those models and
but there were a lot of things I didn't
understand at that time in fact that
none of us understood and I think the
the first thing which is idiotic that I
didn't understand it was that if it
doesn't scale there's no point in doing
it on a computer and it might seem
ridiculous for someone to be training
computer science and I understand that
but uh but I was and I didn't but the
other thing is that
and I think this is a sort of a
well-known maximum now which is that
scalability is not something that you
ever add later it's got to be baked in
from the beginning and whatever it is
that you're doing and so you know as we
started thinking about how do how do we
you know how do we cope with these
realities I was working with my
colleague Chris Hammond and he is the
one who really got me interested
originally and looking at problems in
information retrieval of intelligent
information systems and thinking about
how larger semantic models could be
built on top of the the processes that
information retrieval and statistical
methods generally provide us and kind of
help to make them do kind of interesting
things so we started in this work about
a dozen years ago with this as our
challenge or more than a dozen years ago
it is easier for a rich man to get into
heaven than it is for you to actually
take the context of what you're thinking
and stick it in this little box and have
the machine really do the right thing it
yet it works okay but when it doesn't
work that's extraordinarily frustrating
and and so we got interested in the idea
of just avoiding this entirely get just
get rid of this thing you know and so
the first our earth system in some sense
is the unfortunately named Watson system
j bud take our PhD student and this I
again have to say was more chris's work
and JS i mean i was a kind of a i
contributed some things to this project
but i was really more of a kibitzer but
Watson was one of them there were a
number systems at this time there was
also the remembrance agent at the media
lab was done was a similar system I like
cars actually I thought it was a really
good one but what Watson did is it would
look at a document that you were reading
and writing or writing online in a
variety of applications for instance in
PowerPoint and it would analyze it
statistically and heuristic alee and
then it would go out and would build
some queries and manage those queries
and come back with stuff that was
relevant to what you were doing and it
was a really good system and it worked
exceptionally well I mean it would come
back with the stuff which was really
very on point like here's a powerpoint
on jazz in the American culture and you
get all this great stuff about a passion
for jazz styles of jazz music
blah blah blah so it's all it's pretty
good stuff and it worked really well it
was fast it was automatic and it was
twice as good as you and what I mean by
that is that when jran studies where he
would take a query that you would write
and by you I mean a master student in
computer science and shipped to a search
engine and then a one that was
automatically generated by ones that
were automatically generated by the
system and you could put together
multiple ones too and then max mash up
the results and give them back to you to
identify whether you thought they were
on point you would say that more north
of well north of 60 percent of Watson's
results were on point whereas yours were
in the thirty to forty percent range so
it seemed like a fantastic opportunity
to start a company which we did and it
didn't work the company didn't work and
I'm not going to I think it's pretty
clear what the system did it sort of a
high level so I'm not going to go
through this it didn't really work and
what we found out as we start showing it
to people for real to say hey you should
use this in your knowledge management
system you know you should use this in
your productivity system in some way
shape or form is people would come back
and say you know these results are
tremendously on point they're just not
very interesting it's more of the same
it's like it's what I started with it's
the same stuff over and over again and
then and we had a dumb moment you know
which I think a lot of other people in
this business have had which is we were
doing what everybody else does we were
using similarity as a proxy for
relevance and actually similarity is as
a proxy for relevance has its strong
points and its weak points very
obviously and the you know our final
realization of its you know we points is
what is the what's the most similar
document to a document you have in your
hand is another copy of that document
which is completely well it might be
useful to know that somebody else has a
copy of that document but that's a
completely different kind of information
than information that's contained in the
document so we had this realization that
that would make something useful would
be for to be similar in certain respects
and dissimilar in other respects and I
think lots of other people had this
realization to obviously
we Watson was relying on the size of the
internet and basically on noise to
actually bring back stuff that might be
useful to you that might be enough off
point enough on point to be relevant and
enough off point to actually add
information and the question that came
to our mind was can we do better than
that I'll back up actually well no I'll
do this one so this is a this is
actually an older copy of a competitor's
news system which I think of as an
interesting failure I don't know what
they think about it I mean it's a little
bit better than this now we'll talk
about the ways in which it is better but
for example it tells you a bunch of
gives you a bunch of stories ranked by
how many stories are about or like this
or something I mean whatever they're
using for that and it'll show you you
know it'll show you this thing here if
you don't want to look at this one you
can look at 533 other stories which
you're not going to look at I mean
that's a lovely engineers number right
there you know it's sort of like no
one's going to look at those not those
stories and they don't show unless you
actually do the expansion they don't
show this to you anymore they don't
actually give you they don't put this
number in your face but but then there's
the question to me of like well why are
they showing me a story from Fox News
and why is the alternative something
from business we Bloomberg or why they
show me something from The Wall Street
Journal and why is the associate why is
the Baltimore Sun and an alternative
thing to show me I mean these don't
these again are very kind of those
things are particularly hermetic it
seems to me I mean it's very unclear why
they're showing me that their optimizing
something but it's not clear what their
optimizing and and I guess to sort of
cut to the chase is that we started to
come to the realization that these are
editorial decisions that these systems
are making I mean editorial what what
editors do is they do attentional
engineering they they decide what your
what is going to get your attention by
positioning it on a page or in in a in a
place or in at a time when they think it
will have your attention and these
machines are making editorial decisions
and they're applying editorial
values to make editorial judgments and
we actually don't have any clear idea
about what their editorial values are or
how they're making the editorial
judgments that they're making and I
actually dare say that the engineers who
built this that thing I showed you have
no clue either because they don't think
of themselves for the most part as
editors and they don't think of
themselves as making editorial judgments
they just think of themselves as they're
trying to optimize something although I
don't think they're they're just not
thinking about it that way we'll talk
about the ways in which that's improved
in a minute so we ended up starting to
think that what we really wanted here
was a deliberate mechanism for finding
alternatives or for pursuing information
relationships and here's the thing where
I think we can have some discussion or
debate which it seemed to us that this
is where kind of our preference for
semantic approaches actually might play
a role because to be deliberate it
seemed to us you had to you had to be
thinking about dimensions of similarity
and dissimilarity that actually has some
kind of semantic component to them i'll
tell you what i mean you could look back
at what Watson was doing wrong and say
what I really want to do is look for the
golden donut of things that are
dissimilar enough that though they're
useful and or golden I don't know what
you'd call it it's the golden uh you
know it's it's a donut it's like a
nested spheres right it's the sort of
things that are far enough away from
where you started to be interesting but
not too far away to be useless and so
you can imagine this kind of area and
that does I think and people work on
that and I think that's a really good
idea but again you're not getting any
notion of your still depending on noise
and the size of the Internet to bring
back stuff you're not actually in a
deliberate or thoughtful fashioned
deciding to explore that space you're
actually just saying okay this is where
the sweet spot will be and I think
that's good so we got interested in the
idea of specific dimensions of
similarity and dissimilarity that we can
look at for particular content vertical
so here's an example and actually it was
the point of the thing we did this just
earlier this morning I mean we looked at
that but so this is a we actually did a
similar system to Watson forearm and
you'll have to excuse me for a minute
these these shoelaces are really uh not
well designed
and I should get new ones but I I don't
we did a system like that for video that
looked at the metadata associated with
video and bring back relevant
information as well and it worked pretty
nicely it brings back a bunch of recipes
relevant to the things he's talking
about here you know if you type in
lasagna recipe to a search engine
actually it keeps growing this morning's
result were 10 million results for
lasagna recipe the last time I looked it
was six Million results for lasagna
recipe and the last look before that it
was 1 million results but the point is
there's a lot of lasagna recipes online
and if I'm showing you a lasagna recipe
already the question is you know and
this is the problem watts and watch
would bring you back 10,000 other
lasagna recipes you know and that's
completely pointless right at some level
and so this is like I think this will be
obvious but maybe to get a little little
thing going here like what should I show
you if I'm showing you a lasagna recipe
this is actually a question test right
right so what so in particular what
kinds of one put another way if I'm
already showing you lasagna recipe what
other lasagna recipe should I show you
that would actually be useful to you
federal design yours better lasagna
recipes that's true so highly highly
highly highly thought of lasagna recipes
what else right you know vegetarian
lasagna recipes low-calorie lasagna
recipes low salt was on your recipes
easy lasagna recipes classic lasagna
recipes okay and in fact if you go and
do quarry completion on a search engine
like if you type lasagna recipe L you'll
get low-salt low-fat locale low-carb
even which i think is fascinating but
but okay maybe so you know I'd love to
hear about that
climates you can also find other things
that are related to lasagna rustic way
so share ingredients with butter or not
was on yet absolutely see very much of
that absolutely so other recipes you
might consider cooking if you were
consumed I sell it or right what's the
right wine absolutely what's a good you
know you know Caesar salad and chianti
or whatever it is you should have with
and garlic bread I guess that's the
standard cheap I mean at some point in
everybody's life and there let's say
let's say 23 22 to 23 years old it's
lasagna garlic bread Caesar salad and a
bottle of Chianti i think that's that's
a nice you cooked somebody a nice dinner
when you've done that you know so it's
still a nice dinner I don't mean to be
patronizing I can't I can't even cook it
even today but so we got that's what we
ended up doing we ended up saying look
we're going to actually now if you have
a lot of data and if you if you want to
go mine and you can actually find these
things in what people are asking for we
actually like to say a relatively simple
approach because frankly I think a
person who edits cookbooks knows
perfectly well I mean they're
professional at what kind of information
people actually need to know about
recipes or what other alternatives don't
want and I think it's well i am prepared
to believe that there will be a lot of
undiscovered gems of kinds of
relationships in the data that that
people who build cookbooks never thought
of in their imaginations on the other
hand there will be things that experts
know would be useful to you that won't
typically show up in quarry logs because
not enough people will grasp but they
should have looked at that for example
okay and yet it could have been there so
we're actually very using the idea of
putting a tool in the hands of an editor
that will say take this recipe and
mutate it in the following ways to find
the things that you want you know and
we're also interested in things like how
would you find out whether it was a
quick and easy lasagna recipe well it
might say quick and easy in it or you
might look at it and you might actually
see how many steps it has in it or etc
so you can imagine lots of ways to
actually estimate that this is just a
way of saying that when you go through
the sort of what Watson did our Watson
the original Watson
you know it's these um you know it's
these places where you could actually
make a decision about what am I going to
look at in the context how am I going to
select the source is how am I going to
query you know form the queries how am I
going to do all these things these are
all the little places in the algorithm
where you can stick in a little bit of
nudging or control you know in
relatively simple ways you know um thank
you very much so um but you know so we
talked about a couple of other systems
that we built along these lines that had
that I thought were that I thought was
kind of this was built by my student Joe
way Lou and the idea here was if you
give Watson a story about for example
Israel Israel Zeus of cluster bombs in
the nineteen in the 2006-11 and war what
is that when it was there been so many
unfortunately you will get back fifty
thousand other stories about Israel's
use with cluster bombs in that war if
you give this to her system what you
will get back will be stories about us
use of cluster bombs in iraq nato use of
cluster bombs in the balkans and in
afghanistan and so the idea was to
actually try and find stories that had a
very similar activities or actions but
we're located in different places or
involve different actors and so here's
an example for exact Ace of work will
tried to buy mysql and we get back
actually thing I BM as the comparable
entity and it goes out and finds stories
about IBM basically trying to do pursue
an open-source strategy in a variety of
other places so for example here these
are the two seas are two stories it
found and it actually tells you what got
kind of what correspond to what in some
sense right in these things and what was
in common so so you can see that the
idea here was that maybe you would
actually understand this story better by
virtue of comparing it to something that
was a little bit different from it that
that would actually be a way of of
actually coming to some better
understanding of it this is the this
person base
absolutely so it's a relatively simple
thing it didn't so uh I'll come
back to that in a second we actually did
a couple of things what we could do for
example if you did a story about for
instance um GM laying off workers it
might find a story about honda hiring
workers or ford hiring workers so we
could look a little bit at Antony Antony
macaque tivities and it could do things
around around adjectives so if you if
you gave it a story of a about a bloody
coup somewhere it might come back with a
bloodless coup with a relatively
peaceful coup so it actually had some
some capacity to do that kind of thing
but in general that's right it was
actually what it did is it took the it
took the sort of top stuff in the story
it ripped out the named entities it it
did a search just with that without any
named entities in it and it um and it
was doing that to mine similar named
entities and the reason is is that there
is a lot of there are all the stories
will find that way or the comparable
stories will find but they're pretty
mixed mixed in all over the place
because they're not very highly ranked
so we did that to try and mine for
instance IBM or NATO or the yoke or
Afghanistan verses 11 and for example
and one sublime those things which it
did by finding simple similar sentences
high up in the first paragraph where
they play similar syntactic roles it
would then go back and reformulate the
query using those entities that had
found does that make sense ok and it was
it you know I thought it was a
reasonably successful system and at
least in finding and finding things like
that that were that were a little bit
different that might actually add value
to your understanding of the situation
there's something else I was going to
say that I I'll get back to it later
I actually wanted to use something like
the I mean this this was her idea i
actually had wanted to just use like
this was a case where I thought that
that actually pre-built taxonomy would
be said would be helpful like for
example the Department of Commerce has
lists of US companies in classified by
industry and you could imagine saying
I'm just going to go through that and
say here's another company and I'm just
going to go through and systematically
substitute in these names off this list
we try to use actually you know Brand X
2 sets operation to do this and and it
didn't work that well interestingly
enough it didn't help us uh I will say
something about what this says about the
you know kind of information retrieval
compared to logic and why we were doing
this so you can't what what you really
want to say here is I want a story for
example you might say something like the
following I want a story about that's
like I'm looking at a story about let's
say Iran and nuclear proliferation and
nuclear weapons and I want a story like
this that's not about Iran because I
want to think about similar cases or
similar situations that happen
previously I can't just take some
compressed query about this thing and
add not Iran okay that's going to be the
wrong thing for a variety of reasons
first of all a lot of the specificity
and queries comes from names and because
that's what names are for I mean names
exist to be relative relatively
individuated symbols that count that
stand for something and a lot of the
oomph and indexing comes from them you
know a lot of the specificity but the
second reason is that somebody might
have actually written a an entire case
study about comparing Iran with North
Korea or Libya or or whatever right and
that's actually something you do want to
retrieve and so if you say not Iran
you're shutting yourself out this is
just a way of saying that a negation
doesn't work properly in in in IR
systems because they're not full-blown
predicate logic system so when you want
to do something like negation what you
have to do is actually do substitution
of the of the things that you mean
otherwise so not Iran means Iraq Libya
North Korea whatever the United States
is currently categorizing as you know
rogue states or something like that so
that becomes the does that make sense so
that's sort of the the model here sort
of build
and again this is sort of our notion of
like to building a little bit more
complicated semantics on top of what the
information retrieval systems afford US
um these are kind of from the numbers
represent here always I'm not the best
evaluator in the world but my students
are better than me the precision was
pretty good so about seventy percent or
so the stuff that came back people would
look at it and say yeah this is a good
analogy to the story you originally gave
me the recall is a little bit funny but
I'll tell you what that means so it
turns out that reporters will very often
allude to comparable cases in the
stories that they give you and so what
yahweh did is she took the actual
comparable cases that were alluded to in
these in the set of stories that she was
starting for uh about the original query
whatever that was the original topic
whatever that was and and she took you
know down to some depth like 20 or 50 or
whatever and then she she took all those
situations and said did the system find
those and the answer is it found them
about sixty percent of the time that
doesn't mean that I mean I you get the
point I mean some doesn't mean of the
things that found that weren't there
weren't good ones they were perfectly
good they just weren't the ones so this
is actually something that Brand X I
think took to heart so ja ja I went to
intern at Google News um while she was
doing this work and you know this will
relate to the fact that it shows you
these stories and that shows you the
follow-up stories will be you know
Bloomberg Businessweek and why are you
showing me that you know and we had this
realization that if you serious let's
say you see a story coming out of of
Pakistan and you read about it on the
New York Times or CNN and and the other
question is well where else would you
like to read about it I mean I've
already seen it on I mean maybe the
Guardian will give me a slightly
different point of view you know what
I'm saying but but it's still you know
it's still you know London as opposed to
New York I mean it'd be you ask yourself
this question and answers itself I mean
what you're interested in is what are
people in Pakistan saying about this
that's the obvious question you know so
if you happen to know that the dawn of
Lahore Pakistan is actually one of the
premier English language news sites in
Pakistan that you can go and see what
they're saying about it but we didn't
know that until we started this project
and so this is actually very simple
piece of technology it just has a
you know it just basically has list of
interesting venues that are associated
with with countries locations
stakeholders like organizations and it
just says if the story is about them go
look at what they say about this okay so
for example here's Putin visiting Iran
when he was as this was in 2007 so I
guess he was president before he became
president again and and here you can see
that in Iran it finds a story it finds
some stories about that are from Iran
about this visit in addition to the
standard stories it actually sees the
United States is actually related and a
variety of other of other organizations
it looks at them from each of their
points of view in some sense so actually
if you look at brand ex's new site now
you will see that they do when it's
relevant identify the location of the
news is from and try and show you a you
know so if the news is out of
Philadelphia they'll try and show you
something from Philadelphia as well so
and I think that's a really good idea
and it's a very simple idea it's not a
very technically difficult idea it's
eleven o'clock
sorry oh that's right at 11 minutes
right 11 good I was confused we're
counting down it's almost like new years
so uh I hope this makes sense and I like
the system for that reason I mean this
is an example of kind of system I like
to build because it's not it's
technically not that hard and I think it
sort of implements a relatively obvious
semantic idea and it does it in a
straightforward way and it works this is
one that I think was a little bit more
challenging that we did that Joe way did
as well and if somebody gave me this
fabulous word epistemic dimensions I was
trying to cast about for what what was
that so the idea was I want to look at a
topic and I want to look at it from
multiple points of view and by multiple
points of view I don't mean liberal
versus conservative or four verses
against i really wanted something a
little bit more like more abstract than
that like practical versus theoretical
would be an example of what I mean by de
by a dimension like that and what we
ended up here was like I want to talk
about a story from a business point of
view a religious point of view a
technical point of view a medical point
of view a legal point of view for
example if i put in a topic like
abortion i could look at abortion from a
illegal or a political or a medical or a
religious point of view and I get really
different very different kinds of and so
again I think these are the kinds of
dimensions I'm thinking about when I
think when I say look I'm looking for
systematically different dimensions of
information this is the kind of
dimension that is exciting to me here's
an example of when the EU was going
after Intel this was either before after
they went after you guys well whatever
other large American company they
decided to go after you know but that's
their job you know what I'm saying so I
don't think we should begrudge that you
use the EU their their mission so here
we have a technology and I tu
entrepreneur point of view on on this
issue and then you can find blog entries
about lawyers and and and basically on
the legal point of view and these
typically came from lawyers and
and and and legal blogs that's how many
it found I guess it didn't go that deep
and usual in general we're not really
that into completeness I mean we're
going to be showing things to people
rather than aggregating them and so
precision is more important than recall
for us I'm surprised the numbers are so
low but it is what it is I'm not sure
how deeply she dug the main thing that
we were interested in doing this in when
we did this is we didn't have to
actually download the the actual
contents of the documents to analyze
them we wanted to see if we can do it
from the snippets and it turned out that
this work because bloggers are
relatively consistent in the points in
these epistemic points of views that
they take on topics in other words a
blogger who typically takes a legal
point of view may take a legal and a
political point of view but is you know
does that make sense I hope that sort of
makes sense so you could actually just
so what the system did is once you
identify entry came back as relevant to
this topic you would look at the source
and the first thing you do is you say
well have I have I have I analyzed this
source before because it would cash
those results and if it had then it
would just say oh this is a thing from a
legal point of view good and if it
didn't then it would just go back and do
a query just for the source alone to get
back 20 snippets 20 random snippets
basically a recent snippets of documents
from this person and then it would
analyze those and then we had you know
so at this point I'm just going to say
there's a bunch of details about how to
do that but it actually turned out to be
the case that it was better to classify
the snippets independently and then
aggregate those results and to throw all
the snippets into one document and and
try and categorize that and that's what
this says I can't believe I'm putting up
something with the word neural net in it
but I am that happens so actually it
worked it worked pretty well the the
when people looked at the results they
thought that they were a on point and be
represented that point of view eighty
percent of the time I'm trying to
remember what what this means I think it
means of that
the
I think it means that if you did the
query from a if you do when you just did
the query if you look in the query
yourself in the top 20 or 50 things what
percentage of the things that you would
actually say was on that point of view
did it actually find so this is
conditional on the fact on the on what
came back from that query it's not
actually casting into the web new to
find something I hope that makes sense
does that make sense to everybody here's
the system that was built by our student
Francisco iacobelli I really like this
because it's really dirt simple there
are these metrics for novelty that is
that people work on in in a variety of
track sort of text tracking kind of
things and he actually invented a couple
of new ones but he basically said look I
want to look at a news story and then I
want to find other news stories on this
topic and have new information in them
and he's defining new information
extremely syntactically and simply new
information is just additional actors
additional data or additional quotes
okay so it's going to look through these
related stories that it's going to find
either because they're already clustered
together in a new source or because
he'll dynamically generate the queries
allah wats and to do that our Watson
again and then he'll actually start
sorting through digging through these
stories to find these to find stories
that have these additional information
for example this was done as you can see
at the time last year when the the the
BP well was was out of control in the
Gulf of Mexico and it goes through the
story in The Tribune and it finds other
stories that are like it for example
that have additional actors of them for
example this company Magellan midstream
partners LP or the American Petroleum
Institute
it finds this additional numbers so for
example this this story doesn't talk
about it but it turns out that the
technicians want to be able to find that
the pressure readings in this
containment cap has to be able to handle
eight to nine thousand pounds per square
inch and also that the vessels that will
be collecting oil on the surface have to
be able to hold between two and a half
and three and a half million gallons a
day of oil that's what they're going to
try and collect so these are the
additional numbers that found and then
finally some additional quotes here's a
quote from the the hope is that we can
slowly turn off the valves close the
capping lutely and then test the
pressure to see how well how the well is
performing ok said thad Allen the
government's point man on the disaster
okay so that's an additional quote the
metric he used by the way for whether he
should you know so again he's finding a
bunch of these things and the question
is and in general we didn't have a lot
of real estate here and which two or
three was he showing you and here he did
use the inverted pyramid model so the
idea was that a a new name number or
quote that was higher up in the story
that you found it in it would actually
it would actually it would actually
prefer to show that one on the grounds
that some human being thought it was
important enough to put high up on the
story somewhere so this is not um new in
the sense of cute ya novel but if I've
already read this I made no previous
history so it's sort of like the notion
relevance versus interesting
the things that are after this might be
more interesting to me it didn't look
that but it should have you're right i
mean um yeah the newness here just
simply meant additional information as
opposed to genuinely new okay I mean I
could imagine application certainly
where you know there's the old story
that you know all the estimates change
over you know typically like in
disasters and so on as they get updated
so you would certainly imagine that you
want to paw through and find the most
recent numbers about something and and
that's something I'd be interested in I
mean I'm not averse for example to
saying I'm going to have a relatively
small model of a disaster and by small i
don't mean a complete model of what
natural disasters are like but just that
disaster stories go through the
following progression there's the
original situation there's some numbers
and metrics associated with that which
will be the extent of the storm or the
size of the tsunami or the you know the
range of it the next thing will be the
start will come in will be numbers of
you know people killed or injured
destroyed and so those numbers will
start to build over time and then
eventually you'll start to hear about
rescue efforts right so that kind of
model of the time course of a relatively
crude model of the time course of a
natural disaster and its aftermath and
we haven't done that particular one but
i'm not actually that's exactly the kind
of thing that I'm i'm talking about i'm
very happy to build a relatively simple
model like that just out of my head and
say okay this is now i'm going to be
looking for um you know i'm not going to
be looking for tweets or whatever that
meet the things in each of these stages
that i've identified right as a way of
sort of organizing the thing and that'll
bring some that temporality with it but
it's not it's not automatically
determined i'm not going to talk about
this or this this was very precise which
was good i mean it actually sometimes it
would identify i don't know how it did
this would identify as new information
something that was not in fact new
information well maybe it wasn't on
point it's recall here again we mean
that of the things that came back from
these queries or that were in this
cluster that you should have identified
as being for instance a new new
quote did you actually identified and
again I honestly I can't tell you why it
wasn't perfect it should have been
perfect so all of these systems are have
this nice property that they're
contextualized I mean uh the the
spectrum isn't quite that way I mean you
sorta type of query into spectrum but I
know we're all on pins and needles now
in time there it is okay 11 11 11 11
this is five I guess that's five right
11 11 11 11 11 okay yeah 5 11 s that's
that's better 5 11 speed six sigma or
something I don't know that's what it
reminded me of for some reason it's an
auspicious moment to be giving a talk so
we ended up getting we usually got rid
of search box or we at least had
something that was allowing you to
identify these dimensions and bring back
sort of interesting stuff but uh the
output was the same it was like a list
of results and you know at some point
dawned on us and this is dawn on lots of
other people that you don't want a
hundred stories you don't want ten
stories you want one story and I think
this is not a dream that's only our
dream but I think I think what we are
all thinking now is that you're walking
around in the world and and and sort of
one information experience I don't
necessarily mean a story or document but
one information experience that is
tailored for you right now that
addresses your needs right now is
dynamically constructed based on the
information that's available in the
world and present it to you and that you
can interact with and I think that's
kind of what we're all I think that's
what we're all kind of thinking now
synthetic documents in other words so
crisp built this and his student Nate
Nichols built this really nice gizmo
called news at seven it was a lot of fun
and that might be in some sense was our
first foray into this and what it did is
it imitated Siskel and Ebert you would
give it a name of a movie and then it
would go to IMDB and it would also go to
Rotten Tomatoes and it would pull out uh
positive and negative reviews and then
well first of all we look to see whether
this was a polarizing movie or not okay
because it would do different things but
if it was a polarizing movie it would
pull out positive and negative reviews
and he for instance would become
positive and she would become negative
or vice versa and then they would talk
about the movie and in the meantime in
the background you'd have little stills
from the movie or b roll from the movie
running and and they would actually
argue about it and and one of the
reasons for doing this by the way is
that is that synthetic voices are still
kind of cruft e and so it turns out that
actually listening to two of them
alternating it's not quite as obnoxious
as listening to one drone on and on and
on and so that was part of the reason
for there was sort of that
presentational thing but but it kind of
worked okay and like I'll time I
addition to this was and this again it
go comes back to this idea like simple
simple dimensions or simple semantics
what do people talk about when they talk
about a movie what do they talk about
they talk about the acting they talk
about the directing they talk about the
music the story I mean if they're really
into it they talk about the costumes or
the production values or the
cinematography ok so the ideas are these
dimensions of movie analysis or
criticism for want of a better word and
to some extent the system did try to
kind of keep itself on point in other
words if it found a quote from some guy
saying I thought X was a great actor in
this movie it would come back with
either if it could find somebody saying
they thought X with a lousy actor in the
movie or at least find some other person
who was allows the actor in the movie
and talk about that ok so that you'd
actually get the does that make sense
would kind of cute and if it couldn't do
that it will just change the subject
which actually turned out to be my
amazingly effective in other words when
you listen to this thing you actually
know that got us to thinking actually
how often to Siskel and Ebert actually
talk to each other as opposed to just
sort of saying whatever it is that they
thought they were saying there was sort
of syntactic lose that they were having
a conversation it wasn't real
conversation was it you know i think the
instant question about a thing like that
well or a lot of questions about this
one is it is a fun experience to watch
it the next question is is it adding any
value in the world in other words those
comments are already out there and you
can go to Rotten Tomatoes and read them
yourself and the question becomes do
they gain any additional
meaning by being embedded in a document
like this were an experience like this
that that that is you know is the whole
greater than the sum of the parts in
other words because if it is we're
adding value when we build a thing like
this and if it isn't we're not you know
I think we thought it was I think we
thought that actually pulling things
together like this kind of made them
more poignant or more something but we
were you know but we were still sort of
this is still working by bricolage in
other words it's not generating anything
it does have a simple rhetorical model
of a back-and-forth argument like this
and it does have a notion of the kinds
of topics that matter in movies but it
doesn't have it's not actually
generating any text on its own so that
car that's interested in the idea of
sort of generating you know back into
the argument and interest in the idea of
generating stories which is something we
thought about I mean stories is
something we thought about for a long
time and we had this brainwave which it
turns out other people have had to
because there's never any good new ideas
in the world or everybody's had them but
of kind of generating stories from data
and actually this this finally it's got
a lot of currency so we actually hit
XKCD which excited me because you know
i'll be i have to tell you something I
didn't even know what the XKCD was
actually until one of my students showed
this to me and I was like wow we made
XKCD what does that mean but apparently
it meant something good so a weighted
random number generator just produced I
love that weighted by the way a weighted
random number generator just produced a
new batch of numbers let's use them to
build narratives all sports commentary
so this is what we built actually and I
should say something about how we built
it one of the things that we've been
doing in the last few years is is
teaching joint courses with the
journalism school so northwestern has a
very famous School of Journalism call
the Medill School of Journalism and we
started teaching joint courses of them
about three years ago and what I mean by
that is these are joint projects classes
where we take computer science students
and journalism students and we stick
them on in these in these classes and we
stick them on teams together and we give
them an assignment and then we mentor
them gently yet yet firmly to try and
get something built in the course of a
quarter and actually we gave this
project to generate sports stories from
and even the sports stories thing was
sort of accidental we were sitting
around thinking what should we do and we
thought like well it has to be a field
where there's a lot of data we thought
well sports or business we decide to go
with switch I think that was a good idea
actually I think business it turns out
that so there's now a company narrative
science which is commercializing this
technology I hope I mean so far
successfully so far so good but
obviously business is a much more much
more part of their of their of their
product line than sports is because the
you know that's where the money is but
that's but sports turned out to be a
really good thing to do we haven't
hooked it to a random number generator
yet although we probably should we
thought about fantasy sports actually
and doing that kind of thing let me show
you what it bills so here is here is
this is not the one that was built in
the class so we built a we had two great
journalism students actually on this
team with us and one of them actually
was a developer also so and one of them
was a budding sports journalist which
was one of the reasons why sports turned
out to be useful this is the data from a
from a game actually this is from the
not from the proof of concept that came
out of the class but from the first real
prototype that we built in the lab we we
love this project and we hired those
students afterwards to actually work
with us this is the line score the box
score and the play-by-play from a game a
little more than two years ago the white
sox in seattle in fact i should say
about the play by play that it's
actually in English it's play by plays
or telegraphic English but they're there
it's a limited vocabulary English so it
sort of this is this is things like you
know X gets a double X you know X
strikes out things like that okay and we
just we just put them in this sort of
quasi numerical form to make it clear
that we're not it's not really English
exactly and and the main thing I think
its clearest by the way you can't take a
wall of data in and produce a wall of
text that's not a story right i mean the
any way you push this little button here
and this is not cash so it'll
I'll show you a little bit about what it
knows about baseball down to their last
out Griffey saves mariners seattle the
seattle manners were down to their final
out when ken griffey came to the plate
against reliever Tony Pena on Wednesday
but he delivered a single to carry their
marriage to one another thing victory of
the Chicago White Sox and a 14 inning
marathon at Safeco Field after Adrian
Beltre singled and Jack Hannahan walked
the game was tied I like that it was 0
to 0 when Griffin came to the plate
against Pena with two outs and runners
on first and second he's singled scoring
Beltre from second which gave the
Mariners lead for good so this is a
pretty good story actually this story is
about as good as and we haven't done any
formal evaluation but actually a number
of sports writers there was a sports
writer at the toronto star who actually
on his own without ever having any
conversation with us he grabs one of our
stories and then a story that he'd
written about that game and he did a
kind of side by side comparison and he
was pretty happy actually he thought he
also noticed that ours was grammatically
correct and his wasn't but i don't think
that's so important I by the way I want
to make it clear that we have no we have
nothing interesting to say about text
generation per se and we'd have no we
make no claims about that it's a very
standard uh you know phrasal Jenner it's
a special-purpose phrasal generator with
gaps that get you know get it you know
that it walks the tree and generates the
sub piece and so forth there's nothing
there's nothing there well there's
something there but that's not the part
that we really there's nothing
innovative there why don't I put it that
way okay um how you know that the bats
are correct for example that
that Ken Griffey works for the Seattle
Mariners well we got these so this stuff
comes from a company called stats Inc it
which has the cut the contract to do
bait most major league sports in the
United States stats Inc is owned jointly
by the AP and Fox Sports it's actually
based in northbrook illinois and they do
and their stats are pretty good although
occasionally there are problems and we
can talk a little bit about the issue of
data validation which came up today also
and talk ahead this whole list of back
yeah yeah yeah yeah you skate you give
it that okay so so actually data
validation is a big issue for us
obviously I mean if you don't get the
right data I want to say something about
let me talk a little bit about what it
knows and a little bit about let's talk
about what it does first of all so it
does it does two things basically it
does and analytics based on some of it
is based on like sort of sabermetrics
ideas for example this is this is based
on Bill James's game score model these
things are actually it also uses
predictive modeling to help identify
useful positions in the game so in other
words if you predict that something's
going to happen and then after after a
play your predictions change a lot that
was an important play so it and also
threshold crossing so I mean I don't
want I don't want to actually make this
to sound too complicated I mean if a
company's cash flow negative one quarter
and cash flow positive the next quarter
you know so crossing zero was always a
big deal you know what i mean so there's
a couple of simple things like Maxima
minima thresholds and you can think of
them yourself that turn out to drive
kind of be drivers for potentially
interesting situations and after having
built all these derived features it then
builds this outline and the outline
actually i'll go back to the setting the
outline shows a little bit about what it
thinks is going on so this system is a
kind of a big expert system and what it
has is is it has big semantic models of
situations like this that it's trying to
match to the to this game okay in this
instance the
one that works here is called take the
lead late is actually the the model that
actually matched this and if you think
about what they are you can think about
I'll actually tell you about the
rhetorical structure but baseball game
recap because of this we talked about
this last night we we thought the
reporters would actually have
well-thought-out rhetorical models and
kinds of stories they don't and I think
this is because reporting I think maybe
long-form like magazine reporters might
but news reporters don't and I think
it's because it's a very ephemeral
medium you know I mean it's like is it
it's it doesn't matter you're right it
doesn't have to be well written it has
to get it has to work and so they're not
they don't really honest about exactly
what does a baseball game recap look
like they just write them here's what a
baseball game recap it turns out looks
like the first part of a baseball game
recap is what happened and why it
happened what was the outcome and why
did it why was that the outcome okay
what led to that outcome the second part
of a baseball game recap is the pitching
you must talk about the pitching and the
third part of a baseball game recap is
other interesting stuff that happened
okay in chronological order all right or
actually alternatively in order based on
organized around the players okay so
those are the two ways you can do that
section okay and different kinds of
patterns matter in different parts of
this of this structure so for example at
the beginning part what matters is was
it a come-from-behind victory was it a
take the lead late was it a blowout was
it a back and forth the whole way was a
piling on at the end okay and you can do
this from either point of view you know
you can help that you can either have a
you can either have a comeback or you
can have a comeback that almost makes it
but not you can almost take you can
almost have a late victory but not quite
and from the point of view the people
actually one that's called holding off
right you held them off at the end right
and in addition to those it has a bunch
of actually other kinds of angles that
are around sort of how did that come to
be so for example it has an angle for a
heroic individual effort where it can
look in the in the game data and find
this player in these places made the
difference versus great team effort okay
and again these patterns are visible in
the data and it finds them and actually
uses them to actually figure out how
it's going to describe what
than the game I hope that makes sense is
there any kind of like I'm wondering if
it seems like sometimes these stories
probably talk about events that are sort
of external to the game at there's some
scandal unfolding the playwright or
something like that sipi set it up
looking like Wikipedia freebase or so
right so we actually do do so I so we
are interested pulling out well first of
all you'll you'll notice that the pic
the thing actually pulled out griffeys
picture so it had to go and actually go
somewhere to do that okay I think it's
griffeys picture I can't believe we have
to rear I'm sorry that it doesn't even
catch it then okay yeah it is griffeys
picture but you know it doesn't really
uh so we do go out and find stuff and
one of the nice things about doing this
in this context is your query is very
specific because you know exactly what
you're looking for like I'm looking for
a quote by this player about this play
in this game in this location at this
time okay I would be very excited we
haven't quite done this yet to analyze
tweets from people who are at the game I
think that would be awesome and pull
them back especially around things like
so to get that extra stuff that happened
that you can't quite get and and again
you have to be able to anticipate what
that might be so I think it's pretty
obvious that you can get either either
people's reactions to or descriptions of
Y or better descriptions of particular
events I mean if a spaceship lands in
the middle of the field during the game
I'm not sure what we'll be able to make
of that you know what I'm saying but if
somebody hurts himself well you can
expect that somebody might get injured
in the game and so you actually should
be looking out for that right I'm sorry
excuse me
this was just the n case I didn't have
connectivity so we actually are doing
all-big Ten football baseball basketball
and women's softball games previews in
game updates we tweet during the games
and we also do recaps after the games
and you might say well I want to talk
about why we think this matter so the
thing is there's no point in having
machine right Big Ten football game
stories Big Ten football is a big deal
there's a lot of money in Big Ten
football and there will be no problem at
all paying human reporters to go and
write those stories there's this there's
this it's not a problem okay Big Ten
women's softball okay this is it turns
out that so here's a story from last
year cramer blanks Oakland to help
spartans win it wasn't her best effort
but Lauren Kramer was the backbone and
the Michigan State Spartans afforded
nothing victory over the olden Oakland
golden grizzlies on Thursday the golden
wensleys weren't able to score run off
creamer during her seven innings on the
mound she allowed five hits to walk
struck out nine with the biggest one for
Michigan State since their 92 win over
Eastern Michigan on March 30th we can
get some historical stuff in there as
the season progresses okay and actually
you can actually start to put in horse
racing angles around the around the
plating into the playoffs for example so
you can actually start to change the
stories towards the end of a season they
can become a little bit richer that way
as well um so it turns out that like the
the daily northwestern publishes about
two to three games about women's
softball about Northwestern's women's
softball team every season and the team
plays 20 games 25 games most most of
these games go unreported and if you ask
even by the school newspapers okay and
if you ask who wants to read a story
about women's collegiate softball I
think the question you mean you know who
does who once we despair about women's
collegiate softball yeah the kids on the
team their parents their friends you
know people alumni who used to be on the
team okay and in this great land of ours
I'm sure there are some people who
actually care about women's Kalidas
softball just because they do you know
I'm
it's got to be it's a big country you
know so I don't know how many people
that is 200 people 2000 people probably
somewhere between 200 and 2,000 people
and yet the stories don't get written
there never written how much does it
cost to write a story it turns out that
a stringer will be paid 50 to 75 dollars
to cover a sporting event by buy a
newspaper that's a labor of love if he
has to pay or she has to pay to get into
the game that'll be included that that
comes out of that money transportation
comes out of that money okay it's really
it is a labor of love it's the thing
that people do because they love to do
it and they go and they go and they do
it okay but it's still too expensive for
women's collegiate softball I mean
nobody will actually I mean if you but
so that's the idea we you know the idea
is to actually say look there are things
that just don't get reported on that you
get ripped that you can get reported
quickly and easily and cheaply this way
if you can get the data there's a
company called game changer which has an
a baseball scoring app for Little League
and middle school and high school
football teams available for iPhones and
androids we generated 300,000 little
league stories last summer all right
this program is now the nation's most
prolific author of women's collegiate
softball game stories all right and
there and they're decent stories what's
the larger what's the larger takeaway
here you know there's a lot of data we I
mean we all I mean the other I'm sorry
well these stories are show up on big 10
network com so you can read these
stories on big 10 network com we're
actually doing also very simple stock
market stories so the company narrative
science now has actual clients and some
of them will will attribute and some of
them will not attribute depending on
whether they actually want to make it
clear that there are stories are being
written by machines and some of them are
happy to say that they are and many of
it turns out are not so happy to say
that and we've gone back and forth on
whether that's whether that matters to
us or not to customers who I can
actually tell you about our big ten
network com which is a joint venture of
the Big Ten and Fox Sports again and
then also Forbes does are we do stock
market updates on Forbes those stories
are much simpler by the way but anyway
if you want to read these you can go
here
um you know there's a lot of data at
mrs. this is a commonplace point I mean
there's a tremendous amount of data out
there and we all understand that the
data it's an incredible opportunity and
an incredible challenge at the same time
the data will be has to be has made
actionable if it's going to be if it's
going to make a difference and what will
it mean to make it action well either
it's going to be actually taken by the
machines automatically on the base of
the date and that's going to happen a
lot but sometimes the data is going to
have to be presented to people to make
decisions and if you ask how are we
thinking about doing that right now i
would say that for the most part people
are thinking about visualization so a
lot of work and visualization comes down
to we're going to have to figure out a
way to make the data understandable to
people so i'm just going to say that
narrative is actually a time-honored
method of conveying information and and
for some kinds of things especially
things that have some of a temporal
component they seem like a really good
way of actually presenting that we
talked about all these things here's a
partial list of the baseball angles in
case you're interested what does it know
about baseball these are kind of these
are kinds of patterns it has that it's
looking for and again these are all
built by hand so a lot of our job
actually as technologists has to come up
with tools that make it easy to do this
and libraries of these things that allow
us to do abstraction properly I'll give
you an example if a team could win
because of one player doing a great job
or because everybody does a good job a
company can beat its earnings
expectations for the quarter because
every division did a little bit better
than expected or because one division to
dramatically better than expected in
those situations strike me is very
analogous in my mind and right now when
we write these things we're writing them
separately but I think in my mind we
have to actually get this abstractions
right so that we can do that i'll give
you another example of the kind of thing
i'm very excited about right now we're
coming to the end of the talk and i
apologize i'll summarize quickly i'm
very excited about situations like this
a team gets a lot of hits gets a lot of
men on base doesn't get a lot of scores
runs loses the game a team gets a lot of
yardage completes a lot of passes gets a
lot of first downs doesn't score a lot
of touchdowns loses the game okay a
company
you know increases market share launches
new products blah blah blah blah that
still remains only doesn't improve its
profits very much okay I mean one of
these situations have in common what
they have in common is you're achieving
your instrumental goals and you're
failing to achieve your ultimate
external objective okay so sometimes
this is called failing to capitalize on
your opportunities right you build the
preconditions for achieving some success
and then fail to ultimately put it
together to achieve the success that's a
good example of an egg of a kind of
semantic angle that I'm interested in
getting into these machines to be able
to tell those stories I'm also going the
choice of vocabulary right is that just
interesting for you you know I think
it's really interesting but we have I
have nothing interesting to say about it
I mean I think it's a phenomenal I think
it's a great problem but we show that
well we have a lot a lot we do I mean so
11 couples only take a couple things
about that and so I'm the variants that
I am always most interested in is the
variance that makes meaningful
difference in other words I'm telling it
from the winners point of view or the
losers point of view or this is what
really happened in the game so it
changes how we're going to talk about it
it is certainly the case that if you
read a lot of our stories over and over
and over again we should actually be
thinking about other kinds of variation
I wish I could say to you that every
single variation we put in there is a
thoughtful decision it isn't always you
obviously have to put some variation of
lexical choice in just that they don't
all read the same way even though and I
think that's fine I have nothing against
that that's probably the place where
we're going to start doing our mining by
the way I mean that's a place where I
think that we could do a better job
gathering that stuff statistically to do
I mean I think starting at the edges is
where you probably make progress
automating some of this stuff I could
certainly see doing the Marty Hearst
kind of thing where I take for instance
the bunch of stuff about the team or a
bunch of the data and the names that
were relevant to a sentence that we
generated and go out and find a lot of
other sentences that mentioned exactly
the same things and see what words they
used and at the very least you could
present that to a human to mind if you
didn't do anything more intelligent with
it
I'm interesting this also like this is
what a comeback looks like in baseball
this is what a comeback looks like a
basketball this is what it held off
looks like in basketball and we don't do
this yet either but I'm kind of
interesting the idea of getting a
program to say here's a story with the
same angle the same actors but different
details same angle same details
different actors that that's this is
sort of compare and contrast in some
ways right same angle cross domain or
the imposing angle like the last time
they were in this situation they held
them off but this time they failed to
hold them off and they lost the game
right I think that's kind of a nice that
will enrich the stories a lot I don't
know a lot more time on talk a little
bit briefly about yeah we'll talk a
little bit about about about theme theme
attic for that theme so these angles are
kind of like big themes I think they're
like I want one thing I actually came to
realize about sports now some time for
me to confess that i'm actually not
inherently interested in sports or in
sports writing so this mckay this was
this has a slightly ironic this was in a
slightly ironic moment in my career
really but I came to realize that the
reason why people like sports is that
sports are actually about human virtues
and failings I mean they're about their
about persistence or failing to persist
or heroism or failing to mean they're
about these kinds of human they're sort
of Greek in that way you know I mean
they have that kind of Greek they're
about big human themes really you know
and I'm really interested in these kinds
of themes they're very hard to detect
for machines to actually detect to look
at a situation and say actually look at
a story so here's an example of what I
mean the London riots just went on a
number of people characterize these
riots as by mentioning the the the the
epigram idle hands are the devil's
playground and that's what I mean by a
big theme so here's the theme a lot of
people when when the economy was melting
down about three or four years ago Hank
Paulson was a secretary the Treasury he
was in charge of the tarp it was not
uncommon to say putting Hank Paulson in
charge of the top harp is like setting
the Fox to guard the henhouse okay and
I'm actually a minister
this kind of tagging because it's not
topical exactly it's not topical tagging
this is topical tagging to do things
like it's a business story or it's a
political story or it's a story about
the tar it's not topical and it's not
sentiment it's sort of something else
and I'm kind of excited about it just
that you can see there 135 5,000 results
for this Paulson tarp glitters gold
actually got a fair number of things to
now probably what I want to do
eventually is I i I'm not sure I want to
use these numbers so so actually we're
looking at whether these numbers alone
are sufficient to know whether people
really thought this was a good label for
this or not but I think we're going to
have to look inside of the actual
documents and see whether somebody
suppose I said this is like this that's
kind of the that's kind of the ultimate
gold standard for that by the way new
stories don't do that reporters don't
say that because that's opinion izing
they'll only do it if they find somebody
to say that that they can quote okay
headline writers will say it because
headline writers have more leave
comments to new stories that's where
people put these labels on them it's in
the comments on the stories that you see
this kind of thing coming out this is an
example i want to show very quickly
something we built recently actually i
had nothing to do with this i was very
excited though because it whatever your
teacher a teacher you always are always
excited when your DNA kind of
intellectual DNA for better or worse
shows up and your students and our
student Patrick McNally and a student of
his named Don and I forgotten his last
name but they came up with this idea of
looking for the seven deadly sins on
Twitter and and again it's a relatively
simple model but here they are here's
slaw do anyone Mabel bed for Garfield or
ones will see snow too lazy to look
gluttony this is for you Susan could
really go for some peanut butter cookies
craving greed I need my money pronto
craving starbucks coffee wow how hard is
it to block the Raiders this is pissing
me off rivers pissed me off he just
stands there with a welcome mat I ate so
much sushi and now I'm in pain so
actually it's actually kind of fun to
watch these you know and I'm actually I
was thinking if we get accurate enough
we could imagine actually doing doing
you know today
today's world today today in World sin
you know what's today's what's today's
winner treat this is a super place yeah
yeah yeah I think so so but what I like
about it I mean so I think that AAA I
think that's right but be what I like
about it is I like the I like the I like
this angle on things I like saying you
know it's like this is a kind of way of
looking at the data and maybe this
really gets to the point I mean to
actually blow this out will often
require a lot of statistical work but
what I what I like about it is that it's
a way of looking at the data which
starts from some thematic point of view
that says the sins are actually a
particular lens through which to look at
what people are saying about the world
I'm going to skip this one a couple of
quick current projects so this is things
we're doing in our course this quarter
we're doing this Twitter profiling
system news and blog recommendations
based on your tweet history and this
solves a problem for if you're if you're
like a big organization people click all
over you all day long or type queries to
you and so you you can begin to
understand who they are what they care
about if you're a smaller organization
where do you get the data from and if
they if they're if they use Twitter you
might just get the data from them if
they will tell you what their twitter
handle is so actually and actually the
pawls as team has a project actually
something like this it turns out this
morning the news of the day I kind of
like this and it's sort of been done but
hasn't really been done like a lot of
cut there are things out there like CRM
systems that do like like salesforce com
well if you're going to meet with
somebody they'll bring up of course the
entire history of meetings with them but
also your emails with them or their
LinkedIn profile a bunch of things like
that get brought up automatically
there's a system called rapportive I
think that does that but I haven't seen
one two brings up news about the company
that actually says look look at your
calendar but there may well be in any
case we gave it to the students so it's
looking up at the very least you'll know
if the stock tank this morning before
you go in the door to meet somebody or
vice versa you know what I mean our new
CEO is named or whatever you know a new
product was launched so it finds about
it tries to look up the people you're
meeting within the organization they're
from and just display that to you based
on your calendar i mean the notion was
if you're a honcho of course you get a
briefing you get you
somebody actually I'm sure this still
printed out for that matter i'm sure
it's actually for a lot of people to get
put into a manila folder and handed to
them in the morning or something like
that you know when they get in the back
of their car it's given to them this is
the thing actually to do automatic news
and social media aggregation for city
council elections it was actually done
for the seattle city council elections
that just happened last week because
chicago's all romantic elections were
last year so we wanted to pick one that
was current I then discovered the
Seattle has a very bizarre system where
everybody's at large but they run for
at-large seats against each other which
makes no sense to me whatsoever but okay
it's really crazy in other words there's
there are there's like a seat called
seat seat one and two people compete for
seat one citywide and their seat three
and two people compete for c3 citywide I
don't get it okay you know it's like a
very odd odd model but so this is not a
deep project but this is a good example
of widows like a need so there are a
number of people of clever people in the
news business who have done things like
okay I'm going to do automatic
aggregation of Twitter feeds from the
campaigns and their facebook page and
I'll actually automatically look up the
news i'll have some query running in the
background that will always feed me you
know stuff okay um it's surprising how
many news organizations do this by hand
a news organization that i visited
earlier this year they were very proud
to show me a thing that they had done
for a city council election where and i
looked at it and it was like everything
was stale and I said wow this is this is
kind of said yeah I'm not updating it
anymore I said what do you mean and he
said well yeah I put all this data in
and I actually curate by hand every day
I go through new stories and I put the
links in there and I'm like you know
what I was thinking was are you kidding
me but okay so it's not a big deal it's
not a big project but if we make this
simple and configurable people will this
will matter in news organizations I mean
it's not rocket science but they don't
you know things are not rocket science
if they can maybe robust reliable and
easy to use will get used the poor
commoner is we're looking to see if we
can identify earmarks and federal
legislation I'd like to do state
legislation as well if we can get this
to work I think we can twitter debate is
sort of like the sort of the Twitter
version of news at seven you know tweets
are very atomized
and I'm wondering whether whether you
can make them a little more meaningful
by putting them in a context so
originally thought we would say like
Perry on Social Security and Romney on
Social Security and have a
back-and-forth Twitter does not afford
it does not afford that it you can't do
an extended debate and Twitter what I
think you can do is a BA it's like you
can do point counterpoint final comeback
okay so we're actually trying to
organize that's the rhetorical structure
we're trying to organize tweets into
topically speaking for for political for
political candidates so that's that's
that project and again I think kind of
fun quick a blurb about us we just got
this I mean we've been doing things like
this vert you know we I think is
everybody discovers you know you build a
cool project and then getting it
actually out into the world is like an
entire other universe of pain that you
may or may not actually have any
capacity to do I mean even an
organization like this where you're
sitting on the edge of an entire
gigantic campus of people whose job it
is to build and ship products that
people worldwide I'm sure getting their
attention and getting them they're
getting their mind share and getting
them to say no really we do want what
you have and get you know it's a
nightmare isn't it you know so and we
had we had the same problem when we
build these really cool prototypes and
then they just fall they fall on the
ground and nobody would ever pick them
up and use them and so we got tired of
that the knight Foundation it turns out
was also tired of that they've been
seating a lot of technology in the new
space for the last five years and felt
it had a good impact in terms of
building interest and expertise in the
field but the specific technology
projects we're not necessarily getting
picked up and used so we start talking
together about our joint pain here and
eventually decide that we would actually
build an incubator or development system
thing for these 4 News technologies at
Northwestern so technology that we
invent also technology that are invented
elsewhere you know will come into that
pipeline and get built out it still is a
fair amount of money they put behind it
they put about four million dollars
behind it over the next four years which
goes a long way in a university and and
what can I i think i'm hopeful you know
i mean i'm loving what narrative science
is doing right now but that's an example
of going the other way i mean that i
believe i hope that we'll be able to
have our
technology have impact through that but
that's a big deal that's you're starting
a company and you're getting venture
capital and you're getting management
and it's a completely different again
it's a lot of work to do that I'm hoping
that this will be a way of actually sort
of speeding that at least earlier on
stages to see that in this case well
we're starting out with media partners
in the Chicago area so large and small
media organizations and very broadly
construed it could be nonprofits or
governmental organizations you know you
the PTA or or the sun-times or WBEZ
which is the local public radio station
so all these organizations were starting
to work with we have actually hired an
executive director from the media
business in Chicago who actually knows
all these people personally so that's
been a really great boon to us and we're
starting to hire some developers because
again there are things you can't ask
graduate students to do like you know
use version control I mean they do use
version control version control is the
date is appended to the file name you
know that's the kind of version control
that and I understand that because
that's what I did when I was a student
too but when you're actually going to
ship product to the Chicago sun-times it
turns out you can't possibly do that so
so you know it's like yes you will we
will use git and we will actually do
these kinds of things so that's it's
pretty exciting i'm looking forward to I
think the Twitter profiling project is
probably the first we're going to be
shipping out and you know if they work I
mean we're not really sure what the
final thing is I mean if something
actually clicks I mean we might actually
just put it out open source it might be
the case that other companies get
started I don't know I want to thank my
research partner Chris Hammond all of
our students Nick Allen and John templin
built the narrative generation system
with us J buzzing of course did wats and
along with number of other folks there
Francisco iacobelli did tell me more Joe
way Lou did number of the projects i
showed you compare and contrast Patrick
McNally did the last thing I just showed
you on lust and and Lydon I guess less
was not up there but sloth and gluttony
innate Nichols did news at seven sean is
doing the Twitter profile
anything I guess that's I'll stop there
Earl Wagner kind of helped me dream up
and actually did more of it than me the
thematic tagging stuff and these are my
colleagues over in the school journalism
thank you very much further questions
many people ask thank you i enjoyed that
let me know if any of these things seem
interesting to you I I mean I I'm really
here partly because I feel like um you
know our kind of guy realize this is
still running so I'm gonna choose my
words are you know we tended we tend to
be pretty seat of the pants I'll put it
that way in terms of how we get these
things built and a lot of the times that
works pretty well and sometimes it
doesn't work quite as well so if any of
these projects seem interesting to you
for example I think it's certainly been
talking about what we might do to sort
of push them forward together some day
three or four teen idol groups so one is
where I are she learning right social
great thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
