hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
how he has come and helped out a number
of events for me presenting about blend
you work in the the product group for
blend right and so he's going to talk
tonight about blend he's going to fill
up most of the time talking about blend
as it applies to your zamel and c-sharp
development and then I'm gonna come up
for just a little bit afterwards and
talk about how all of that all of the
blend goodness applies if you're doing
HTML and JavaScript development okay so
please welcome Hari Menon so you know
it's going been here so I work in these
amo design tools team we pretty much own
all's I motoring across every platform
like double appears in the light Windows
Phone and Windows Store so one big thing
that we did for the last release was uh
I don't know how many people have used
them at design and depth n anybody used
to so so def didn't designer was
completely different code base from
sorry yeah I should turn it on though oh
yeah so the death and co designer was
completely different from the blend one
so we had two different code based
language Microsoft so what we did for
lost release we took the blend designer
and moved out into vs as well so you are
the exact same experience in both
products a comment question than people
ask us then why do you have do different
products right you know if the same
designer the reason is we want it blend
to be a place where people do design
focus tasks and vs you have a lot of
Windows flying around in blend you only
have those things that you need to
accomplish your design tasks everything
else is actually hidden away you don't
have to worry about it and we as we want
to be a place where people can do our
complex operations like actually writing
code or actually doing the fracturing
and we wanted to actually make these
products different in that way going
forward will invest more overtime in
doing design tooling and blend and doing
probably more stuff like advanced in
talise sense or better of fracturing
features for vs so is everybody here
does amyl developer or like our DNA HTML
folks here HTML all right
so I know journey is going to talk about
HTML and JavaScript bed so but I thought
I should make my case for example as
well so uh why would you want to use
Amal if you being a dog Mandela before
the past let's say seven years you have
definitely touched it probably touched
WPF silverlight and Windows Phone it's
very easy to put your skills over the
exact same stuff saml almost all the
constructs are the same there are some
slight differences but not that many
that it would find that difficult to
move on for dela Paz new resemble you
know zamel is basically in describing
objects in a declarative model so it's
very powerful they can pretty much write
your entire you are in 0 there are
certain patterns like mvvm that allows
you to make sure that your application
UI and your data model or a logic is
actually very separate for Windows Store
that a lot of free third-party libraries
out there that help you get started on
this so you can drown the building
application in a very you know in a very
well architected fashion actually then
the sama platform team our ships a lot
of controls out of the box there are
some that you probably won't find that
you'll find JavaScript this point things
like men you fly out AB bar buttons but
some of these controls are available
from third party custom control
providers like tell Raiko radcontrols or
even there are open source libraries
like callistore that is available that
it can download using the new kid
manager initial studio itself that
provides these kind of controls for you
then if you want to write a custom
control it's very easy it's as simple as
deriving from a type and then you get
write a custom behavior and you have a
new control that you can share with
other people or you can use an
application so I'm gonna ask skip this
slide we already talked about this and
this is going to tell you like what we
offer in vs and what we offer in blend
in vs you can basically do things like
control creation layout property editing
basic data but in blend you have more
advanced functionality for example I can
actually edit part vectors you can
declare you know vector images in zamel
as parts and you can actually edit that
and blend you can do styling you can
edit templates edit control styles and
data templates you can do data binding
you can even edit states in a visual
manner you don't have to actually change
a state value or f5 and see how it's
going to look like an input
we do that with and blend itself and
I'll show you how then you can set
transitions and we even offer your ways
to import illustrator and Photoshop
files so you can import your assets
using blend and actually incorporate
that into your Windows 8 app so how do
you how do we help you get started up a
lot of time for the last release we
spend on actually creating a whole bunch
of templates like the grid app to split
up a lot of item templates like contract
that really helps we get started pretty
fast these applic the templates in
visual studio if you say no new project
you go to Windows Store you'll see a
great app right thatting is almost a
completely functional Windows Store app
it basically has a navigation built into
it it responds to layout changes like if
you snap your app to snap it'll actually
make the correct transition the UI and
all the plumbing is building for you
even things like up you know integration
solution manager is also a part of the
template so it's up to individuals I've
seen certain people actually build your
entire app starting from grid other
people actually take a new they create a
blank application and just selectively
import assets from the adapt and use it
so it's up to you but there's a whole
lot of functionality when the templates
and should definitely take a look at it
if you're going to start a new app is
the same thing for JavaScript as well
they have the exact same templates and a
couple of more in the JavaScript old we
also have item templates for contracts
like every Windows app should
theoretically if you know it makes sense
to support share and such contracts so
we have item templates that you
basically say hey add this new contract
we insert code and everything for you
such that it just works out of the box
so given should give that a try and go
through that in a couple of minutes okay
so at all seven months black manager
want me to actually go ahead and you
know builds what he hoped was a
good-looking app so I was like okay fine
I'll build something that with movies
and I really wanted to use some kind of
rest api so i choose flixster so um what
is he on the right is basically just a
grid with a couple of fancy images in
the background and a grid view that is
bound to some data source which is
actually live data one more thing in the
blend designer is that the blend design
is almost a full running Windows Store
we pretty much execute every piece of
code in your project and that helps us
actually give you ready Mississippi
experience what do you see on the UI in
blend is almost always up what you'll
see when you're actually fi and a
provider you have the coded data model
everything hooked up so what you see
here is I'm actually talking to a life
flixster service and that data is on the
designer itself there's naught F 5 from
the app is actually f5 I just took a
screenshot and lend itself now um so
this basically what we walk through in
demo is I'll take a nap from the start
and we try building something that is
similar using blend itself and probably
not I don't have to write any hand code
an example so let's do that before
before that let me just show you the
template that I'm talking about and what
you need to know about it so this is
going to do a new project select me to
the store by the way is all publicly
available bit so it's not going you know
new or fancy it is just a develop in our
TM so sorry official through 2012 with
update to so I'm just going to hit okay
and just grew up in a group Adams page
so you have this exact same design and
blend as well you can create president
vendors well uh if you look at the
common folder you know there are a whole
bunch of things here that's very useful
for example layout a web page every page
in this particular template derives from
this particular type and this actually
has things like it responds to you know
your keyboard input so is a very good
reference point for you to figure out
how do you want respond to keyboard
input how do you wanna respond to touch
input how do you like our your
suspension managed to work everything is
actually enable in this particular
template so you can just take a look at
it whenever you're building your app and
probably copy over stuff into your app
and it'll just work it's very well
tested as well so it's a good starting
point for you ah and if i do if i click
the project
and I go to Windows Store you can
basically see we have contracts like
file open search contract and share
contract when you add these contracts we
inject code into your solution so that
you know the correct hookups to the
windows minority is actually set up so
when you fi the app bring up the charms
bar or chums bar and hit share contract
the page will automatically get hooked
into it so all that is done for you
behind the covers and that's pretty
awesome so that's it but the templates
are please feel free to you know stop me
at any time and ask questions if you
have anything around these topics so let
me start it off so I've just opened this
application here I'm just going to show
you the sam'l for a bit as you can see
all it does is I have a collection view
source that's bound to a groups in my
data model the data model I've actually
declared as a static resource this
collection view the reason why we use
collection view source is basically to
support grouping because I want to group
by like you know the rating or audience
rating or the critics rating so I have
to provide a group data source and CBS
converts a group data source into
something that the grid view control in
the list view control recognizes and
then shows data you know you know group
by format so i have a datatemplate let's
not look at that i'll create a template
from scratch there and all my
application has this time as a park this
basically defines this guy over here
which have imported from illustrator so
the grid view is now this items whose
property is set to the grouped items
view cir that we saw about so first i
want to basically create a simple tile
that shows the image of the movie and
the name of the movie so what I can do
for that is right click on the grid view
control go to edit additional templates
Edit item template and say create empty
so this box lets me choose where to put
the data template so common thing if
you're going to use the data template
only in one place you might as well as
put in the same document the reason
being Glenn has much better support for
restoring the same document you can edit
these resources within the scope of the
stage itself let's see if I put that an
app
vacation when you do edit template again
we'll have to take you to a blood sample
to edit it so we can't edit in place so
if you put in this application blend can
allow you to edit this thing in place so
I'm just going to hit okay you can see
that new data templates created a grid
was here algunos created as well by
default and one it's like the grid and i
can see that there's nothing there right
so i'm going to set a height of it so
let's say 200 the high to 250 can see
that ran during the design surface
itself and because it's a grid we
support a whole lot of design time for
grid i can basically click here and
create a row instantly so I would row
here you can see that low definition
everything was set right just simply
hovering here just hover my mouse over
so that's that's release for grid then
I'm gonna go to the assets panel I'm
going to search for the text now let's
text block right yeah I know drag drop
that in this area so you can see every
single item now has a text block to it
and I'm going to just do a reset layout
so the extra margin everything is
removed and it's fitz completely into
this particular area defined by the
queer now i'm going to do a data binding
i'm going to select this text property
over here and hit create data binding
okay that actually have on a different
screen so I which one so yeah the high
decoder will start working yeah so r
this is up so when you get to 11 it's
absolute pixels to one star basically
sizes up how do I explain it for example
star star means equal right so to 11
basically means if you have let's say
you have 100 pixels available are 200 *
will translate to the current relative
layout so if you divide the space in the
ratio exactly related to the sizes thing
is not exact pixels though it'll
translate it self so I have that here
I'm just going to click on text
create data binding and you can see that
blend now actually flows the data
context over so right now we know what
properties are beta and data context for
it to bind to so I can just go ahead and
select this play title and click OK you
can see that now that you can see the
name of the movies here right the next
what I'd like to do is I'm going to
search for an image control drag it up
the top one over here right click reset
layout it fits in I'm now going to bind
the source property to a property in my
data model I'm going to click search
create data binding and select profile
so that's the easy part that it's that
easy to actually design a datum plane
plan all you got to do is create a
datatemplate you start binding to your
property and data model and instantly
lights up and is actually live data from
the service itself I don't have any
sample data anything it's actually
running pure user code at this point so
we basically have some form arm you know
something that you want so I'm going to
be a little bit more prettier and we'll
select the text block and I can do
operations like group into a border I'm
going to select the bottle go over to
the property inspector and just select
something like black I can select the
image over here and change this property
so that is uniform to fill so it kind of
fills up the space Urkel you know that
space that's available and I have
something similar to my actual finished
running app nebula scope up so right now
I'm the data template editing scope so I
need to scope up to come back to the
actual tree the visual tree of the
current document wouldn't come up and
see the freshers you can see everything
here what I'm going to do next is
basically ad groups to this grid view I
can do that by right-clicking on the
grid view again and execute the ad group
style command so now basically a new
group cell was added to this grid view
the whole zamel everything's inside it
for you have nothing to worry about but
I need to start it now so what I can do
for that is right click on the grid view
again go to edit group style edit had a
template and hit edit current you can
see there's a small space over there and
the select the text lock go to the text
property
we hit data binding and you can see that
even we float on the correct schema to
an item in the group so in select title
and it ok so its title is pretty tiny at
this fine I want to set to a style so by
the way all the templates comes with a
file called standard size exam oh it's
basically windows approved styles for
like what you just watch your size of
your page header be what's the size of
your subtitle be so all that is
prepackaged with the template itself so
I've added that particular file to my
solution as well so I'm just going to
set edit style applied research now i'm
going to set it up at a textile and the
style is instantly applied i can select
the text block again just say group into
a butter set a slightly different color
and that's it then I'm going to scope up
I wouldn't really change the whole
layout of my group you can become a
final application it basically has a
group on the group out on the left side
and items on the right but this is like
top down I want to change that lay out
completely I can do that by going up
right clicking the grid view again going
to edit group style edit container start
sorry yeah Adam cutting style and had
edit current so you can see a whole box
is being drawn around the hole in the
group I can select the grid so this
content presenter is where the header is
actually the header of the group has
actually placed at the items control is
used to display the items in that
particular group right now there is just
one so i'm going to select the content
for center sorry the grid and i'm going
to delete the rows off i don't really
need rose i need columns so i can just
delete the rows are then i'm just going
to add a column over here select the
content press enter go to properties and
set the column index 20 and the column
span 2 1 i'll select the image that is
items control over here said the
column two one the Khans man to one as
well you can see that basically it moved
out of the way right but it is kind of
big though that is surprising oh yeah I
should set aside for it so we can see
that now it's two different things I can
set the item's control set a margin to
it so it stays a bit away from the title
I can use a property inspector for
pretty much everything set up like 40
pixels I'm going to scope scope up for a
moment at a grid view edit group style
had a template select the bottle and set
a height and lit to it
so that looks a bit better still not
really good we'll just go back into
editing be our continued style again let
me just see why is so far away
one more
yeah that's not really behaving well by
this time it should actually go up but
so basically if you make a little more
edits you can actually move the header
template to talk and keep the crew
bottom on the left side itself so if I
just fi this application right now I'm
just going to move that over function
windows function make sure so there's
one problem in the default template I
really don't like this whole blue bottle
over here like how would you change that
this only happens when there is like
when you actually selected element so i
can use blend to edit any state a state
in a control in zamel is basically what
we call visual states it is a control
using something called visual state
manager I think what a visual state as a
user input so they could be things like
check state or selected state selecting
state dragging state so examine what you
can do is you can specify in these user
inputs are in these actions I want my UI
to change so and so so basically States
is just a property back it's a set of
properties you set to modify the look
and feel of your element based on some
user interaction and these states are
internally called by the controls logic
so when a control sees a mouse over it
actually calls internally Mouse
overstate the mouse over state will
contain some properties settings which
will basically change the look and feel
of the control so I'm just going to
close this come back what i can do is
i'm gonna right click the edit grid view
go to edit additional templates
container style edit a copy mmm what
does that go to
sorry that's fine i'm going to go to
States if I go to States and I so you
can see a whole lot of states here like
normal normal as a base state this is
what the control as an asst normal
pushing then there's no user interaction
whatsoever we were you know presses on
it you can see that there is a different
when it's disabled week and appoint over
and if you come down you can see a whole
lot of selection States so you can see
selected over here so in selected you
can see the whole blue border with the
check mark I really don't want this to
be shown it's like the state I want to
slice it'll just be black so what i can
do is open the document offline and
blend and you can see these red mark
these red record buttons it shows that
this prop this element has been changed
in this state so i can further drill
down I can keep drilling down until I
find which element actually change so I
can go you can see that hey this is the
selected check mark so probably in this
state I can set it collapsed and it's
gone so you don't really have to do
multiple iterations of f5 change
something come back see how it is you
can basically do those interactions here
change those values without having to
multiple round trips then I can go a bit
more I can select the selected border
you can see hey this has a stroke over
here I want to change that lets say a
different shade of black and there's
actually two borders so have to change
in a couple of places but content border
it's full crown yeah change this guy as
well
gimme a sec
hmm
the change
yeah it's plaque so it's right sorry i
thought it was actually low still so
it's pretty easy to actually modify
states and stuff and blend itself so um
have you guys ever written states and
everything by hand or do you guys all do
writing stage by hand you do hand coding
right pretty much all the time so you
can see it's much easier to actually use
plan in these situations the last thing
I'm going to show you is working with
animations so blend has a full-fledged
animation editor you can create a you
know traditional applications using
keyframe animations color animations
extra they also support actually
altering team animations theme
animations is a part of the windows 8
animation library so if you open the
control panel and stuff the new settings
app and in Windows you can see things
fading and fading out you don't really
have to write those animations you are
anymore by changing the opacity or
visibility of the object there are pre
can't animations like fade out animation
Faden animation that you can use to
basically get those effects in your
windows 8 applications without having to
hard-code any of those so there's this
whole said I think there's on 14
animations in whole and blend allows you
to order those animations within the
context of a state we have full support
for that so I'll show you a quick demo
of that ah let's say I really want to
bring up I'm gonna have a text block you
wouldn't add a textblock to this page
i'm going to call it I just want to be
the movie name I really like the whole
assume idea of things moving the
background a slightly moving background
so I'm going to simulate something
similar using team animations and
standard animations I'm gonna call it um
let's say dark shadows or something i'm
we right click on it again edit style
i'm going to apply a new style to it
like the header textile it was pretty
big i'm just going to put in a fancy
angle but i can use blends out on our
system to actually transform anything so
i can just click here just my mouse is
not the best okay yeah oops yeah my
master on behaving i'm just going to
change the property in the property
inspector itself
okay just put an angle I'm going to
select the text block change its
foreground property some other color so
basically if you select this particular
button over here it shows all the
resource in your projects you know can
really just select it from here as well
someone's is selected to this color
which is not really visible this is
better and what I'm going to do I'm go
to the states panel I'm going to add a
new state group so these state groups
over here like full screen landscape
filled portrayed snap etc is to allow
your application to respond to different
states so basically you can actually it
I can select a snap state and say that
hey in snap state I don't really want my
title to be shown because there's so
much space less rides lately heaven 26
pixels so i can select this and set the
visibility to collapse if I want to and
you can see hey in snap state that
particular enemy you know the particular
object is no longer there but if i go
back to filled our full screen it comes
back so it's pretty easy to modify
states and stuff and blend itself now
what I'm going to do is about a new
state group then I'm going to add a new
state to it a state group is basically
you don't have to rename it or anything
it's just basically a collection of
states there's nothing special to it so
I'm just going to call it visual state 1
i'm read one more state legislation
state 2 in which one state one i would
like you know just not to be there and
we should state to i want to make it
come in with a windows 8 animation so
i'm going to select dark shadows i'm
going to select this wish you a straight
name over here you can see a new
property editor show up here it's called
team animations from this list i can
select let's say the fade-out theme
animation which i actually the box comes
on a different one that turns right yeah
i can select which element of an apply
to i'm going to say i'm gonna apply to
the text block and click OK you can see
it disappears here i'll go to visual
state 1 i'm going to add a fade in
animation to it
you can see it come back so in my code
behind all have to do is when my
application loads up or something I just
have to say a visual state manager go to
state and give the state name and then
visual signature will actually force
this place to go to that state and you
can see that thing come in with a proper
window state animation in blender you
can even preview these animations are by
clicking this button over here it's
called transition preview we generally
turn this off because of perf reasons
because we will have to render
everything at 30 frames a second so if
you click on it and then I start talking
with in the States you can see the
animation actually happening it fades
and slightly in runtime it looks much
better so that's how we can work with
team animations there's a whole bunch of
team animations you can use but
primarily what I have seen people views
is the fading the pop out pretty much
most other ones are very specific to
certain scenarios for example this if
you look at the app split closed team
animation the only place used in Windows
is for the combo box to come up so when
you click on the comm box you can see it
like pop and then expand right so that
is the animation that windows users to
simulate that so it's pretty rare to use
some of these animations but fading and
pop art a pretty common so let's do all
you know one of the let's do a keyframe
animation now so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to group this guy let me just
come back to base go back to s its final
i miss liquid over here group into
another career i want to have a really
big of image in the background that's
slowly moves where the application is
running it basically moves from X to Y
and Y again to y- and just moves around
slowly throughout life to an application
based look like zoomed right you have
the whole artistic moving around so I
just want to seem like something like
that it's what I can do for that is a de
image control
to this grid over here said image
controls source to one of my you can see
that it's over there I'm going to set it
to reset layout all so it fills the
whole space and it's in the background
but I want to move it right so if i move
it i really wanted to be bigger than the
actual image so that the user does not
see anything a different shade actually
coming in so what I'm going to do I'm
going to go to scale I'm going to make
it two and a half times bigger than you
sure oh sorry I did not this is the one
so it actually is much bigger than the
normal size is basically scaled up I'm
going to go here add a new story board
so there's new story board here what i
can do is what i can say is that when
the time is four seconds i want the
image to move from left to right by 100
pixels so i can select for over here
select the image go to the translate
transform this is one thing in Windows
that'll be very careful about when
you're writing animations there are two
kinds of animations dependent animations
at independent animations independent
animations are those like if you modify
our transforms like you can do a
translate transform you can make it you
know rotate transforms those things are
independent those happen but you know
those happen under threat and doesn't
really block the UI thread from
executing but things like you want to
change the height and width of an
element using an animation that'll cause
the UI try to block because now we have
to the whole thing measure and arrange
and relay out the entire thing so be
always so in low powered arm devices
blocking the writer is not good you will
actually have that's why when insert an
application you'll see starter while
moving is because they might be doing
some animations and stuff but actually
blocking the UI thread so in videos
you'd be very careful because we have to
support multiple form factors and great
different kinds of tablets out there
never use dependent animations always
use independent animations and you're
safe with transforms but modifying like
margins and widths and Heights not a
good idea so that's what I'm doing you
know I could do the same thing by making
bigger I could have done a bit I can
just modify I don't want to i'm actually
applying a transform at that point so
here I'm just going to set the translate
to i want to move it to x like 100
pixels right yes if you if I tried
modifying the wit the blend will show
dialogue saying that hey you will modify
the been an animation you know click if
you wanna proceeds some people know what
they're doing right in certain situation
they might have to do you know dependent
animations they have to take the risk if
you're a lot of elements guarantee it's
going to cost performance issues an
application so I just move it 100 pixels
right and now I can just play the
animation over here clicking the image
slowly moving to the right and this
all independent this happens without
blocking the UI thread so as long as it
transforms your good and I can just yeah
I'm just going to go right and let's say
at five seconds I wanted to mow another
10 pixels down I can play the animation
again you can see it slowly actually
moving and then at that point it
actually moves down it's pretty easy I
can modify any number of animation
create all number kinds of these
animations modifying any of the
defendant sort of independent properties
and that is England um you can then set
the property of this I wanted to loop
forever so all I have to do is like the
animation over here sorry and just set
the repeat behavior forever and I'm good
it'll keep looping in as long as
application alive it explicitly called
the storyboard stop so that's pretty
much it for my demo section and if you
guys have any questions please go ahead
and I can show you a lot more features
if you want me to or anything specific
you're interested in just let me know
yeah this is a update to CDP to which is
just popular publicly released like last
week on 21st yeah but it's same for
Metro it's the same for Windows Store it
has the same as RT and there's no
difference we just added support for WPF
and Silverlight in update of City veto
and oh we added our illustrator and
Photoshop support for Metro as well so
uh that's pretty much it from blend so
we have like I basically showed you like
document outline as its panel I've
showed you um you know design surface I
should property inspector you a couple
of things like device panel which is
pretty cool you don't really have to
leave a you know so it's supposed
multiple resolutions right if you want
really test will have to change the
monitor in a resolution of application
of your monitor or a physical machine or
find machines that support the
destination but in blend you can just go
ahead and click that and we will
actually render the design surface at
that resolution so you don't really have
to deploy to multiple devices to verify
if your application scale as well you
just have to use a device panel and
select the solution that you want testin
oh we also allow you to
preview how your application would look
like if it's in this you know like
landscape mode or fill all you have to
do is you know click the snap you fill
be over here and we resize the entire
design surface to only fit in that area
so you can see how the application works
and fills view you can click snap so you
can only have space enough for snap into
the same thing for portrayed as well so
we provide a lot of functionality that a
device would and what I use of wood
feeling device within the device panel
and we can even change your theme so as
you know you know if you want black
applications we support dark light that
application all the choices or if the
user is high contrast and we have to
render things in high contrast you can
even preview those and blend itself you
don't really have to go and change your
property you know you have changed
system properties to reflect and test it
out you can do all within blend up
another one thing haven't talked about
was responded resume and that's pretty
much our it's something that helps
people and refactoring and stuff like a
pretty much you can see all the
resources in application sorted by group
by the document it's coming from it can
do complex things like it can delete a
resource deliver your resource means you
might break exam because these results
might be using Moulton places but here
you can actually say converter local
value it'll actually bake all the
references make copies of resource and
local place itself so that your exam is
always valid we do all the refractory
heavy work for you so that's what the
resource panel is used for you can also
directly edit click on it and we'll open
the style directly so you can edit
in-place well as well so that's pretty
much it let's take it run down of the
major blend features that's available at
this point any questions questions i'm
going to give re around the laws thank
you
my portion of the presentation is going
to be quite short relatively because
you've already seen all the features of
blend and how he's already showed off
all the cool stuff that it can do and
for the most part blend is a single
story for developing your Windows 8 apps
whether you're using zamel or HTML but
the nature of the different language
stacks HTML CSS and JavaScript and then
zamel and c-sharp means that there are
going to be a lot of differences in the
app still so when if you are a web stack
developer you're going to come to expect
what you find in blend for the web stack
developers and if you're as an we'll c
sharp hopefully you'll you'll also come
to expect what you see in blend for
those developers you'll see a lot of in
the c-sharp zamel stack to see a lot of
strong typing you know a lot of
references all the way back down to
exactly where a type was declared and
everything and you don't always get that
in HTML and JavaScript you know that
when you're when you're a web stack
developer your kind of shooting from the
hip there's a lot of stuff that that the
Ides just can't tell you because it's
all dynamic and there's no way for it to
possibly know what type this variable
might be or whatever so you'll notice
all of those differences between the two
but the way that they implemented blend
for HTML and javascript is really
exciting in my opinion first of all it's
it's all new I haven't seen any IDE that
does this that we've had a lot of kind
of code based IDEs in the past like your
notepad plus plus they're just you know
Raj is work with the code only of course
visual studio has had incredible web
stack ID support for a long time very
code based support everybody tries to
get into a WYSIWYG HTML support it seems
like developers never really liked it
and I'm one of them I've never really
liked any of the wussy wig support that
I've found in any IDE but blend is
actually the first time I've ever really
liked a design based ide for the web
stack and I'll show you exactly why so
I've just opened any project I'm opening
my code show project it's the the front
page looks like a lot of Windows 8 in
that it's just
got a grid of tiles in my case it they
represent demos I'll just go ahead and
run the project here so you can see what
code show looks like when it's running
and then I'm going to jump over into
blend with this same project i have it
set for a remote machine and it's not
able to communicate with my surface
which is currently at my house thank you
for that and by the way i'm hitting ctrl
f5 to make it faster i always like to
remind people of that and also getting
this issue with the fact that it's
already installed on this machine i have
the store version because this is
actually in the store you can't see that
i have the store version installed on
the machine and so it's not letting me
run the app so all i have to do is go to
my Start screen I know you can't see
this go to my Start screen and uninstall
code show real quick and then I can go
run my app and and use the the built
version my change in question oh you can
just different
patient other than that one doesn't look
oh and it didn't like that so let me go
ahead and try to change the name he's an
aries tip not that this is all that
important we're going to see V app
running and blend in just a second but
this would be nice too so here you would
put something on there oh yeah it's
freaking out oh well well we'll just go
ahead and see it in blend that won't
shouldn't be a problem hopefully this
stops though okay whatever that was I
have no explanation for that okay so
here we are we're working in visual
studio because we are a developer or the
code guy okay we like to look at
functions and methods and we we love
curly braces so we're using visual
studio for this but then all of a sudden
we need to switch over to kind of design
mode or maybe we're handing off the
project to a designer right somebody
who's going to be looking at the exact
same project but from the perspective of
a designer so I'm going to right click
on code show and open and blend now I
actually shouldn't have done that
because I already had it open there we
go so here it is in blend and you can
see that one of the huge movements
flickering a little bit one of the huge
advantages of blend is that it's already
it's already showing me my app boy I
wonder if that's going to stop that's
good now uh maybe I just shouldn't talk
oh well you guys can interpolate so
blend is already showing me what it
looks like now let me tell you a little
enough about code show so that you can
tell what blend is doing for me here
code show doesn't have a little
JavaScript array of demos that it that
it loads up it it has instead a demos
folder and when my app starts an
asynchronous process begins that
enumerates all of the demos folders in
the project and for each one it builds
some meta information about that demo
and it creates a tile for it or it
creates the the list that the tiles are
based on
so all of that javascript is actually
running in blend so this is the this is
the first ide that I've ever seen where
you're actually designing at the same
time that you're executing and there's a
lot of power in that you guys saw it in
the sam'l side and you'll see it in the
HTML side to which is perhaps even more
impressive given the nature of HTML and
JavaScript but you know the the engine
the JavaScript engine that's driving
Internet Explorer 10 that engine is
running right now that's the same exact
engine that's driving what you see in
blend now let me go ahead and click on
some of these elements in here and you
can tell that I'm in design mode right
when I click on that I get a little
handles around it like I want to resize
that well that's design mode but then I
can flip up to interactive mode does the
saml side have the same type of switch
doesn't have that switch so i can switch
it to interactive mode and then you'll
see that all my ide chrome goes away and
my flickr enhances its not flickering
over here it looks just beautiful over
here but so all of my chrome goes away
and i'm actually looking at my app now
as if i was a user of the app i'm
browsing the app ok so now clicking on a
tile doesn't it doesn't give me design
handles around it instead it navigates
to that demo in question so what we were
talking about is the fact that when
you're in blend you're like in design
mode but then you just flip the switch
and it takes you to interactive mode and
the real reason to do that is so that
you can change your state you can change
the page that you're currently on or if
you're in a card game you can flip a
card over or something like that you
want to change your state like a user
would right well you change that state
and then you flip back out of
interactive mode and back into design
mode and the beautiful thing here is
that you still maintain that state so
you're still on the page you navigated
to if you were playing a card game and
you flip the card over it still flipped
over if you know anything about
javascript and HTML you know the way
that we interact with the HTML elements
is by adding little classes to two
different elements you know you decorate
it with the flip
attribute with the flipped class and
then your CSS knows how to style that
card and maybe show the image or or do
an animation or whatever well the all
those classes are constantly changing
their values and all of those class
values are maintained whenever you flip
out of interactive mode and back into
design mode okay so that's the nice
thing so now here I am in in design mode
on this page actually what I meant to do
was while I was still an interactive
mode to swipe over here and look at this
grid now you know in zamel you've got a
grid right well when when we were
releasing windows 8 and giving people
the ability to program for it in either
zamel or HTML we said we're really going
to need to have feature parity here
we're going to need to give people the
same powerful grid implement that in in
HTML that we have in zamel so Microsoft
implemented did that the dash ms grid
that's currently our vendor proprietary
prefixed version of the grid CSS
attribute which is a standard in w3c
it's just not really implemented by any
of the other browsers yet so we had to
kind of jump ahead and make sure we got
that thing implemented so that we could
reach feature parity with zamel so this
grid we have the same powerful grid in
HTML that we do in zamel and i'm
actually using this grid in a way i
probably wouldn't normally to be a whole
bunch of little tiny cells so let's jump
back out of interactive mode and see how
it handles those cells I can go click
and now notice when I click one time it
it actually doesn't know what it is
there's a bunch of layered stuff here so
it doesn't know what it is that i wanted
to click on so it just highlighted the
containing element there but i can click
again and then it drills in a little bit
more and now it says now I know what
you're actually wanting to click on that
individual cell so I click on in on that
individual cell and you can see that
I've got all the chrome that allows me
to control that grid modify the sizes
and and all of that so really good
really good UI for
switching between design mode and
interactive mode now if i go back to
interactive mode and get myself back to
my hub page and then I flip out of
interactive mode you saw in the sam'l
how you got access to all of the styles
and the style inheritance so you can
drill into any element and figure out
why for instance the selected item had a
checkmark up in the top right corner
right well in HTML and JavaScript and
CSS we have cascading style sheets CSS
and so you have multiple style sheets
all these layered style sheets and a
style for instance the addition of a
little check mark or a blue outline or
something like that could come from
anywhere in this CSS inheritance there
might be at any given point six or ten
or twenty different style sheets
hopefully it's not that many different
style sheets that are responsible for
the styling of any given thing now it's
really cool the way this is implemented
because any element that I click on so
let me click on this animations tile
here I click a few times until it knows
that this is what I want to drill into
so this tile how does it get its width
if we look over at the right it tells us
that its width property is 250 pixels
but where does that come from you see on
the top it says winning properties that
means that it applied all of those
cascading style sheets and determined
that 250 pixels was the winning value in
other words maybe maybe the width of
that tile was specified down deep in in
the wind j/s CSS file for us but then
maybe we overrode it in our default CSS
and then maybe for the specific page we
overrode it again and said I want you to
be 250 pixels who knows what that
cascading inheritance was but though
when you have winning properties
selected here it actually tells you just
the winning one and the cool thing is
that it knows where that came from so if
I go and change 250 pixels to say 240
pixels it knows what seat which CSS file
to chase
change that in now if it is able to
change it for us than then ducky but
sometimes it's not let's look down at
some of these properties are grayed out
that means that it got that property but
it's in a CSS file that's read-only
usually that means it's in the wind j/s
there are two CSS files in the wind j/s
library you I light and you I dark in
this case I'm using UI light and so
actually if I hover over those i already
am you cannot edit this property because
it's declared in you I light dot CSS so
it's not going to let me change that one
okay sometimes I actually and again I'm
going to drill back into the CSS grid in
interactive mode and then flip and then
I'm going to scroll all the way to the
right flip back out of interactive mode
and I'm going to click on one of these
little grid items again now the
properties on the right takes a little
while for them to refresh the properties
on the right have a little blue outline
around them what do you suppose that one
needs any guesses they're also gray
that's a hint I can't change them why
not they're coming from JavaScript their
dynamically created it's created at
runtime these properties can't be
changed because basically you did it
with code so this whole grid I didn't do
that declaratively that would have taken
me a week I actually ran through a
couple loops and got some random color
numbers and and created that grid and
because I did that in JavaScript as
saying it's ridiculous for you to think
that you could come in here and change
this color to something else because
what do I change for you there's not a
CSS file that did this this was done
using javascript so it's really super
smart about where all these Styles came
from and what it needs to go change to
do this the thing that I think is really
cool is that for the developer because
zamel and c-sharp have we've done so
much work to give them quite a bit of
feature parity and because blend
actually really ties those together
really well now you have a bit of a
consistent develop
story where you understand blend and
where the properties are and and where
to go do things and it kind of means
that you can take your zamel c-sharp
skills and translate those right over to
the HTML Javascript world somewhat
there's you there's still the nature of
the beast in here and you still need to
kind of get used to it but okay so the
other cool thing that I want to point
out about blend using HTML and
javascript is that you've got the live
Dom running over here so all of those
however many billions of pixels I have
rendered there in that grid all of those
are a little tiny div and every single
one of those is available to me and my
life Dom because they actually exist so
even though these aren't declared in
HTML I still see them in my live Dom so
I could come over here and I could click
on one of these and I'm actually
grabbing that individual div element now
these ones I can't change because of
course they were created dynamically but
if I wanted to I could right click on
one of these and if I had access to it
actually let me just click on something
I do have access to like that and I
could add a new class II this is an h2
and so I could right click on that and I
could add a new class to that element
and then I could start filling out that
class and it gives me you know quite a
bit of code support down here in that
the whole time I'm designing I will also
have access to my HTML and my CSS I
can't actually change my CSS pain here
to a JavaScript but you you don't
usually want to write your JavaScript
and blend it doesn't give you nearly as
good as support okay so let me invite
Hari back up and we're going to go ahead
and transition from presentation to QA
and you guys can just fire whatever
questions you have at us and I might be
able to answer say fifteen percent of
them I wouldn't nothing would well and
ask zamel c-sharp questions as well do
you want to keep your microphone on for
Q&amp;amp;A I think we've broken he does
plan for the storyboard bunch of those
things in available for girls so the
question was what sort of animation
support do we have in the HTML
Javascript world the the animation
support is I would say not as rich as
sam'l but it is rich and getting richer
and it's all due to CSS animations so if
you look in CSS animations actually if
you go to IE test drive microsoft has
that site that has a lot of really good
demonstrations of the capabilities of
the IE engine which is what's being used
behind all this you can see a lot of
those animations so we have transitions
where we can basically just say any time
the user changes or the code changes a
property of an element I want you to
animate the transition from what the
value was to what the value is so that
if I change for instance the width from
100 pixels to 200 pixels then it goes in
it and it gradually gets bigger so
that's a transition now in animation you
define an animation just like you do in
zamel you define a storyboard with
animations in it you define an animation
and you can animate the different all
the different properties the CSS
properties and you can create as many
key frames as you want and then you
apply that animation to any given
element and is into any given class and
then as soon as an element acquires that
class whether it's because the page just
started up and it had it or because the
user did some action and JavaScript went
and added that class as soon as it
acquires that class that animation runs
CN is the cool
can you be sure this like how do we do
animations in here even as simple as
take a red box and color to blue or once
again i think that i would have to kind
of think about some of the terms and
stuff so i think i'd be too much
thinking in front of you we should a
girl likes emily i could least you dare
you how to do it through blend yeah i
actually haven't done the animations in
blend before with HTML I always do mine
by hand so we can talk about it offline
yea yea yea big I'd be glad to try this
not roids I can talk about and like just
ping me offline or after this meeting
this begin talk about it yeah I had a
question about states when we were doing
this animal stuff I saw like from the
little window there were two different
kind of states one was app application
stable and then one was visual states
yes are those the only two buckets and
what exactly you can create n number of
buckets official state group so because
it was just basically a collection of
states you can have n number of ocean
state corruption application so
basically one was for application via
States the reason it's named that way is
because a layout aware of page when the
window size changes right when it goes
from to snapped or filled it actually
calls into that particular state and
makes a you know and that state will
then have this property set on the UI
elements which would make it and change
it to something the user expects at that
state but you can create n number of
state trips you can create something
like I did right I created for some for
animation i want to kick off a
particular animation in the state so i
can do that as well one visual stage
associated with only one application
state or and one which will straight be
associated with many application states
and so application states are nothing
special it is just normal visual states
the reason we have chosen to implement
the way the UI changes and different
window sizes using states it's a it's a
method to achieve the same thing but
there's nothing it's just the way it's
an implementation detail it's not tied
to it an Emmy
yeah in the first meeting our babies
some other one we look at the cooking
app I'm in the grid there you know we
were there multiple cookie different
recipes huh and every other one had a
different color background uh-huh
wondering how do you achieve them out
that's actually a doable so what are you
doing meet a question repeat the
question so the question is up so each
recipe had different background right so
how do you achieve that in samo so there
are two ways to do it what you can do is
you can have a property in a data model
that specifies what color you want and
you can bind that property to the
background property right now that we're
to do it you can have different data
templates you can define different data
templates each of a different color and
then what we can do is are you basically
override a class called the data
template selector and in that class
there is a method that allows you to
select a particular template so
basically can check hey this recipe
belongs to this class so let's load this
template installed an other one so you
can do that so basically would write
some code for it to happen all you can
just do a data binding by the way and
basically the same two options exist in
HTML and JavaScript if you have some
reason why one is red and the other one
is blue then I would attribute that to
the data and dynamically choose a class
or in your case choose a color based on
that data but you also have full control
of selecting which template you want
however those blends have supported
personality soon oh yes so repeat the
question the question is does blend have
supported semantics room so our support
at this point is look at semantic zoom
high board zoomed out view and zoomed in
view right so if you select a grid view
inside a zoomed out view will render
that if it's like the grid inside the
zoomed in view will render that so you
can basically toggle between those these
and you can see that render the designer
so we support that but nothing more than
that is basically for visualization yeah
I'm done that in HTML and you know you
switch to your interactive mode do your
little pinch gesture then you switch
back out and you've just switched
what's a good so I was trying to get up
to speed with zamel and I saw something
like okay what are good places to learn
them on what are good books and I saw a
lot of blogs and books that were
referring to silverlight and how to use
example for silverlight and I did not
know if that's something I wanted to get
into or it was just confusing because
we've gone through so many layers and
iterations i did not know where to start
do you have a good recommendation on
where to start to learn samuel
constructs and concepts um okay um so
the extreme team has a blog called blend
insider blend insider com ah you have a
lot of tighter yeah blends are calm a
lot of good content especially Windows
Store honestly I what we call Jupiter is
a new platform right it's very closest
in the light the platform is derived
from single light version of zem oh so a
lot of constructs that you see in
silverlight will also be there in
Jupiter or the windows stores on the
platform but not everything so you'll
have there's a lot of things missing
like for example implicit data templates
is not available in Jupiter a lot of
things that's missing but it's basically
a derived from Silla light itself she'll
have some parity and what I found when I
was trying to learn some zamel was that
if I started with anything silverlight
it assumed that i already knew some of
the basic concepts of zamel and so if i
started with a WPF course then even
though so many things that are in WPF
don't exist in silverlight or or Windows
Store apps what are you calling it Oh
sound let's call this a platform okay
download for Windows Store apps if you
start with a double yeah of course then
they usually go okay you don't know
anything about zamel so let's start with
what is a resource you know then I it
helps me learn the concept but just know
that you'll probably learn some things
in WPF and you'll come over and find out
that that doesn't even exist in
silverlight or Windows 8 and I always
thought that was
he starts at what is water brackets okay
was inside of a bracket okay how did you
go up a bracket what's an attribute
what's not an attribute you know he goes
he starts from baby baby baby steps but
he assumes you know what a bracket is
right yeah once you get the three
quarters through the book then he gets
into WPF specifics and you can ignore
but that first you know two-thirds of
the book is really really good and
what's the title of this one I think
it's just he has a book for each
platform so yeah just I just saw in
joining ya more per game was over like
yeah but yeah the puzzle book is
fantastic okay and my favorite is that
program book that I think about 300
pages are not appreciate vtv 200 pages
and that goes over talks about nothing
about codes only about length everything
that you can be just as length right
goes over the fits like Photoshop book
this button about this different is this
and throw blind yeah that's the first
time at the air should what Blanco to do
you know they offer oh I'm trying to
search I think also Adams Kings blog is
pretty good for blend Adam Kimmy Adam
kitty kitty kitty oh hey I an Emmy why
yeah is he one of the authors for not
coming windows phone ah the he's he's
done a lot he currently works with
Robert and gabe Watson auto company he
he's pretty famous in seventh circle his
blog was pretty good back in the day for
and now he's now he's doing more
javascript javascript I know yeah I
wasn't gonna say that he came over to
though he left the dark side yeah Oh
questions I think you are there any like
best practices in terms of jumping
between blind and visual studio if you
said you know visual studios from
probably were to be doing doing a lot of
debugging up JavaScript or C sharp any
any kind of workflow tips and tricks
jumping back and forth actually uh blend
in Visual Studio supports the same
project solution structure so everything
is compatible if you create a project
i'll open in blender to create a blend
project open PS as well and we there's
no specific practices and we monitor for
file changes and everything on both
products so if you make a change it'll
be reflecting blend when you go back so
there's nothing specific it should just
work for you on that I wouldn't say any
specific practices but one thing I'll
tell you is that especially if you're
using C sharp the nature for example and
because we run a lot of user code it is
sometimes necessary for you to God your
code so doesn't cross the designer
because in your user code you might
expect a certain type not to be null but
in the context of designer because we
don't have access to let's say every web
service or anything out there things
might cause the designer go down so you
might need to be a little careful and
guarding certain things especially in a
constructors and stuff so be a bit
careful there other than that blend
should just work so really an individual
like myself can jump back and forth and
use blend for its strengths and visual
studio for its strengths and you can
also certainly use it if you have a team
of four you know three developers in a
designer everybody speak in the same
language they're working on the same
source control it's just that one guys
using the design tool and the other guys
are using visual studio and blend past
DFS as well integration as well so
I you disconnected your laptop so I
don't know how come eat it it will be
but when you talk about Adobe and blend
integration what kind of features are
redrawn can I use yours yeah sure will
continue as well so I go to file I got
import I can do input adobe photoshop
file so i can input a PSD okay if I have
a PSD file imported it actually show you
every layer you can selectively select a
I want this letter that low and input as
a major smacking your application in
illustrator will convert the vector
drawing and the saml version of it the
path vector and you can just use that as
well so it's pretty simple as just a one
dialogue meant it's a function okay
guessing when you finally publish the
app it does the conversion into proper
formats well like he said when you
import it it turns it into samo at that
time illustrator illustrator for PSD it
will just let you import specific layers
as images it's all that is taken care of
for you does it put it in an actual
rapid in an actual image oh no it'll
just import your project at that point
because you don't know you don't know if
you don't create how many image blocks
right I see that'll do olimpo the things
to your project though I see we got time
for more questions feel free again about
the psu fuzz it converts the PSD file it
won't be like I can keep editing the PSD
file in Photoshop and you'll keep
updating in blend or no okay yeah I know
but uh the problem is once you come at a
PSD like there's no actual translation
by because we are actually extracting
specific layers out of it okay yeah
exactly interesting point
anybody's looking to learn more CSS my
just submitted the last change to my new
book yesterday and so you can already
buy it early but it's it's gonna be
printed here in a couple weeks and you
can find it AKA ms / CSS book so it's
all about CSS that's kind of specific to
Windows 8 yeah it feels good to be done
I always say if anybody needs any
encouragement or about not writing a
book your first year at Microsoft and
your first year being a dad you can ask
either my wife or myself okay well let's
go ahead and wrap it up we can feel free
to have some more discussion after we
turn off the recorders so feel free to
stick around but this ends the public
