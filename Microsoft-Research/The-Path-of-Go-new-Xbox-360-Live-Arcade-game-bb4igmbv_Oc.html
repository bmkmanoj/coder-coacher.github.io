is called the path of gold it is the
first game on the xbox 360 that actually
runs f sharp code go is said to have
originated over 4,000 years ago in China
the game is deceptively simple to play
it only takes minutes to learn the rules
but you can keep improving your skill
over a lifetime it is one of the most
complex and deep board games there is
many people think of chess as a
challenge to artificial intelligence
however the strongest chess player today
is not a human it's a computer the story
for go is completely different by far
the strongest players today are still
humans if you think about a chess game
in a typical situation you will have
about 20 or 30 legal moves you can make
that allows you to build brute force
strategies that actually go ahead and
explore all of the possible fictitious
games that you could play from any point
on if you were to try to do the same for
go you would miserably fail and go you
are going to have about 200 moves you
can make so the universe of possible
games of Go that you can play is
enormous it is way larger than the
number of atoms there is in the universe
and so if you wanted to let a computer
explore all that universe of different
games you could play it would take
literally millions and millions of years
writing the AI engine in f-sharp was a
very straightforward process it was
literally translating the mathematical
algorithmic ideas into code in a very
very natural way using the immense
expressive power that the language has
to offer today we are able to ship a
game of Go that offers a very very
compelling AI in fact I haven't been
able to bid it myself yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
