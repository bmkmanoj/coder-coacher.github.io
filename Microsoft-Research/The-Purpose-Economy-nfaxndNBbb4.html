hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
thank you all for joining us today my
name is kevin s ferrito I manage
employee community engagement that's the
Microsoft Giving Campaign the volunteer
programs all of the good fun stuff at
Microsoft so for those of you that have
been around for a while you know that we
have a very long history and culture of
giving at Microsoft and our employees
are amazing you all are amazing we
reached 113 million dollars last year
record-breaking campaign and that's over
a billion dollars since this program
started back in nineteen eighty-three
The Giving Campaign yes all right stuff
and any of you that have seen me in the
past know that I am always up for giving
a free plug for The Giving Campaign
we're very lucky to have Aaron Hurst
here today to talk about his new book
The Purpose economy I've had the
pleasure of working with Aaron when he
was the CEO of taproot the taproot
foundation where he was CEO and founder
and worked for a dozen or so years aaron
has also been extremely active in
founding some of the pro bono
initiatives across our nation and is
just a fantastic wonderful person
especially in this space so without
further ado like to have Aaron come up
and talk about his new book
thank you awesome thank you Kevin it's
I've been a great to be a friend of
Microsoft for so many years and I've
actually been to many many Microsoft
offices but never to the mothership so
it's great to be at the mothership and
when we talking today about purpose and
work and since I've never been here
before I'd love to disturb but it's
asking you guys like what do you love
about working at Microsoft just a couple
people so I can get a taste of what it
is that you there you go that is the
best answer I've heard anywhere hey I
don't know how do we can top that yeah
great people awesome what else change in
the world awesome I need this side of
the room this aside like a wedding
usually like the love Microsoft looking
for another job what what over here why
do you guys hear why do you love working
here drink the drinks free milk so just
like their grid nice all right yeah
scales and makes a difference he'll make
it events by scaling ideas I'm solutions
awesome um that's great I it's always
great i always heard different things
going to different companies it's really
helpful to secure sort of what what is
the passion what is it that connects
people to the organization where they
spend the majority of their waking hours
i've been talking today about my new
book the purpose economy that came out a
couple months ago and one thing this is
background i wrote this book using
crowdsourcing so i wrote the book last
summer about a year ago and the
publisher worked with me to actually
print two thousand copies and send it to
my network and asked people to set
contribute stories data better arguments
etc and got back just tons and tons of
emails with suggestions and ideas the
book that is being sold an incredibly
low just got a price today only in the
back actually is only about twenty
percent the book I wrote the other
eighty percent came out of being able to
reach out to the community and gathering
content and ideas from other people so
there's a lot of fun but one of the
pieces
a feedback was from our Freddie's like
dude why are you writing a book no one
reads I was like oh I don't know what to
do at that feedback right that's kind of
hard it's like all of a sudden feeling
make cars like at nobody drives why are
you writing a car making a car right so
what I thought a lot about that piece of
feedback i was like he's kind of right
like most business books maybe people
buy them but only very few actually
finish reading them so I hired a
cartoonist and you'll see in the book
that each section in the book has a
cartoon summary of that section so I
just wanted to let you guys know that in
case any of you don't read or can't read
you can still consume this book so this
is my cartoon me who you will I meet
throughout the presentation today so the
core of the book the core idea I'm
actually was inspired by number of
things one of them was my uncle who is a
economist at Stanford and coined the
term information economy back in the 70s
and prove that the information economy
had become the dominant driver of the US
economy increasingly global economy
actually at a point in the 60s it had
become the leading driver of economic
growth that output but he also in his 9
volume dissertation which I have never
seen I read summaries of it which is
good enough no cartoons but it was good
he basically helped me understand how
the economy has changed over time and I
can't understand it through this little
diagram which is we basically started
off as Apes the same would disagree with
that occasionally I'm in an audience or
someone has to like contradict that
point okay we're good here so we started
off as Apes we still are Apes but we
became an erected over millions and
millions of years right but one of the
things that characterize us as human
beings is that were impatient bastards
right we are an impatient lot and we
weren't happy with the fact that
evolution was taking millions and
millions of years and we decided to take
evolution in our own hands and hack
evolution right we decided to hack it
and speed it up and first we created an
agrarian economy where we use the land
animals etc to be able to extend our
lifespan increase our quality of life we
hacked the environment to basically
accelerate our evolution we then said
you know what that's not good enough we
want to be stronger so we
started extracting minerals from the
earth creating machines that had
strength the ability to move things much
faster much stronger than we ever could
have through natural evolution we had
hacked it once again finally we said we
also want to be smarter and we hacked of
evolution again and found ways to
process and access information in a way
in which we never would have been able
to do just through natural evolution we
sort of a third chapter hacking
evolution that'll make sense so it's
what's interesting about this couple of
things one and you may or may not
believe in a hypothesis of the book but
I think one thing I really want to leave
you with is a question that you should
ponder tonight and tomorrow and maybe
even the next day is is the information
economy the last stop on the train are
we done hacking evolution well our
species sure to say this is the final
chapter done sold we've completed our
hacking of evolution or is there another
chapter in many chapters ahead in the
way in which we will evolve over the
coming years right sort of a challenging
question like I think a lot of times
people think oh the information economy
like that is innovation that is growth
that's where everything is going to be
forever if you look at it just from
pattern recognition it seems almost
implausible that this is the last
economy that we will ever have right
secondly if you look at these this took
millions of years thousands of years
hundreds of years this is likely to last
dozens of years and in fact if you just
look at it as a projection we're
probably 10 to 20 years away from the
next major economy in our global history
and it's really fascinating to think
about what could that be and as an
entrepreneur and being among people who
are you know innovators it's a really
interesting question to think about you
think about how much the information
economy changed the workplace changed
every type of company out there etc that
that whole process could begin again and
to have that kind of transformation and
disruption happen again in the next 10
to 20 years is an incredible opportunity
so what would this next economy being
there's a couple different ways of
looking I spent a couple years just
reading magazines talking to CEOs trying
to understand where are we seeing signs
of what the next economy might be how
can we make an educated guess there's no
way of knowing for sure
and one of the things that really struck
me is I was looking at Maslow's
hierarchy of needs do people remember
Maslow from psych 101 so it's not a
perfect model but I think from a
storytelling an understanding
perspective it's sitting as you think
about we basically have these base needs
for survival you know food shelter etc
but as those needs become sort of well
more or less taken for granted we start
focusing on the next order of magnitude
needs and as you look at this hacking of
evolution what you see generally is a
further and further evolution towards
generations that are focused on the next
order of magnitude needs and as you look
at the millennial generation which has
been studied ad nauseam the three things
that really define this generation are
the desire for greater relationships the
grit desire to do something greater than
themselves and the desire for personal
growth those are the three things you
see over and over again define this
generation and what those things are is
really purpose when you look at the
definition of purpose that's what
purpose is and it's getting towards
these higher order of magnitude needs
and you're seeing more and more within
the professional classes who are the
ones who define the start of an economy
there's less of a fear of where am I
going to sleep tonight there's not
really a fear where's my next meal going
to come from Microsoft cafeteria the
fear is will I have a life without
meaning well I have a life that doesn't
matter it's a fundamental fear of
irrelevance and of not making a
difference in the world and having an
impact this is driving incredible
anxiety of this generation this desire
for purpose and the other way that's
where it came to this conclusion was
again going back to biology and if
you're just walking through the forest
right and you see let's say a frog on
the ground right and it just looks a
little weird like it has an extra leg or
something you're like wow that's a
mutation that's kind of weird right and
you see a tree that looks a little off
and then you see a bird it looks a
little off you're like that's weird but
when you see all the frogs having that
mutation all the trees all the birds you
say wait a sec this isn't just random
mutation we're actually seeing a
biological event we're seeing a
fundamental shift in the ecosystem of
that environment and as I was looking
around at the places where innovation is
really happening now around the sharing
economy the maker economy
freelance economy etc there's about a
dozen of these sort of micro mutations
to parts of the economy and you say okay
there's all these weird mutations of
frogs that look a little funny trees
that look a little funny and birds that
look a little funny what do they all
have in common what's going on here the
common thread is purpose these are all
being driven by these three elements of
purpose relationships doing something
greater than yourself and personal
growth and if you look at them in
totality it explains why from my point
of view the next era of our economy will
likely be one driven by purpose just
based on the evidence on the ground and
the generation that's really given
timing likely to drive this so as Kevin
said I was the founder of the taproot
foundation back in 2001 she's a
nonprofit and the goal was to ensure
every nonprofit has access to the
marketing technology HR strategy
services they need because just like
companies nonprofits need these
resources and it's vital to get ensure
that they have them even if they can't
afford them and built it out across the
u.s. we built it the overall market
place into a 15 billion dollar-a-year
marketplace parallel to philanthropy and
it was incredibly enriching it was
wonderful but ultimately I left tapper
because of this quote which is I find
pro bono work so much more rewarding
than a paycheck job and at first is
actually the reason I stayed at a prude
I was like hot damn we did it we created
Disneyland right we created the
Disneyland of work we create the place
the happiest place on earth but then I
realized what does it actually say about
what we go back to after disneyland what
does it say about what we spend most of
our time doing the core work that we're
doing and we have a fundamental problem
in our society which is that work is
broken we fundamentally have a work
environment that's not designed for
human beings and that we need to think
about how to change the nature of work
pretty fundamentally to ensure that it's
actually built around the needs of
people and we're my goal with taproot
was let's ensure every nonprofit has
access Michael now which I will never
achieve which is my favorite kind to
make all work feel like pro bono work
how can we make it so all work feels
like pro bono work
ain't ever going to happen but I think
it's the goal in terms of how do we
start thinking and saying why isn't that
possible why is it that work can't be
that way and I'm not to talk to you
about section 2 of the book which is
really around purpose at work how do we
understand what generates purpose at
work how can we start thinking about how
to make all work feel like pro bono work
guys game but let me start with a more
important question what is the meaning
of life I figured here at Microsoft you
guys would have an answer 42 that's a
hitchhiker's guide is gonna go it's the
universe right yeah like yes okay yep I
do hard do ha good word me be happy and
make others happy nice people willing to
go sup yep you come the all-knowing
master of timeline dimension I already
did that one was it was alright but like
the next day was kind of boring um just
wasn't a challenge anymore well you guys
were among some great people over time
we've the cavemen back when I was a
caveman we would stay up like late at
night just staring at the Stars
wondering about the meaning of life
every religion is basically built on
trying to answer this question for folks
the Philosopher's spent much of the time
trying to answer this in the modern day
talk show hosts like Oprah Winfrey as
well spent much of the time sort of
pondering and exploring this question
and I have absolutely no answer to those
questions I just wanted to like put that
aside I mean you already had some great
answers in the audience but what I'm
going to share with you is what I think
is just incredibly fascinating which is
in the last five to ten years new
research largely at a Michigan Yale and
pen has started to help us understand
something we've never understood before
which is really what actually creates
purpose at work this is like the
equivalent for me of when we first
figure out how to make the internet work
it's like we're in the early days and we
haven't yet figured how to commercialize
it changed everything but we have now
tapped into a science that enables us to
radically change the way we approach
work which is going to create tremendous
opportunities economically and socially
we're sure at the cusp this incredibly
exciting time and I'm going to share
with you this research that really
changed my understanding of what
actually work candy and what matters
when it comes to purpose at work
but before they do that I have to admit
I was committing malpractice for about
12 years giving especially young folks
career advice that turned out to be
completely wrong and in looking at the
research at dawn to me and I realize in
retrospect that I've been completely
missing the point and been giving bad
advice so part of what I've had to do in
this tour is really share with people
some of these myths that I found that I
was propagating and that I find most
people hold about purpose at work that
actually prevent them from being
effective in finding purpose for
themselves but also being effective
managers and leaders the first is that
purpose and cause are related or the
same thing right most people think that
and they come to me they say I really
want more meaning in my work I need more
purpose like I need to find my cause why
is it everyone's like found their cause
like education puppies kittens whatever
it is and I haven't been able to find my
cause right and you're going to LinkedIn
or Facebook emmons checked off all their
causes etc right as if this is a thing
like brings meaning and purpose to our
life but this woman over here is from
the Upper East Side of Manhattan if
anybody has anyone been to the Upper
East Side so you probably know her chea
she this is this is a typical Upper East
Side woman who has many many causes in
her life and pretty much no purpose does
anybody know anybody has a lot of causes
but you would say no real purpose yeah
like they've checked all the boxes on
Facebook you're like yep still no
purpose right similarly is anyone met
anyone who has tremendous purpose in
their work but he said what's there
cause you'd be like I have no clue and
I'll niggas person has a cause anyone
met someone has purpose in their work
without a cause I know lots and lots of
people have tremendous purpose in their
work without any cause associated with
it I also know a lot of folks having
worked in the nonprofit sector who work
in the nonprofit sector which is full of
causes and are miserable and have no
purpose in their work in fact the
taproot foundation we had many
volunteers who were coming out of
nonprofits because they weren't getting
purpose they're going into other
nonprofits or we'd have business
professionals move into a non-profit
thinking that was going to give them
purpose when they realized after a day
it was just a job right purpose and
cause are not the
yeah yes I will absolutely i'll get to
that in a few minutes so purpose and
cause are not the same thing there is no
scientific connection really between
these two things the other two that
anchor important here are that a lot of
people believe purpose is a revelation
it's like you read the Sunday Times
Magazine and you're like stumble an
article in US and I give you purpose or
you're going to go to Africa and you're
going to see something and you're gonna
like whoa I found purpose right we think
it's like a revelation something that
happens to us something that we're
waiting to like connect with like a bolt
of lightning that's going to come down
and like tell us what our purpose is in
life right and I shared this recently at
Oxford in the UK to a bunch of graduate
students and like all of a sudden they
just all looked depressed and I was like
what's up time out like what's what's
the problem here and you're like well we
all realize that we kind of went to
graduate school because we thought we'd
have a revelation and figure out what
our purpose is and the faculty there
were more like sorry yeah that's not
going to happen this is not the way the
life actually works it's what publicists
and the media like to tell makes for a
great Hollywood movie the purpose comes
to us as a daily journey it's not
something that comes to you like a bolt
of lightning and the third is the belief
that purpose is a luxury and this is
especially a popular myth among affluent
liberals to be honest and I'm not sure
exactly why that is because whenever I
talk to someone who doesn't have means
oh like of course you don't need money
to have purpose like they're not
correlated at all but we tend have a
belief that we have to like work we have
to toil we have to suffer we have to do
all these things to earn the right to
have purpose absolutely not that's like
completely ridiculous there's no need
for a yacht to be able to have purpose
we don't even have a job to find purpose
and what you're doing and there's no
better example this than Viktor Frankl
who was a slave and a concentration camp
and Nazi Germany and said he made it
through life as a slave in a
concentration camp because of purpose
and meaning and the work he was doing
and with the people he was working with
so I figure if a slave in a
concentration camp can have purpose in
their lives I've yet to find a work
environment that's worse than that right
I'm assuming it's better here so
so purpose is not a luxury this is a
really important point to make a lot of
people say think they don't deserve
purpose yet I think it's like a
privilege that you have to like get to a
certain age or a certain point in your
life we're allowed to have purpose or
like oh we can only offer purpose and
opportunities or purpose or people with
means it's really important to move
beyond that so these are the three myths
I have been propagating that I've now
realized our myths and actually getting
in the way of people finding true
purpose in their work and getting closer
to that goal of making all work feel
like pro bono work but it left me with
two trick questions as i was looking at
this research one was these two women
had the exact same job and a cat which
is funny cuz i'm totally allergic to
cats and the cartoonist put it in and it
was gonna charge to take it out and I
was like I'll just leave it in but even
but even the cat even the cats happier
here right i did in the exact same job
this one's fully engaged full of purpose
this one's not right like what's going
on here what's wrong it doesn't make any
sense right what how do you explain that
behavior how could the same person or
these two people like have the same job
and have a different experience and this
is dr. pickle he works selling pickles
he makes pickles and sells pickles in my
neighborhood in Brooklyn New York right
all he does is make pickles and sell
pickles and he smells like pickles right
this guy has not had a date in decades
right the guy should hate his job right
I mean god awful job right just playing
the pickles all day dude loves this job
and it's full of purpose right what's
wrong with them right and this point
have to do a quick full disclosure the
actual doctor pickle does not have a
beard the problem is the cartoonists are
hired from Williamsburg New York i'm in
brooklyn and like they just have his
total fixation on facial hair and they
put it on everything so he ended up with
a beer but if you ever in Brooklyn
looking for him it just picture that
without the beard so when I son it's
early at the research which is this this
piece is blew my mind and again this is
something i've been working in for 12
years there are basically three ways
people think about work so it's not
about how you think about it today
versus tomorrow but in general how you
think about work throughout your life
from the start of your career to the end
of your career if someone just asked you
right now what is the reason we work
like what you're the immediate reactions
are like that question just think for a
second
is it that we work but they found is
that there are basically three
categories of answers people give to
this question and they don't really
change much over time the first is we
work because a job to necessary evil we
need to make money to pay the bills be
able to do the things outside of work
that we want to do these people are with
someone at a linkedin called
coin-operated right these are people for
fun amount of like we only work because
we have to and it's because of the
economic needs right that is the meaning
of work the second group is career and
these folks see work fundamentally as
part of their identity they work so that
mommy and daddy are proud of them and
that when they go back to their high
school reunion people don't think
they're a loser right they're
fundamentally saying like I work as like
it's part of who I am and how I express
Who I am to the world it's tied up in my
identity that's the primary goal of work
and the third which is I don't this is
the term the scientists use which I
don't love but is calling which is a
fundamental belief that we work because
work adds value and that we gain purpose
through the process of work itself right
so its interests I mean people had these
sort of three buckets right through a
taxonomy of why do we work what was more
interesting was that the people who are
in calling were shown to have higher
life satisfaction and higher work
satisfaction and on most regards better
employees so I was always told as a CEO
when I was being mentored you want to
have a mix of like people here who are
just like punching the clock getting the
job done get it done you want people who
are the climbers and you want people who
are like the craftsman right but it
turns out actually based on the research
that may not be the case it may in fact
be that we want our people who are of
this calling mindset and see work
fundamentally as a value creation
mechanism but here's the challenge in
the u.s. right now based on the research
i saw a third of the workforce is job a
third is career and a third is calling
it almost evenly splits a third a third
a third which is interesting but more so
they studied about a dozen professions
and those dozen professions they found
that the exact same pattern held true a
third of doctors see their work
fundamentally as a job it's a great
steady paycheck you're unlikely to get
laid off it's like a very steady way to
make a living so you can go jet skiing
right career a third doctors are
mommy and daddy will be so proud of me
for being a doctor no one's in a call me
a loser at my high school reunion right
and a third say I'm a doctor because I
fundamentally believe that doing this
work adds value to the world and I get
purpose from the work itself this is not
to say these people are bad doctors
right these people could all be great
doctors but you see this to be true
aggressors or as most people to say
doctors are a job full of meaning and
purpose right well yeah for a third of
them right same things true of executive
assistants a third seat as a job a third
a career third are calling is they went
through each profession they saw almost
even divided in every career among these
three nine sets and they didn't see it
really changing between jobs i guess you
skipped between different employers and
rolls it didn't really change because it
was tied to your fundamental story about
the role of work so this is really leads
to a couple of really important
conclusions one is purpose at work as a
choice if you basically can't say that
it depends on the profession it doesn't
depend necessarily on the employer at
the end of the day it's a choice you can
certainly have JA like jobs and
opportunities that give you more purpose
but that ultimately this is a choice
right and that we need to each accept
that choice that's sort of the first
step in making all work feel like pro
bono work is for us all to accept that
that's our responsibility not some
external force the second one which is
for Kevin is that there's a tremendous I
think philanthropic / social change
opportunity in that it turns out that
during your adolescence is when you have
this mindset created and it's hard to
shake there's a tremendous opportunity I
think here for change in the world
around how can we help set in people's
adolescents the mindset that's going to
serve them and the workplace best
throughout their lives we tend to think
about like building the right skills may
be as important or more important that
we ensure we're graduating a hundred
percent of high school graduates with a
calling mindset right how do we start
doing that the fascinating opportunity
so what is actually purpose you asked
earlier how do we define like what
generates purpose purpose comes from
these three things I mentioned earlier
relationships we get purpose from
interacting with each other you can get
purpose by yourself it's much harder we
get purpose by interacting with other
people to the relationships in our lives
we get it through doing something
greater than ourselves this is where
people often get confused with cause
because they said oh sort cause you're
like no it doesn't have to be a cause
and it's not like there's one cause out
there for you it can be helping someone
open the door it can be building a
product and make someone's life just a
little bit easier so but doing something
it's not just about you right it doesn't
have to be this romantic saving the
world fully you can do your little piece
of it but it's not about a cause and
that personal growth and challenge we
get purpose when we master new skills
try new things lean into our fear this
generates purpose for us when we're
learning new things right and again this
is the future of the work force me by
the end of this decade the millennial
generation will be the majority of the
workforce and these three things are the
things you see over and over again as
the priorities of this generation they
want to have relationships at work
they're like second family they want to
make sure they're having a career of
meaning and impact and they're
constantly wanting to learn and grow and
the old model that I was taught as a kid
was a sort of model of learn earn and
then return was anyone should have
shared that model so yes the basic idea
is you spend the first stood your life
learning stop that no more learning it's
been a third of your life just earning
its earn money earn money doesn't matter
what you just earn money optimize
earning and then the last third you can
join boards give it a philanthropy
return right this model is broken in
like six thousand different ways right
and the Millennials were the smart smart
enough to actually realize that and are
saying I'm no longer willing to wait
until I'm 60 to do the return and i'm
also not willing to stop learning
because i know that if i stop learning
in a year i'll automatically be obsolete
they're saying i need to learn earn and
return every single year if not every
single day and it's radically disrupting
the workforce because employers don't
know what to do with this incredible
desire to be doing such a dynamic job
it's doing all three things so how do
you bring purpose to work either as an
individual a manager a company there's
really four things that have just seen
to be effective whether we're exploring
again this is like the web back in like
nineteen ninety-six i mean we are at
this sort of beginning of this and it's
really fun because an idiot like me can
actually say things that sound profound
is because it's so early right in ten
years like I won't have any chance of
like doing anything in this field so if
any of you are similarly inclined it's a
great time to get into this business
even idiots can rule how to build
purpose at work so number one the first
is to take responsibility for purpose in
your own life and to build
self-awareness what drives purpose for
you it's not the same as the person
sitting next to you and until you
understand what uniquely drives purpose
for you it's gonna be really hard for
you to create the right path for
yourself and that's why we built on our
site imperative calm a free diagnostic
tool for the first time in about 15
minutes enables you to determine what
drives psychologically purpose for you
relative to other people so you can
start looking for those opportunities
and thinking about it your life through
that the second one is to craft work to
your job so we tend to buy clothes
that's sort of fit right like this shirt
sort of fits right but you can go to a
tailor and actually have a tailored so
it actually fits you right and what we
see happening with most jobs is that
people take the job description and
assume it that's the final job when in
reality in almost every single job
there's the opportunity without even
letting your manager know in most cases
to change your job ten to twenty percent
to optimize purpose for yourself and I'm
gonna talk more about that the third is
to connect personal purpose to
organizational purpose what tends to
happen is in startups they're incredibly
full of purpose because the
relationships are intense to working
around the clock on a small team you're
doing something greater than yourself
because every startup no matter how
stupid what they're doing is believes
they're changing the world right and
then finally you're learning and growing
cuz you're playing like 16 different
roles right which and you get bigger you
don't do but then what happens is the
organization grows the nature that
changes and a lot of the founders and
CEOs think that the organization's
purpose is enough to feed the whole
organization but in reality that's only
like ten or twenty percent of it the
purpose we get us through the tribe that
we work with closely and it's around the
craft of the work we actually do and
there's a need to align what generates
purpose for the individual with the
organization that's a lot of the work
we're doing now with our platform is
around how do you help individuals and
companies find that alignment so that
there can be a much richer community of
purpose and then fourth celebrate and
connect people around purpose we tend to
a most companies celebrate the job
mentality and the career mentality but
not the calling mentality we celebrate
when we hit quarterly earnings close a
big deal get a feature in the new york
times we don't celebrate the things that
are about making an impact right it's
really important to think about not
the other two but how do you as a
culture celebrate calling purpose and
then how do we connect people around
purpose we are finding tremendous
opportunity to start creating affinity
groups or resource groups that are
around shared purpose profiles not just
around the color of your skin or your
gender how do I actually start
connecting people around what generates
purpose for them and we didn't
interesting experiment because I have
you taken like strengths finder
myers-briggs so what's interesting about
those that in general it's like magnets
opposite magnets when I meet some of the
same strengths finder myers-briggs I
tend to find them really annoying
anybody had that experience they meet
some of the exact time typing or like
God that person is kind of annoying and
what's interesting about purpose we did
this experiment around connecting people
who had shared purpose as 24 different
types and what we found was the opposite
is like immediate friends like immediate
connection it was so powerful and we
actually did experiment internally where
we asked members of my team to go in our
database find someone as a job that you
think sucks there's the same purpose
type as you and set up a call with them
to talk to them about their job good
really all right so looked up a job but
they're like oh god I would never want
that job the same purpose type and two
things would happen one is they would
like immediately hit it off and be like
immediate friends and secondly they
would come off saying wow that job is
kind of cool because the problem is we
tend to get advice or images of what a
jobs like from people who don't share
the same kind of purpose type and
therefore don't understand really what
that job would be like and don't have
the right approach to it we get advice
from our parents or colleagues but they
don't have the same purpose type in a
totally skews our understanding of
what's successful so once talked a
little bit for this last piece about
this process of job crafting or
tailoring your clothes to fit and the
research upfront centered around
hospital orderlies does anybody know
anybody is an orderly or someone who
cleans hospital rooms so this job sucks
like if you want a job that sucks this
is it right because you're literally
cleaning out bodily fluids all day long
and doctors and nurses are so incredibly
rude and mean to these people it's
ridiculous like next time you're in a
hospital just watch how doctors and
nurses treat these folks like furniture
and don't even acknowledge that there's
a human being in the room like these
people are literally cleaning up
and being treated like right
it they still found that many of them
love their jobs so the researchers like
what the hell is wrong with these people
they should hate their jobs like what's
going on right so they went down and
they talked to some of these folks like
what's wrong with you guys and uh they
said well they're like what is it you
like find so much meaning and they said
we think we're just as important as
doctors and nurses and the research is
probably giggled right and they're like
well you're cleaning the room like why
do you think you're so like how dare you
compare yourself to a doctor but what
they found was they had been crafting
their job to make themselves as
important as doctors and nurses so for
example they found many of them this is
weird because they didn't tell each
other and then no one knew they were
doing this but many of them are actually
doing it they would sing dance or tell
jokes to patients right this was not
part of like most hospitals in the
interview orderlies aren't like please
share three jokes you'll be telling to
patients in the next three months right
I guess not part of the job description
they don't have to do like a little tap
dance recital right this is something
that they started doing to help care for
the patients they also they found
provide a much more important bridge to
the family and friends of patients then
doctors and nurses did and did much more
to actually take care of the
psychological well-being of patients in
many cases then doctors or nurses and
one story that was really touching in a
long-term care facility where people
actually you know stay for weeks or
months at a time the orderlies are
moving art around because I want to make
sure patients gotta see fresh art every
day instead just leaving the art up none
of these things are part of the job
description but they tailored it to fit
their needs and who they were to
optimize purpose and this is exactly
what we're seeing now is possible with
every job what we're starting to try to
really build the technology around is
how do we create the ability to every
quarter craft your job and optimize it
to tailor it to actually fit you to
optimize around what generates purpose
for you because if you can sing and
dance in a hospital you can sing and
dance on Microsoft right it may not
literally be singing and dancing or it
might be but how do you every day find
the equivalent for yourself to bring
craftsmanship and carrying into that
work incredibly doable it's really we
think the future of how do we reform
work to really make it more human the
key this process is really three things
task
so these people added singing and
dancing not part of the job
relationships they actually built
relationships and reframed relationships
with the people and perception they no
longer saw a patient as someone who
makes a mess I must clean up after which
would be my immediate reaction they
change the perception to be these are
people i'm taking care of the greek
rafta their job to add things that were
not part of the job description so one
quick story about this case i want to
make sure you like see how easy this is
to do i went looking for the place that
was certain to have no purpose right so
I went to midtown Manhattan to like an
investment banking company where
everyone wears black suits right and I
was like there is no way in hell there
is an ounce of purpose going on here
right and I opened the door and like
just waves a purpose started like coming
at me like people were like in so it was
the most purposeful insane culture and I
met met with the sea I'm like what the
hell is wrong with you like what is
going on here you're not allowed to have
purpose like how did you get purpose
here in midtown Investment Banking black
suit wearing people right it's a sense
of purpose suit actually yeah it's lined
with LSD inside and they just lick it
they lick it every 20 minutes no what
she did was really simple and I like to
show it's a very human example you don't
need technology you don't need any
permission to do this she is the CEO we
just ask people how was your day how
many of you asked people how was your
day and how many of you when you say it
like actually want to know how someone's
day was versus you're just like hey
what's up I wasn't like what's up
category like it's something you just
say like hey how was your day great talk
to you later right just she would
actually care and if someone said I had
a good day she's like oh that's not good
enough tell me one moment today that
made it a great day what was one moment
that made it a purposeful good day and
over a couple weeks or a month she'd
start to see patterns and she starts you
based on that give them different
projects celebrate different things
about them connect them to different
people and started crafting their job
around what gave them purpose so she
basically done the diagnostic I'm
intuitively around what general purpose
for them and started crafting their job
yes CEOs can do this but so can
individuals themselves just by writing
down every day to answer that question
like what was the moment today
and looking for those opportunities
right you can do it for your peers you
can do it as a manager it's not
something it requires a CEO this really
speaks to me so how to do it so again
we've seen everywhere from an orderly to
an investment banker find purpose it is
obviously incredibly possible right so I
fundamentally believe I started off
working in technology in 1997 in the Bay
Area and Silicon Valley at the time sure
the the web was just sort of really
getting momentum and a lot of companies
saw that and what most companies do they
said okay this web is coming the
information economy let's hire a firm to
build a website for us right and that
was lovely another sort of company said
wow the web is coming this changes
everything this isn't just about
throwing up a website it fundamentally
changes everything about what we do
those are the companies that have
thrived over the last 15 to 20 years
versus those that just thought all they
had to do was get a website right and
the same thing we're seeing today is
true the companies that see the purpose
economy coming there's sort of two
categories the ones that get up their
umbrellas right and those that get a
surfboard and ride the wave the ones get
out the surf are they umbrella are the
ones that say Oh purpose economy i would
let's make sure you have a foundation
and a volunteer program check right
versus those that say holy moly this
changes everything and fun of my looks
at how they're building purpose for
their customers how they're building
purpose for their employees all their
shareholders seeing it fundamentally as
different we're seeing companies new
company's existing companies radically
changing their approach at a fundamental
DNA level around purpose this doesn't
mean that foundations and volunteerism
are important that'd be like saying
websites aren't important but that's not
the solution the solution is how do we
fundamentally baked into the DNA of
every company this new economy that I
believe is coming so with that I want to
share with you my contact information in
case I can be of service and open it up
for questions any how long do we have
for questions
bring them on yeah so love any questions
thoughts and if anybody has an update on
the game score that would be awesome too
yeah what's the reaction when you share
the adolescents direct make a bunch of
teenagers or have you done that you I
have I showed it to my six-year-old and
he was bored I haven't tried adolescence
it's actually it's not part of sort of
what I'm focused on but I think it is I
really would love a group of folks to
take on that quest and figure out how to
translate to that audience on how to
help make that happen so I do think that
somewhere one thing which is fascinating
this new research that came out I don't
know three or four months ago out of
Michigan they looked at like what was a
role of parents in this right and it was
fascinating what they saw and this was a
pre limited study was only looking at
you know male female not single parents
sort of a more traditional definition of
families but they found that Mother's
matter a whole lot more than father's
which it some of those no surprise but
anything about traditionally you tend to
think of career being something that
fathers are responsible for in the
household not the mother it went so far
as that in the sample they had are the
people who saw work solely as a job
that's sort of far left category not one
of them had a good relationship with
their mother so what I say when you see
like somebody is just money focused all
they care about is money like instead of
judging them I just give them a hug say
it's I'm sorry your mom and you didn't
really get along well so that's my new
intervention strategy so next time you
come across someone like that just get
my hog um any other yeah Oh scores five
nothing five nothing how much time's
left uh 33 minutes nice and uh what did
the female CEO say when people said I
had a bad day today um I think she just
um I don't know the answer to that to be
honest she just shared the story thing
around the good day I'm gonna make
something out but that's probably better
said on a yeah you should between the
people who three buckets yeah horses
their parents view of their job so it
was based on so what they found was this
based on not with their parents actual
attitude was the child's perception of
what their attitudes was
of course you to see there's may be
contaminated the beliefs in the cause
current Collins yeah absolutely comes
what they found is that for you to be
calling both your get to proceed both
your mother and father to be calling in
the way they approach their work if your
mother does not demonstrate calling to
you are almost statistically not likely
at all to end up with a calling
mentality and if the father if the
mother is and the father isn't it
undermines that imprint and actually
most likely shifts the person down that
cycle so it's fine it's fascinating I
think it speaks to and they looked at
also things that really mattered like
it's really important that we allow
mothers to bring their kids to work
occasionally to model work and what I
found personally is that as a dad people
think it's awesome and cute when I bring
my kids to work if my wife did the same
thing they'd be like why are you like
why can't you get kids under control
while you bring into the office like we
don't have the right standards overall I
think in terms of really enabling our
kids to be able to see our see us at
work I'm and see how much we love what
we do and showing them that calling
approach yeah I feel like Donna may be
getting day I don't fit into any those
shirts right yep take that diagnostic
and figure out what's right there
that'll get to like what generates
purpose for you I think we all have days
where it's just like I don't wanna go to
work today but I have to clean you the
money or I'm really proud I can't wait
to tell my parents about the awesome
thing I did it work today these things
all happen i think i also do with
fundamentally like the story you carry
with you about why we fundamentally work
is the thing that seems to matter we all
have days that saw evan flow with the
diagnostic will answer is what are the
things at work that generate purpose for
you what is the approach to work itself
that will generate purpose for you yeah
back so I'm kind of on this journey
right now yep and I think one of the
biggest challenges is when you
something that you love that you feel
like you have purpose it's hard to earn
what you think you would earn for that
so the economy part of it now charging
for things you'd love to do and making
people believe that you should you
should cover that amount can you talk to
the economic side of it yeah well makers
to Turin pieces to hang because
economics in a sense that people are
willing to take somewhat of a lower pay
to be able to get purpose could sort of
part of the total rewards of whether or
not they're able to get that it's about
fifteen percent that they see people are
willing to shift around you also see a
lot of people just to optimize learning
and relationships portfolio careers are
becoming really popular where people
aren't just working for like one
employer and by the end of this decade
forty percent of the workforce will be
freelancers which is to a large part
part of this overall desire to optimize
against that so I mean I think it's also
a question of like realizing how much
money you actually need I think a lot of
people I mean basically an average city
for a family Frankie like 75 ka year but
we've all sort of built a lot of social
constructs to need more money and
actually the research shows that like
the correlation to happiness like after
that point like almost doesn't matter
right so I think part of it too is sort
of recognizing like what do you need
that money for is it for recognition
security and trying to define that well
so I think that's the piece but I think
the thing with it turning to an economy
is that there are going to be huge multi
multi-billion dollar companies in there
already are that are going to be
servicing the needs of this economy
there's going to be people creating in
every single vertical new companies that
will disrupt the status quo the same way
information economy companies have
disrupted the industrial right a big
part of I was just down in Portland last
night any big part of what we're doing
right now is working with mayor's to say
stop trying to be the next Silicon
Valley I mean first of all you ever been
down there it's not really the place you
want to be secondly it's it's it's it's
the old economy it's the economy that's
like in its heyday right now but it
won't be forever and just like Detroit
where I went to school University
Michigan like used to be the hub of the
industrial economy so going to mayor's
civic leaders and saying stop trying to
be like Portland wants to be like a
Silicon Forest I'm like that just sounds
weird and why do you want to be that
like let's have everyone try to be
Portland let's not try to mb Silicon
Valley let's figure out how to make your
city the hub of the new economy so it
gives me tremendous economic opportunity
and we're already seeing that and a lot
of different verticals yeah so I to on
this journey and it just we're all
mature neck I just got back from
vacation so it's always interesting
thing about these things um and I
instruct with two things about our
vacation and where'd you go so we were
in Eastern Bloc or what used to be
Eastern Bloc countries Latvia Estonia I
love it up there yeah so one thing is we
travel not by hotels we stayed in air
B&amp;amp;B and I think fbb is one of these
companies absolutely and the
relationships or micro relationships and
met the people once we dropped off their
keys sometimes they were just apartments
that they had sometimes we actually
lived in somebody's house for a weekend
but the micro relationship we shared
with those people versus a concierge
then we booked a room in a hotel and yep
you know it's not personal it was a hard
job and that was added a lot of meaning
for a truck but the other part was being
in countries that are basically 20 least
they were celebrating 20 25 years of
freedom yep and they all appreciate that
they still remember it I mean we were in
Lithuania over the weekend and it was a
non-stop parade of every youth in the
country marching and celebrating their
heritage yeah and so it struck me that
it's a lot easier to have purpose when
you're fighting something and we don't
have to fight anything here we have to
define this for ourselves yeah but yet
when they're not fighting that anymore
is so new to them that it's it's all
it's not a challenge to find it I found
so many people just invigorated with
what they were doing regardless of what
they were doing um I still can't
understand why that is I don't think
they struggle with the youth their
struggle with a sense of what am I going
to do with my life I think it's a me see
it I'm again going to that true economic
history of I mean typically economies
have to go through each of these stages
in their evolution like they go from
that agrarian economy and many countries
in the world are still agrarians
industrial information on purpose so
just from like an economic sort of a
output creation like there's a need to
go through that progression from an
economy standpoint people can have
purpose in any environment any time I
think it's when it becomes economic is
where you're seeing that rise right and
we too would have all of our children I
think marching to independence if we
only had four kids I mean Lithuania is
like such a small country so i think
that's cheating yeah what a secondary
education go will do based on the change
in the purpose again yeah those learn
ehrin yep return who's kind of built on
okay you do high school you go to
college get a job so that model i would
call college and a model yeah i mean
just too different i mean it's really
answer the question what it should do
there's a question of what i will do and
i can sort of talk a little bit to both
in our current system is probably fifty
percent agrarian a 50-percent industrial
we haven't yet created an information
economy educational system even we still
like how two summers off because that's
when you farm we still fundamentally
look at a factory model for how we
manage the classroom right this is just
completely ass backwards and we know
doesn't work right so it's an incredibly
hard thing that a change has so much
infrastructure so many vested interests
in that right when you look at it what
should be i think you're looking at a
couple things one education being
something that's not seen as done at any
given time but building the
infrastructure for us all this they were
in school all the time right you're
starting to see companies like General
Assembly that are like creating much
more powerful continuing ed that's not
seen as a continuing ad that's not
desirable and just for people who can't
find work but actually seen is like an
ongoing part of how we are constantly
curious and retooling and I think that
is a critical piece I think the second
one is we known we now know that like
the best learning happens not in a
classroom but like out and about right I
was lucky enough to go and I read about
this in the book to a school in ann
arbor called Community High School where
you could actually get credit for your
job you could get credit if your grandpa
wanted to teach you about World War 2
history you could get credit for Ashley
teaching your peers of class it was
really understood that you learn in the
community not just in a classroom and I
will see more and more
of that I think the third is building
empathy as a skill and self-awareness
which is not something right now that
schools work on they actually do the
opposite they remove empathy and they
remove self-awareness from what the
experiences in terms of graduating folks
with that and the final piece
homeschooling is growing seven times
faster than public school enrollment
right now right and I'm not advocating
for homeschooling but homeschooling is
getting better outcomes than classroom
teaching I'm like most measures right
and I think what that speaks to is the
fact that we need to remove these
intermediaries and the sort of one too
many model and look more at why
homeschooling works which is that it's
an intimate relationship with the
teacher which is your parent and it's
also a customized curriculum at the
speed of that student right right now if
my daughter is in third grade she has to
be at the third grade in math English
art science gym right but people don't
evolve that way she may be like a first
grader in math but like a third and a
third grader in English and a fifth
grader in science right we don't just
evolve and when teacher teaches
something so I give that one window and
then it's over that's not how we learn
and when you're homeschooled you're
actually building learning to that and
that's sort of more like Khan Academy so
I think these are some of the things we
need to adjust I don't think we're going
to be able to create a revolution I just
don't think the infrastructure is to
like solidified I think what we can do
is look to make some of these changes to
building more community and empathy
customization etc yeah so telling
underway he said purpose could this be
reactionary to i'm thinking climate
change and stuff like that so purpose
being installed as reaction vs. mean
something that's innate i think it's
both right so um you know in the
research they show people who have a lot
of chaos in our life tend to emphasize
and put more priority on finding purpose
and creating a story that helps make
sense of the world right so this is true
immediately look at this in really poor
communities by religion for my point of
view is often so popular right because
there's incredible chaos you see it in
terms of the environment the you know
incredible fear around all the changes
going on in the world around the fact
that the job market is incredibly
unstable right now I'm although
potentially getting a little bit better
Millennials are entering a very chaotic
the average millennial is expecting a
job to last two years versus Gen X which
is five years or boomers which is seven
years this kind of chaos breeds a need
to be able to explain what their life's
about what they're doing what's going on
because they're not getting that from
like the unemploy they have forever so
there is a big part of this mono
generation that is is driven by that
that need for some stability to come out
of self-awareness that's why you're
seeing so much as a quest for
self-awareness I'm so much interest in
everything from yoga to self help with
this generation so I think that is
that's no doubt part of it I think it's
one of as I write about in the book
several different like macro trends that
are affecting this from a longevity to
actually the fact that we've only
recently completely integrated women
into the workforce and this is having a
huge impact on a workplace and on the
economy overall economist traditionally
were men and they said work that's done
at home is not real work right which
traditionally was women's work and they
didn't include it as an economic
activity someone said that if you added
that so the gdp would actually boost the
gdp by twenty-five percent right but now
that women are fully integrating to the
workforce we're outsourcing those jobs
and now it starting to show up in the
GDP nom and what's interesting the
fastest-growing job in the u.s. right
now is not a software developer it's a
home health care aide it's the people we
hire to take care of our parents because
we no longer have time to do that right
so it's there's other shifts that are
fundamentally happening they're moving
this economy overall yeah so I'm still
working on the parallel between the
digital economy and the purpose economy
yep Muslim much of your talk here a
subset of the book i'm sure it was about
finding purpose in whatever economic
environment yep yourself so so that
that's different from for instance the
difference between the digital economy
versus the that's right right yeah so
it's the same way like it to think about
like Microsoft you could argue is pretty
much information economy company right
but bank of america maybe isn't but they
still use information economy a lot as
part of how they operate right so
there's sort of like is that the way i
see there will be companies that are
like almost entirely purpose economy
companies like etsy right but you're
also starting just
the other companies that are basically
saying okay we're in apparel right like
I was working at the gap where an
apparel we're not a purpose economy
organization overall but just like we
had to add IT to make ourselves modern
we are having to basically figure out
how to add purpose to what we're doing
so thank you see sort of a pure model
like Microsoft is pure in the
information economy and then you see
like every other company realizing they
have to add it as part of their platform
that make sense yeah yeah he's gonna do
this band elevator on the whole idea of
freelancing you said that to me you're
gonna select forty percent people
working yeah you see incredible rise in
it I mean into it did this study um you
know I cuz a bunch of variables for I
mean part of its not by choice right
it's a people as having to pick up bits
of work but a lot of us actually people
wanting that autonomy wanting to be able
to choose their clients peel to have
diversity um I worked as a taproot we
had a volunteer early on who was from HP
and you've been there forever as a
designer he's like I love my job people
I work with I get a have really fun
tools etc but I'm really tired of
designing in blue and gray like
everything I do at HP has to be in the
same colors right and Jim pro bono work
he's like I want to add pink and green
and yellow and be able to do more right
I think it's easy to see that from a
design standpoint but I think in every
career it's like you whether you're
working in the same code base whether
you're working in the same HR policies
you tend to like want that to mix it up
and I think also people are wanting to
have more control their identity and not
be just seen as like an employee of a
company and you're seeing this desire to
do that I think it also fits better with
the learn earn return model where people
are saying look I'm going to want to be
taking classes and learning I'm going to
want to be working some and I'm going to
want to be being involved in a community
etc and it creates the flexibility for a
lot of people to see how they can go
about doing all three of those so many
of my millennial friends like do not
have a job and maybe them make more than
the people i know who do have a job
because they're basically doing this
portfolio and it's stressful because
they're constantly having to basically
hustle for money and find clients and do
that work so it's not like a Pollyanna
schleich it's it's not all sort of easy
we're just seeing a huge increase in
this and it's radically changing how we
think about work when you think about
all the labor laws we have and all
of the sort of systems we have if you
think about you know in 10 years like it
may be that many of the folks working at
Microsoft are actually not employees of
Microsoft right which is already the
case probably to some degree but to see
the acceleration of that the whole idea
of what is a team what is a community
how does this all work and it TV it goes
to the extreme of like YouTube I mean
YouTube at some level is like one of the
largest volunteer organizations in the
world right they've got all these people
creating content for them my time warner
would kill for that right yeah exactly
so it's like this suit of the whole idea
like what is an employee what is a
customer what is a freelancer what is a
volunteer like these things are all
getting mashed up and I think in the
next five to ten years we're going to be
really thinking differently about what
the relationships are I don't have like
a crystal ball to say what exactly
that's gonna look like only to say we've
got a fun time to make a really cool pie
yeah what I would say is that I think
that this purpose economy mentality
transcends generations absolutely we've
talked about Millennials yep but I also
think is true for Gen X and boomers I
give me an example though in my job I
leave citizenship and public affairs for
the US yep we just hired a director in
the central region and in four days we
have 600 applicants uh to the point
where a recruiting said that at first of
all we were astounded but our recruiting
team was too and when I look back on the
candidates they spanned the generations
yep so my question for you is that if is
true that that we're all their rep
whether it's a baby boomer millennial or
Gen X yep is there a difference among
those generations once they're all there
so once so I think there's a couple
things I think every generation since
came n probably cared about this right
so it's not that it's like unique to
Millennials I think you know I'm Gen X
this is important to me my dad just
became a social entrepreneur at 65 I
mean people are exploring these things
for different reasons at different times
there's a huge movement on boomers to
say okay I got past that midlife point
and beyond um you know I still know I'm
have to work for another 30 years like I
want this work to actually matter and I
mean somebody I want to learn I want to
do this so it's a term motivation there
for Gen X we're seeing a leadership
opportunity to help create this
environment to make this happen and for
millennial think the difference is one
does that fundamental belief from the
get-go the learner in return all happen
at once where the previous generations
did have more of a sense of once I've
earned my right then I will and I think
also just this sort of much more
dynamism around it in terms of like the
networking that happens around it the
amount of stuff has done outside of work
around this I'm seeing a lot more of
that kind of activity it exists for sure
with these other generations but you
just see it like spiking a lot of it's
pretty superficial so far because people
don't know how to get that need met them
so you know it's absolutely like through
and through I think the millennial
generation though is the one it's going
to force the workplace to change whereas
X and boomers are just excited to have
the opportunity and are like wanting it
but they're not like forcing the change
the same way Millennials are ya which of
this will touch the Hobby 22% maybe 23
so this is this is a um I should have a
couple ever answers to this and this
book is about like the science and it's
also about futurism right and I think
there's some contradictions and some of
like understanding how this will work
because the future it's not the past
right so so the standpoint of purpose
and having purpose in their lives it
affects everybody right and I would
argue the people I know who have the
least means often have the most purpose
in their lives because they're closer to
that story in Lithuania where they're
getting real purpose from the day-to-day
of the survival with their family I know
when I was 22 i had more purpose in my
work that I do now as a CEO at 40
because i had more authentic
relationships i was actually coding
which was deeply rewarding to like code
something actually see something change
versus now i get us create powerpoint
decks and talk to people and don't
really get the depth of relationships i
think there's some interesting sort
dynamics there but it's an economic
force in terms of changing the workforce
in terms of changing retail I think it's
similar to like the beginning of the
information economy we're early on like
not everyone can afford a computer right
there was a huge digital divide and it's
only like relatively recently that we're
pretty much going to the point where we
assume everyone has
smartphone everyone has you know access
to a laptop not every single person but
the majority right and I think it's a
challenge about like patience right of
like how long is it going to take em it
took the information economy decades to
get to that point where everyone had
access and we're like it affected every
job I think we're going to see a similar
shorter but trajectory and if you look
at Roger Everett's diffusion of
innovations curve people remember that's
really good this curve that goes from
the innovator early adopter early
majority late majority laggards you know
the information economy were already in
a late majority right where the late
majority of folks are fully on board
there's still a few laggards out there
right that are just like hell no i'm not
using the stuff it's horrible but we
pretty much gotten all the way through i
think with this purpose of cotton we're
still in the innovators early early
adopters that's why the cold foods does
so long people are like oh it's just an
elitist thing but so were the early
computers because you just couldn't
afford them otherwise right so you know
whole foods is slowly actually changing
a whole organic food markets so that 10
years from now you will be able to get
low cost organic and healthy food at any
grocery store and that would not have
been possible if whole foods hadn't
developed at early part of the market so
we tend to think of them as only for the
rich they actually played in critical
role and actually changing the whole
ecosystem around food yeah online
questions of th she says something that
data is the oil that fuels the internet
information economy what would be the
currency in a purpose economy purpose no
I think the currency is a choice around
purpose right and those employers that
are able to create environments and
support employees to really optimize
purpose are the ones they're able to
have access to the top talent those
companies that create products and
services and experience they give the
richest sort of purpose to to their
customers are the ones they're going to
be able to attract the best dollars the
biggest dollar is the biggest margin for
their product it's a special sauce and I
think it's trying to understand like how
does your product help build
relationships how does it help someone
do something greater than themselves how
does it help someone grow right building
that into that experience and it's been
fun working with retailers you know
everyone from like IKEA thinking about
what is the purpose economy mall
shopping mall look like right
to you know thinking about you know
apparel thinking about cars how do each
these industries how do you add that
special sauce to differentiate and make
your product better the same way you
know other companies had to bring
information economy to existing products
to make that special yeah that probably
looks like here is apps because
everybody is encouraged to build an app
and whatever your purpose in life can
come through as an app that you know
help suppose the cut both the company
and the individual yeah I mean apps your
phone because it's like something I
requires much less infrastructure
typically and like any of those people
to have that space you know I think it'd
be interesting to challenge like what
what is that here fully as a company and
I guess probably every single product
you have now you could think about how
is this product building relationships
anything someone they just want greater
themselves and helping someone grow
right I don't think it has to be like a
separate product line I think it has
maybe a question of how do you integrate
that more and more and amplify where
it's already existing so I guarantee
you're already doing that and a lot of
your products it's just a question of
like putting it through that lens
actually talking to your customers about
how they're using out how they could use
it towards these other goals will have
much deeper residence and loyalty with
them to do a nap here that's the sorry I
didn't okay houses like bring her after
work day find your purpose through now
yeah that's an employee of Microsoft so
what it said how many how many of you've
created an app like fiber Kevin did like
I'm curious to hear about that
afterwards um no I mean think that's a
really important way to like give
someone space to create something and
have a breakthrough it's like a really
wonderful little way to test and pilot
I'm sometimes I think guess you know I
gots great um I think it's a start of
like really thinking through everything
yeah about yep
wow wow my friends in German I'll be
happy thank you guys I really loves
playing the afternoon if you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
