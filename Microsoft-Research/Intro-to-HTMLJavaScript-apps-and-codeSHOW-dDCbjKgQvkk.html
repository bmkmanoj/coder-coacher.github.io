so we're going to be talking about
JavaScript tonight how many people are C
sharp total is C sharp awesome that's
what I thought a lot of people are I
totally came from C sharp javascript was
always kind of love hate mostly hate I
jumped into windows 8 and for some
reason I went the JavaScript way
actually I remember after being in this
role for a couple months calling a
colleague and being like I need out I've
got to get back to C sharp because I
feel really really bad here you know
this is not a happy world JavaScript
just leaves me out in the woods in the
dark so often and it's just not fun and
but he told me to stay in it and I
stayed in it and now I'm really happy
I'm really I'm really loving the
javascript stuff it's really cool and
the tools are getting better and the the
performance is getting better not that
it was ever really bad but just the
performance measurements monitoring and
stuff is getting better it's really a
cool world to be in it's kind of amazing
being on the client and writing writing
this JavaScript so we're gonna be
talking about all JavaScript tonight who
here is a JavaScript head or a web
platform person all right so if I am
talking to mostly a crowd of C sharp
developers I assume that you guys would
maybe enjoy the occasional this is the
equivalent in c-sharp of that type of
thing great so there are kind of two
components to the presentation tonight
first is the app itself this is called
code show and I use this to show HTML
and JavaScript programming in windows 8
and the app itself I made in the so i
can show kind of the architecture of the
app and how it how it actually works and
builds the tiles and and looks at
metadata and stuff like that and i don't
know i'll try to think about whether
that would be more helpful or the second
tier is actually taking you through the
demos themselves and showing you how
these things are done now if you're just
looking to see how to do certain windows
8 things a lot of the things that happen
in here end up calling in to the winner
t API and that's the way it's done
and it's the same way pretty much the
exact same way in both javascript and C
sharp so you'll you'll still kind of you
know learn how to for instance tie up to
a sensor or integrate with Bing Maps or
whatever whether you do it in JavaScript
or in c-sharp but i'll go ahead and
start with the overall app architecture
and i'll move into a few of these demos
i'll look at whichever ones i think
might be the most helpful for you and
then you guys can feel free if you see
one blaze by and I don't hit on it I'll
leave plenty of time for QA and when we
get to that point you can say can you
show me this one I've always been
wanting to know how to make a custom
control in JavaScript or I've always
been looking to use the flip view
control in JavaScript or something like
that and I'd be glad to show that demo
by the way code show is a project that I
of course I put it in the store for free
I do have an ad in there mostly just for
display I make like two dollars a month
on it but I i have it on codeplex and
when I put it on codeplex I said well
let's do this in TFS you know this is a
full-on Microsoft product and so I put
it in TFS on codeplex and when I was
trying to tell people to collaborate I
thought that they were going to be able
to go into codeplex and connect to that
source control so that they could always
just do get get latest version and pull
it into visual studio and I ended up
hearing from somebody in the field
saying no I were not able to do that
apparently I would have have to had to
grant them as a contributor it with
their codeplex ID and then that's the
only way that I mean I kind of knew that
they would have to do that if they were
going to contribute to it but they would
even have to do that if they were going
to consume it they were just going to
get latest version so does anybody have
any experience with that you've run into
the same thing yeah so you pretty much
just have to download this static file
will code show changes quite a bit you
know we add demos to it we've got a
couple contributors to it and and so I
wanted people to be able to feel like
they kind of had a live connection to it
so they don't have to go seeking out the
latest version
so I didn't want to use github because
github is you know a direct competitor
and I know a number of people were using
github but I was like I'm going to stick
to the you know the party line here and
then they we started allowing get source
control in codeplex how many people knew
that from last time how many people have
used get as a source control in codeplex
how many people have used get at all
handful of you okay what are your
impressions with get compared to TFS
that I'm talking just about the source
control not about the overall alm sounds
it uh stated simply I haven't forgotten
greater with visual studio like the TFS
version was just automatic yeah I have a
github project that I have to use a
different set of tools yeah yeah seems
to work
anyone else codeplex or what are
whatever I went to TFS vigils to calm an
asset of my project yeah does it get
there in a great visual studio yeah she
up as well they both do any get project
will integrate and visual studio and
i'll show you how that works yeah okay
so the reason why i want very much to
show you how this works is this
currently i have two people myself and
one other that have contributed to code
show i would like very much to have more
contributors to code show and i want you
guys to see how it's done because it's
super super simple okay it's just the
creation of an HTML CSS and a javascript
file that does whatever you want to show
off and then you just add a little bit
of meta information in the HTML file and
you contribute that a folder with those
three files in it and that's it it'll
automatically show up as a tile on the
front screen and it'll automatically
work that demo and so want people to
contribute to it but whether you're
doing JavaScript or C sharp hopefully
this will hopefully this will help so if
i go to my visual studio instance which
mine is code foster dot visual studio
com this is all the projects that i have
in my TFS my this is the service not
terminal server terminal foundation
server but serve this okay this is all
the projects that i have and these can
be private so this is the equivalent of
the pay version of github really okay
these can be private and so i can
restrict these two only the people that
I've elected to be on my team so I can
build a little team and as long as my
team is five or less it's free at least
for now it says that it doesn't say it
here but when when you're not logged in
when you're on the kind of the public
landing page it talks about how there's
going to be a free tier but for now
everything's free in it because it's
just spinning up but this is really cool
that I can for I've actually got a
little game group I call us the
underground app dev group and there's
three of us and I just give them
accounts in here with their live IDs one
of them has a gmail account and one has
some custom account but they're all
they're all in here as contributors to
my projects so that's really cool when
you create a new
project you can create a project using
it and now you get all of the glory that
is TFS I mean TFS is amazing I don't
even really see any direct competitors
TFS it's just awesome and you get all
the glory that is TFS but your
repository is sitting on top of github
and so that's really beautiful so now I
can go to my app this is one of my my
projects that is ntfs but it's sitting
on top of github and I can go to the
code tab this is in TFS now not codeplex
although codeplex is you know sitting on
top of TFS they work a little bit
differently so now here's little pond
and I can go over here it's a little bit
obscure I think this needs to be a
little bit more clear but this applica
psyche on on the far right is clone and
if I click on that it gives me the the
git command and the URL to clone this
github repository and now anybody in the
whole world it doesn't matter if they
have an account on TFS doesn't they
don't have to have anything TFS anything
Microsoft specific nothing installed
they just have to have get installed on
their computer they can go type in get
clone and that URL and it will
automatically create a folder and put
this entire project inside that folder
on their machine plus because you did a
clone action that clone will set up this
URL as a remote and a remote is like a
repository that I'm aware of okay so
they're going to be working on their
machine they'll make changes commit to
the repository on their machine make
some more changes make another commit
continue to work locally as much as they
want and as soon as they have something
that they like like some commits that
they think adds some value to the
project if they are a team member on
this project if they're one of my guys
then they can they can do what's called
a push to that repository and it will
push those commits those changes that
they made up to that repository okay you
actually have to go up to your profile
in TFS and create a flat the ID and
password because otherwise you're logged
in as your live account and you don't
want to log in through the gate terminal
with your live account so you go in and
create yourself flat credentials I'll
show you that real quick I go into my
profile my profile
and the credentials tab allows me to go
change this secondary credential so I go
set it to whatever password I want and
now that's my kind of flat credential
for accessing that repository so this is
really neat because somebody can really
easily get do a git clone and then all
they have to do is do git pull and it
pulls down from from this repository
pulls down all the latest commit so
anything that the people that own the
project have pushed into it they just
hit pole and it refreshes it's just like
a get latest version okay it pulls all
that merges it in their project
automatically and then they've got the
latest and they never had to sign up for
anything they never had to do anything
so that's really that's really helpful
for people now this all exists in the
form of codeplex at codeplex and if you
go to code show codeplex com like i said
when i started code show i had this
hosted in TFS on codeplex but at one
point I realized I want to open this up
for more contributions and so I want to
host this on get and so I went into
source control and I tried to change it
to get and it said in order to change it
you have to email this person oh well
that's a fun workflow in 2013 so I
emailed this person and man they got
back to me like the next day and said
all right it's converted I was like
really I came and logged back in and all
of a sudden it looks like this I've got
you know get verbiage all over the place
and I am absolutely loving the way this
works now because I still get since
codeplex is still sitting on top of TFS
it still takes advantage of all the
things like work items and all of that
all of the other ALM features that that
TFS gives us and yet for my repository
I've gotta git repository this one I
think is looks a little bit better it's
a little bit more clear that I can clone
by doing this and the clone address for
code show is just that so I can give
that to anybody I want any forum I could
just say here's my here's my repository
URL and they can do git clone they've
got my whole project okay now if they
want to clone it and pull any time they
want they can always pull changes they
can always get the latest version of
code show no problem
but if they want to push they're going
to have to have a code Plex account I'm
gonna have to know who they are if
they're going to push into codeplex
right so how do I allow just any Joe to
contribute to codeplex does anybody know
the answer submit a patch that that's
not in get terminology though and get
terminology what do they do when they
feel bad baby get this fork and they do
a pull request okay it's actually easier
than it sounds i don't know why that the
terminology has to sound so arcane but
the first thing they do is they say you
know what i'm interested in this project
and i've already cloned it and i've
already you know pulled it a few times
got the latest and I've written some
some stuff on it but I want it I want to
contribute these so they hit fork and
what happens then is fork requires that
they have a code Plex account because
forking takes a public repository like
cojo it takes a project and says you
want to duplicate that project in your
own codeplex account and so now there's
a mirror image of code show in that they
are hosting and that's the key it has to
be another publicly hosted repository so
they've just forked it but they're fork
has a an awareness of the real code show
the original project and so they can
from that they can you know maintain
that that live link and then they can
make the changes on their local computer
and then they can push into their fork
and then once they've pushed some
commits into their fork on their
repository then they can come here and
it probably won't oh it will let no for
me since I'm the owner of this it's only
telling me how many people have done a
pull request which right now is a grand
02 people have forked the project but
zero people have done a pull request but
somebody that doesn't own code show
would come in here and they would look
at this and they would see the option to
submit a pull request and they would
choose which they would you know they
would give them their fork and they
would choose the the commits and they
would say boom go and what that does is
it sends a message to me that says Joe
just
Forked your project made some changes
and submitted a pull request here are
his changes and he'll show you all of
the deltas on all of the files whether
it's XML or a CS file or a JS file or
whatever i'll show you all of those
deltas so you can see exactly what he
did if you want you can pull that down
to local and run it and go yeah that's
really good i really i don't see any
bugs in their code i think its value
added to the project so i'm going to go
ahead and pull that that's why it's
called a pull request because he's
requesting that i pull his changes into
my project so he does that pull request
I say that's good i pull it in it
automatically merges all of his changes
into my project and now i've got it okay
so that's the procedure for that it's
it's nice because Joe can be anybody
using whatever system I don't I don't
care what ide he uses I don't care if
he's using notepad or whatever and he
doesn't have to have any of the
credentials unless he's actually going
to fork and then all he needs is his own
account it doesn't have to be a
contributor in the code show project so
hopefully that's helpful now if you have
if you if you are used to that workflow
of using your source control inside a
visual studio then what you want to do
is upgrade visual studio to update to
see TP you guys heard of update to see
TP so this rolled out with the get
changes there's there's visual studio
and then there's update one you probably
all got it and then there's update to
see TP which is not being pushed since
its CTP but you can go you can go grab
that change I haven't had any issues
with it you can go grab update to see TP
and then you can install the wait for it
you can install the visual tool Visual
Studio Tools forget which this just this
just revved up to version point eight
just now I just installed it Visual
Studio Tools forget don't be confused
because there's been a source a git
plugin for visual studio for some time
it was called source can get source
control for visual studio or something
like that that's the version that looks
at the looks at the get binaries on your
computer the actual get program
and it makes it work in visual studio
but this version actually upgrades all
of the ALM and everything inside a
visual studio so you can go look at
repositories look at all the commits on
them and everything so I've got this so
let me try I don't usually work in
visual studio as you might notice by my
my fumbling but I can go look at team
explorer here and I can connect to oh I
wonder if it's because I just upgraded
this but anyway I can connect to a git
repository and then it gives me all
kinds of I can see all the diffs right
in visual studio I can see the commits
the basically the changes I can see a
big history of all the changes I I'm
waiting for it to integrate a visual
like a branch a visual branching
representation because those are really
cool with get gets like incredible with
branching and so it's really nice to be
able to see all your commit branches and
stuff and I don't I don't think that
it's in that plug-in I haven't found it
yet but that would be really nice
tortoise kit and you can visualize yeah
a little bit basically if you use talk
like this feeling yeah the same thing ok
ok go to the visual yeah it also
integrates with exposure so you can
right click and say hi the other now i
don't use any of those i used to use my
source control in visual studio all the
time and i tried doing that with get and
it just felt a little bit more awkward i
got used to the git commands finally I
don't know what that makes me but now I
go to get shell the easiest way to get
get shell on your computers to just
install github for windows if you
installed github for windows it does it
really nicely it installs this get shell
which is basically posh get that's the
PowerShell get now you have posh get on
your computer you can run it and you can
use PowerShell and access all your git
commands and if you're a if you're a
command line person you're going to
absolutely love this if you just hate
the command line it has to be gooey for
you you're going to hate this so
definitely get that plugin for visual
studio but now I get in here and the
thing I love about get is that the
repository travels with the folder so it
doesn't really matter where on my
computer
put my development projects the
repository is right there inside of them
within a hidden git folder so it's all
there so I've got this development
folder and I can go into I've got my
construct two games and I can go into
that fish game the little pond and as
soon as I move into a folder that has a
hidden get folder in it it says hey I
noticed that this is a git repository so
it shows me the branch that i'm
currently on and so now i can use my git
commands like i can use git status and
it's going to show me what's different
between my working folder and this git
repository and it says there's nothing
to commit your working folder is clean
let me add something here let me add
hello world and then we add that to a
text called HW txt is everybody familiar
with that piping command I'm just taking
a string and writing it into a file so i
just created a file and now my get
indicator is saying there's been a file
added that little plus 1 means there's
an addition and if i if i do a git
status now it says here's a file that i
recognized but this is an untracked file
it wasn't aware of this file before and
we're not by default going to assume
that you want that even as part of your
repository so I can do for instance I
can do get add HW txt or oftentimes if
you've got a lot of things to add used
to get add dot and it adds that into
there and now when I do a git status it
says you have a staged change this new
file HW text is staged to be added to
that project then I can do a git commit
and it opens up notepad for me and i can
write all the notes that i want about
what that commits was just a hello world
test come in ok all the rest of that is
going to just be comments so it's not
actually going to show up in my commit
text and then when i close notepad and
save changes get uses that as that last
commit and now i can do get log and
it'll show me all my commits that's a
little bit hairy so I do get I do get
log one line that needs two dashes
get log one line and now I can see the
complete history of that repository
notice I'm just looking on my local
computer right now and the last one is
just a hello world test commit I just
committed that change right there and
now I can push this up to the server
like this so I have an awareness if I
type git remote it shows me everybody I
have an awareness of and I've named it
TFS so i have this shortcut in get
called TFS and actually if I do get
remote v4 verbose it says TFS and it's
pointing to that URL it shows it twice
because it you know there's a different
one for the fetching versus the pushing
but in most cases they're the same URL
at least for TFS it always is so now i
can do get push TFS my master branch BAM
and it's going to look at that remote
TFS and it's going to look at what
commits that that i have locally that it
doesn't have and it's going to publish
that commits up to TFS right same thing
would work in codeplex this might take a
while because the if you if you don't
know a commit is actually a snapshot of
the entire repository but get is super
smart about never like duplicating
information so if you have a file in
there twice it actually is is being
intelligent about the way that it stores
it so it doesn't it it's actually ought
the repositories are surprisingly small
surprisingly small especially when
you've got since you've got so many
versions and now it's copied that whole
thing up and I now just added that
commits up into my repository all right
I think this is the way we're going I
think that the the TFS team indicates
that with you know with adding support
for get into the TFS solution so that's
pretty cool any questions on that all
right let's go ahead and open code show
so again you get the source control real
easily by just doing a git pull or you
can just go into the source code and
download a zip file of the whole thing
and code show is currently a few little
projects but that's these are just
components for one of the demos so we
can show off what components are and
then this is the start of a testing
suite is anybody is anybody kind of an
expert in c-sharp unit tests decent
we're all kind of quasi experts in it we
should all be better right we should all
be better citizens and be better at our
unit tests well when I jumped into the
JavaScript world I was like how in the
world am I going to do my unit test
because unit tests don't integrate with
visual studio like they do in c-sharp
and I found my answer in another project
called heel ojs that the patterns and
practices group works on and it's really
helpful it's it's a really well-designed
app that it's really a simple scope
really low scope app is just like a
picture app for Windows 8 but they did
it really really right yeah it's helo
jsh ILO you can find it in the msdn
samples you can also find it at I think
it's at Hilo j/s codeplex com so H ILO
Jas codeplex com yeah that's it and it's
it's hosted and get so if you jump over
to the source code and then click on
clone you'll see the clone URL for
getting heel ojs now he'll ojs is a
project and then a test project and the
way that I learned from that app that
this works is here I've got code show my
main project right and then I've got
this test project and notice I've got
code show in there with a little X on it
the way this is working is this is a
linked reference to another project and
in order to add a file as a linked
reference I actually didn't even know
you could do this I had never in all my
years of programming done this before
you can actually when you add a
reference or add a file to the project
you can say i want to add it as a link
and then it keeps that file in its
original location i don't know why i
never ran into that anyway it turns out
if you want to do that for an entire
folder and kind of automatically get all
of its contents recursively you can go
into the project file into the xml
and you can add a little content line in
there and reference that folder and so
if you want to see how that's done just
look in the project file for my test
project and you'll see exactly how I
drag actually I'll just go ahead and
show that I'll take my tests project and
I'll unload it and then i'll edit it and
here i'm looking at the whole thing and
if i look down here at content ok that's
interesting it looks like it has i
didn't know it was going to do this and
i haven't looked at it since I did it it
broke it out into a whole bunch of
linked files I thought it was going to
maintain just a single folder reference
but it actually broke it out into a
whole bunch of files wow I need to look
into that because that's really
interesting that it did that I didn't
have to add all of those i just added a
reference to the folder i don't think it
will which is the problem that i was i
was hoping that it would pick that up
hmmm curious anyway ok so i can reload
that project close it yes and so you can
see that the test project has a
reference to the real project the reason
why we're working in this environment is
with with unit tests oftentimes you just
create some assembly with a reference to
your unit testing framework and then you
use that assembly to hit your your
project but in this case we have to be a
Windows 8 app in order to access like
the WinRT a name spaces and stuff so we
create ourselves at a real winrt win 8
app and then we create that reference to
our real project and then we can access
the stuff in that real project and we
can run our tests now this testing suite
is actually using mocha and chai those
are two different test frameworks for
JavaScript that happened to be really
good ones I'm really pleased with them
they're really simple test frameworks so
and if you look in tests I just have one
test in here that's doing almost nothing
but it'll show you basically how you
describe these you get much more robust
example if you open heel ojs but I've
just got one of them where I describe a
test before the test I set x equal to
one or do whatever and then I have a
test and it's structured win when
something or other this should happen it
should happen that true equals true in
this case it's always true and so then
you can run this test and it gives it
it's got its own UI mocha gives it kind
of a UI it runs in windows 8 and it runs
all these JavaScript tests so that's
pretty slick maybe we should go ahead
and run that
runs all those tests runs that one test
in my case I feel pretty ashamed having
this code show app out there with one
unit test that's ridiculous anyway and
doesn't work thought I'd run that before
it true is no longer true and it is a
bad day
hmm I don't know what's wrong there
anyway doesn't matter look at Hilo Jas
let me see how that works okay now let's
look a little bit at the overall
structure of code show and this won't be
much set as startup project this won't
be much but the way I wanted this to
work is I wanted to be able to add demos
very easily so I have a folder called
demos and inside of demos is just a
whole bunch of folders one per demo and
for each of those folders so for
instance for the let's use the Bing Maps
I'll expand that and each one is
essentially an HTML CSS and a JavaScript
file okay the the HTML file I have these
four lines six through nine or is yeah
line 6 through 9 are these meta tags
that tell the system a little bit about
this demo so I say who the author is I
give it some keywords and I give it a
description now when the app first runs
the default j/s file is the one that
does all of the kind of startup stuff
it's the one that that has the events to
describe the activated and suspended
events things like that and in here I
call a when the app is activated i call
this load demos a sink I can f12 in to
load demos a sink and see what that does
and load demos async iterates this
folder iterates the project folder and
it looks in the demos folder and it it
looks at each of them and for each of
them it looks for the meta tags and
builds this information and it basically
builds up a file and then I'm also
storing some stuff in Windows Azure
mobile services I'm not finished with
this piece of it yet but for each of
those demos I want a person to be able
to say this demo sucked one star or this
demo rock five stars and of course I
don't want to just store that in their
app because I want them to be able to
see the reviews from all the other
people that reviewed it so I'm going to
be storing that up in Windows Azure
mobile services kind of already a.m. and
so this is going to be kind of a melding
of two pieces of information all the
stuff that you get local and
and all of the stuff that it pulls out
of Windows Azure mobile services and it
builds up a collection of all the demos
and does that once at the beginning of
the app and the important thing here is
that the load demos async returns a
promise so for all you see sharp heads
you use the async pattern which is
really really elegant JavaScript's
equivalent is the promise pattern it's
pretty cool I would say it's maybe not
quite as as terse as the async pattern
but it's pretty dang nice it's pretty
dang nice you return a promise and
that's essentially a task so you know
how your tasks are generic you have a
task of string so you get a task back
but you get to look at its string well
we get a promise and that promise
contains a function that that has a
payload as a payload that is the value
that you wanted it to return okay so
that this load demos async I give it the
convention i use the async keyword at
the end to just kind of follow that
convention so that somebody knows this
is not going to return to you a value is
going to return to you a promise so it
comes back with a promise and now if you
look back at where I was where this got
called on line 28 on line 28 i set an
appt level variable the demos list i set
that equal to sorry I'm on the wrong
line the demo is loaded I set that equal
to the result of that asynchronous event
so this returns a promise that gets
stored here and now anywhere else in my
app I can ask that question or they'd
have the demos been loaded so now I know
that nothing else will try to happen
until that has happened it'll wait for
the demos to be loaded before it for
instance allows you to navigate to one
or something like that okay so it's just
kind of a an interesting pattern that
async pattern the way that things are
loaded you do need to wait for it of
course it takes milliseconds for for
those demos to load but you definitely
don't want to try to do something before
that's actually happened so everything
in this demos folder is loaded up
including the bing maps folder and it's
looked at the meta information for bing
maps
so it's looked here for get ready for
easy and powerful maps and apps so let's
go look here and Bing Maps is right here
get ready for easy and powerful maps and
apps it takes this from the page title
inside the HTML and it takes this from
that meta tag and it sets it up
navigable and everything so I can click
on bing maps and I can start to show you
the first demo in code show so on some
of my later demos I've put more meta in
for more information in here kind of
explanatory information here's how the
demo works here's what you need here's
the your different options and stuff and
I've kind of followed this slider
pattern where I've got multiple things
happening and they kind of get more
advanced as you slide to the right so
for the Bing Maps I always the the goal
with code show demos is for each one to
be something super simple and super low
scope so that you can just go yep that's
what I'm interested in I'll go look at
the code and figure out how that works
you know how the msdn samples are pretty
robust and they all have like nine
scenarios and it takes a little bit of
time to go reverse engineer the
scenarios and exactly what it's going to
do for you and how how they implemented
that so I wanted these to be
complementary to that and so these are
very very low scope very simple demos so
the first one is just showing a basic
map and you can see that the map works
and if you if that's all you want to do
is start there and include a map and
then that's the one that you should
start with but if you want to be able to
move around on an app like if you want
to be able to go to Seattle or go to
Kauai then you can use that second one
and if you want to get into adding some
push pins you can use this one and then
if you want to add a custom push pin
somewhere then instead of just adding a
generic push push push pin you can add a
custom one like this and now you can use
any HTML markup that you want as a push
pin so that gets that opens up a lot of
possibilities now since this app is
you've got the source you've got all the
source code but i also want somebody to
very easily like say on their winner
t device to go to the store download
code show and browse some of these demos
and see how things work and so I added
see the code at the top so at the top
here i have see the code and then once i
go to the code i can switch back to the
demo so this is just a little toggle nav
and when i get to the code it shows it
looks in that folder dynamically and
says what code files and i tell it what
our code files what code files does it
have and then it uses the Alex whatever
his name is that syntax highlighter that
you may have seen if you try to use it
for blog posts or something to highlight
the syntax in your code it's a real
popular one anyway I use that to pretty
print this essentially the only downside
to that is that it's not you can't
select anything and that's the big
bummer number of people have commented
in the reviews you can't select and
highlight and copy stuff out of here so
big bummer but anyway it shows you all
of the HTML all the CSS which in this
case is hardly any and then all the
JavaScript for that for that app for
that demo for their to say copy code
yeah actually I could and it would copy
that entire code file that would be
better than nothing but i found a
javascript library that i want to plug
in that would allow you to just go copy
whatever you want in there that would be
better okay so you can look at the
javascript that it takes to do the basic
map all you have to do is a new up a map
stop map tell it what divs you're going
to be dropping it in and in that case
your map options are simply your
credentials and your width and height so
that's the Bing Maps so now this is
where you can feel free to jump in and
say we want to see that one and I'll be
glad to show it to you but in the
absence of suggestions I'll just kind of
pick some of these the canvas ball was a
super simple implementation of canvas
animation in HTML and JavaScript so we
just have a ball bouncing around on the
screen and you can see that this one is
obviously going to be mostly JavaScript
and you can
see how to do that very simple it's
basically a really light game loop there
we've got drawn step drawn snap drawn
step drawing stuff that's essentially a
game written in JavaScript of course
they start to get fancier as you add
this and add that but that's the very
basics of a JavaScript game I got
together with the guys that do reactive
extensions and asked them if I could
plug in some of their demos into code
show and they said of course and so I've
got a number that begin with RX one of
them here is rx autocomplete so all of
the ones that begin with RX use reactive
extensions and who here is used at
reactive extensions one who here is even
aware of reactive extensions just a
couple interesting Wow reactive
extensions is beautiful there's a whole
dotnet implementation of it and a whole
javascript implementation of it and it
is slick how to describe it in one
sentence I always struggle with this the
guys that wrote it do much better but it
essentially isn't an event aggregator
it's the ability to capture a stream of
events and respond to it intelligently
as a stream manipulate the stream filter
the stream merge the stream with another
stream so if you are running into a
situation where you're capturing events
and mass and it might happen more than
you think imagine like mouse move mouse
move is something that's going to fire
very very many times and instead of
responding to that event and asking
yourself all kinds of questions in that
event and having all kinds of switching
logic well ok the mouse just moved but
if his button was down then do this and
if his button was up and do this and if
you're running into that type of a
scenario then look into our xjs or rx
net because it might might cure a
headache ok so it's we're using we're
consuming streams for all of these RX
examples in this one I'm actually
looking on Wikipedia for results and so
this is an excellent way to to query for
to do autocomplete in any so
an input box so that's a really good one
i have RX canvas paint RX canvas paint
is tracking events like win the mouse or
finger touch and as they're dragged and
it's rendering canvas artifacts every
time the the mouse moves by one pics
okay so that's a good way to do
something like that also on a related
note the drag and drop is our X for
dragging something around on the screen
there are higher level ways to do that
but that's okay there's a crop tool that
allows you to crop a picture and there's
this funny time flies that follows your
finger with a string of texts so like
welcome to 1990 JavaScript so those are
some RX examples that I have has anybody
seen any that they want to see okay
let's look at a sliding div if I have a
div from off the screen and I want to
bring it on there it is super simple
let's look at the windows add SDK this
one will show you how to bring an ad
control into your project so if you see
the code on this you can see the the way
that we do controls in JavaScript you
know in C sharp and zamel how to do it
in JavaScript here's how we do it you
have a normal div tag but you give it
this these two attributes you really
only need the one in some cases but
there are two attributes control and
options the control is the full name
space and control type of the control
that you want to turn this div into and
then options is a adjacent string that
you want to pass into that control as
options as like attributes and then the
the framework the wind j/s framework is
responsible for looking throughout your
whole app when your app first runs and
saying find all of the data win controls
and turn those into controls so it's
going to go through and say okay here's
the element they wanted me to turn that
into an ad control so the ad SDK is
responsible for running and crunching
that and turning it into an ad control
okay so that's how we do controls this
is just a super simple one that brings
in an ad and I like to sit here and just
refresh this over and over and I highly
suggest that you guys do that too yeah
yeah yeah just going yep same same
credentials and everything here's a
decent one that i just added for the
latest video series that that we did on
on mva this is the lambs push
notifications so if you're interested in
doing push notifications and you don't
want to write your own server service
then you can use Wham's for this it's
really easy to sign up to create an app
a mobile app in Wham's and for employees
you can do the whole thing for free
anyway so you go into Wham's and you
create yourself a mobile app and i've
already had one for code show but to
write this i basically just went in and
said I want to enable push notifications
I created a table and I just set it up
so that it's really simple really simple
push and in just a second I'm going to
see a toast pop up on the screen what's
actually happened in that time between
when I push push and when that came down
is I wrote a record into Wham's into a
table and the script in whim said hey a
record was added in this table and it's
configured I wrote the script to pick up
that record and and call the push API
and push that to the the person that is
using this app in this device
specifically okay so it know it i've
given it it's called a channel uri so
that knows me and this device uniquely
and so it knows exactly where to deliver
that notification okay so it's possible
from your app to just do a toast
notification but I didn't cheat and do
it that way it actually is going to
Wham's and coming back and doing that
push okay so if you want to see the code
for that the HTML is obviously very
simple it's just an input and a button
that's it the CSS is non-existent and
the JavaScript looks like this I put my
whims context or client there's this
this is kind of the root of the SDK I
put it in my app very
once again so that you can glance at it
there and see and it's not so that you
can glance head so that you can use it
from anywhere in your app okay you can
always just do app client and you're
referring to that that whims instance so
I get the Wham's push notifications
table which i created in whims and then
i do an insert and i'm inserting the
channel uri the message that the user
typed in and whether or not that message
has been sent in the way i actually
structured this is every time you right
into it it enumerates the whole table
and picks up any that haven't been sent
yet and sends them so if there happened
to be more it would send them as well
yeah I've been looking at the
notification it seems
only send push
to yourself
it might not understanding something
yeah i think the common scenario is
something happens and you want to send a
portion education
users of your app that are related to
you somehow so let's say you have a chat
or you're playing a turn-based game yeah
so is that something that's not so the
question is can the notifications only
be sent to the to yourself or can they
be sent to the right person the answer
is they can be sent to the right person
it depends on the channel URI that might
be where you're getting hung up the
channel as soon as I've got a a post
online that should make this clear it's
called anatomy of a push so if you go to
code foster calm / anatomy of push it'll
take you to this blog post and what's
happening is the green is you you wrote
an app on windows 8 and you wrote a web
service if you're using Wham's this is
easier you didn't have to worry about
this but your app when you start up your
app you do a call to windows and you say
give me a channel and it says okay I'm a
device and I'm a user I know this and it
goes to wns and it gets a channel and it
gives you back that channel now you're
responsible for storing that channel so
in the wam scenario that's why you saw
when i created a record in the table i
create the channel URL as well and if
you need to you can store that channel
URL it doesn't expire for 30 days you
can store that channel URL with user
information so as soon as the user
launches the app now you know what the
channel is for that user you've got it
stored so for instance you could store
it in a user's table here's their
Channel and every time they open the app
you could refresh it just to make sure
that you don't expire within 30 days
yeah you know outside of 30 days and
then when something happens like another
table gets written to that this person
has a message waiting for them you can
go to the users table find their channel
URL and send send a push notification to
that channel URL Cap'n's server sir
so within Wham's you determine that this
other thing happened that you need to
send the push so yeah one user can't
send a push to another user the way I've
does that point maybe that's where the
confusion comes in so you're writing the
script on the website yeah you're out so
if i have like let's say a different
database that i keep track of you don't
my logic can I get off into that
database and figure out which users to
send a information if your database is a
completely external system then you're
going to have to kind of have like whims
is going to be able to do raw requests
it's basically written on node and so
you can pull in requires into the wam
scripts and if you have a way of
communicating with your database that
way then yes you can do that otherwise
you can communicate with ross equal
calls to the database that you've got
sitting underneath Wham's and then what
were you going to add just going to say
take off the bounce light off the server
that can do push you give it a and i
push it effectively you have you are and
you say i want to submit up this URL
back that's how a channel and push the
working works so you can win that you
can build s endpoints have your ddn it
depends the lower different machine but
when something happens you can just call
your website point and say i once and i
want to do this action and at that point
of time either like whatever food you
want you can ask to push notification
you can ask you to update or equal to
whatever the mission right now the first
iteration of Wham's was able to do a
push only triggered off of a crud
operation on the database then they put
in another iteration of whims where you
can have scheduled operations and if you
have a free tier mobile services you
only get one operation that you can
write but if you go up to shared then
you can write more and these operations
you can schedule them to run every 15
minutes or every 24 hours or something
or you can make it so that you manually
trigger that operation so now you can
trigger an operation for some other
reasons so if you wanted to you could
have a database of users with their
channels that are getting updated every
time they use their app and then every
24 hours you could look through that
table and say is this user expecting to
see something or expecting something to
happen then go ahead and using the Chan
you are i stored in the users table go
ahead and do a push to them and now
you've got it happening on a schedule
this is kind of some thinking to get my
hands up and on it even though that
supports on liquor operations that you
can like particular task you need to do
any good operation intransigent you can
just say cannot respond yeah and just
like whatever logic you want you having
to say okay to eat anything in other
words you can trigger a Wham's operation
by writing into a table but then not
even actually completing the right
because once you override that script
that the insert method you see inside
the method the actual execution of the
insertion of the record and you can just
kill it yeah it's not even feeling it it
like just say instead of writing or just
say I swallowed a small by the way I
don't know what the next step yeah s
feels like a hack to hey that's right I
don't make it a set us up oh yeah yeah
but the end of the day works it's not a
hack right the the push notification the
communication system in this anatomy of
a push I talk about what the message is
actually look like the HTTP message is
going back and forth but then Wham's
makes it so that you know really you
have to deal with that so that it's
pretty nice in that case would it be
helpful to see that what anybody else
like to see the like my mobile service
online okay let's go ahead and look at
that
as yours one of those things I'm
incredibly excited about I love going to
my dashboard and Azure and seeing all of
the you'll see all the stuff I've got
going on I mean media services and
mobile services and websites i recently
moved my my whole blog over to an azure
website and have been really thrilled
with it ok so this shows you everything
it's not a helpful view in my opinion
but i'll go into mobile services and you
can see that I've got a few one of them
it's called coach oh that's obviously
the one that's sitting behind code show
and when I go to the the dashboard for
it it shows me you know here's how this
is being used as code show is operating
it's communicating with this and
actually probably as I as I show this
we're going to see a few of these hits
for the push notifications but if I go
into data I'll see this Wham's push
notifications table and then if I go
into that table specifically I can see
the script for that table and this is
where this is where that that one is
being done actually I should have stayed
on browse long enough for you to see the
structure of that table this uses I love
the way they did this so it's sitting on
top of sequel server or its sequel asier
sequel databases and so you have a full
sequel database but it's wrapped in a
kind of a nice modern UI and not just
the UI here but it's wrapped in a no
sequel implementation so it's really
easy to read write and everything and it
even feels like no sequel in that you
can just shove whatever you want into it
but it's actually dynamically creating
those columns for you we call it dynamic
scheming ization if I were to send it an
object remember I was sending it an
object that had channel message and sent
the ID is always just done for you if i
were to now send in an object that had
one more column it would actually go
alter my table in my sequel azure
instance alter my table and add a column
to that table and I'd have a number of
records that didn't have a value because
they I made them beforehand and then I'd
have a column that
that have values in it all of a sudden
so here's my channel URI some of these
might be expired now maybe I did in more
than 30 days ago so some of those might
be expired and then here's the message
that the user wrote and then those are
all true right now but all I do to
trigger a push is insert into this table
with this as false and then how does
that trigger happen that's in the script
in the script for this specific table I
have an insert trigger and this is I
forgot your name Sanjeev was talking
about this request dot lore here i'm
doing a request respond but here's the
request dot execute when you first get
here that's all gone and it just looks
like a request dot execute that's the
actual insert statement but what I'm
doing is I'm saying go ahead and do the
insert and then when you succeed at the
insert do this so I go get that table I
loop the whole table and find all of the
ones where sent is false and I do this
to them and this is doing the actual
push so here's the actual push push wns
sentosa text by the way if you're if
you're wanting to talk to an iphone it's
just push dot is it 8ns or AWS or
something like that if there's a there's
another object there for communicating
with the Apple push notification server
and the same with any other push
notification servers that we support
hope that's helpful
in zamel you guys know what grids are
right you've been using them forever
just the grid not a grid view the
windows 8 list of items but a grid well
we got grid in HTML now so we can you
know we can kind of play on the same
turf here the grid is just like the grid
in zamel the grid allows you to define
rows and columns and then it allows you
to place the elements in there including
roast fans if you want you can use it to
create fancy layouts and stuff in HTML
and JavaScript and here's a fancy one
that's just like a huge grid that I
obviously generate automatically in a
nested loop but we've got grids in HTML
and that's significant we've also got a
thing called a flex box and I think this
is roughly equivalent to your stackpanel
except that it also can wrap I don't
know if a stackpanel can wrap it handles
its own I think in sam'l in Windows 8
don't you have to put things in a
scrollviewer if you want to be able to
let them run off the screen and scroll
the flex the flexbox handles that
automatically in javascript so that's
pretty nice you just you just you don't
even specify anything as far as width if
your items push it to five thousand
pixels wide it'll just excuse me in an
ineligible just work naturally with
touch so there's a quick flexbox there's
one where I've told the children to
distribute themselves one where I've
told the children to stretch a little
bit you know like allow them to flex and
it here's a wrapping one and a vertical
one and then here's a this is kind of
like an implementation of flip view but
this is just a simple flexbox and
actually this is the same type of
technology that I'm using to do this
swiping it's really it's really simple i
basically notice that i have this one
peeking onto the screen i did that by
saying i have a flex box and if it is
has the class of Swiper then I have some
CSS that applies to it and one of those
is that every panel should be eighty
percent the width of the screen that
means that the last twenty
scent is going to allow the next panel
to peak onto the screen so now I could
just do this well if this was a touch
projector screen wouldn't that be great
and I love the way it handles touch in
here notice when I touch inside I need
to turn on my touch points does
everybody know how to do that if you go
to settings and type touch there's this
change multi-touch gesture settings and
then allows you to optimize visual
feedback for projection to an external
monitor that's pretty slick now when you
want to show off how something works you
get a little touch point there how many
people knew that I love bringing new
things that's FS excellent ok so when I
touch inside here well first of all
watch this it knows that I'm I can go
vertical in that by the way that's not
good you I not good you I don't listen
to what I say no what I do if I swipe to
the left it knows that I'm inside that
control so it swipes to the left but if
I grab it and it doesn't have anywhere
to go then it passes that gesture up one
and now it's swiping the control above
it yeah no really I have this issue if
you have any element that's goes
vertically right and you want to add
horizontal scrolling to it too yeah like
how does the control figure out which
direction are you intending I mean
basically when you do this way like
either is taking it at a saying it
actually move more horizontally and
vertically so let's make it a harder to
scroll that's just into it automatically
or have you done that logic in your code
I don't have any logic in my code
whatsoever it actually reads your mind
there's a different signature for i'm
about to scroll up and down and it reads
that brain pattern and that's how it
sets it no it actually exactly like you
said it looks at the Delta like the
first movement that you make and now
you're locked in rails so now notice I'm
going side to side and it's not allowing
it's not scrolling side to side at all
it's an advantage of the same thing Lake
no time to school to put a list view on
a ball on a page and you have our little
flirt alert that just wouldn't look when
you get the list you if you hit a list
view in the very first thing that you do
is grow directly horizontal it will work
it should work is almost impossible I
mean you're not a mouse cursor that you
can do perfect one pixel is good well I
don't have any I don't have too much
trouble with it here like there I'm
going vertical and there I'm going
horizontal and and I get that right most
of the time I mean I still goof it up
sometimes I want to go vertical and I go
sideways a little bit and I'm like I
won't go vertical oh I got to let go and
I've got to grab it again but I feel
like it does a pretty good job of
discerning like a benefit miscues yeah
they're just a little it's interesting
the way the if you go to Internet
Explorer and you look at any page that
pans so I'll go to something like msdn
because it's usually got lots of data on
it so it's got some well this doesn't
have any horizontal though so it the way
that Internet Explorer works is it looks
at your very first movement and if your
very first movement is in the
up-and-down direction then it puts you
on Rails in other words it's only going
to scroll up and down if your first
movement is Ho is diagonal which can you
may think of a web page that has
horizontal whip you know like whiter
than one screen and taller msn
no same thing what yeah click on the
headline right oh no what I mean is that
the web page itself is wider than my
screen and taller than my screen devices
can you zoom and then make it oh that's
a good idea i can zoom brilliant give
the man a start ok so now I might want
to go side to side and I might want to
go up and down and what it does is when
I first start going up and down if it
was straight up that I went now i'm on
rails I can't go side to side at all and
I like this because let's say I'm let's
say I'm reading an article and I've kind
of got it lined up on the left and now I
just want to read the article I just
want to go up and down I don't want to
accidentally get this side to side I
don't want that much freedom but if I if
the my first gesture is diagonal now
it's it's wide open from that the rest
of that touch point is wide open okay if
my first gesture is horizontal I'm on
Rails I can't I can't even go up and
down but if my first gesture is diagonal
I'm wide open so I got into the habit of
starting a gesture diagonally if I want
to look around a little ooh look around
a little bit so you might want to get
into that habit so I didn't have to do
anything special to make this work I
basically just have that same Swiper
control it's not even a control it's
just a class with some CSS I have it on
the inside and the outside it's and
there's actually a CSS property i think
it's an MS prefixed property to override
this control so that it doesn't pass
that touch up to the parent it's in CSS
yeah yeah it does seem strange so here
I'm able to swipe this to the left but
once I got all the way to the left now a
swipe in this still inside of their
Scrolls the whole thing same things
visible if you go look at the list view
demo list views so these are list views
right and they have stuff inside of them
and I can swipe on the inside but even
in the same gesture watch this I'm
swiping I'm swiping I'm swiping I get to
the end and the whole thing starts
painting that's pretty slick I think
they think they did an excellent job
with that so in in zamel you have a
gridview and a list view right a
gridview looks like this and as list
view looks like this in HTML Javascript
we don't have both all we have is a list
view
and we tell the ListView to be a grid
layout or a list layout okay so we just
have one control same same concept but
we just have the one control so this is
a list view in grid layout it's the
equivalent of as amell's grid view okay
this is just a simple one so it's just
bringing in some data here's bringing in
some data that's grouped and so the the
code behind this is really super super
simple so that you can see exactly how
to bring in grouped data and then here's
how to do an asymmetrical grid has
anybody done this evenin zamel done an
asymmetrical grid they're really not
that you've done that they're really not
that difficult what you what you want to
do is figure out what your atomic size
item size is and in this case it's this
one I don't remember what the size of
this is this one is four of these this
one is too tall and this one is too wide
right and so when I bring this data in I
can conditionally say I want this one to
be a class a CSS class that indicates
that it's going to take up four spaces
two spaces two spaces but they're still
brought in in order so the order of
these is like one two three four five
six seven eight nine ten can everybody
see that it's like this one it goes here
here here and then here it happens to
take up to vertical and then it moves to
this one no I'm sorry then it moves to
this one and then here here here which
takes up two spaces so then here here
now I would really run into trouble if I
was expecting to be able to put
something here in fact if I sometimes
you have to add some logic to here to
make sure that you don't end up with
gaps so in other words if i were to if
my third item was too tall like this one
then it wouldn't be able to land here
there's not enough room for it so it
would jump up there and I would be left
with a hole here so if you want to do an
asynchronous grid you may have to do a
little bit of logic to make sure that
that it fits together like a puzzle and
you don't end up with any gaps I imagine
somebody's may be written
some logic and wrapped it in a control
or something by now but maybe not and
then again I don't know if you guys have
done this in c-sharp but I figured out
how in JavaScript to capture not that I
figured out like it was rocket science
it wasn't all that difficult but to
capture the the loading event and or the
loading state changed event and figure
out when the the loading state of this
guy changes and each time it does I can
ask it what's the current loading state
so I can figure out that it's the
viewport has been loaded so the the
basics have been set up the items have
been loaded so all of those items are
done and now the whole thing is complete
and this was really important for me
because there were some things that like
anytime I wanted to go kind of
dynamically inject things into the items
or ask go query the items I wanted to
not do that until the ListView had been
completed and if I tried to do it
beforehand it there weren't any items
hadn't been built yet and so this was
really important also if you if you go
back in code show it takes you to the
scroll position that you had okay at
first didn't do that I don't know if it
annoyed anybody else but it sure annoyed
me I would go into a demo and then hit
back and I would be all the way back at
the beginning again and just drove me
nuts so I was storing that scroll
position and then I was trying to
reintroduce the scroll position but it
wasn't working and it's because the
items hadn't been loaded yet so I wait
until the list view is loaded actually I
don't wait until it's loaded entirely I
wait until the viewport has been loaded
and it turns out that works and then I
add that scroll position and it takes me
to that scroll position and it is
seamless like when I did it and I waited
for it to load I would go to one and I
would go back and it would like go to
the beginning and then flash to the end
and I that wasn't acceptable so now I've
got it so that it's seamless so that was
that was nice I mean I had the same
problem my ass but
three days trying to get furious yeah
yeah that wasn't that was maybe too hard
yeah
anybody use player framework this was
really easy to add in it's just
basically an example from where i got
player framework it's a believe it's on
codeplex to codeplex project but it's a
wrapper for media that that makes it so
that I it's got really good fail case
scenarios where if they have this then
use it if not the use this if not then
use this so it kind of wraps your media
and makes it nice and safe so that
you're guaranteed that your media is
always going to play that you're never
going to be left in front of a crowd
with a black screen that's what it's
there for who knows template items is
kind of a fun one template items you let
me open that again actually I've just
got to click here to reload at the top
when I reload this you can see that
everything kind of comes in on an
animation and we get these animations
for free so we kind of take them for
granted sometimes but it's really cool
that we've got a whole animation library
in both saml and in an HTML that we can
capture and on this one I can click on
any of these and they disappear and it
uses the that's not good it uses the
remove from list animation pulls that
item out of the list and then you see
the rest of the stuff collapse and as
those animations end up being super
super helpful I mean if something just
disappeared and everything else took its
right place instantly you wouldn't
really notice what happened but when you
touch something and it removes it and
everything else repositions it looks
more like reality so that's really
helpful we always say make sure that
your animations have a purpose you're
not just using them superfluously to add
some movement you know you want to make
sure that there's a reason for a page
turn kinda shows movin on movin on movin
on remove from list shows I took it out
everything else split into its place so
snap points snap points make sure that
as you scroll you land not in between
two items but you always land
snap point and it will take you there
there isn't one that I don't remember
what the equivalent to his Amal is
anybody it's called snap one yeah it
might be a property might be a property
this one's done in CSS yeah okay let's
actually look at the CSS for that one
because I'm forgetting what what it was
so here's the CSS snap points that's a
ms prefixed I like the way ms has
implemented all of their CSS it's all
are actually their javascript and HTML
as well it's all based on the standards
but where it's something Microsoft
proprietary anyway like snap points in
you know in apps then we use the vendor
prefix but if this concept ever gets
successfully through the w3c process and
becomes an RC then the prefix would fall
off and that's that's a good deal so
we're saying these are mandatory meaning
it has to land on a snap make sure it
gets to one not only if it's close
enough so it's either mandatory or
proximity and then you have to give it
the interval I kind of wish that I was
able to put the snap points
declaratively in my HTML or inject them
logically with my JavaScript and say
there's a snap point oh and then there's
one but i can't i have to be at
intervals they can be at percentage
intervals or at absolute intervals but
you have to set them at intervals okay
somebody else pick one
CSS animation colleague of mine made
that one so i might not know everything
about it what supporters of that
animation ok so don't click me makes me
angry just makes me want to click it so
you touch it and it runs through some
animations just the changing of
properties on that guy and then it
resets so if you see the code on that
you're going to see in the CSS where all
the magic happens here's an actual
animation with keyframes it's the
equivalent of a storyboard in I believe
it's the equivalent of the storyboarding
zamel where you get to say these points
these are the property sets that should
apply and and then obviously it's going
to run through that so this set of
keyframes is defined as get angry and
then this property or this whatever the
element is has this class and we're
applying the get angry animation for
five seconds and that's the way we do it
in CSS yeah yeah storyboards end up with
a lot of you I write a lot of lot of
angle brackets yeah but I hope right
step using pen and
oh yeah yeah when I would suspect doing
here the very painful 105 all of the
ocean yeah right right luckily we've got
blind huh
the netflix examples show there's three
netflix examples and if you do they're
just netflix data it's the most basic
and i believe it waits until all of the
data has been loaded and then BAM you
see it all load at once and there's
something goofy with that with it with
the display I think wonder if that will
fix it or left yeah it's overlap see
there it's right I don't know why it
didn't work the first time it loaded it
and seen that before but so this one is
making sure that everything is loaded
and then BAM it's showing you all the
data and then the netflix by 10 actually
so the netflix data was bringing in a
random and i think it's like a thousand
different movies or something and so the
letters like I and K there's not even a
J in there there only had one movie and
there were no J's so the netflix by 10
goes through the letters of the alphabet
and says for each letter of the alphabet
do a different call and get 10 movies
that begin with that letter so it's just
a kind of a different way to call it so
Netflix by 10 will end up with a bunch
of netflix movies coming down from the
API but there's always 10 / movie okay
and then the netflix trickle is a way to
use promises intelligently to do the
call but bring them in and show them
even before like if I I can beat it in
speed C so some of them have come in and
some of them haven't yet it actually
shows them as soon as that request comes
back so essentially it's a list view
that's based on a set of data that's
empty at first and then I do 26
different calls right 26 different
letters of the alphabet so do 26
different calls and if J comes back
first put the J letters in there and
they'll show up and then a comes back
next so put the a movies in there and
then they'll show up so that's a way to
bring them in on a parallel in a
parallel format
it was good a good battle they do make
up the stack will let you piss tackling
I think they will not go out in more
than eight at a time yeah the HTTP stack
on your computer is there's going to
have limitations if you try to send out
26 it's not like you get all that much
advantage anyway and so I think that
it's aight currently in IE and i think
it would use that same number for
JavaScript apps in in Windows 8 but I
can't be sure of that now that you bring
it up makes me really want to go look
that up I know I remember it used to be
to anybody remember run into that in in
IE like six or five or something and so
you go into the registry and turn it up
to four or a two metal sudden you get
download more things at once those were
the days anyway I'm in them what system
connections like little components yeah
so this system living all day yeah all
right anymore that we want to see and
then we'll will end here in five minutes
or so oh you know the promises one I
think is really helpful the promise is
when I tried to start by showing you the
concept of what a promise is and then by
showing you four different ways to do
promises and then showing you some good
syntax for chaining promises so if you
look at the concept so watch this when I
hit start it'll freeze my UI every one
of these tasks takes three seconds by
the way it'll freeze my UI for three
seconds which is not a good experience
so BAM my start button is even frozen I
wouldn't be able to hit back I wouldn't
be able to do anything and then it
finally completes so that's not a good
experience because I'm freezing my UI
the next one is kicking off a three
second task asynchronously and as soon
as it's done kicking off that task it's
completing that progress bar so that
one's not a good experience because it's
a lie it's telling you I just finished
it didn't actually finish it just kicked
it off right it just kicked off an
asynchronous task but it didn't wait
until the end so what we want to do is
we want to kick off a sink but then we
want to wait until it's done and then do
something else and so that's why we use
a promise now we can not only say when
we get done but we can
we can get the event that fires whenever
progress occurs so now we can show
intermediary stage and now we're giving
the best experience to the user okay so
that's the reason for promises that's
the reason for a sink and in JavaScript
if you're just calling an async function
in the WinRT library like if you're
calling show a sink on the message
dialog or something you you do in a
weight right that's kind of the
assumption of the consumption of an
asynchronous method and that's what a
consuming a promise is your calling an
asynchronous method consuming it and you
do a dot then so the code behind this
one all of these just work the same but
the code behind that first one just does
a dot then to not complete that progress
bar until the three seconds is up now
this one is passing on a promise this is
the equivalent of writing your own a
sinc function which calls an async
function and then returns whenever that
one is done so you're awaiting something
and then somebody's awaiting you write
equivalent creating a promise is the
equivalent of creating your own async
async function doing whatever you want
in it and only returning at a certain
time and then storing a promise is the
equivalent of saving a task of type
whatever and then referring to that task
later on in your app I found a number of
cases where I want to do this like I
showed in code show go do something and
store the promise that comes back
immediately right here and then it
various places in the app I'm going to
go ask that promise are you done did you
finish and if it fit finished a long
time ago it'll just happen right away so
that's great i'll just go if that is
done if that promise has been fulfilled
then go ahead and do this how do you do
that in c-sharp do task like is complete
or a weight task you still just await it
you go do
wait when you finally won one okay
awesome you are the pew of a lot of
fancy things in the past life but I
think that our problem task and
different ways of executing them so no
there's not something necessarily like
the TPL but we do have parallel ism but
you have to spin off different web
workers they're called and it's it's a
it's a web standard and you can use
these web workers but it's not
integrated with the promise pattern
necessarily so I'm sure there's a good
pattern to utilize it well where you can
inside of your promises you can launch a
different web worker and then you're
kind of doing roughly the same thing but
I've used the TPL a lot and it just kind
of merges the two concepts and makes it
nice and easy for you it's not quite
that nice in my experience there my end
unless there's something that I'm I'm
missing but it's not quite that nice you
can join a bunch of promises together so
I've got 26 different promises out there
and I can join them meaning wait until
all 26 have completed and then do
something you can really easily wrap
anything you want in a promise so if
you're returning a value and who you're
returning it to is expecting a promise
you can just do when JSL promised as and
then pass your string and it'll pass it
as a promise with a string in it so
there's a number of things that help you
with promises and then the chaining is
just some of these three second events
happening one right after another so
this one's not so helpful unless you see
the code but it shows you the right way
in the wrong way to do your chaining so
in in c-sharp you kind of have to do it
right oh wait this oh wait this oh wait
this oh wait this right in JavaScript we
actually have a little function thing so
if you look in the wrong way to do it in
my comment here you start ending up with
the Christmas tree pattern if your
nesting inside of your then your nesting
another another promise and another one
and another one and another one pretty
soon your way deep this is the better
way to do that its cool the way it works
because inside of a then function
whatever you return
even if it's not a promise we'll get
wrapped with a promise and it's kind of
passed on not passed on but the next dot
then that you have is is tacked on to it
and so with this one's always receiving
a promise so you could return a string
and then in this next then you could
capture that string as a parameter and
return integer and then capture that
integer as a parameter and we use it
then then done pattern then then done
that means that we always use then until
the last one and that one isn't done
because it it has a special way of
handling exceptions it makes sure that
you haven't let any exceptions just get
swallowed okay I'll bring it back to the
main screen here and if there's any more
that you guys want to see let me know
otherwise we can just kind of turn
social and so the cryptography and
encryption this one I'm not very proud
of it basically it doesn't help you too
much unless you go back and see the code
and I had to show this in a in a
presentation and so I had to have
something in here but all it really does
is run some of the same things that you
see in the sample on msdn so I would
just go look at the samples on msdn
they're a lot better than this one it'll
it'll do us a couple of simple things
like you can create a sha this this kind
of whatever but you have a basic super
encoding and decoding right if you are
wanted to say we can wash the image when
you call cameras or to data URL converts
it to a base64 string and then you can
use the base
in order to image and save John Wooden
country is a game and you want to save
the current state and you can do that
and is that the only way to save an
image from campus then I spent a month
don't do that that's all I do wow that's
really cool though you can talk to Drita
URL and that converts English do this
image thing with a the sources said to
the entire basis yeah right right let me
take a look at it it's a PhD strange so
that's the same that's the same thing as
if I do like to URL create object URL to
source an imp to take an image turn it
into a base64 string and set it as the
source of an image right that's really
cool that one is used in the media
capture demo sure demo you the first one
is image the second one is video and the
third one is audio and for the image you
capture and it launches the camera
capture you I so there I am and I touch
it and then I can crop it if I want and
I'll get it rough that's a terrible
picture I'll get it roughly right and
then I'll hit OK and I didn't get it
roughly right but now it has converted
that to a blob to a base64 string and
set that as the source of this so I
didn't actually save an image on disk
and then set it as the source of the
image tag as a instead i actually
created an object URL and did it that
way one little whore sentencing across
the job i have a focus on that
21 send a guy with those of the code for
sheer jump to figure that out okay you
just want to share the image i have a
blog post yes will you email to me sure
great excellent because i have an app
that i'd love to use that in actually I
forget exactly how I'm doing it when you
can see me and then share but that's it
yeah yeah agreed agreed that's right
helpful yes I just wanted to make the
announcement that our AKA done and this
meet my apps form is now live so go sign
up now if you want to present as in two
weeks from today and we'll just
basically take those first come first
serve yeah it'll be first come first
serve we might select more than one of
the other telling people sign up yeah
but we'll try to keep it at a minimum at
a maximum probably two or three per per
week yeah I'd say two so that we can
spend you know five to ten minutes on
one more exciting platform to talk about
your ad yeah anybody know that they're
gonna go sign up for one can you raise
your hand if you're gonna go sign up and
show something awesome good we'll have a
few then that's good
fly outs are one of those areas that are
easier in HTML Javascript than they are
in zamel the fly out you can pass an
anchor and that's where the fly out
appears and in zamel you can't easily
make a flyout appear in a certain spot I
guess in the Calypso package there's a
fix for that but it's really easy for us
to hit fly out and hat and say that
button is the anchor for my fly out and
I want to show up on the right side of
it so boom nip that brings that up
anyway that's it let's go ahead and fold
huh so feel free to stick around I'm
going to be around for a few minutes
feel free to help us finish off those
sandwiches or take a couple home and the
next meetup is not entirely confirmed
but it's two weeks away so you'll get an
invite hopefully sooner than you did on
this one I think I just sent out the
invite four days ago so sorry about that
but the next one is supposed to be on
SkyDrive and live integration so cool
thank Oh question or just a reminder um
if you guys know anybody employees
vendors um interns that would be
interested in
joining us go ahead and forward them are
meeting invite encourage them to sign up
for the FX best ftk alias journey
included in his in his nature between
but i try to remind you guys help us get
the word out the more people we have
coming to these the more we can spend on
tasty treats and and prizes for our
hackathon the wind up feelings I just
want to make sure to remind everybody to
help us get the word out if you guys
think these are cool vistaca i'm likely
going to send a poster soon and ask you
if you'll put post it in your building
on a common billboard or something so we
can get the word out to more people so
cool thanks for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
