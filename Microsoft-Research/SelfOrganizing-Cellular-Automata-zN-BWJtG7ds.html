you
all right so very happy to have and the
whole world tell us about
self-organizing cellular automata okay
thank you for coming everyone
so I'll try to tell you some of what
I've been getting up to with yangko
Grovner who's UC Davis and who was
visiting here last month so I don't
usually do this but I'm going to start
with quite a lot of background
motivation showing you pictures some
might call it waffle before I get before
I get down to things but rest assured
there will be some theorems coming and
the reason they do this is because it's
the motivation for what we're doing is
maybe not completely obvious to begin
with so that's what I'll try to show you
so and let's talk about cellular
automata so this is a subject for the
quite a long history so certainly von
Neumann and Coulomb considered cellular
automata and perhaps the most famous
example is Conway's Game of Life which
probably those people have heard of
already but in case you haven't you work
on the square lattice z2 and elements of
z2 are called cells and each cell is
either alive or dead has two states one
and zero and so you have some
configuration of alive and dead cells
and then there's an update rule which in
this case is a dead cell becomes alive
if it has at least if it's sorry if it
has exactly three living neighbors and
neighbors here refers to the eight of
the cells at L infinity distance one
from it more neighborhood or and if a
cell is already alive then it stays
alive if and only if it has two or three
living neighbors otherwise it dies and
you update everything simultaneously in
discrete time so you update every cell
according to these rules you get a new
configuration
and so on so okay I think so yeah so
here's a very famous example of Conway's
life you start with these cells alive
and you apply the update rule so each
cell sees how many living neighbors it
has and the second step you have this
this this is called a glider so this
shape just moves diagonally and there's
a huge amount of work that people have
done in setting up very special
configurations in Conrad's life and
other cellular automata to do specific
things so for example this is a
configuration that computes twin primes
it's a very very complicated thing and
it does all sorts of complicated stuff
and after a while there'll be some
output stream coming out here and the
locations of these gliders represent the
locations of all twin primes not
infinitely many or not and thanks to an
extraordinary algorithm called hash life
it's possible to run these things at
extraordinary speed so this is already
getting to millions of iterations
and yeah so that was the initial
configuration here is I changed one cell
I changed the state of one cell in the
initial configuration and what happens
if you learn that well so it starts off
looking good but then after a while you
realize something is wrong and well I've
no idea what it's doing but it's
certainly not computing trend times and
probably the best description of this is
chaos although very difficult No
so yeah so somehow the point is you know
a lot is known about what you can do if
you start from a very very specific
situation and much less is known about
typical initial configurations for
example what happens if you take a
uniformly random initial configuration
on z2 and run life I don't think anyone
has any idea what the answer to that
question is I might come back to that
later so if it turns out a lot of the
surprising and interesting things that
cell the automata can do can already be
seen in one dimensional model so that's
what we're focused on so one dimensional
cellular automaton rules with a
quiescent state zero so that just means
there's some state so that if all cells
are in state zero then the next time
they're all in state zero as well and
I'm particularly interested in what
happens if you start from a seed which
is an initial configuration with only
finitely many non-zeroes
and especially what I'm really aiming
for is what happens with typical a
random seeds so okay let's look at some
examples so so some cellular automaton
rules it turns out are completely
predictable in
register on the sensitometer so-called
one or three rule so remember it's in
one dimension so lambda TX will denote
the state of cell x at time T and if you
want to know the state of exit T plus
one and it depends on three things it
depends on itself and its left and right
neighbors at the previous time step and
it's simply the states of 0 and 1 and
it's it's 1 if the number of if the sum
of these is 1 or 3 otherwise it's zero
and got some another way of saying that
is it's just the sum of these things
these these things modulo two okay so we
normally draw these things with time
going down the page so the world if you
have one or three of these three guys
black family and the one below is black
so okay here's a picture of what that
does starting from a single one at the
top so does everyone understand the
picture so so time is going downwards
and the universe is one dimension also
we started off this time with a single
black dot and then this time two times
the cetera now this picture it turns out
it's completely understandable in a
certain sense so it has a fractal
structure and a self-similar structure
and it's it's possible to write down a
recursive description of it where this
section here is composed of smaller
sections that you've seen earlier on and
so on so no mystery about this really
what happens if you start from a
different seed so here was a random seed
of length 12 or something like that well
essentially the picture is very similar
so you still have this fractal shape but
it's thickened a little bit and also the
the configurations in the thickened part
are predictable it turns out to all
these little configurations here are the
same
and similarly everywhere you see it so
again this is completely predictable
it's something we call replication and
I'll come back to define things like
this more carefully later but
essentially every seed gives a similar
picture for this particular rule and
there's a very simple reason for it in
this case because this rule is additive
so remember it was the state of a cell
is the sum of the three above it modulo
two and as a consequence of this very
easy to prove it if you want to know
what happens for any initial seed for
example the seed consisting of these
three sites here being one all you have
to do is draw the triangles that the
fractal triangles that you get starting
from a single one from those three
places superimpose them and then add the
modulo two and that gives you the answer
so everything here is so on the other
hand here's a rule that can behaves
completely differently this is rule 30
this is Wolfram's numbering system for
elementary one dimensional rules details
don't really matter I mean if you see
exactly one one then you become one and
if you see this you become one so here's
what happens from a single seed so so a
single one so you might say the best
description for what's going on here is
chaos although I know it's not quite as
simple as that because you can see
things a periodic along the left-hand
side and but certainly there's no simple
formula that anyone knows to predict
what happens and long way down and not
surprisingly if you start from some
other seed like this one then you still
get apparent chaos and even in one
dimension some of these rules are
sufficiently complex that people have
proved that they are chewing complete
capable of universal computation so in
particular will 110 which is another one
of these ones cook matthew cook proved
that it's two incomplete
previously conjectured by Wolfram
but once again this is you know the
theorem says you can produce a Turing
machine if you set things up exactly
right to begin with that's very
important there's nothing to do with
what happens for a typical initial
condition now in some ways the most
interesting types of rules are ones
which can exhibit different types of
behavior depending on how you start them
and this is such an example so called
exactly one rule it's simply you know
you look at the yourself and your two
neighbors left and right and if you see
exactly one one then you become a one
and here's what it does from a single
one looks kind of similar to the
previous picture isn't it nice fractal
here's what it does from another small
seed also we call the replication so
nice fact although it's a little bit
more complicated because of the
configuration here is not the same as
the one here but still know that this is
completely
analyzable on the other hand if you
start from certain other small seed like
this one you get apparent chaos in the
sense that it doesn't seem to be any way
to predict what happens in the middle
and also firms again same rule from some
specifically chosen seeds you can get
something else a periodic pattern and
space and time and you can even get
mixtures of several of these things so
here it's periodic in a non-trivial
wedge at the side but be chaotic in the
middle and rather amazingly some of
these sort of things can be proved so
gravan and griffith recently proved that
many of these behaviors for this
particular rule I just showed you
exactly one replication periodicity some
of these mixtures occur for infinitely
many initial seeds even an exponentially
growing family of seeds growing in
length but the conjecture here and this
is the point I want to get to the the
conjecture here would be that chaos is
the typical thing
in the sense that if you take if you
start from a uniformly random seed of
length L you know there's all to to the
L binary strings equally likely then
with high probability with probability
tending to one
you see chaos at least within some cone
or wedge and what does chaos mean well
yeah there's no universally accepted
definition in this subject for what
chaos ought to mean
but in here's one thing you could say
for example that that if you look at
local patterns strings of length 10 and
look at the densities of them then they
converge to something and if you look at
all possible lengths they converge to a
non-trivial probability measure and
which should have some sort of mixing
properties so what happens over here
should be asymptotically independent of
what happens over here so you can write
down more precise versions of this the
conjecture would be that something like
this typically happens and and by the
way nothing like this and nothing like
this is proved for any cellular
automaton that I know of even though
this sort of behavior seems very very
common and you might argue this isn't
quite strong enough because somehow
chaos implies it's not predictable as
well isn't there's no simple formula and
in any case even nothing like this is
proved okay so you might at least
imagine that something like this
situation is a universal law something
akin to the second law of thermodynamics
that if a if some cellular automaton
rule is capable of producing chaos
whatever that means
then chaos ought to be the norm in the
sense that for long random seeds
you should get chaos with high
probability
and it's you know it's easy to postulate
a mechanism for this where somehow chaos
can start from some local local
configuration and once it starts it
should
it should take over everything else
chaos should take over so you might
guess this is what always happened but
it's wrong so some cellular automata are
self-organizing in the sense that the
opposite thing holds and the first
evidence we know about for this is
another paper bag rather and Griffis so
they showed that for certain
one-dimensional rules some seeds give
you chaos and but apparently almost all
long seeds give you predictable behavior
but predictable in a non-trivial way and
what we our goal here is to give a
rigorous version of this phenomenon and
now I want to be careful because a lot
of the words on this slide you hear all
the time with elaborate claims sometimes
not with much substance behind them not
necessarily and I don't want to fall
into that same trap
so what we're proving is something very
specific about very specific models and
this is just motivation but they just
want to give you the idea that we're
motivated by some kind of deep questions
even if they're not necessarily
mathematical questions and so this is
where they're coming from and I should
also mention in a slightly similar vein
to this there's this famous or infamous
positive rate problem ahem so there's a
result by a very very difficult proof so
difficult that you know very few people
other than the author claim to
understand it but well
so Larry Gray has written written this
I don't so the claim is there there
exists a one dimensional cellular
automaton model so that if you run it
but with random noise so you take an
epsilon and at each step every
transition you have probability epsilon
of making an error and changing to a
random State and there exists a rule
which nonetheless has multiple
stationary distributions think of it as
like a plus phase and a minus phase so
in yes so for two dimensional models
it's well known that something like that
can happen for instance for the easting
model but in one dimension too but very
very difficult
okay so that's the side of it but it's
the same sort of thing that we're trying
to get okay can you can cellular
automata or other similar systems do
complex things even in the presence of
randomness okay so what we prove is and
I'll have to come back and define terms
here but what we prove is that for one
dimensional cellular automata in a
certain class started from a uniformly
random seed with probability going to 1
you have replication which I'll have to
define but you should think of it as
these fractal like pictures while some
seeds do not give you a replication they
probably do something more complex and
apparently chaos in some cancers
although we aren't able to prove chaos
ok so obviously for this to be a theorem
I have to tell you what each of these
three things means in the last
application ok so I'll give you one
simple example of a rule which out there
and applies to first of all it'll have
three states 0 1 or 2
and they'll 0 will be white 1 will be
black or gray 2 will be red and your
state at time T plus 1 is given by a
function of the 3 things above you
yourself and your two neighbors at the
previous time and function f of a you
see is if you see 1 or 3 ones in your
neighborhood then your 1 and otherwise
you look at a and C so you just look at
your left and right neighbor at the
previous time if exactly one of them is
a 2 then you become a 2 otherwise you
become a zipper so where you can think
of it is that the ones are performing
this 1 or 3 rule which was the nice
predictable one at the additive one and
the twos try to perform X or just on the
point not occupied by one so X or
meaning they look at their left and
right neighbors and
the exclusive all of them okay well so
here's an example of what it does
starting from a very simple seed this is
an apparently chaotic picture although
we can never prove that so the the gray
is the ones and they are just doing the
additive one or three rule so you can
think of them as being decided on to
begin with and then the twos the red
things are somehow seeping through but
here's what happens for a typical long
seed so this is a random seed of length
30 or something like that
totally different this is replication
basically you have this fractal picture
that we saw at the beginning except
thickened and a few Reds around the
edges and you can already see how we
might go about proving something like
this and here are some pictures where
you don't have replication you provably
have something else
yeah the this is an example of something
we called quasi replication I'll come
back to what that means there's some
non-trivial fractal configuration of
twos and here's another picture of quasi
replication so that this picture as well
can be completely analyzed this this
specific seed and one can completely say
what's going on here I'll come back to
that okay so what's the replication and
so first of all let lambda be the 1 or 3
the support of the 103 rule started from
a single one so it's this nice fact
whole triangle thing we saw before and
let lambda R be the set of all
space-time points within distance R of
that set
okay so just fatten the fractal by R and
we say the configuration is a replicator
of thickness R and ether eater where eta
is a doubly periodic configuration of
zeros and two
on z2 said space and time periodic if
every bounded component of the
complement of lambda R is filled with a
translate of the ether each oh so here's
the picture you have in mind you have
the black which is the nice spectral
triangle and you shrink away from it by
a distance R and you get these
triangular spaces and each of those is
filled with a doubly periodic picture
ether doubly periodic pattern eater
which we call the ether so in particular
for example this implies if you have
such a configuration that the the
density of the whole thing is just the
the density of eater because these these
white triangles occupy proportion one of
the area they have density one in the in
the forward light cone of the origin
because the black is just a factor so it
has a non-trivial factor dimension and
also if you have such a situation it
turns out it's if you have any
replicator it turns out it's possible to
describe the configuration everywhere
even close to lambda even within lambda
R and that's because in these regions in
between the white triangles those have
bounded width now with about our so
there's only finitely many
configurations that you can see in those
places and it turns out on the basis of
that you you can describe the whole
thing and this is well by grab no
Griffith and healthy so anyway the
takeaway message is that if you have a
replicator everything is predictable so
here are some pictures this this one we
already saw this is a replicator with
zero ether you have the gray factor and
you have the white triangles and and in
the white triangles you just have zeros
this is a picture of a replicator with
the different ether you have some the
conversion of the factor and each of
these voids is filled with this doubly
periodic picture this is for another
rule and that's how theorem applies to
and this is now for the same rule as the
previous picture that's a different
ether which you can get a different
doubly periodic configuration and that
would be a replicator with zero ether as
well because you're allowed to have
complicated things happening on the
fractal as long as these triangles
contain zeros in this case and according
to our definition this is something
which is not a replicator because we
claimed and again this this is another
rule that our theorem applies to but
this is an exceptional seed our
definition said you're only allowed to
have a single ether you have to see it
everywhere for the particular seed so ok
back to my theorem so here's what the
claim now says it says for certain
cellular automata if you take a
uniformly random seed of length L then
there exists a random number RL which
could be infinite and a random ether et
al so that you see a replicator with
thickness RL plus L and ether et al and
furthermore so ok if RL was infinity
then this statement is vacuous because
it says the distance that you pull away
from the fact all is infinity but the
probability that RL is infinity goes to
zipper and even RL is tight so so so the
distance that you move away from the
factory is basically just L plus the
plus something not very large and the
same holds even if we change some of the
zeros and the twos sorry the zeros two
twos in the initial configuration with
the same ether in the same
he said that and now I have to tell you
which things it applies to so think
about a configuration over the one or
three rule again this is the simple
additive rule and we'll define an empty
path is just a path of zeros in the
configuration that takes steps down or
down left or down right and an empty
diagonal path is a path of zeros where
you only take diagonal steps diagonally
to the left and right and don't worry
about this too much but we also define a
wide path is a is a path which is empty
but you can't move diagonally between
two ones like this okay so the
definition is we have three states which
we call zero one or two zero one and two
there's a packet missing here and we
have a range to rule which means you can
look at yourself or your two neighbors
or your two next nearest neighbors at
the previous time and the assumptions
are if you just look at once then they
obey the one or three rule if you if
you're blind to the difference between
zeros and twos then then the cellular
automaton obeys this simple one or three
will and the key thing is information
about the distinction between zeros and
twos can only pass along diagonal paths
so the ones you can think of them as
being there already because they just
come from this very simple rule that we
know about and then anything that's
white here could be either a zero or two
and how do you decide so if you want to
know whether this is a zero or two then
it's going to depend on stuff above it
but it's not allowed to depend on
whether that's a zero or two because
it's only allowed to look diagonally and
so here you whether this is a zero too
can depend on whether that's a zero or
two because that's a diagonal set and it
can also depend on the
that there is a a one above it and no
reason to prevent that hey but but
information can only further long
diagonal paths okay so yes in the
okay so I won't write down the formal
definition so okay our condition says
for one of these things that is either
compliant with diagonal paths or wide
paths we can do as well this is the
conclusion and that includes all the
pictures I showed you at the beginning
so what about this provably more complex
behavior so okay I'll be fairly brief
about this so we call a configuration a
quasi replicator if there's some
exceptional set of space-time points so
that each bounded component of its
complement is filled with an ether eater
and furthermore this exceptional set if
you scale it by a to the end by some
fixed number a which is normally two but
not always then it converges to
something of non-trivial hausdorff
dimension so it's really a fractal and
yeah so it turns out you can prove or
either
gravan or Griffith and Pelphrey can
prove that that certain specific seeds
are quasi replicators by inductive
scheme so it so here's a very simple
example of a quasi replicator so the
exceptional set is the gray and the red
together and you know you can you can
completely understand this picture
because you can say what happens here
and there's some inductive recursive
scheme you can prove it and it's not a
replicator on the other hand and there
are the more surprisingly examples like
this you can sometimes prove quasi
replicators as well and much less
obvious what's happening here from the
picture but it is completely predictable
that's a bigger picture of the previous
one and here's another example of a
replicator where the ether quasi
replicator where the ether is this
non-trivial periodic pattern but it has
these disturbances which and
which never nevertheless only live on a
a thing of non trivial fractal dimension
so they occupy zero density in the bulk
these disturbances and yeah so for
specific cases it's very it's often very
very hard to decide whether you have a
quasi replicator or chaos so since here
we think it's probably chaotic but no
way to tell for sure right so okay so
that's the last part of the theorem that
for many of these rules that the first
part applies to some cereal some seeds
are quasi replicators and also some are
apparently chaotic but of course we
can't prove that part ok so and we can
say some additional things as well so
you saw in this pink picture of the rule
that I called piggyback which I didn't
define for you and I'm not going to that
you can have different ethers different
periodic patterns in the triangles and
basically if you see some ether at all
if this if for some eater eater it's
possible for some seed that you get that
ether and this RL is finite then you see
it with positive limit as the length of
the seed goes to infinity and in fact we
can compute rigorous lower bounds on
probabilities of particular ethers so
and since for this will we know that at
least a hundred ethers have non-trivial
limits for long seeds and we believe
that there are infinitely many also we
can prove this is a slightly different
kind of result if you change if you take
a seed and you change zeros to twos some
zeros two twos in the initial seed then
I already said it doesn't affect the
ether or the R but in fact
it has no effect at all within some
region about log L from thee before
would like cone okay so what briefly
mentioned this so although perhaps the
the particular cellular automaton rules
that I'm looking at may seem a bit
contrived it turns out they are relevant
to other things people are interested in
so they have implications for certain
two-dimensional rules that people are
definitely interested in solidification
rules via something called extremal
boundary dynamics so I probably won't
have time to discuss that but and that
was part of our motivation so the key
tool is my other favorite topics
percolation and so we do percolation on
the space-time configuration of a
cellular automaton and it's this one or
three cellular automaton this
particularly nice one so here's a
theorem so if you take again the one or
three rule this additive so I'm going to
rule and you start it from a uniformly
random configuration on the whole of Z
so in other words you take fair coin
flips a zeros and ones on Z and you run
it then well diagonal paths do not
percolate in the sense that the
probability that that there is a
diagonal path from time zero so anywhere
along the top line to a particular point
at time T stands T down goes to zero
decays exponentially with T and the same
applies to wide paths as well which I
didn't talk about like so here's the
picture here and here's the the set of
points reachable from diagonal paths
reachable by diagonal path from this
interval that's for wide paths and on
the other hand
if you look at empty paths which were
the ones that can go down and a gal in
the two directions then they do
percolate so probability does should
have said yeah there's an infinity
missing here it should say the
probability there exists an empty
infinite empty path from the origin is
positive okay so how do we prove this
it's on the face of it potentially very
tricky because this is a highly
dependent percolation problem the we're
looking at the space-time configuration
of the evolution starting from a random
configuration and that's not iid in any
way it's highly dependent because
everything is a deterministic function
of what happens on the first line so
problems like this highly dependent
percolation problems in some cases are
very very tough indeed and so coordinate
percolation Winkler percolation are some
of the words and there are a number of
impressive results here particularly
mention this recent result on by
bathroom and sly which is on a model of
this kind but it turns out in this case
we're lucky it's not one of the cases
where it's fiendishly difficult to
analyze and there and there are some
other similarly well behaved to cases
that have been that have been found as
well including these and so the the key
idea is this so the the space-time
configuration is highly dependent but on
the other hand we can find certain sets
within it sets of space-time points
where we see independent randomness
so suppose worried about all the
notation so much let me just explain and
so suppose you start from an initial
configuration in which some
set is uniformly random so I'm set a not
necessarily the whole of Z and suppose
you are interested in some set of
space-time points down here well because
the rule itself is simply this additive
cellular automaton rule the
configuration that you see down here on
s is a linear function of the initial
configuration linear function modulo two
and what we want to do is basically find
cases where the matrix that tells you
what linear function it is is upper
triangular with ones on the diagonal
okay so if that's the case then the set
of sites you're looking at down here
will itself be uniformly random you if
you just look at that set of sites you
see iid coin flips fair coin flips so
and what that basically involves how do
you find out what the matrix is well it
basically comes down to just looking at
the configuration started from a single
one that's where all the information
lies and and and this you know this this
picture one can understand okay so
that's the idea so we sort of now tried
to find the right sort of percolation
arguments that will adapt to the setting
so here's the proof of no percolation
for diagonal paths so here's a diagonal
path of length T the number of such
paths is two to the T starting from the
origin and I claim for any given path
the probability that it's empty in other
words the probability that all the sites
in it are zeros is exactly at 2 to the
minus T as if it were everything iid
coin flips and the reason is a dual
assignment so for any given path yeah so
I guess I didn't really define what
these pink arrows are but but this is
basically how you find the upper
triangular matrix the idea is each step
you take there's a new random site in
the initial configuration that you get
to look at that you haven't seen before
if you're going to the right you have to
look that way when you're going to
do you have to look that way okay so
this is true now of course that doesn't
help because two to the T times 2 to the
minus T certainly isn't going to give me
exponential decay so I have to just
squeeze a little bit more out of it
because this is critical so there are
lots of ways you could try to do this
but Andrew you found one that actually
works so um so I claim if you take F
given diagonal path the probability that
it's a leftmost or the leftmost diagonal
empty path from the origin well you can
bound it by something a bit better so
the idea is if it's leftmost then
whenever it takes a right left step like
this then that site has to be a 1
because otherwise it wouldn't be the
leftmost path so there's some more
information if I know this path is
leftmost and well it turns out if I only
restrict my attention to these right
left steps at odd times then there is a
dual assignment for them so in other
words if I look at the whole set the
diagonal path and these black squares
that occur at odd times then that set is
uniformly random you see uniformly
random fair coin flips on it and the key
fact that you need remember you have to
go back to the configurations
starting from a single one and the key
fact is that down the second diagonal
you see alternating zeros and ones so so
it just it just works and so basically
this allows you to squeeze something
extra out of the argument and you get
exponential decay and yeah I won't just
show you the pictures but I won't say
anything so for wide path wide path
don't percolate and it's a superficially
similar argument but in the details very
different we just had to find another
construction that these dual assignments
work for and then proving that empty
paths do percolate
again uses a dual assignment but in a
different way and ok so then we won't so
now I want to deduce so what I just said
was starting from randomness on all of Z
so now I want to deduce percolation
properties for what happens from a
finite seat so you take a random seed on
a finite interval and on the face of it
again this seems more difficult still
because the space-time picture I get is
infinite and yet I only have a finite
number of bits of randomness to work
with but it turns out I mean this was
somehow the surprising thing here we
were just always able to prove exactly
what we needed and almost nothing more
and so and so here is a simple result
first of all if you start from a random
seed of length L then there's with high
probability
there's no empty path from anywhere in
the initial configuration in time 0 into
this forward light cone by more than
distance constant log L and how do we
prove this we now we really exploit the
long-range dependence so here's the
picture starting from a single one if
you look at a strip along the diagonal
strip of width K along the diagonal then
the picture that you see is periodic in
time and that has to be true for any
cellular automata and actually because
they're only 2 to the K possible
configurations you can see as you go
down but in this case it's periodic with
period or decay and that's because it's
this special additive cellular automata
and all these things things like this
properties of this picture easy
exercises to prove very easy exercise
so what that means is if you start from
a random seed and you have this additive
'ti property so this picture is simply a
bunch of those superposed on each other
random then again the this diagonal
strip has period same period as before
or decay order its width and furthermore
if you K is less than L basically each
row of it is uniformly random so each at
each time you see fair coin flips but of
course the toilet there's a lot of
correlation between different modes so
that basically enough because if there
was a path from up here to somewhere in
here then it would have to go through
this strip but for every you know each
of these is uniformly random so it's
unlikely that you can make your way
through it and down a bit and the
picture is periodic with period about K
so if you apply a Union bound then you
don't need to look at infinitely many
cases you only need to look at order K
cases so you have a constant K because
of the period and you have the
exponential decay so there's a small and
basically by the same sort of methods
where you can prove this more elaborate
application of the same ideas take the 1
or 3 rule started from a uniformly
random seed then with high probability
you have these triangular voids of zeros
above each one there's a strip which
blocks diagonal paths and by the way
everything I say for diagonal paths it's
true for white pants as well so
right so that there's a strip which
diagonal paths cannot get through into
the void below and furthermore all these
strips are spatially periodic periodic
in the horizontal direction and with the
same repeating pattern for all of them
and this is basically where the main
theorem comes from because if that's
true and you have one of these rules in
a class then within each of these voids
you don't you're not influenced by what
happens outside up here all you're
influenced by it is this strip and the
strip is just the same periodic strip in
every case so all you can get is an
ether the same ether in each void and
the way we prove that again it's just
sort of a sequence of miracles semi
miracles just where you want them
somehow and it's because in the
configuration starting from a single one
above each void you have a periodic if
you go a distance a power of two up then
you have something that's periodic with
period three times due to the M and it's
this very specific periodic thing where
you have one one zero spaced apart with
2 to the M 0 as in between again
anything like this it's an easy exercise
to prove it's not a mystery why it's
true but it turns out to be the thing we
need so that means if you start from a
random seed then you have something
similarly you above each void if you go
up distance to to the M you have
something that's periodic and the same
period no matter where you look and
every interval of length 2 to the M
within this periodic thing is uniformly
random that's the that's the way to set
so then it's essentially before and this
is yeah so this is as I say this is
what's behind the Mentos
so as I said somehow it just enough
things work to enable us to prove this
but many seemingly closely related
questions we don't know the answer to so
for instance we do not understand very
much about super critical percolation
started from random seeds
so remember empty paths were in some
sense super critical in the sense that
if you start with random on Z then
infinite empty paths exist and the way
we prove that as we actually prove a bit
more that if you take all the points you
can reach starting from let's say the
half line origin to the left then it has
a frontier and that frontier has drift
positive drift a quarter but for
instance what happens if you start from
a random seed of length L and you look
at where can you get to by empty path
starting from the left-hand end say so
here's an example of the picture that
you get there's a frontier and the
question is at time T how far over has
it got and what we believe is that for
typical seeds this gap behaves like a
non trivial power law of T now that
makes sense because the remember the
black thing is essentially a fractal and
you presumably have speed a quarter when
you're inside the fact all because it's
kind of random and you have speed one
when you're in the void that part at
least we could agree on so but but it's
a fact also most of the time you're in
the voids so that's kind of where why
this parallel makes sense but
that and again it's not true for every
see so here's a specific seed and here
in the specific case we can prove
everything if you look at this frontier
then it's a macroscopic distance from
the edge so even though for a moment we
looked at these pictures for a while and
we thought this must be essentially the
same picture as this because when you
look at the first thousand iterations it
looks very similar but it's not in this
case it's and it's this distance is a
strictly this distance over T is
strictly bounded between 0 and 1 and and
in fact the frontier converges to a
variant of The Devil's Staircase and the
scaling let me that's proved abortive
particular place we can prove that this
power law holds for some very simplified
version of the model that we came up
with and we're obably something like
this power law is behind some cellular
automaton pictures that we can't analyze
so here's an example for one of the
rules in our class where probably what's
happening is you have this frontier that
obeys a power law and then it causes
some other things to happen just on the
frontier so if one could prove the power
law then through this was a quasi
replicator probably and robably
something somewhat similar is happening
in this chaotic picture I showed you at
the beginning so again this is one of
the rules that have theorem applies to
so long random seeds are nice and
predictable and well behaved if this one
is apparently not but presumably there's
a power law of antair here and then all
sorts of complicated things happening
behind it that's just a bigger picture
of the same thing so you can see there's
this tantalizing mix of order and chaos
because and you sort of have this power
law repeated in lots of places as well
and
what's going on here well it doesn't
look exactly random so nothing to say
rigorously here and also completely open
our cases where the percolation is
apparently critical and this is a
particular case like that so lots of
open problems and I mean we don't know
how to prove that any of these rules
have infinitely many possible ethers
although we believe it to be the case
also very interesting question is trying
to do space-time percolation for other 1
dimensional cellular automaton rules not
additive ones and there are plenty of
others for example we will 34 which
uniform measure fair coin flips is an
invariant measure so that would be a
natural place to start with some of
these questions yeah so we don't even
know what happens to empty paths if you
start from random configuration on the
half line and zeros on the other half of
course proving existence of chaotic
behavior in any of these cases and yeah
coming back to we started also
presumably impossibly difficult what
does not as Conway's life do from a
random configuration on Z 2 and so the
reason I think that's difficult is on
the one hand you know you can come up
with these very elaborate computers that
do interesting things but they're not at
all robust if you if if a little bit of
chaos runs into one then it's the end
but on the other hand if you're on Z 2
perhaps there are local configurations
which do interesting computations and
also are very good at defending
themselves against attacks from chaos on
the outside you have the whole of Z 2 to
blewett's and who knows whether those
win over the counters so that's that was
sort of our motivation I'll stop
homey
- I can't anything is great
well I guess a strictly yes but in a
very a very trivial example the one that
was a different ether on the two sides
so it's a mixed replicator I mean this
and this is more just a symptom of how
we defined things but yeah is a bit more
evidence besides eyeballing the pictures
than that which is the roundabout
evidence to say the least the the the
the program I showed you right at the
beginning for simulating Conway's life
its users a remarkable the program
itself is called golly by the way highly
recommended for the software and uses
this remarkable algorithm called hash
life which somehow stores configurations
that it seen before and it's very
interesting to see so for some
configurations it does very well if you
give it a replicator it goes very very
fast it gets into trillions of
generations it a few seconds for a
apparently chaotic case it's not much
faster than just computing everything as
you go although it's a bit faster and
for quasi replicators it seems to be
kind of intermediate yes into the
millions so there's and if some evidence
may be there that the apparently chaotic
ones really are more complicated than
the quasi replicators but but yeah I
mean and I think that's something that
could be investigated further
do you expect any calluses off of rules
for wish you would have same behavior
moving outside now neither everything
dependency thank you big it big inator
any conjecture if you take such and such
a class than formulate just why not take
any night a neighborhood no I don't
think anything would particularly
changed if you started looking at bigger
neighborhoods but you just have to be
very careful define things and you know
we're doing it any theorem which says
that if your rule is depends on a finite
neighborhood which satisfies certain
conditions then
you can encounter the following friend
of mine
we didn't open it such a result
because it would provide very heavily on
the factory for this face marketing
yes and then that certainly deviations
or the backgrounds can talk later
the rules we prove things about our very
very special ones and so one could
extend the class rules for which the
theorems work but it would still be very
very special
something she's officially didn't see
yes but sometimes it does but typically
it doesn't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
