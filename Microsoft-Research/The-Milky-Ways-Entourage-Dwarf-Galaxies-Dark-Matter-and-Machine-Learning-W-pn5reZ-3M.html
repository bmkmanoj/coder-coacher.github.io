you
so I don't get to introduce
astrophysicists very much so this is
pretty awesome but it's my pleasure to
introduce Marla gaya who is faculty in
astronomy and physics at the University
of Yale University when I first met
Marla couple years ago at one of the
Cavalier vents she was doing her
sabbatical this was a year-long
sabbatical and she was traveling around
the world to all the different
observatories and spending time and
sending pictures not sure was an
amazingly productive year but just
looked like a wonderful trip looking in
from the outside so I was really jealous
have you looked Marlo up on the web
again I don't get to introduce
astrophysicists all that much maybe look
her up on the web you see words like
cosmology and dark matter and and Milky
Way structure and dwarf galaxies and
she's done some wonderful work in the
area tons of awards to back her popular
sciences top or top 10 brilliant minds
in 09 that right just that year um yes I
was terrible the Hubble fellow sloan
fellow collie fellow and list goes on
and on but rather than stand in the way
of us and a stellar talk oh let me hand
over tomorrow awesome thank you so it's
a real delight to be able to talk to you
today I appreciate the opportunity I'll
tell just took so what I want to talk
about today is my research looking at
little galaxies around the Milky Way and
trying to use them as tools to
understand Dark Matter to understand
cosmology and the tools that we actually
use are essentially computer science and
so I had a conversation this morning I
was staying on bainbridge island with
friends they have a seven-year-old and
the parents were trying to get the
seven-year-old into coding they had
tried the hour of code and he looks at
me and he says do computer program and I
was stunned because that's essentially
all we do astronomer is unlike biology
or chemistry we don't were not able to
go and ask to galaxy you know take two
GALEX
and throw them together and ask what
happens we just have light we study
light and so all my tools are in a
computer so if I want to take two
galaxies and throw them together I can
do numerical simulation and so all my
tools are computer program we're
terrible computer programs were awful we
don't take computer science classes as a
rule it's mostly physics classes and so
I have a problem that I want to do and I
just go and solve it so that usually
becomes very inefficient but we're okay
okay so the thing that I want to chat
about today are the satellites around
the Milky Way and the image that i'm
showing here is not actually the Milky
Way this is our nearest neighbor
probably the galaxy that looks very much
like the Milky Way this is Andromeda you
can in fact see it with the naked eye
it's one of the only galaxies you can
really see with the naked eye all of the
dots that you see are actually
foreground stars in the Milky Way and
this will actually become important to
the story I'm going to tell so we're in
the Milky Way we're looking through the
disk of our Milky Way and so those are
all these little stars that are kind of
annoying and in front of us and then
looking out to a galaxy nearby the
Andromeda galaxy but this probably looks
a lot like our own Milky Way and it's a
pretty picture so I have it up here what
I'm most interested in in this picture
are actually these two things right here
so right here and right there those are
galaxies of their own right they are the
stars in in these two galaxies are bound
to each other so it's a conglomeration
of group and its orbiting around the
larger object so these are two satellite
galaxies we call them dwarf galaxies a
dwarf galaxy is defined as something
roughly a tenth of the Milky Way's size
or less the object so I'm going to talk
about today the or less is one
ten-thousandth I can't even say that
word of the Milky Way's mass so very
very tiny galaxies but turn out to be
incredibly useful tools in terms of
trying to understand the underlying
cosmology of the universe as well as
tools to studying what dark matter is so
they are kind of fun objects to study
because I can talk about basically
everything and astronomy from stars up
to you know the underlying properties of
the universe
to explain why satellite galaxies are so
important we actually have to go to the
very beginning of the universe so I'm
going to show a movie in a second which
starts just after the Big Bang and just
allows a matter in the universe to
congeal and a merge to form the milky
way that we see today so this simulation
actually can we dim the lights thank you
this is a numerical simulation what you
see is starting at the very beginning of
the universe there's over densities of
matter those over densities just from
gravity coalesce and merge smaller
objects are merging to form larger
objects at the center you'll see what
becomes the Milky Way there's a major
merger happening right there but just
notice all this structure there's just
tons of smaller things merging and we
call this hierarchical merging the
underlying physics of the universe is
encoded in this simulation so if the
properties of dark matter were slightly
different if the topology of the
universe was slightly different the
structure that you would see would be
changed just a bit there's one hitch and
that is is that this simulation is
entirely dark matter there are no stars
there's no gas there's certainly no
people in the simulation and that kind
of sounds like a bit of an oversight
except that we know dark matter the the
matter in the simulation makes up
something like ninety percent of the
universe and so we can ignore the other
ten percent pretty confidently and these
simulations really represent can
represent what we see in the universe so
the image that I showed you just before
this beautiful galaxy with all these
stars lives kind of right in the center
of this and it's surrounded by dark
matter it's surrounded by all these Dark
Matter structures here is the problem so
this simulation predicts around a galaxy
like our Milky Way that there should be
something like a thousand satellites
that it that is a thousand of these
little structures around our Milky Way
as of 2005 we knew of 11 and in 2005 and
11 and thousand are different
even in astronomy in 2005 I would have
convinced you and I would have been
really really convincing that we knew of
all the satellites around the Milky Way
we had looked really deeply across the
entire sky maybe there was one or two
that we missed but this was the
population of satellites and so there
was a crisis really smartly named the
missing satellite problem and the thing
is is that if we know of all the
satellites are in the Milky Way yet we
predict thousands what's wrong so either
the underlying cosmology of the universe
is wrong which is really disturbing
because for big galaxies like the Milky
Way and larger these simulations
actually really represent what we see so
there might be a problem with just our
understanding of the universe an
alternative is maybe we've missed some
of the satellites but again in 2005 I
would have said no so the most of the
research was trying to understand how
maybe you could have Dark Matter
satellites that didn't have stars that
it didn't have luminous matter and so we
these Dark Matter structures are there
we just don't see them and only
occasionally they're stars that are in
these things and so basically trying to
suppress luminous matter in these things
it wasn't a very satisfying solution but
that's where most of the research happen
in 2005 a couple things happened the
first major mapping digital mapping of
the sky was released so the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey and I'll talk about
that a little bit in a bit release the
first homogeneous catalogs of stars
across a very large region of sky that
allowed us to search for satellites in a
way we hadn't before as of 2014 we now
know of 25 satellites around the Milky
Way these were all found in the Sloan
catalog and I'll tell you exactly how we
found them and we now know that instead
of 11 when I would have said 11 is
definitely the number that we know 25 I
know that there should be a lot more out
there because we haven't searched the
full sky and we haven't searched the
full depth of this guy and so in fact
doing completeness calculations and i'll
tell you about those we think there
should be something like 400 luminous
satellites around the Milky Way out
there to be found which is pretty
exciting and then I will leave you on
your edges the seats until the very end
of the talk to ask
these things solve this missing
satellite problem or not if these things
are so important and they perhaps solve
this problem how did we miss these
objects so this is what a milky a
satellite one of the satellites that was
known before 2005 looks like even with
the lights not them you can kind of see
it it's an over density of stars this is
what one of the new satellites look like
and I promise you that no amount of
imagination even though I'm sure you're
going to try can reveal the satellite
that's in that image so all of the ones
before 2005 were found by visual
searches just by looking at images and
looking for these sort of smudges let's
talk about why these new things were
found so here is again the same image
I've now reversed the colors for no
particular reason and there are stars
and these in this image that are
associated together but most of the
things that you see are actually these
foreground stars or foreground stars
right in the disk of our Milky Way so
imagine we're in the Milky Way we're
looking through a disk of stars and
we're trying to find objects that are a
little bit farther away so the problem
is is that most of the things you're
seeing in this image our foreground
objects and we need to get rid of them
somehow the way we're going to do that
is to remove these Milky Way stars and
we're going to do it understanding the
physics of stars so stars are formed out
of gas and gas they collapse and we have
really good physical models to
understand how bright a star is and what
its color would be so for example our
son has a particular brightness and it's
kind of yellow if it was a lower mass
star it would be a bit more read more
massive stars are a bit bluer hotter and
we can actually use this sequence of
Magna of brightness and color to remove
stars remove stars that we think are in
the foreground so what we actually do
algorithmically is we take that really
pretty picture we turn it into a bunch
of dots in a catalog for every dot in
this catalog I have a brightness and I
have a color what I do is I filter out
stars that are not in a particular
window of color and magnitude this is
what it looks like so this is brightness
and color and stars that are at a
certain particular distance should lie
in a very particular part of this
bass and so if i take this image and i
remove all the stars that don't lie in
this filter it get it gets rid of a lot
of these foreground objects you might
with a lot of imagination start to see
something right in the center but I'll
smooth it so that I can actually see
something and so what we do is we go
through and we filter the catalogs and
we look for over density as those stars
or a particular distance so if I now
take that same image and I circle all
the stars that are at the same distance
this is the galaxy and again these stars
are faint and they wouldn't pick them
out just by eye this is how all of these
new galaxies have been found by
searching algorithmically these catalogs
so let me just show you where these new
things were found this is just an
all-sky imager all-sky map the disk of
the Milky Way is this blue thing the
disk of the Milky Way has lots of gas
and dust gets extremely irritating we
can't find things through it we can't
look particularly far through it so this
is kind of a zone of avoidance the green
are the satellites that we knew of
before 2005 if you've ever been in the
southern hemisphere and seen the
Magellanic Clouds which are pretty
awesome these are the two Magellanic
Clouds here these are aware the new
galaxies have all been found and you'll
notice that these are not homogeneous ly
distributed on the sky and the reason is
is that this is the coverage of the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey so this you
know amazing mapping of the sky is in
the northern hemisphere it's a telescope
that's in New Mexico has only Matt the
northern part hopefully in the next
couple more years we'll have maps of the
southern part so this is when I say we
found 25 satellites we know they're
going to be more just by mapping the
rest of the sky we also know they're
going to be more because this Sloan
Digital Sky Survey only goes so deep it
goes down to a magnitude that sorry down
to brightness limit that's it's good but
it's not great and so what we need is a
surveys that go even deeper to find
galaxies that are beyond the distances
of these objects so this is a sloan
digital sky survey again in New Mexico
it was a first systematic digital
mapping so it really allowed
to apply these techniques the hope is
that the next generation of surveys so
the large synoptic survey telescope is a
big initiative and astronomy right now
it's one of the projects that the
national science foundation is really
supporting it looks like it may actually
go they have just broken ground actually
for this telescope it's going to be in
the southern hemisphere and the first
light is predicted for maybe 2020 or
2022 so the Sloan survey did a digital
map of the sky LSST is going to do a
digital movie so it's going to do one
Sloan survey every three nights if you
stack all those together we're going to
go much much deeper and so in terms of
data we're absolutely terrified of this
survey because it's just going to be you
know terabytes upon terabytes per hour
and trying to search this sort of thing
we need to be thinking about it now and
so there's a lot of people i'm on one of
the working teams trying to figure out
how the heck we're actually going to be
able to deal with all these data and and
do the science that we want to do now
before the fire hose is turned on in
less than 10 years so what could we
actually expect with LSST so now this is
a plot this is astronomers have really
goofy units terrible units so bright
things are over there at smaller numbers
and faint things are down here this is a
logarithmic scale of brightness called
magnitude it's horrible and this is the
number of the cumulative number of
satellites so right now we know of 25
satellites that's the red the green if
we just do a full survey with a sloan
digital sky survey we would predict just
based on the incompleteness something
like 50 satellites around the Milky Way
and then if we actually do really deep
survey something like LSST somewhere
between a hundred and six hundred
because we don't really know exactly how
to do that completeness correction
should be something like 600 satellites
around the Milky Way so now with these
satellites we can actually do science
the least luminous of these objects the
faintest one of these objects we can do
a lot of really interesting physics with
so the first thing and we've already now
talked
about it is we can actually test
cosmology by comparing the number of
satellites we see to the numerical
simulations and so we'll come back to
that and see whether or not those two
things add up these Lewis luminosity
galaxies are also really interesting
they're the least luminous galaxies that
we know of and they also turn out to be
the most dark matter dominated so I will
explain exactly why I think these
objects are dark matter dominated and
then we can use them to study dark
matter itself so we can use these as
particle physics probes to actually try
and detect dark matter and it's really
wonderful that you know these these
small little satellites I can talk to an
enormous range of people just using
these objects ok so let's talk about
dark matter for a second and why I think
these objects are dark matter dominated
so we've come back to this image we've
now identified a galaxy or a candidate
galaxy where we have stars we think
they're associated together but this
could just be a random collection of
stars this might be some kind of
statistical fluctuation where we just
happen to see stars that are aligned up
you know an asterism so that's one
question is how can I tell that this is
not a random collection of stars if it's
not a random collection of stars what I
want to understand the question I really
want to ask is what is the mass of this
object and so just from Newton's law of
gravity we know that a more massive
object will have those stars will be
orbiting around each other faster so the
Milky Way stars are orbiting around at
about 200 kilometers a second if it was
a smaller galaxies those things would be
flung out just based on gravity and so
if I can measure the relative velocities
of stars I can actually directly turn
that into the mass of the galaxy so
let's do that the problem is is that to
measure the mat the measure the velocity
of the stars these things are super
faint and so I need a particularly big
telescope so the biggest telescope in
the world is the one I'm going to choose
the biggest telescope optical telescope
in the world is the Keck telescopes
these are in Hawaii on the top of Mauna
Kea the Keck telescopes are 10 meter
mirrors so the primary mirror wouldn't
actually fit in this room by a long shot
it's run by the University of California
and
caltech Yale has actually just bought
into the Keck telescope so we have
something like 20 nights per year on the
telescope we internally write a proposal
to ask for time I actually organize that
and run the committee decide who gets
time on the telescope's so I get time on
the telescope's there's no I walk out of
the room when that decision is being
made so we use the Keck telescopes to
measure velocities of stars in these
really faint galaxies so we measure
individual stars to measure their
velocity so let me just take a moment to
talk about how we measure velocities and
many of you may know this already but I
kind of wanted to talk about it so this
is the spectrum of a star if you look at
you know just take the Lexx say sunlight
and you turn it into put a prism in
front of it you turn it into a rainbow
if you look really carefully even at the
Sun spectrum you see dark lines in front
of it and what's happening here is that
you have the Sun itself it's very very
hot it's acting like a black body and
there's atmosphere the sun's atmosphere
is sort of on top of it cooler stuff and
so as the light comes through the
atmosphere of the Sun there's absorption
from various different chemical elements
and so you know hydrogen helium all
those sort of things and you can see a
very clear footprint of these absorption
lines if the star is moving these
elements just shift just slightly and
just like the Doppler shift we can
measure the shift of these lines and
then infer velocity so it's essentially
the Doppler shift this is the pretty
version of that this is what the real
data actually look like so with the Keck
telescope we can measure something like
a hundred stars with a particular
instrument we can measure something like
a hundred stars at a time what you're
looking at here is each of these
vertical lines is the spectrum from a
star in that galaxy the lines across it
are actually lines from the atmosphere
and so the data reduction part of this
is you know again me writing a bunch of
awful code to figure out what the
wavelength is and then infer the
velocities from this this is where most
of my PhD work was done and I love this
kind of stuff okay so I have these stars
I then measure their velocities and this
is what the data look like from that so
here is the velocity of a particular
stars I've met
this is just a histogram and here I'm
going to plot for those stars they're
brightnesses and their colors so first
we have stars here and I have a model
for what the Milky Way should look like
stars in the Milky Way because the stars
are near us and they're moving with us
they should have a relative velocity to
the son of zero but there'll be a big
dispersion around that and so these are
stars that are all associated with the
Milky Way you'll also notice here if you
can it's kind of hard to see the blue
stars here are all over the place
they're kind of scattered in brightness
and color and then you'll notice that
there's a peek at a different velocity
very different velocity than the sun's
velocity these are stars that we
associate with this particular galaxy
and you'll note that those red stars are
all in a fairly localized region in this
color-magnitude diagram space and if I
over plot a model for stars at a
particular distance stars that a single
distance should lie on these tracks and
so it's kind of consistent there's lots
of noise and stuff that the these red
stars are in fact associated with each
other they all have kind of the same
systematic velocity and they're orbiting
around the Milky Way and now what i can
do is ask given what is the width of
that histogram what is the width of the
stars that are associated with each
other and turn that into a mass so i can
first predict what I would expect that
dispersion should be and what i can do
is ask all right i know all the stars in
this galaxy i can I know what the mass
of a star is I'm just going to add up
the mass of all the stars and just say
okay given that mass what would the
dispersion of this history on be if I do
that if the mass was just from
everything I can see everything luminous
the measurement would be half a
kilometer a second let's compare this to
what I actually measure so I actually
measure something like three or so plus
or minus one so I can talk about that
error bar forever that took me a year to
calculate I'm very confident in that
error bar and the reason it took me a
year to calculate is because now I can
say with real confidence that this
dispersion is much much larger than what
I
expect from just the Stars and I've been
conservative when I figured out what
this upper limit was I included stars I
might not see that are too faint I
included some gas I included some dust
this is a real upper limit and so I'm
measuring something that's much much
larger than what I infer from what I can
see therefore the mass is dominated by
stuff I cannot see and we call that dark
matter at this point so dark matter at
this point is just stuff that we can't
see is a gravitational mass and in fact
all of the newly discovered galaxies
these small galaxies are not only
dominated by dark matter their stars
make up something like a percent or less
of the total inferred mass that is there
really are the the stars are really the
tip of a mass iceberg and the the ultra
phase these faint galaxies are the most
Dark Matter these are the most extreme
things where the stars to gravitational
mass have ratios that are a thousand to
two thousand compare that to let's say
the Milky Way this image that I showed
you earlier the Milky Way's mass at
least within the sun's radius are a
little farther out the stars make up
something like ten percent to the total
mass so it's not as dark matter
dominated is the one percent or point
one percent that these lower mass things
are are dominated by and really velocity
measured from basically every type of
galaxies infer we infer dark matter and
I think to me that's empirically the
strongest evidence for dark matter this
doesn't give us any indication for what
this matter actually is in fact at this
point this is what dark matter is right
dark matter is dark we can't see it and
not dark matter is stuff that we can
actually see to understand what dark
matter actually is we need to do a lot
of other experiments and so we could
just ask well what could this dark
matter stuff actually be right a couple
of columns and start crossing stuff out
and I apologize I couldn't think of any
other word besides stuff so dark matter
can either be normal stuff or it could
be other stuff under normal stuff i can
write down everything that is sort of
normal is made out of the electrons and
protons
that we might not be able to see so
things like dead stars so stars that
have run out of hydrogen they're no
longer producing their own luminosity we
wouldn't see them but they'd provide
mass planets there could just be
free-floating planets out there and
there certainly are we wouldn't see
luminosity from those things black holes
might not you might not intuitively put
that under normal stuff however the only
way no we know how to make a black hole
is from a star from a supernova of a
normal star therefore I actually put
this under normal matter because it's
coming from the normal matter part you
might say okay then what's other stuff
so other stuff is a little bit more
exotic something like a neutrino
particle that has mass or a particle
that has mass that we don't really
understand we sweep this all under the
rug and we call this a weakly
interacting massive particle so a
particle that has gravity but only
interacts doesn't interact
electromagnetically it only at in this
case only interacts using the weak force
if I had three more hours and I know I
don't I could explain all of the
observations that suggests that none of
these things make up enough mass they're
certainly our dead stars are certainly
our Black Hills but they don't even come
close to making up the mass we need to
explain galaxy dynamics if I had another
two hours we could get rid of neutrinos
and there's a bunch of interesting
experiments to suggest that neutrinos
actually don't work from a bubble
different points of view I maybe am a
little there's ways to make neutrinos
work in the last couple of weeks
actually I was reading some papers that
neutrinos may be making a comeback
whatever the most popular idea right now
for what dark matter is is a weakly
interacting particle and there are
actually really interesting other lines
of evidence that suggests this sort of
thing so these wimps and there's a great
story about why they're called wimps but
I'm not going to tell you we can
actually use the galaxies that we just
found these ultra faint really faint
galaxies to study and test whether or
not the dark matter in them is made out
of wimps so if dark matter is made out
of a wimp um it
actually predicted occasionally that
dark matter particles will collide and
annihilate and actually make something
observable make a real photon so in this
case dark matter is not strictly dark
occasionally to mark dark matter
particles will collide and interact and
they'll actually create a very high
energy photon a gamma-ray photon the
particle physics and this is actually
something I don't fully understand but
most of the preferred models right now
for this particle interaction predict a
gamma ray okay so what we need to be
able to see this this is a very very not
probable occurrence it's extremely low
probability so we need a place where
dark there's a lot of dark matter it's
very very dense therefore the
probability for interaction is higher
and it also needs to be nearby because
it's a photon and so it'll be one over R
squared the signal so we need to have
something that's very dark matter dense
and nearby the best place to do that is
actually the middle of our Milky Way so
the center of our Milky Way should have
lots of dark matter it should be very
very dense and it's extremely nearby
it's actually a closer than any of the
dwarf galaxies I've showed you the
problem is is that in the center of the
galaxy is every Astrophysical process
that creates gamma rays and so if I see
a gamma ray from the Milky Way from the
center of the Milky Way it could be
created from a supernova it could be
created from matter falling into the
center of the black hole the the black
hole to the center and milky way so I
can't cleanly say if I see a gamma ray
that it's coming from dark matter
annihilation it could be coming from
normal Astrophysical processes the dwarf
galaxies are awesome because they don't
have any of these Astrophysical
processes so there are no there's no
ongoing star formation there's no
processes that create gamma rays from
normal processes in these dwarf galaxies
so if I see gamma rays coming from these
I can say oh this must be coming from
annihilation to look for gamma rays I
can't do it from the ground thankfully
otherwise we all be dead you have to
have a satellite you have to be above
the atmosphere the fur marie the fermi
gamma-ray satellite has been flying now
for about three or four years and has
been doing all sky gamma-ray surveys of
the of the sky there's been no detection
zuv the dwarf galaxies there's been no
if we look at all the different course
we found there are no over densities of
arrays but we can actually stack them
together and get some kind of upper
limit and so the fact that we don't see
them actually put some limits on this
annihilation process and so for the
aficionados in the room we can actually
rule out some dark matter particle
models just by the fact that we don't
see these four galaxies and deeper
surveys deeper gamma-ray surveys will
actually be able to get into ranges that
are really interesting in terms of what
we expect to see okay so coming back
around we've now used the dwarf galaxies
to test particle physics we can now test
cosmology as well and so I said that the
number of dwarf galaxies around the
Milky Way is a test for cosmology the
number of predictions of the satellites
is directly related to the underlying
physics of the universe and so let's
actually see whether the earth galaxies
work or not so here is this is now in a
different units the mass of a satellite
galaxies and this is a number the
cumulative number of galaxies the open
symbols are the predictions so that's
actually taking that numerical
simulation asking what the masses of all
the things little things around it and
just adding them up so that's the
predictions and this is where I came up
with this idea that there's about a
thousand should be a thousand satellites
or in the Milky Way these are the
numbers that we knew of before so only
about eleven satellites in 2005 so those
are worthy observations these are where
the observations stand now assuming that
we've searched the entire sky so this is
this 25 to 50 number of satellites and
you can see that it definitely is
getting closer but there's sort of still
factors of 2 250 between this and so we
can now ask look if I look really deep
can I actually get up to the numbers
that were predicted and for the smaller
satellites for the lowest mass things I
think we can so these are pretty
generous predictions and I think we can
actually get up to the numbers that we
predict so there's the lowest luminosity
satellites have actually at least ease
this missing satellite problem at the
lowest mass end and so here you know if
it's a factor of a few we actually feel
that things are going pretty well
what's interesting and this will be sort
of one of the last points in the talk is
that we now instead of having a problem
at the lowest mass ends where we're
having problems of thousands we're now
actually very concerned with the
brighter satellites the things that we
knew of since 2005 and earlier that I
know in brown the Milky Way that there
are no more very massive bright
satellites I'm quite certain of that
still and so we're talking here about
factors of 10 below the simulation still
and so the question here is well you
know maybe the Milky Way is just it's a
sample of one maybe the Milky Way is
just a weird you know outlier in this
distribution and that we put a lot of
weight into the Milky Way we should
probably go and look for other milky
ways and asked what the distributions
are around those satellites and so this
is something a new project that I've
just started in the last six months this
is at the collaborator at Stanford we're
really excited about it it's a
completely insane project so let me
explain why it's insane so here is an
analog to the milky way we can find
these all over the place so a milky way
analog is something that's probably the
same luminosity maybe roughly the same
mass as the Milky Way and what we want
to do is find satellites around these
things so the you know the question is
isn't as a milky way an outlier and what
are the satellite populations around
others other galaxies we can't get down
to the incredibly faint ultra faint
things that I've showed you earlier
around other galaxies there beyond our
capabilities but we can get down pretty
far and those two data points that I
showed you earlier we certainly can find
satellites around those here is the
problem so here's a milky way this is a
far away but not all that far away many
of my colleagues would consider this the
local universe so that's a blow-up of
this Milky Way analogue it kind of looks
nice we've got you know spiral arms it
looks very milky way like we have gone
and got in spectroscopy so we've
actually gotten distance measures for a
handful of objects in this in this
region this is a actually can we did
them dim the lights that work Wow sorry
that's what I'm going to go home and
tell my colleagues about so this is a
satellite galaxies this is um again
coming from the digital Sloane's survey
you know it doesn't look like much and
here is the problem this is a bunch of
dip background galaxies in the same
region and they look you know pretty
darn similar the problem is is that we
expect something like four or five
satellite galaxies so four or five
galaxies associated with that large
thing in this same region there's
something like five thousand to eight
thousand objects that have the same
colors the same properties as these
satellites so there's two things I can
do to solve this problem I can go and
get spectroscopy I can actually measure
distances for absolutely everything in
this in this field that's a fairly
expensive proposition where expensive
just means i need to go to telescopes
and spend nights weeks of nights just
getting spectroscopy for all these it's
actually what we're doing right now so
in the next six months we have about 15
nights of telescope time to sort of
blindly get distances for everything in
the couple of fields around a couple of
Milky Way's the reason we're doing this
is because we're trying to build up
training sets so the idea is that there
is if I look at this image and I look at
these images there is something a little
bit different I can't quite actually put
my finger on it but when i see a
satellite galaxy I kind of know it looks
like a satellite galaxy if i look at the
catalogue properties the sizes the
colors and i compare that to these
things they're identical so i can't
really break the problem there but i do
think that somehow my brain knows that
there's something different and so what
we want to do is try and build up
training sets and then throw these into
some kind of intimacy learning
algorithms and we're trying this now um
yeah instrument have any spatial
resolution from the spectroscopy so um
right now we're just getting no answer
we're trying to get we're doing fiber
spectroscopy trying to get really coarse
really low signal-to-noise awful spectra
to simply measure velocities it's
expensive to get spatial but we're once
we find things we are actually following
up with spatial
resolution so the hope is that if I can
teach a machine what that looks like and
we need to build up samples to do that
perhaps we can at least get rid of
instead of having five thousand galaxies
/ milky way we can get down to something
that's more reasonable maybe a few
hundred and actually be able to build up
a statistical sample of Milky Way's so
this has been really fun we have so far
found I think maybe 20 new satellites or
something 20 is not great in terms of
trying to teach a machine anything and
so we're trying to come up with some
clever ideas of how to do this but it's
been really fun and for me it's been a
real learning experience in terms of
using new tools to try and get at some
old problems um I went really fast but
that's cool we have more time for
questions so I'm going to I'm going to
stop there I have hopefully convinced
you of a few things so first of all just
interesting that the number of
satellites around our Milky Way has
doubled just in the last you know five
to eight years and there are new set of
new discoveries happening all the time
so last week there is a paper on the
archive the first satellite discovered
outside of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
which is pretty awesome there are new
imaging surveys that are coming out in
sort of small patches of the sky it
won't be until LSST where we can really
map the entire sky and get a sense for
the entire population around the Milky
Way but all of these new things are
interesting they're all they're the
least luminous galaxies they've actually
had us questioning what is a galaxy so
you know with luminosities there are
only multiples of the Sun we really have
to think about what we what we define as
a galaxy they're the most Dark Matter
galaxies and so that dark matter Dominic
Alexei's which means they're really
great tools for studying this crazy
thing called dark matter and we can test
we can use them to test cosmological
models so many of my colleagues we have
basically ignored dwarf galaxies for
many many years they're small and tiny
they don't make up much mass in the
universe have all sort of like a herd
started simulating things with dwarf
galaxies because there's such cool
crucial tests and there are hundreds of
Milky Way satellites to be found
and beyond the Milky Way there are lots
of satellites to be found around things
beyond so in the next ten years we're
really going to understand both the
population of dwarf galaxies themselves
and then be able to use that to
understand galaxy of information and
sort of underlying properties of the
universe so thanks but there's some
local galaxies that might be obscured by
the disk or the center yeah it's um it's
a small percentage so yes absolutely oh
yeah so within about 10 degrees of the
the disk of the Milky Way it's all bets
are off you can go to different
wavelengths so that's in the optical in
the infrared we can pierce through the
dust of the disk a little bit better and
get down a little bit lower so yes the I
can but that's actually pretty easy to
account for in the Mayan completeness
and so I know where I can't search for
things and so I can just account for
that yeah but there are interesting ways
to try and get around it it is the
proportion of dark matter inside like
galaxies with Lincoln systems um it
doesn't really interesting so the result
right now which I gloss over is that all
of the low-mass galaxies no matter what
their luminosity so over a three or four
orders of magnitude in luminosity they
are all it seems sitting in the same
mass of dark matter that is so the most
luminous ones have a certain amount of
dark matter but the least luminous ones
have the same amount which is actually a
little bit weird and not quite up to
predictions possible then there are
large satellite massive satellite
galaxies that we can't see just because
there's such a high proportion of dark
net we're such a low proportion of women
yeah it's possible it's possible um that
you know we if they so if those stars
are spread out we have a detection
threshold essentially we have to see
this over density and so if they're
spread out a little bit larger we won't
see them so really low surface
brightness things we just don't see
again with LSST as we go deeper we
should be able to push those limits a
lot more
yeah um maybe the more basic question
what's what's holding all those sat on
satellite or four pillars he's gotta
visit the dark matter otherwise yeah so
it's all gravity and so it's they're
being held together therefore there's
matter they're so so yeah there's both
white matter so the light matter
actually has so the luminous matter
basically doesn't play a part in this in
the story so those numerical simulations
I showed were just each particle has
some great you know has a mass and the
you can actually just calculate like a
tidal radius so at what radius away from
the center of a dwarf galaxy does a star
feel gravity from the more from the
object itself or from the outside field
from the the Milky Way and the radii of
that radius where the transition happens
is actually well beyond the luminous
matter so the stars in a dwarf galaxy
you only feel gravity basically from
each other I mean it's a much larger
radius that it transitions into starting
to feel the title field from the Milky
Way we certainly see things like
globular cluster is a cluster of stars
it doesn't have dark matter similar
luminosities we see these things being
torn apart and I have one another
project I'd love to talk about like
three different projects in here one of
my graduate students is working on
trying to use these gravity art sorry
trying to use these clusters which are
being torn apart in the gravitational
field of the Milky Way using the stream
and actually inferring the gravitational
field of the Milky Way so we're using
those to weigh the Milky Way which is a
really cool way of trying to get at the
Milky Way's mass but we certainly see
things being title East ripped and
shredded and in those movies you can
kind of tell there's just it's a kid too
chaotic mess is galaxy formation which
is why it's a fun problem radio signal
at all or easing it so radio waves are
how are those produced it usually is in
active regions where their supernova
going on or something like that this
pilot club just happen to be a vibrant
lips
just happy to be in their little not
yeah we there's I have a pet project
maybe I'll talk to you about after but
basically there's nothing except for the
stars and those are brightest in sort of
luminal and the optical and I are so the
fact you're not seeing the gamma rays
coming off with the blimp interactions
that must be influencing the models for
wimps yeah so we are so there's a
there's a preferred model right now and
the the limits are still slightly above
those preferred models so we haven't yet
made any one extremely uncomfortable but
within a year we're going to make people
extremely uncomfortable and that's
happening it's really interesting
because it's also happening from the
direct dark matter detection so that was
that's in direct from annihilation the
direct dark matter detection are in labs
waiting for a dark matter particle to
knock like say a xenon atom or some atom
that doesn't interact with things
usually and those limits are also
getting really interesting and I've
actually kind of ruled out some of the
preferred models for what dark matter is
and so it will be interesting in the
next couple of years to see how this
field starts changing as the preferred
models are ruled out you said that a lot
of the dwarf galaxies you find out with
similar mass yeah does that strike you
as unlikely that's so it is interesting
um I am fairly confident that the
observations are right not a hundred
percent but fairly confident there are
models that explain it so there's models
that say look basically at this mass of
dark matter galaxy formation becomes
extremely stochastic and so the the you
know if you go higher more high a higher
mass Dark Matter mass the luminosity
that's in that that hate that object is
always kind of the same it's not all
that stochastic as you get to smaller
and smaller Dark Matter masses the
amount of luminous mass get stochastic
and so that's why you get this sort of
range of luminosity in that dark matter
mass those models predict that there are
lots of dark matter smaller Dark Matter
masses that don't have stars so in this
model that I've showed you there should
be a lot of things that do
have stars in them how do we find those
so that's a really interesting test so
one idea is actually to go back to these
streams and see whether or not there are
holes punched through these streams by
Dark Matter things it's a bit
controversial but we're going to try it
anyway but trying to find things you
can't see is really challenging and you
have to be clever but we do it all the
time maybe one last question to know he
took a step back and third hypothesize
that the things are that could speak the
science where would those bottlenecks be
right now this is a certain measurements
isn't in processing is in pure yep
people time what I'd say most of it
right now is actually a cure people time
and clever coding I would like to so
something like LSST with you know
getting a lot more data that would be
amazing and that would actually at will
break that will you know that should
spray copan this problem you know that
said really clever coding that's how the
satellites were found and in fact the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey was available
four or five years before the first
discovery it was just us kind of you
know processing and crunching through
and trying to come up with our stupid
clever ways so in fact more interactions
with people who think about interesting
algorithms there's a lot there there's a
whole lot there so it probably the
people and the the ideas is where things
are about on that
any other questions thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
