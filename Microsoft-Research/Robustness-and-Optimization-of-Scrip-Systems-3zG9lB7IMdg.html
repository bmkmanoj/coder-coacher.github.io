so look especially with an audience of
this size don't be polite don't wait to
the ant ask questions if you have
questions feel free to ask along the way
this is joint work with Ian who was
actually his thesis in cash a very
appropriate name it turns out as you'll
see and Eric Friedman who at the time
was a Cornell in the o.r department but
now is the Dixie in Berkeley what's
let's do that so what script script is
basically virtual money so let me
explain by examples so basically let me
tell you the story that motivated this
and you'll see the point so this is a
story that that was actually originally
published in the economics in the
economics literature but I first read
about it an article by Paul Krugman and
it goes as follows there's a bunch of
yuppies in Washington who all have kids
and they need babysitting for their kids
and so they agreed that they would form
a babysitting co-op which is the title
so they would babysit for each other now
to try to keep things fair they use the
token system so basically they all had
some tokens and if if you babysat for me
I would pay you a token but think of the
tokens is that there's the their script
virtual money right but the tokens were
like a bookkeeping system to make sure
that that that you know nobody did a lot
of babysitting and didn't have
babysitting done or return right so it
turned out at the beginning nobody was
going out nobody would be no everybody
was staying home and he said oh this is
bad the whole point of the system is
that we should all babysit for each
other and go out now these were
Washington yuppies so what do they do
they try to pass rules laws legislation
you all have to go out you know at least
once a month it's good for you you
shouldn't stay home didn't work then
they got a smart young economist he said
you know what your problem is you have
too few tokens in the system print more
money make more tokens work like a charm
everybody started going out great and
then these guys thought well gee if
printing more tokens helps
let's print even more it'll make things
even better so they printed more tokens
the system crashed nobody went up okay
so let's get some intuition why did
people not go out at the beginning so
the economist is right there too few
tokens the system well what's the
concern well you know you've got first
of all you can imagine a system with a
hundred people only 10 tokens a lot of
people simply won't have a token but if
even even if everybody has a token if
you've only got one token you might say
gee I mean you know my kids might get
sick next week or you know I might have
to go to see my parents in it right no
no credit an assistant was just tokens
and that'll be true actually throw out
to talk no credit right but now what
happened when there were lots of tokens
in the system why did the system crash
nobody wanted to I've already got 20
tokens why do I need it 21st right so
token systems have been used all over so
a nice a free riding this is like the
NPR problem everybody NPR wants you to
contribute but you might say well I like
listening to NPR but gee I don't need to
contribute as long as other people
contribute and the NPR station the NPR's
national public radio in the states
right and so i'm basically free riding
on the back of everybody else everybody
else has contributed money and that's
good enough i don't have to contribute
myself right so a token system is meant
to prevent free writing because you sort
of have to pay a token to get the
babysitting and there's a bunch of
systems that have used tokens precisely
to prevent free writing right um another
way using tokens again is just a way of
resource allocation if you really want a
resource you have to pay for maybe
you're willing to pay 10 tokens I'm
going to pay 10 another there's only
willing to pay five so I get it and and
so we're using you know think of money
money is a way of ensuring that the
right people get the resources right so
what we wanted to study was really
motivated well okay let me just a few
more words know sometimes script could
be very effective we all read all these
economist papers as a market mechanisms
are good but it's far from perfect so we
wanted the studies how robust our script
systems and if your assistant designer
how should
you build a script system in particular
we were motivated by the babysitting
co-op example what's the right amount of
script to put into the system right too
little that's bad too much was also bad
somewhere in the middle was good but we
wanted to understand that funny
inflation no and that's an interesting
question that will arise that was
because the price of a job was fixed at
one token / babysitting well so think
about these these yuppies I mean clearly
there would be advantages if we could
have say okay let's bid for a job how
much am I willing to pay you to do a job
but there's a downside to this at first
you know as a psychological matter the
yuppies are only using this as a as a
you know as a token system they weren't
gonna you know stoop to bidding for a
job right these were it's not like you
were trying to pay a babysitter say okay
you won't do it for five will you do it
for ten you we talked to a fellow
professional here and that's not the
kind of thing you do with a fellow
professional I I mean this in other
words in the real world it's there are a
bunch of cases and you got so so that
that were there are fixed prices that
are posted companies like it because
they can plan around it and in other
cases we have auctions right so we all
know about google auctions and stuff
like that right so it is so throughout
this talk I'm going to assume that the
jobs have a fixed price except you'll
see there will be inflation so I'll come
to that but our results are assuming a
fixed price job so hang on to the
question about inflation but it's
certainly a perfectly serious question
but at least might be argue in the real
world i can give you lots of examples of
script systems where there's no bidding
so it's not like you claim this
artificial well it's not a fishy ality
that arises in the real world right so
it's not that everything is an auction
system right so so what we're going to
do is we're going to develop a micro
economic model of formal model where
mathematicians and and study it game
theoretically and talk about optimal
behavior and show that there's a stable
nash equilibria i'll explain that and
use the understanding to design scrip
systems and it turns out that what we
get these results have been seen and
they're in the wild and things like
second life so you like market crashes
we can explain that comes it's it's a
consequence of our formal model as
you'll see and and apparently in second
wife where they've had you know script
systems and money they observe these
kind of market crashes so okay let me
give you the formal model I'm going to
give you a quite simplified version of
model but i'll explain what the
simplifications are so we have a bunch
of agents think event is being pretty
large this is not like two or three it's
more like 100 or more right in round our
nature chooses you randomly to make a
request think of a request is you want
babysitting so it's not a strategic
choice that you make that gee I'm going
to think about it i'm going to choose to
go out on friday rather you wake up
friday morning and you read the paper
and say there's a great movie here i
want to go out so in around our nature
is going to end for simplicity so think
of rounds is happening very often let's
assume that exactly one agent has chosen
each round but that's just to make life
the exposition simpler ah if you want a
job done you can get a jump done
provided you have a token think of a
token is being a dollar but there's not
real money I mean think of it as a token
right now the one so i say i want some
babysitting done or I want you to store
some stuff for me or I want you to do
some work for me right so these are the
kinds of things that happen in real
systems and then I say okay who's
willing to volunteer to do it if you're
willing to volunteer that you want
strategic choice you get to decide
whether or not you want to raise your
hand to volunteer and out of the people
who raise their hands one person is
chosen at random to satisfy the requests
now I have to say in the more general
model first of all we allow there's some
parameter beta that says even if you're
willing to volunteer you can't so you're
only able to volunteer with some
probability beta intuitively I love
babysitting your kids but my parents are
coming this weekend and I can't writer
I'd love to babysit your kids but I got
a ton of work to do this weekend then I
can so with probability beta in the
general model you're not not only do you
want to babysit you're free to babysit
again in the in our general model we
assume that it could be the case the
different people
art ozan with different probabilities
right it's not that there's a uniform
probability of being chosen you might
think that some people might advertise
better than others there might be
reputation effect so we don't have to
assume that's the same probability for
everyone supposing your chosen then the
person who's chosen gets the dollar the
person so if I want babysitting and and
and a ditch is willing to volunteer that
I give him a dollar I get a payoff of
one utility to think of it as one unit
of happiness happiness is not dollars
the dollars are just a bookkeeping
device right you're not happy if you
have ten dollars you're only happy if
you get babysitting done or you go out
to a movie right the money is think of
it as a bookkeeping system that's
important now you want the money so that
you can get money can buy you happiness
in this in this world okay and you get
negative alpha utility utility for doing
the babysitting right so babysitting is
a bit of a pain so you you stop for a
little bit for doing the babysitting but
we better have alpha being much less
than 1 or nobody would ever babysit
right the only reason you're babysitting
is that you get a token which you can
later use to get somebody to babysit for
you but if the pain of babysitting is
more than the benefit you get by having
babies and none for you never babysit
right now again in the general model
were quite willing to assume that
different people suffered differently
the cost of babysitting is different for
different people right or and the gain
of babysitting you know I I love going
at the movie you could happily stay home
and read your book right so we don't
have to assume that everybody gets the
payoff of one and gets minus alpha
finally we assume there's a discount
factor so a unit of utility today think
of discounting is measuring how patient
you are so if you get a dollar today but
you only will spend it a month from now
are you willing to work well if you're
very impatient then there's no way
you're going to work because the Alpha
you suffer now to work well so basically
what this is saying is one unit of
utility today is only worth delta
tomorrow and delta square the next day
and delta cubed the day after
right so think of Delta's being very
very close to one it's a number between
zero and one the closer to one it is the
more patient you are right so you're
willing to defer the pleasure of
babysitting are we together so that's
the formal model but this one thing like
this idea that the actual optimization
is none other something other than money
is that that's pretty standard that that
that I do want to distinguish money from
from the happiness that money buys you
so money in and of itself options uh I
you know I you know whether it really
applies to various people depends I mean
some people tend to identify money with
happy doesn't forget so now it becomes a
psychological question but certainly
it's the case that a hundred dollars to
me might be different for a hundred
dollars to somebody in in a rural
village in India so you don't want it
you certainly don't want to identify
money with happiness directly because we
might put different values on money so
think of unit utility is being you know
one measure to early one unit of utility
is the same for all of us but a dollar
is not the same for all of us right now
that's certainly true right it's quite
clear that 100 alters for me is a very
very different from Andhra dollars to
somebody in a in rural village right not
one day right that may not be the first
day no so my discount factor should
start from that oh wellz having me yes
uh well it doesn't make it that will
happen automatically so from your point
of view today tomorrow is a unit of
utility today is only worth delta
tomorrow and delta squared the next day
from your point of view tomorrow now
that is tomorrow a unit of utility today
is worth delta the next day and delta
square the next day i mean because the
discounting is multiplicative whatever
day you're at tomorrow was always a
factor of delta less is that making
sense i mean it really is uniform maybe
right so the effect of this model which
is definitely not to toss I mean this
notion of discounting is completely
standard in the literature so the total
utility you earn from the point of view
of day zero is how much utility you earn
and they are multiplied by Delta two
they are right but let's keep going I
mean I I alpha is positive negative
alpha is negative so oh can you we'll
talk about that later so so right now
let's take alpha to be positive but less
than 1 but you can certainly may I love
your kids so I get positive pleasure
from from babysitting for them so
certainly in the real world that can so
i'm assuming in the general application
of this stuff it's going to be negative
there's some pain and doing some work
for somebody storing something I mean
yes our analysis assumes that alpha is
positive but again you'll see there's
one place we drop that assumption so for
as a freight for ease of exposition I've
assumed that that agents are on
Virginia's they all have the same
classroom performing word the same
probably being chosen they gain the same
utility for having a job done they use
the same discount factor everybody's
equally patient everybody can always do
the job and end in the full paper we
allow what economies are called
different types of agents and a type is
characterized by five numbers saying you
know what's your alpha what's your delta
you know this is turns out we use beta
for this and gamma for this so we have
five numbers that characterize these
different features but but what is
important so the fact that these are
fixed that was only for this talk but
the fact that there's no auctions in the
price of a job is eternally fixed that's
critical and I'll come back to that
point that was the point that you raised
in London so it turns out that that in
the econ literature has it all
independently looked at script systems
they had a different focus they allow
agency Tillett iza change over time and
they allow agents to choose whether to
provide service or request service
whereas for us it's a different model
where you sort of get chosen to want
something and then as rising and you how
are you sort of followed up on our work
and the first version of our work and
and so they had a different model let me
not go into that that's not worth the
details so
I'm going to focus on one kind of
strategy which I would argue is probably
the most natural strategy so intuitively
I'm trying to decide whether or not to
work so I'm sitting there with ten
dollars in my pocket should I work well
I you know oh why should I work what's
the only reason I should work remember
money doesn't buy happiness and I would
prefer to work tomorrow rather than
working today right so why should I work
what's my worry if I don't work I'm
sitting there with ten dollars what am I
afraid of I want that why should I
volunteer what am I afraid will happen
yeah you run out of money right so it
could be the case that 11 times in a row
before I get chosen to work I'll want
something now the first 10 times it's
not a problem i'll have a dollar to pay
for it the 11th time i won't have a
dollar and so the only reason to work is
that i'm concerned that i'm going to run
out of money right but if i have lots of
money then why should i raised my hand
i'd rather work tomorrow because from my
point of view this is where the
discounting is coming in i would rather
work tomorrow than work today right
because the pain of working today is
minus alpha from my point of view today
the paint of working tomorrow is minus
alpha times Delta smaller paint smaller
game but smaller pain does that make
sense so it's precisely because of
discounting that I that I prefer to work
tomorrow if I can get away with working
tomorrow rather than working today now
that's an important point and so yeah
I'd even more prefer to work the day
after tomorrow right so what I'm doing
the analysis what I have to do of course
there's always a chance even if I have a
hundred dollars there's always a chance
that i'll run out of the hundred dollars
before i have a chance to work and what
I'd like to do is compute how likely is
this to happen right are we together but
there's a catch in order to compute how
likely this is to happen I have to know
how likely it is that you guys are going
to
so somebody could promise me whenever I
volunteered somebody would hold your
hands behind your back you couldn't
raise your hand to volunteer no problem
i might as well wait till I you know I'm
quite low on money because I'm quite
confident that when i raise my hand I'll
get a job on the other hand if every
time I raise my hand I'm sitting there
in India and a billion people are
raising their hands oops I better raise
my hands off right because the odds of
me being chosen it's not I can't
guarantee when I raise my hand I'm going
to get a job right all I guarantees i
have probability of 1 over m of getting
a job where m is the number of
competitors i have so i need to
understand this is a game theoretic
problem of what when should i raise my
hand that depends on how often other
people are raising their hands are we
together ok so i want to focus on what
are called what bar to meet the most
obvious kind of strategy with the
threshold strategy if i have the some
threshold k if i have k or more dollars
then i won't volunteer I'll more or less
assume I got enough money to last me if
I less than K dollars i'll raise my hand
does that make sense something seems to
me like the most obvious thing to do
then think of K is your comfort level I
is it reasonable to play a threshold
strategy and how does the system behave
if everyone plays the threshold strategy
that's the question I want to try to
answer now let me say that there is one
threshold strategy so I'm going to
answer this is is there a Nash
equilibrium in threshold strategies the
answer will be yes and then we're going
to try to understand what happens in
that equilibrium that's how I answer so
let me explain what I'm getting was also
I who is chosen as random okay whether
or not you raise your hand is is under
your conscious control right so are we
together that's actually very important
you decide if I say look I need some
babysitting at that point you think and
you say okay should I volunteer to
babysit your simulation so your agents
all volunteer for sure they have Lisbon
oh yeah so they're using a deterministic
strategy they could use you know I mean
there's nothing i had so i want to study
this this particular strategy so let me
point out so remember just to remind you
for those of you who
aren't familiar with us what is Nash
equilibria mean Nash equilibrium for us
is choosing a threshold strategy k such
that even if you knew everybody else's
threshold strategy you wouldn't want to
deviate because you're not going to do
better by choosing a different threshold
right that's not cool the room nobody
wants to change them ah well I went
identify threat tread thresholds and
strategies for me it the only strategies
I'm looking at I don't want to say it's
the only strategy the one could possibly
play there might very well be equilibria
using other kinds of strategies I'm just
going to focus on threshold strategy so
from so I can I actually identify a
threshold with a strategy the strategy
of volunteering precisely if you have
less money than that threshold right so
there's a one-to-one identification so
there is one trivial Nash equilibrium
which is a very good which is where
everybody uses a threshold zero using
the threshold of zero means you never
volunteer that clearly is an equilibrium
because if none of the rest of you are
going to volunteer why should I ever
volunteer I know if I volunteer you'll
happily take me I'm not going to have
any competition none of the rest of you
were volunteering right so I volunteer
for sure I'll get a job and I'll get a
dollar but what am I going to do with
about the dollar because nobody's I'm
never going to be able to spend it are
we together so clearly if nobody ever
volunteers that's an equilibrium because
if none of the rest you were going to
volunteer I would be crazy to volunteer
I would suffer the cost the baby see
that's why I need alpha to be positive
negative alpha to be negative so I don't
I don't get any happiness from
babysitting and and I'll never be able
to compensate for the pain of
babysitting because nobody will ever
babysit for me so there's a trivial equi
librium which is everybody uses a
threshold of zero that's clearly
uninteresting so the real question I
want to ask is are there non-trivial
threshold strategies and the answer is
going to be yes for n sufficiently large
especially large is like 60 or 70 and
for Delta sufficiently close to one let
me explain it turns out that there's
there's interesting mathematics here
because the distribution of money in the
system not utility money as we'll see
turns out to be critical and is
characterized by maksim in
trippy and and there is not a Nash
equilibria epsilon dash equal different
so there's a small probability you if
you deviate you might be able to do
epsilon better but we make epsilon as
small as we like but as I said there's
also a Nash equilibrium where everybody
plays 0 but that's just not interesting
ah and here is the most interesting
point for systems people this is the
Washington baby co-op sorry so I'm going
to be interested in oh great so I skin
please cancel this game come on that all
right we start out so I'm going to be
interested I'm assistant designer right
I'm a system builder I want the system
that has maximum social welfare what do
I mean by that the total social welfare
is just the total happiness of everybody
in the system what does it take to make
you happy well to be happy you want to
make sure that every time you want
babysitting done or you want work done
for you you have a token to pay for it
otherwise you'll be unhappy because you
know you'll be frustrated you want to go
out you can and equally important
there'll be somebody who's willing to
babysit for you right so we're going to
maximize social welfare if we can
guarantee that pretty much every time
somebody wants something done they'll
have a token to pay for it and they'll
be a volunteer at the other end is going
to work are we together that should be
obvious now it's clear that having too
little money in the system gives you low
social welfare so think of a system with
a thousand people in 10 tokens so that
means 990 people don't have tokens and
any one of those 999 990 no money right
then you mentioned before that 0 was
actually a magical well it's late it
zeroes in our chakra so it's a Nash
equilibrium with the total social
welfare is zero so from the point of
view of the system designer that's a
horrible Nash equilibrium because
everybody is unhappy all the time right
I mean it's an equilibrium nobody ever
said I equilibria we're good you could
be very unhappy about the equilibrium
you find yourself in it's just to buy
yourself if you do something different
you're not going to be better off that's
all that I pro Librium says ike whatever
is a fixed point it really is
mathematically it's a fixed point there
can be bad fixed points there can be
good fixed points you are necessarily
happy in equilibrium and the equilibrium
of 0 is the one with the worst social
welfare so as assistant designer I
should not want this equity brihat I
making sense because so I want an
equilibrium where people are happy want
to maximize a social welfare right so it
turns out so certainly if there's no
money in the system then everybody has a
threshold of zero because they have no
money i'm interacting as if they do
right that's not good as you pump more
money into the system social welfare and
proofs so you can certainly see at the
beginning if they're only 10 tokens in
system with a thousand people that's
clearly bad because most of time people
won't be able to pay for a job put more
money into the system Social Welfare
increases it keeps increasing it keeps
increasing till it comes to a critical
point and there's a sharp crash so we
have the babysitting co-op phenomenon
but what I'm claiming is it's that
phenomenon in a very sharp sense so the
economist said you know print more
tokens you'll be happier indeed they
were happier print more tokens you'll
keep getting happier till the magic
moment when you fall off the cliff you
fall off the fiscal cliff and then the
system grinds to a halt so it's not like
this which is what we expected it's like
that and will prove that mathematically
so turns out we can model the system as
a Markov chain I'm sorry
ah interesting question but you want to
keep putting money into the system or
something so hang on to that question so
let me wait till I get the result
because uh so first look so here's
here's the mathematics and and this is
actually fun for a few slides so yeah so
it turns out the right strategy to
follow will depend very much in the
total amount of money in the system so
the answer is yes there is a very tight
connection so that is to say even if
you're following a threshold strategy
the optimal the threshold strategy
equilibrium what that threshold is will
depend on the total amount of money in
the system so so the answer is yes if
I've understood your question right so
here's the formal mathematics and I it's
not as bad as it looks even if you don't
know Markov chains so I want to think
first of all the state of the system as
a tuple just the tuple saying how much
money everybody has right so Rama has
three dollars a ton done has five I had
to serum a 7 or Leslie has 20 he's rich
okay so it's just a big tuple I think
you have Audrey right so describing how
much money everybody has and what about
the transition so let's fix a threshold
for everybody doesn't have to be the
same and then I claim the system is
completely determined I mean it's
probabilistic but it's completely
different it's clear so what kind of
transit transitions can we have well the
only kind of transition that's possible
is I get somebody gets chosen at random
if that person has a positive amount of
money they say okay I want some
babysitting done everybody all the rest
of you are following a strategy what we
can see who's going to volunteer because
the state describes how much money
everybody has right so i can say okay if
your threshold is 3 and you have two
dollars your volunteer if you have five
you don't so i can figure out who
volunteers one of them is chosen at
random right and the transition is AI
have one less dollar the person chosen
as one more
right so it's a completely probabilistic
system once I fixed everybody strategy
are we together now the very nice thing
about this is this is a reversible
system the probability of going from
state 1 to state 2 is exactly the same
as are probably going from state to
state 1 and because of that I'll prove
that in a second because of that it's a
standard result in Markov chains that
each state is equally likely because of
the reversibility in the limit I mean
not at the very beginning but after you
run it you'll get to a steady-state
where every state is equally likely so
let me convince you that transitions are
symmetric the probability of going from
x 1 x 2 is the same as are probably
coming back what they're probably going
from s1 to s2 let's say I mean look the
only kinds of transitions we have as
well one person goes down by a dollar
and somebody else goes up and everybody
else stays the same right because I want
babysitting done you babysit for me I go
down by dollar you go up right are we
together so suppose we take that
transition where I wanted the baby
sitting in Ramah babysat for me so
what's the probability of that
transition well as the property that I
get chosen which is one over in it then
we look at everybody who volunteers
suppose n people volunteering so
probably that Rama gets chosen among the
M people so it's 1 over n times 1 over
it that's the probably the transition
well what's the property of coming back
well so probably that Rama gets chosen
which is 1 over n times the probably did
I get chasm now how many people going to
volunteer well I claim everybody who is
willing to volunteer before is still
willing to volunteer plus me because if
before I was so I claim after a little
bit amount of time nobody has more than
the threshold amount of money so suppose
my threshold is 7 so it's conceivable at
the beginning I had a hundred dollars
but I would never volunteer so I start
out with a hundred then you know I want
somebody to babysit I have 99 98 97 I
don't volunteer and come on below seven
right and once I go below 7 i'll never
go above seven right are we together so
I claim after a little bit of an initial
phase everybody's at or below their
threshold there's nobody could ever be
above the
a threshold it's conceivable initially
you were above your threshold but
eventually you'll fall below the
threshold you'll never rise above it
again right so going back to why things
are symmetric what's so before there
were MP so Ron mr. Ozols probably one
over in and now I claim that I'm chosen
was probably one of REM that means
they're in volunteers why well before
they were em volunteers including Rama
well Rama is not going to volunteer now
he wants the job done he's not going to
volunteer for himself so now that
there's M minus one of you who
volunteered before who are still going
to volunteer because if you were blow
your threshold before you're still below
and I'm going to volunteer because even
if I was at my threshold before I gave
Rama dollar and I just slipped below a
threshold so it's 1 over n times 1 over
N yep right sure sure to your you've
chosen with probably one over him if
you're one of the end people that raised
their hands so if you're below e so
whether or not your chosen doesn't
depend on how much money you have it
just depends on whether or not you raise
your hand suppose my building ah chérie
yeah I mean so your threshold is just
when you're saying I'm willing to
babysit that's the only way you're using
Farrell you can't pay for it how you can
be chosen but you can't pay for but but
look at the nice thing here Rama for
sure can be chosen because in the
transition from me to him he got a
dollar so he can be chosen and he will
be able to pay for it and I will
volunteer so we keep one over n + 1 over
m so we can come back right so just
think about it is actually an easy
argument and and so there's a standard
theorem and markov chain theory that
we're appealing to which I'm not gonna
prove that says if you have symmetric
probabilities than it's it's uniform but
i'm actually not interested in these
states I don't really care exactly how
much money Leslie has what I really care
about I want to remember what I care
about is how much competition am I going
to have when I volunteer so I want to
know not exactly how much money
everybody has but how many people are
below threshold I mean how many people
are there
who are at threshold or below threshold
I don't care what their names are I just
need to know the fractions so for the
purposes of this slide so that I already
did this so I care not about the
distribution I care about not who has
the amounts but what the distribution is
so how many people have seven dollars
how many people have eight how many
people have three right so for the for
the next few slides let's assume that
everybody is following a fixed threshold
strategy seven so I want to know how
many people are at seven and how many
people are below seven because that will
tell me exactly the number of people
below seven is exactly the fraction of
people who will raise their hands so I
don't care about the identity of the
people who have seven miles below seven
I mean you're all equal from my point of
view but I care about how many of you
there are so I'm interested now notice
that won't have a uniform distribution
it's easy to see suppose we have n
agents and are two dollars in the system
well it's conceivable that one of you
has two dollars and everybody else has
zero or the two of you have a dollar
each and everybody else of 0 which is
more likely well clearly there are any
ways to give both dollars to one agent
exactly and not just oval then and
there's n times n minus 1 over 2 and
choose two ways to give a dollar to two
different agents right this is much
bigger than this as n grows large this
is much much larger than that right and
that's an essence of what's called the
concentration phenomenon so it turns out
that in the limit I will be almost
certain so suppose I clamp the threshold
at seven okay so now I can run this
Markov chain and if n is sufficiently
large and so very large really is like
on the order of a hundred or you know 80
even you don't have to be like it a
million almost surely one distribution
will be of money will be overwhelmingly
more likely than i should say in the
neighborhood of one distribution will be
overwhelmingly more likely than any
other amount so the formal statement is
there is a distribution of money
so 130 you have six dollars a half of
you have seven dollars a sixth of you
have zero or something like that there
is one particular distribution such that
for all epsilon there is an
insufficiently large that such a bad
distribution or the distributions within
Delta of it have probably greater than 1
minus epsilon so almost surely that's
the right distribution or very close to
it as the right distribution right so
within Delta of that distribution has
probably one of my cell phone I can take
epsilon arbitrarily small right so
that's and it turns out the distribution
it has that properties the distribution
that maximizes entropy and this is
actually a proof of that I don't know
want detail i want to see if so so more
generally suppose i have end people and
and I of them have I dollars how many
ways are there of that so if everybody
is following a threshold strategy of K
so nobody is ever going to have more
than K dollars but some number of people
have zero dollars some number will have
one dollar some number 11 to dollars so
number of K dollars how likely is it
that that for a fixed tuple n0 updating
k so for right how many how likely is it
that exactly n0 people have zero dollars
exactly n1 have one dollar exactly and
to have two dollars and so on well how
many ways are there doing that well as n
factorial this is the multinomial
distribution over n 0 factorial n 1
factorial this is easy comet orcs if you
don't if you haven't seen this all
explain and afterwards I don't want to
get hung up on this this is the
generalization of you know n choose to
write and you can replace these
factorials n factorial is roughly e n
log in right so if we take logs of this
log of w's log of this will this so it's
log of n factorial minus the log of this
minus log of that minus log of that
right so we're just replacing division
by subtraction and multiplication by
addition and using the fact that that in
fact oreos roughly eat to the n log n so
log of n factorial is roughly n log in
so log of W looks like this and that
tells you that roughly w the number of
ways of having this distri
of money is so raising as a power of E
those tricky to the nhk H mu is the
entropy of the distribution mew so let
me explain so let me be a probability
distribution as a distribution on
amounts of money so it's the probability
of having i dollars as i should think of
this so if they're n people all together
and n0 people have zero dollars and one
people have one dollar and so on so n 0
plus n1 plus n2 + NK is n right am I
making sense there's this so this is
saying the probability people have I
doll is a 10 I over N and the entropy of
this distribution H of new is by
definition minus the sum of you I log
nuova this is the entropy function and
what this is saying is the probability
of having this distribution of money mew
where ni people have I dollars is e to
the n HMU so the entropy function is an
extremely accurate estimate of how many
people how many ways there are of
essentially having this distribution of
money so if you have higher entropy then
alright it's higher entry closer to 0
right i mean then that just the
distribution is much more likely than
other distributions as it goes
exponentially right so if n is
sufficiently large the distribution of
money that maximize entropy is far more
likely than any other distribution again
the formal statement involves epsilon
and deltas but what this is saying is
that if i clamp everybody at following a
threshold strategy of k i can be almost
certain i don't know who has seven
dollars and who has six dollars new has
three dollars but i know what fraction
of people have seven dollars what
fraction of people have six dollars and
so on and i'm almost certain i can bet
large amounts of money on this and that
tells me i know if everybody else is
following a threshold strategy of seven
I know how likely it is that i will get
chosen when i raise my hand because i
know what my competition is like I know
how many other people will raise their
heads so the only way i'm using its
distribution of money is to figure out
okay how many people going to raise
their hands well
you're going to raise your hand if you
have less than K dollars if everybody
else is so what this is saying is if I
knew that everybody else was following a
threshold strategy of K what I do is
noise right if there's a hundred people
I can change my mind it's not going to
affect this this calculation I'm just
noise in the system I can figure out my
best response alright so now it's just
mathematics I know the probability if
everybody else is following the
threshold stretch of seven I know how
likely it isn't any given round how many
people going to raise their hands so I
have to think should i raise my hand so
I'm sitting here what's my right
threshold you know am i if everyone else
is following the seven can I get away
with having five dollars or maybe I
should have 20 right because I can
figure out exactly how likely it is if I
don't raise my hand how likely it is
that I'm going to run out of money
because I know precisely what my
competition is going to be like it's you
know now it's a straightforward
probabilistic calculation and once I
figure out how likely it is that I'll
run out of money i can say well should i
raise my hand now should I wake the next
step you know am I am i okay waiting
right so this is becomes a purely
promise of calculation now there's
another very nice fact so let's get some
intuition so suppose I've clamped
everybody else at k using the
calculation here which I you know I'm
going into detail but I hope you're
convinced I can figure out my best
response so if you're all falling at
threshold strategy at seven I can figure
out what I ought to be doing by not what
I really would hope is my best
trousseaus all the rest of you are
following the threshold strategy of
seven if my best response is seven I've
just discovered a fixed point that's an
equilibrium if the best response to K is
playing k then we just magically found
an equilibrium strategy is then if
everybody plays k your best responding
to everybody else right if the best
response ever to find K is something
other than k then you're not at a fixed
point you need to look some more to find
an equilibrium but now let's let's get
some intuition so don't read this let's
let's just think intuitively suppose my
best response to everybody playing a
threshold strategy of seven is let's say
playing Tim now what happens if I change
all of you instead of playing a
threshold strategy of seven you played
Oh strategy nine I raise your threshold
what should that effect beyond me none
should I lower my threshold sure I
raised my threshold so if all the rest
you raise your threshold and detect this
intuitively should I what should i do in
response what do you think will happen
to my best response if all of you are
using a higher threshold any intuition
so what's the effect of you using a
higher threshold do I have more
competition or less competition more
because if you're using a higher threat
remember if your threshold is 9 you will
volunteer as long as you have less than
nine dollars if your threshold is 7
you're going to volunteer only if you
have less than seven dollars so you're
actually more likely that you'll
volunteer more often and therefore I
should increase my threshold that's
exactly right so the intuition is if so
if suppose magically I could force all
of you to follow a threshold of seven
and I can figure out my best responses I
don't know Tim now I could change it I'm
going to force all of you to follow
threshold strategy of nine I've just
forced you all to raise your threshold
keeping the total amount of money fixed
so now it turns out with their higher
threshold you volunteer more off because
your volunteer you have less than nine
dollars which will happen intuitively
more often if you have less than seven
doll if you're going to volunteer more
often oops I'm going to have more
competition I better volunteer more
often right because I'm less likely to
be chosen if you guys volunteer I should
be more conservative so if I raise
everybody else's threshold I should
raise my threshold so the this lemma is
saying the best reply function is
monotone so what I mean by that is think
of a function that says what's my best
reply if everybody else is following a
strategy of case a lot F of K be my best
reply if everybody else is fixed to
following a strategy of K and I claim
that function f is monotone it's
increasing if I increase K I increase my
function now there's a theorem that
actually goes back to a logician tarski
this says a monotone increasing function
has a fixed point
so the way to figure this out so
technically now I have to allow some
randomization so I want to say i want to
allow agents not only to have the
threshold of seven and eight i want a
lot with threshold of seven and a half
and what i mean by a threshold with
seven and a half is you randomize
between seven and eight okay but I claim
that that I can now figure out it
follows from a theorem of tarski what I
do is I start out at that so there's a
fixed amount of money this is only one
thousand dollars so that highest
threshold you could possibly have as a
thousand and and then I work my way down
and I can find the fixed point right I
look the best respite to a thousand is
the best reply to a thousand is you know
950 that I play 950 look at the best
reply to that and I keep going down and
and it'll stabilize I'll be a fix point
oh and what you can show so in general
the only fix point is zero but but we
control that if Delta sufficiently close
to one there there's guaranteed to be a
fixed point that's greater than zero and
that's the Nash equilibria so and now
the reason it's not as an epsilon here
so it's not really a best reply it's an
epsilon best reply it's because you're
not maximum entropy is an extremely
accurate I mean almost surely the
distribution everybody else is following
is maximum entropy but it's not one
hundred percent guaranteed that
everybody else is following the maximum
entropy distribution so there's a little
fudge factor here of epsilon but epsilon
as n increases epsilon gets smaller and
smaller because the problem with the
sure sure the certainty that I have they
were following maximum entropy gets
closer and closer to one is n as n gets
larger and my certainty is pretty high
already by the time and is about 80 I
mean we're not talking about big values
again ok so the consequences of
monotonicity is that there exists a
greatest and least fixed point and we
can find that equilibrium we can flip
the fixed point is neuqua librium by
iterating so you start out at the best
strategy and look at the response to
everybody using the highest threshold
and work their way down and the line
were the best response function where f
of k equals k the best response that to
everybody else playing k is i play k so
this is the line x equals y so it's when
this crosses the line and we can show it
actually does cross the lunch so there's
a bit of mathematics I'm hiding here and
and there could be more than one fixed
point if it crosses the line several
times they'll be every time of processes
so it definitely hits zero and we can
show that that if Delta's sufficiently
close to one at some point it comes on
this side of the line so it could be
that it goes like this but it can also
happen we can show in general there
might be several fixed points so it's
here the fact that I mean if I only
looked at the sweet points that might
sort of jump over and I want to say look
at some point it actually hits the line
so I mean basically the way the theorem
goes is we show that initially you're
below the line and at some point you
have to be above the line so i want to
say by continuity you cross the line but
of course if I only allow discrete
strategies it could be they could jump
over the line right so I want to allow
strategies like a threshold strategy of
seven and a half by just mixing between
seven ornate and that turns out to be
the fixed point so okay so now we know
there's a threshold in in in peds so
there's an equilibrium threshold
strategies and now your assistant
designer you're building a peer-to-peer
system where you're using this kind of
tokens you're building scripts design
and it's like lots of systems folks have
done this so this is not a theoretical
question so now the right question to
ask is look I want people to be as happy
as possible i'm an assistant designer
how much money should i put in the
system so it turns out and as we've seen
from the Washington babies in cough
example too little is bad too much money
as bad what's the sweet spot in the
middle as we want to understand and so
it turns out and follows from art this
theorem I mean I haven't shown you the
details all that matters is the average
amount of money per person in the system
right so the behavior of the system if
there are 300 tokens and a hundred
people and 3,000 tokens and a thousand
people so the average amount three
tokens per person is identical it's the
average that you know the number of
tokens per person that matters that's
the key I mean with with a thousand
people you're going to get close to a
maximum entropy it's the epsilon is
smaller but but the qualitative behavior
is identical
by the time you get past the hundred
it's indistinguishable for the human I
draw the graphs right and so this is the
cliff behavior I was talking about so
you start out with zero dollars in the
system that's bad you increase the
number so fix the number of agents right
so by increasing number of dollars and
system you're increasing the average
amount per person things get better and
better and better and better tell you
crash Oh social welfare is the total
happiness in the system so the total
happiness is just the sum of the
happiness of each person and when are
you happy you're happy if the more the
more your requests are satisfied the
happier you are so look I'm an assistant
designer I really wanted to be the cases
one you have sorry oh I see so here we
actually fix the number of people in the
system and we fix the parameters so we
fixed the Delta so that we could
actually so that so these are actual
numbers but qualitatively this
phenomenon of there being a cliff is
independent of our choice of numbers
right so these numbers were four he
ended these experiments so this is
simulations right and in the simulations
we just fix all the parameters but the
important thing is here again the
intuition I hope is clear that as you
pop if with very little money in the
system does lots of unhappiness because
I want a job done and I don't have any
money to pay for right as you pump more
money into the system it's more and more
likely that one I want a job done I'll
have money to pay for now what happens
when you fall off the cliff you get to
this magic moment where everybody has
lots of money but they feel no need to
work and that's when you fall off the
cliff so now everybody has you know 10
tokens per person and now nobody wants
to work as they figure 10 tokens that's
plenty I'm over threshold so what's
happening is you punk more money to the
system it turns out that the threshold
decreases this was probably your
question Rama the the the right
threshold goes down because you know
money is easier to get you don't have to
work as hard the more money you pump
into the system again fixing the number
of people what let's think about it into
the more money you pump into the system
the less the more like it is the people
are going to be at threshold so you're
going to have less competition when you
volunteer so you have to set a lower
threshold so Wallace what happens as you
pump more money in the system the
threshold goes down the threshold goes
down the average amount of money per
person goes up and then it turns out
what happens the cliff the cliff happens
when the threshold equals the average
amount of money per person so think
about this so suppose my threshold of
seven and the average amount of money
per person 27 think about the behavior
of the system well I don't care what
state i started so it could be at the
beginning some people have a hundred
dollars some people of zero so clearly
the threshold of seven the people with
zero dollars are going to work they're
going to raise their hands but very
quickly the people with 100 are going to
come down because they're not going to
work that I have less than seven the
people of zero are going to come up and
very quickly will get the point where
everybody has seven and then the system
will grind to a halt because the
threshold to 70 everybody's got seven
dollars nobody works anymore that's so
when I say there's a crash I mean in
steady state there's a crash is at the
beginning you know you can have lots of
you know you could have people 20 people
with 100 but very quickly everybody will
come to the threshold are we together so
that's that's what's going on here to us
that the crash was surprising i mean we
expected something more you know smooth
now what does this say to assistant
designer well it says well gee you ought
to sort of get as close as you can to
the cliff but but be careful because
maybe not everybody is rational but now
love to look at the more interesting
question what if you have a dynamic
system going to start talking about
inflation you have more people entering
the system well remember i said all that
matters the average amount of money per
person so what do you want to do if the
system doubles in size you basically you
want to keep everybody at having you
know let's suppose K is 10 I mean
suppose that the right threshold is a
sort of the sweet spot here is 10 no
here was six and a half doesn't matter
so with a thousand people I had it you
know I had 10,000 I had let's say six
and a half thousand tokens in the system
it was just right everybody was happy
because
the average of six and a half that was
good now the system is doubled in size
and now all of a sudden the average
amount of money is you know not six and
a half to three and a quarter bad so
what do I do well what i could do is
just every time somebody enters the
system imagine a growing peer-to-peer
system i could give them six and a half
dollars why is that not such a good idea
this is the real world now why don't in
a large peer-to-peer system I don't want
to start everybody off the six and a
half dollar so what's going to happen
eyes are all too busy verifying systems
you want to think about the real world
so suppose I give you six and a half
dollars when you enter the system what
are you going to do you don't care about
it when you leave I mean the money is
meaningless outside this is not real
money these are tokens right so they
have no value outside the system sorry
yeah well I mean what song I'm keeping
away here but what are you gonna do
you're gonna enter the system with your
six and half pause what are you gonna do
yes it's called the simple problem I'm
going to spend my six and a half dollars
then my twin brother is going to come
into the system right I create a clone
get six and a half dollars spins at all
leaves and i'll have it you know i have
another sibling who comes into the
system right i create new identities
every time so the last thing you want to
do is give everybody six and a half
dollars or whatever the right average
amount is because you're going to get so
you do want to keep the average amount
of money constant but what we suggest is
really the right thing to do is just
give everybody let's say you went from
1000 to 2000 give everybody and this
isn't twice as much money so somebody
coming in get zero if you're already in
and you had ten dollars now you have 20
that keeps the average just right and of
course the people come in with zero will
have to work a little bit but now you
have inflation effectively right that or
equivalently you could you know either
you could just double the amount of
money that everybody has or you could
have the price of a job that would have
exactly the same effect because all I
really care about is how many you know
how many units of work do you have per
person right if the it's not the average
amount of money that matters is the
average amount of
jobs you can pay for per person that
really matters right am i making sense
so that's one issue now it turns out of
course in the real world not everybody
is rational so although I tell you that
look these tokens they have no value
outside the system there's no point in
stuffing them under your mattress they
you know tokens are not equal to
happiness they can be used to buy
happiness but you know if you have a
discounting factor there's no point
collecting the tokens but nevertheless
there will be people who are hoarders
right we just you know the real world
are such people no matter what you tell
them they don't listen right well it
might be irrational but it's common this
affected this has the effect of removing
money from the system so if your
assistant designer and you understand a
ten percent of your community or orders
you should increase the money supply to
take that into account and now another
your question suppose we have some all
choice people are really to work I love
babies and your kids right so basically
these are people who work for free right
at roughly speaking so if you think of
orders is taking money out of the system
you can think of altruist is adding
money to the system right because they
don't require money to work now it turns
out because the system with office
essentially behaves like why don't have
to pay you you know you're willing to
work for nothing so it's as if there was
more money in the system because I
effectively I can do more jobs with the
same again more jobs done with the same
amount of money right so it turns out
having a few altruist makes everybody
better off but too many actually makes
us or self so any intuition for that I
didn't say that so this is 0 so I have
to be careful this isn't our more
general setting when there's some
probability that you know you love
babysitting my kids but this week and
you're really busy and you can't alright
so imagine there's some probability that
you just can't work right so you're
right if the probability that you'd be
able to work is one which is that is
that the model I head up to the slide
but right but but but the more
because right a lot of entries and he's
one of them yeah ah but I didn't say
there were lots of ultras I said a few
altruists make everybody better off more
make us worse off than a whole lot would
make us better off so we get this kind
of behavior your intuition is not bad
but I point out there's there's this bad
any intuition why would that be bad and
can anybody think of why that might not
be such a good thing for social welfare
so what do you think would be the effect
on me by the way this you know this is
like refereeing why should I referee
because other people you know if there's
enough suckers out there who are free
then maybe I don't have to referee
review the paper these are these are
real world phenomenon I mean you want to
say you know how many people are there
out there willing to contribute to NPR
right so maybe I don't have to do it so
does anybody can anybody give me any
intuition for this this drop what do you
why do you think that happens so again
it's important that obviously if there's
lots and lots of altruist seeeeee then
no problem then whenever I want
something that just as you said there's
always somebody there to do it for me
but here in the neighborhood of well I
decide it's not worth working because
when I want something done there's a
good chance that they'll be somebody out
there to do it for me but it's not
guaranteed so what happens in this
regime is people basically don't work
under the you know counting on the
altruist but the altruist aren't always
there so the total social ever actually
goes down and we've done this by
simulation but that's that's the
explanation of it so with a few altruist
just basically everybody's better off
but this is is because people just
stopped working I mean the fact of a few
ottawa's really doesn't stop you from
working very much a lot of ultras you
say I mean and a whole lot you really
don't have to work as really is always
going to be somebody there but this in
between areas not so good that's true
we're assuming that and and so i should
say even more we assume for our results
that the money supply was constant but
of course what this is telling us is as
a system so if you're an assistant that
grows rapidly the money supply will
increase and so all of our results stop
holding in very dynamic system
I mean so there's a disconnect so let me
explain the disconnect so all our
theorems where I said look there's a
threshold okay that's neck librium blah
blah blah all that was assuming the
system is completely stable right and
particular the money supply doesn't
change now this does well if this Steve
if the number of people in the system
doubles you don't want to keep the money
supply stable you want to double the
amount of money in the system right so
if I knew there were a bunch of people
coming into the system I might behave
differently so we sort of have to assume
the people are blindly going on doing
what they were doing before ignoring the
possibility of a major shock to the
system which you know i mean the sum of
that phenomenon the real world although
when you get news reports of you know
there's about to be a devaluation of
currency right so that you get this
phenomenon where we're currencies in
trouble and things are fairly stable at
the point where everybody starts
worrying that there's going to be a
major devaluation you get a huge change
right so that's this phenomenon so one
more comment symbols are not then I'll
stop so so I said that even if so agents
entered the system was zero so we
stopped that prevents the obvious
problem with Sybil's that I come in with
no I I come in may spend my six and a
half dollars leave the system bringing
my twin brother and so on so starting
with zero clearly prevents that problem
but there's other problems because
suppose I come in with ten siblings I
mean they're all virtual so they're all
me right now whenever I need a job done
I and all my siblings raise our hands
and of course you can't tell that these
are clones of me so if I'm the only one
with siblings only one with civils then
my probability of getting chosen has
just increased dramatically are we
together right so this is assuming that
if one of my siblings gets chosen this
as if I'm chosen and the fact that they
get a dollar means i'm getting a dollar
right so under that assumption then um
you could imagine that that all of a
sudden we have a war where I bring in my
Sybil's I get a small advantage for a
little while then you guys all figure
out that I'm bringing in symbols and you
start to bring in your symbols of course
if everybody has five symbols it's a
wash right you only gain if you have
siblings and nobody else
does right so and it turns out that that
Sybil's they're diminishing returns
right having one civil helps a lot to
civil helps last three symbols helps
less so we feel that that if there's a
small cost of joining the system just
enough to prevent you from having
Sybil's that's probably the right thing
to do but these are all system z
questions right that we have some other
results other papers and sort of
inferring is when I say agent type so I
mean your type II is characterized by
the values of these parameters how
willing are you to work how likely are
you to get chosen how likely is it that
you won't be able to work so we have
five parameters not tupelo five numbers
characterized as an agent type and we
assume if we have a system of different
types it turns out at that point it's
not maximum entropy that characterizes
what's going on but the concept which is
a generalization of Mac cementery called
relative entropy or cross entropy and
and we have different types will have
different amounts of wealth it turns out
and and you might as a company be
interested in a script system of sort
learning something about how many agents
there are of each type for example if
you're doing advertising you might want
to know something about the kind of
people in your system so it turns out we
have results of being able to infer
agent types from the empirical
distribution of wealth the different
types will have different amounts of
money and we've studied how the system
involves under best reply dynamics you
converge to an equilibrium so we've done
various other results let me just
mention one other result and and which
is that we've sort of learned so it
turns out in economics everybody looks
at nash equilibria i personally have
doubts about Nash equilibrium but you
can ask the question how will a system
converge to nash equilibria and in this
setting you can imagine what people
learn the right thing to do and that
actually makes sense so suppose you have
a thousand people in the system they've
all learnt the right thing to do now
you're coming into the system nobody's
telling you what you should set your
threshold at how are you going to figure
out what to set your threshold then well
you can experiment let me try threshold
27 see how I do let me try eight nine
ten and you know after some
experimentation will converge the right
answer and that works fine as long as
the number of new entrants in the system
is small relative to total number of
people in the system but suppose the
system overnight doubles from a thousand
to two thousand
so now you've got a thousand people
experimenting with different thresholds
there's absolutely no reason to believe
you're going to converge to anything
interesting that right so if a thousand
p you're one person experimenting your
noise everybody else is playing the
threshold of seven well very quickly
you'll learn out seven is the right
thing right but if everybody is
experimenting you the information you're
getting is all over the map right and
and so we looked at what it would take
to get convergence in the system and it
throws out that getting systems to
converge tecmo librium is non-trivial we
provide an algorithm that provided
everybody follows it will guarantee
conversions in large anonymous systems
where everybody or all that matters is
the fraction of people doing various
things rather than exactly who's doing
them that's what I mean by it or not in
the system so there's all other blind of
research there but let me stop and and
you know so what's going on here that
we've looked at scrim systems I claim
that script systems really do arise in a
lot of real-world systems and one
interesting question which was the one
that an undone raised at the beginning
which is look we've assumed that there's
a constant price for a job well except
for the fact that it might change when a
thousand more people enter the system
but but they're long stable periods that
in particular is no bidding for a job
now bidding for a job would totally
change our results I don't think we'd
have this cliff anymore right because
what would happen is people got more and
more money well then the price of a job
would go up you get inflation as you'd
expect right you get standard economic
phenomenon so why don't we do that well
I claim in the real world there are lots
of good reasons not to have auctions
right at least in the US when you go to
a supermarket there's not an auction for
tomatoes right there's a fixed price
posted for tomatoes and nobody's
bargaining now that price might change
you know day to day right and even in
some places they might lower the price
if you know they don't want the tomatoes
to spoil they're not going to sell the
same tomatoes tomorrow so maybe in some
places at eleven o'clock at night
they'll have a sudden sale on tomatoes
right if they're going to close the
store at midnight but by and large is
fixed prices and people don't go at
least I mean and I understand so here in
the market I bet there are things you
bargained for and they're things you
don't bargain for more or less right so
my sense is and and I think there are
theorems that can be
proved that if you have large markets
that is you have lots and lots of
customers it actually the overhead of
bargaining isn't worth it and you might
as well have a fix price are more or
less with a large number of customers
it's as if you had a fixed price anyway
because you'll quickly converts to an
equilibrium I think if you have smaller
markets then it actually makes sense to
have bargaining so it's more in a
technical economic sense it's more
efficient nice because little monkey
business right so they probably can't
lower the place anyhow well well I mean
but again you might certainly imagine
that towards the end of the day those
tomatoes are going to rot I mean they
can't sell the same tomatoes tomorrow so
whatever their margin is they would be
better off selling them but yeah you can
bargain a lot better but in the u.s. you
can't and why because I think they don't
want to introduce the concept of
bargaining because exactly cuz they
don't want you to bargain in the middle
of the day right by the time you start
bargaining at the end of the day you
might start thinking well maybe I can
bargain at three o'clock in the
afternoon to write artificially yeah but
but is art it's artificial but they're
good economic reasons for it's not that
the grocery store owners are stupid and
saying you know they would be more
efficient if they could just have
bargaining at eleven o'clock at night
right I mean efficient the sense of
increasing their profit but they don't
and it's not because they're stupid so
I'm claiming that that there is an
overhead to you know definitely
employers like fixed prices so I think
there's some interesting research to be
done which I want to be honest I haven't
done yet in when does that make sense to
have auctions and when doesn't right but
here with fixed prices maximum entropy
and the monotonicity the best reply
function turned to be the keys to
showing that there exists the equilibria
and also so we could prove we proved by
simulation that we had the cliff but we
can actually prove it analytically as
well right so it's not just a simulation
result it follows from using the mac
symmetric properties and and what this
is saying 422 assistant designer that
you really need to be careful about
managing the amount of money in the
system and there's this cliff phenomenon
you and apparently is when i said this
happened in second life that they had
injected too much money the system mash
off the cliff and they have to sort of
figure out ways of dealing with that so
this phenomenon is a real phenomenon and
I've talked about the system designers
they say yes we actually we've
experienced this so these are small
system I clift in the sense of
social yes yes but but there's something
like that yeah so what happened is when
you have too much running the system the
system grinds to a halt I said I mean
right i mean the social welfare is zero
because nobody's doing anything so it's
not just some abstract notion of social
welfare this is a real you know real
world phenomenon where you know nobody
wants to babysit anymore right so so
that this is real stuff and to the
extent and as I said at the beginning
there's a bunch of people who are using
script style systems scripts I'll
systems in real systems to the extent
that you're thinking about using this
and you don't have auctions right
because I mean I think it's different
results with options these are these are
things that you want to be thinking
about you know how much money exactly I
pump in the system and and again
everything I said was for rational
players but my sense so I think there's
this whole phenomenon that of course
game theorists have never looked at but
my guess is there will be like two or
three standard kinds of irrationality
like hoarders and altruist seeeeee and
and as assistant designer you want to
understand you know what kinds of
irrationality what I've looked at all
these new people you don't understand at
all but this is like you're a teacher
and and you don't just want to know what
the right answer is you want to know the
two or three standard wrong answers so
that you can teach your class so as to
you know explain to people who are
misunderstanding in one of the two or
three standard ways you know you can be
a better teacher if you understand not
just the right answer but the standard
wrong answers so here I'm claiming you
could be a better system designer if you
understand not just rational behavior
but the two or three standard or
rationalities and then there'll be other
totally weird people who hell knows what
they're going to do we can't account for
that but ok let me stop so I won't abuse
your time too much are there any
questions besides going once twice ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
