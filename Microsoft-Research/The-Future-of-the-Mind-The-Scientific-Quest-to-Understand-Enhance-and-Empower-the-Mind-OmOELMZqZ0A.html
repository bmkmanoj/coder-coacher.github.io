hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
okay it's an honor today to have Michio
Kaku visiting us yeah Michio holds the
Henry samat chair and professorship in
theoretical physics at the City College
of New York the famous alma mater where
my father attended back in the in the
1940s he's taught there for 25 years he
did his undergraduate degree at Harvard
and his PhD work at UC Berkeley and his
long pursued that the grand quest set up
by Einstein and others to unite the
fundamental forces of nature the strong
force we set malta the strong force the
weak force gravity and electromagnetism
into a single grand unified theory of
everything and he's co-founder of an
attempt to do that called string field
theory his theoretical physics research
has spanned topics including string
theory supergravity supersymmetry
hadronic physics and he did about 70
technical articles and several text
books in his own field in physics he's
also of course as you all know devoted
substantial effort and creativity to
communicating his excitement about
science and implications of science to
lay audiences authoring a number of
well-known books including bestsellers
hyperspace the physics of the impossible
and the physics of the future and beyond
those books he's written for popular
science publications like discover wired
in the New Scientist he's hosted TV
specials for BBC discovery channel The
History Channel and the Science Channel
and has a couple of fun radio shows
science fantastic and explorations in
science that you can listen to weekly or
I think sometimes when you have time
they hear he's been off so I what I
found in researching some of his bio
I've been very active I didn't even
follow some of this in science and
society with activities and efforts on
nuclear weapons and their danger global
warming and other challenges we face
moving forward he's here today talk
about his latest book released just a
couple weeks back called the future of
the mind on the sign
the quest understands enhance and
empower the mind this topic resonates
with many of us deeply here at Microsoft
Research for many of us it's the mind
that's the big frontier and the big
challenge for understanding as big as
any Big Bang ever was so let me invite
meet you up
well after such a great introduction I
can't wait to hear the speaker myself
and first time also let me say that
sometimes all these accolades can
backfire i recently new york magazine
voted me as one of the 100 smartest
people in new york and i thought wow
what an honor later however i have to
confess later I found out that Madonna
also made that same list and they told
me that next year lady gaga is going to
push me off the list entirely what can I
say well today I'm going to talk about
the future the future of the mine and of
course it's very dangerous to talk about
the future let me quote from that great
philosopher of the Western world Yogi
Berra Yogi Berra once said quote
prediction is awfully hard to do
especially if it's about the future well
I'm a physicist we can predict the
evolution of the universe billions of
years from now so let me quote from that
other great philosopher of the Western
world Woody Allen Woody Allen said quote
eternity is an awful long time
especially toward the end
well I'm a physicist what is the
physicists do well we invented the
transistor we invented the laser we have
to assemble the first computer and the
internet we wrote the world wide web and
along the way we also invented
television we invented radio radar
microwaves and don't forget we helped to
create the space program and the GPS
system and we physicists love to make
predictions when we help to assemble the
internet when physicists predicted that
the internet would become a forum of
high culture high art and high society
well today we know they're five percent
of the Internet is pornography but
that's because teenage boys log on to
the internet just wait until the
grandmas and grandpas log on to the
internet then fifty percent of the
internet will be pranathi now before we
begin a discussion of what sits on your
shoulders something that weighs three
pounds and is the most complex object in
the universe before begin a discussion
you may be saying to yourself well
what's the difference between businesses
the chemist well let me tell you a
little story during World War two the
Nazis captured a group of American
scientists and call them spies and they
were going to be executed by firing
squad so they put up the a geologist a
physicist and a chemist about to be
fired away by execution well they aimed
the rifles at the geologist and the
geologist suddenly said earthquake
earthquake well in the chaos the
geologists snuck away an escape well now
it was the physicist time to have him
shot so the Nazis raised their rifles at
the physicist and then the physicist
said lightning lightning and again chaos
everyone ran off and the physicist
escaped and now it was the chemist term
they turned their rifles at the chemist
and the chemist said fire
now we're going to talk about the brain
today and if we were to duplicate the
brain using hardware computer hardware
it would occupy a city block a city
block of blue jean computer some of the
most advanced on the earth the energy
consumption would be that of a nuclear
power plant a gigawatt of power and it
would take a river a river to cool it
down and your brain however only
consumes 20 watts of power so when
someone calls you a dim bulb that is a
compliment and your brain doesn't
require a nuclear power plant to
energize it just a few hamburgers so how
is it possible and now because of modern
physics we've learned more in the last
five to ten years than in all of human
history you know when I was a kid I used
to love reading science fiction I read
about telepathy that is reading minds I
read about telekinesis moving objects
with the mind i read about recording
memories I read about photographing
dreams however I tried very hard to read
people's minds and I finally came to the
conclusion that maybe telepaths do exist
but I wasn't one of them well today we
can do all of the above I will show you
how we photograph thoughts photograph
dreams one day you will push the play
button and see the dream you had the
previous night I will show you how we
can record memories about how we can
move objects with the mind and read
minds all this because of advanced
physics just in the last five to ten
years and this is my previous book and
New York Times bestseller they used to
say that the word physics would never
ever enter the New York Times bestseller
list I did it not once but twice
physics of the impossible goes not just
50 years into the future it goes 500
years into the future but we might have
starships we might have teleportation we
might even have pine machines and in
this book I answer the question
according to Einstein's theory is it
possible to go backwards in time and
meet your teenage mother before you're
born and she falls in love with you well
if your teenage mother falls in love
with you before you're born you're in
deep doo-doo if that happens well
there's a lot of interest in the mine
because I'm proud to announce a my book
the future of the mind is now number
four on both the Barnes &amp;amp; Noble and the
amazon list of best sellers in the
United States so it's already and it's
only been out for one week so the two
greatest mysteries in the universe one
of them is the origin of the universe
which is what I do for a living I'm the
co-founder of string field theory and
one day we hope that string theory will
answer the question why did we have a
big bang anyway the other great mystery
is what cysts on your shoulders the most
complex object known to science for the
first time in history now revealing his
innermost secrets and you probably heard
President Barack Obama in last year's
State of the Union address shocked the
scientific community by announcing the
brain initiative you realize that the
Human Genome Project it only cost three
billion dollars in map all the genes of
our body and it has opened up huge areas
of genetics and medicine the next big
project already devoted a billion
dollars on the European Union at the
United States government into this
project is the brain project to create a
map a map of every single neuron in your
body which means that one day we will
understand mental illness one of the
greatest afflictions of humanity and
perhaps even create not just a disc of
the genome but a disc containing your
connectome every single neuron all your
memories your desires your hopes dreams
encoded in a
and if you have your genome and you
connect home on two discs and you put
them together then you may even have in
some sense a form of immortality this
raises theological ethical religious
questions who are you anyway if you die
but your genome survives and we can
revive your body anytime if we can bring
back your consciousness at any time then
did you really die this raises all sorts
of questions about who are we are we
nothing but information so when I was a
kid I used to try to read people's
thoughts I would concentrate real hard
to see whether or not I could be a
telepath like we see in science fiction
ultimately I realize that all this is
bunk without physics you cannot read the
mine and then there is a movie The
Matrix where reality itself is nothing
but an uploaded software program
everything you see around you is fake
this is the matrix in fact let me ask
you a question late at night just before
you go to sleep have you ever had that
weird bizarre thought that maybe the
matrix is right maybe the reality you
see is an illusion maybe it's a software
program maybe you are the only one
that's really real ever had that thought
late at night and maybe it's all a test
to see whether you're smart enough to
figure it out that everything you see is
nothing but an uploaded memory and we
had that I did raise your hand if you
ever had that feeling you're crazy
give me a break you think you're the
only one in the universe I'm the only
one in the universe I'm in bed right now
I'm just about to go to sleep you are
nothing but an uploaded memory now is
that possible I would show the answer is
yes last year the first memory was
successfully uploaded into a brain I'll
talk about that something that happened
just last year and then here's the
former governor of California that's
what happens when you have a marriage
uploaded into your memory his marriage
with Sharon Stone was uploaded into his
memory and there he is okay reacting to
that in fact if you saw the movies very
clever movie throughout the entire movie
Arnold Schwarzenegger gives the good guy
you identified with him he's a good guy
battling the bad guys then at the very
end of the movie you find out that he's
really the bad guy with all the good guy
memories implanted into his mind this is
the only movie I'm aware of in which the
hero and the villain are the same people
and then what about exoskeletons believe
it or not the United States Pentagon is
dumping tens of millions of dollars to
connect the mind to mechanical arms legs
of complete exoskeleton my colleague
Stephen Hawking the great cosmologists
he now has lost control over all his
bodily functions except his mind we have
now connected his mind to a laptop next
time you see him on television look at
his right frame of his glasses there's a
chip and an antenna that picks up waves
from his brain decodes it and allows him
to communicate with the world and so
we're talking about brain machine
interface one of the hottest fields now
in neurology and then people say well
where do we have robots where'd where's
my robot made where's my robot Butler
well artificial intelligence turned out
to be harder than we thought but what
about surrogates avatars they use a
human brain wired up to control a
perfect body
cars you are placed in a pod and you
control the motions of an organism a
living person or maybe even a robot
surrogates already exist and the
question is is this the future of the
space program when we send into outer
space robots robots that are cheap they
don't bellyache they don't complain they
don't nag and they don't have to come
back controlled by astronauts sitting in
their living room mentally communicating
with their surrogate and then
telekinesis telekinesis the power to
move objects with the mind this is the
movie Carrie where a young girl who's
telekinetic was abused by all her
classmates so in the final scene of the
movie she destroys the entire high
school what's the lesson here the lesson
here is never bring a telekinetic to the
senior prom and then in the latest
Superman movie maybe you've seen it
every child knows that Superman's father
and mother died when crept I'm blew up
but not in the latest Superman movie
Russell Crowe here play superman's
father he's a hologram energized by a
software program that has memorized all
of the memory circuits the personality
quirks of the father the father comes
back to life to talk to his son beyond
the grave one day perhaps your great
great great great great great grandkids
will go to a library a library of souls
and have a conversation with you because
your memories your personalities or your
clerks are all encoded in the hologram
that you can bring to life by simply
pushing the play button and then the
question is asked in Star Trek asked by
Isaac Asimov can the mind exists outside
of the body it was Descartes who said
that I think therefore I am therefore
the mind is different from the body
that's called dualism recently however
people say that's a bunch of nonsense
the mind is nothing but software running
on wetware called the brain that's all
it is it's one and this
same thing but now we realize they could
be different this goes back all the way
back to the Middle Ages we may have the
ability to put your consciousness on a
connectome and send it into outer space
this is the dream of Isaac Asimov
sending pure consciousness into outer
space at the speed of light no booster
rockets no movies like gravity anymore
no accidents pure thought on a laser
beam shot at the speed of light
throughout the universe that could
ultimately be the destiny of Homo
sapiens but let's get back down to earth
that's Hollywood now let's talk about
reality first of all MRI scans allow us
to look at energy flows blood flows in
the living brain on the left for example
is the brain when it tells the truth not
much happens on the right is a brain
when it tells a lie yes when it tells a
liar first you have to know the truth
then you have to create the line then
you have to calculate the consistency of
the light with all the lies you've been
telling all these years that's a lot of
brain power your brain lights up like a
Christmas tree and so we can now see
thoughts ricocheting across the brain
like a ping-pong ball and we can now
reexamine Freudian psychology old wives
tales we can now see what's true and
what's not for example the brain the
brain is a Museum of all the stages of
its previous evolution starting with the
back the back of your brain is the
reptilian brain the ancient part of your
brain if you have whiplash after an
automobile accident you will lose your
sense of balance appetite basic
reptilian instincts are encoded in the
back when you're born as a baby your
brain grows in the forward direction
mimicking evolution of the last few
hundred million years so the growth of a
baby's brain mimics art evolutionary
past as the brain goes forward we get
the monkey brain the mammalian brain the
brain of emotions the brain that
calculates your relationship to
the monkeys and then at the very front
is the prefrontal cortex the thinking
brain the human brain and now we can see
whether or not old wives tales are
correct for those of you who have
children you have always suspected that
your teenage kids have brain damage well
it's true we can actually show that the
prefrontal cortex right behind your
forehead that's where you are located
every wonder where you are you are
located right behind your forehead that
is not fully formed in teenagers just as
many parents have always suspected
another old wives tale that when a man
sees a pretty girl he starts to act
stupid true you can actually see the
blood flow drains from the prefrontal
cortex of a man when he talks to a
pretty girl and he starts to act
retarded absolutely true this is
verified just last year by looking at
the brain scans of college kids
absolutely true and so these old wives
tales can now be cannot be verified now
if i were to slice the brain
horizontally now you would see the motor
cortex and you can actually put
electrodes on the surface of the exposed
brain the brain has no sense organs the
brain does not feel pain you can remove
the skull and you don't feel a thing and
then when you touch this part of the
brain your left side starts to move you
touch this part of the brain and this
part of the brain starts to move and you
can cut the link between the left and
the right brains for epileptics the two
halves ricochet off each other creating
positive feedback that is potentially
fatal causing convulsions so doctors
have to cut the link and then some
bizarre things begin to happen in a
person's brain that is cut in half two
personalities begin to emerge different
personalities begin to emerge and each
of them try to control the hand you can
literally struggle with the other part
of the brain for control of your organs
just like in the movie dr. Strangelove
there's one documented case where one
guys
left rain was an atheist and the other
brain was a believer this is true you
can imagine that one day we're going to
find somebody who's left brain is
Republican and his right brain is
Democrat and when you go to the polling
booth to put down the lever there's this
big struggle in the polling booth when
he puts down the lever absolutely true
that the two brains start to emerge as
two personalities and so we can begin to
test all the old wives tales of of the
past now in the old days we used to put
electrodes on the surface of the brain
and what came out was nonsense gibberish
very very complicated all the average
radio waves coming out now we have
computers now we have MRI scans and so
we don't use this old data technique
anymore however with computers you can
actually make this sexy on the upper
left is neuro sky where toys toys are
now controlled by a headband and you can
even you can go from one level to the
other level in the video game mentally
by mentally and controlling the pictures
and in Japan this is the rage of Japan
on the right it's a headband with two
ears on it when you meet someone at a
party whose very interesting your two
ears go like this what do you mean
someone who's a dud a real jerk a real
bore your ears go in our time okay so
you will always know if you're making an
impression on somebody at a party and
you will always know whether or not
you're going to go to home whether or
not you're going to go home alone that
night and I'm a professor one day I'm
gonna have all my students put on this
these things so i will know exactly who
gets the a and who gets the f we're
looking at their ears ok anyway this is
the rage in japan and on the lower left
people are already saying well look if
this technology is that advanced why not
replace the mouse why not mentally
commune with a pc in the future we may
walk into a room control the lights the
temperature your humidity
the internet turn things on and even
control cars cars will drive themselves
probably by the year twenty twenty and
why not drive your car mentally all
these things might be possible but of
course there are some hiccups that we
have to negotiate still but yeah this
could be the future whereby we control
things mentally and as I said it will be
sexy Madison Avenue is going to get
ahold of this all of a sudden fashion
models all of a sudden the leaders of
culture will start to have these
headbands and deal with things mentally
and then here is my colleague Stephen
Hawking he is paralyzed he's lost
control of his fingers now he simply
blinks when he wants something but now
on his right frame we have connected him
to a laptop computer here's how it works
sometimes we take a chip about the size
of a dime and put it right on top of the
brain this is what we do at Brown
University and the ship goes right on
the part of the brain that governs the
motor cortex it is then connected to a
laptop computer that understands the
impulses for example if you move your
hand to the right you move to the hand
to the right the chip registers the
electrical impulses of moving a hand to
the right and it knows to move the
cursor of a screen to the right so
eventually the laptop gets a dictionary
you move your hand to the right the
cursor moves to the right he gets a
dictionary of motions and then by
mentally thinking just by thinking
moving your hand to the right the cursor
will move to the right so this gentleman
here is totally paralyzed he had a
massive stroke he cannot talk to his
loved ones and yet we've connected him
to a chip to a laptop to his wheelchair
he cannot move his wheelchair you can
surf the web he can write email answer
email play video games operate household
appliances and he is totally paralyzed
we can also do this with mechanical arms
this lady here can only communicate by
blinking blinking is the only way she
can communicate with the outside world
again at Brown University they hooked
her up to a mechanical arm which can in
principle right she can write messages
so the gift of mobility is with us and
the military is now dumping tens of
millions into something called
revolutionary prosthetics this gentleman
here along with thousands of others have
lost arms legs because of roadside bombs
in iraq and afghanistan we are giving
them the gift of mobility these arms are
the most advanced arms ever created
created at johns hopkins university
under contract with the pentagon you can
pick up an a with these things you can
you can fist bump you can high-five
anything an ordinary person can do you
can do mentally mentally control not
just an arm but a leg these are
exoskeletons right out of the comic
books and they exist in fact at Duke
University at Duke University there's a
Brazilian neuroscientist at the lead
lead one of the leaders of this
technology he has made a goal that in
the next international soccer games in
Brazil the athlete who starts and opens
up the soccer games will be totally
paralyzed totally paralyzed outfitted
with an exoskeleton allowing him to
initiate the world cup soccer games that
is a concrete goal by the neuroscience
Department at Duke University and we
talked about surrogates artificial
intelligence turned out to be a lot
harder than we thought this is azimu one
of the most advanced robots built in
Japan Japan makes thirty percent of all
robots and samo can run jump climb
upstairs and he dances in fact he dances
much better than me I've been on several
programs with him and he doubt dances me
every time but I went up to the inventor
of a Zumo one of our most advanced
robots and I asked him how smart is as a
mo anyway and he was quite honest right
in front of the TV camera the inventor
of as a mo said as mo has the
intelligence
of a cockroach a retarded cockroach a
stupid retarded lobotomize cockroach he
can barely walk across the room unaided
he is a tape recorder for the most part
every motion is pre-scripted when I'm on
television with him it takes about three
hours three hours for the handler is to
get all the motions just right but now
we can connect him to a human a human
who wears a helmet picks up the brain
waves of the of the brain and then
operates as a mo you realize that this
will eventually revolutionize everything
including education remember when we
were kids we used to play hooky I mean
come on fess up right well we can now
create a surrogate in the classroom this
surrogate has within it a picture of you
in your bed sick the teacher can see you
and you from yours bed can I see see the
teachers face this is going to
revolutionize education isn't the future
wonderful you will never be able to play
hooky ever again and of course another
way to input information into the brain
is through the eyes the eyes are a
direct extension of the brain so why not
put the internet in your contact lens so
who are the first people to buy internet
contact lenses college students taking
final examinations
they will blink and they will see all
the answers to my final exam right there
in their contact lens who's the second
person to buy internet contact lenses
President Barack Obama so he doesn't
have to have these damn teleprompter is
giving him a speech all the time who's
the third person to buy internet contact
lenses Vice President Joe Biden so he's
always on message and ever says anything
goofy who's the fourth person to buy
internet contact lenses well if you fell
in love with somebody but your tongue
tied because you can't recite poetry you
can't say oh you're eyes are like the
sky your lips at ruby red never fear the
room use of the world will buy these
contact lenses and they will always have
poetic words just gushing forth from
their mouths so for you romeo's out
there this this is for you and who also
buy these internet contact lenses
husband and wives they'll see each
other's images and what they're looking
at so if your husband or wife always
buys the wrong thing at the supermarket
never fear you'll see through his or her
contact lens and you will say no no no
that's not that well that apple's wrong
no no no no not that so we will be
living in the matrix so the future of
surrogates and exoskeletons could be the
space program it cost ten thousand
dollars a pound to put anything in
near-earth orbit that is your weight in
solid gold the next time you want to go
in orbit sure buy gold the equivalent of
your weight and you two can go into
outer space to put you on the moon costs
a hundred thousand dollars a pound to
put you on Mars cost a million dollars a
pound that is your weight in diamonds so
why not send drones avatars surrogates
to the moon controlled by astronauts
sitting in their living room and firemen
dealing with dirty dangerous dull jobs
why not have somebody sitting in the
comfort of his living room energize
these surrogates so exoskeletons and
computerized
statics they are here today in the
future they may go into outer space and
into the construction field and
revolutionize education now let's talk
about the big one uploading memories
into the mine last year at Wake Forest
University and also Los Angeles the
first memory was recorded and uploaded
successfully here's what they did they
took a mouse and they had the mouse
learn how to sip water then the mouse
forgot this trick but they recorded it
they recorded the hippocampus right
there that is the place for memories
process they recorded it then after the
mouse forgot how to do what they played
it back into the hippocampus and the
mouse remembered this has now been done
with false memories you can actually put
false memories into a mouse and he will
remember things that they never did and
next is chimpanzees and primates very
soon we will start to do this with
primates and after that alzheimers
patients the short-term goal of this is
to create a brain pacemaker shown on the
upper right a brain pacemaker could be
our future as our brain deteriorates the
hippocampus deteriorates fastest your
short-term memories start to
disintegrate and we may be able to get a
brain prosthetic a pacemaker to upload
memories of who are you where do you
live what do your children look like and
things like that and then even beyond
that maybe just maybe we'll be able to
upload a vacation you never had or
courses you flunked in college workers
will be able to learn new skills as
technology progresses by uploading the
memories necessary to master a new
technological skill this could affect
the job market students can learn
calculus by pushing a button okay this
also raises legal questions because what
happens if a criminal uploads a false
memory into your mind now
there is the hippocampus in the middle
when it is damaged you lose the ability
to form long-term memories the most
famous case was mr. hm many decades ago
he had an injury during the surgery and
he lost his long-term memory when you
greeted him in fact I was on a TV
program with him once when you greet him
he shakes your hand and says oh hello
how are you then later he forgets that
he ever met you and he starts all over
again hello hello Oh glad to meet you
and he did this for decades once when he
was an old man he saw himself in a
mirror and he was horrified horrified
cuz he thought he was a young man saying
hello hello how are you every time
someone came in the door he was an old
man he was horrified but then he forgot
the memory of being horrified and it was
back to hello hello hello are again in
fact his story is so strange it's been
made into two movies 50 first dates with
drew Barrymore and ground Groundhog Day
with Bill Murray two movies about the
man who relives that same moment over
and over again that's what happens with
damage from the hippocampus and now at
Berkeley what they're doing is something
that is outrageous videotaping a thought
how can you videotape a dream well
here's how you do it this is the brain
in an MRI scan you analyze it for 30,000
centres of electrical activity and you
get 30,000 dots these 3000 dots
represent a map of energy flows in the
brain then a computer program recognizes
these dots and has a dictionary and from
it creates a picture of what you are
looking at MRI machines today are huge
bulky but in the future it's going to be
a lot smaller on the right an MRI
machine built in germany the size of a
briefcase the size of a briefcase
according to the laws of physics the
smallest MRI machine that is compatible
with the laws of physics is
this big you will have one day an MRI
machine in your medicine cabinet you
will have more computer power in your
medicine cabinet than a modern
University Hospital according to the
physicists who built that thing on the
right and here's how we do it we MRI the
brain look at electrical activity
construct a matrix of 30,000 dots and a
computer program prints this out these
are some of the first pictures of a
thought on the left is Steve Martin next
to it is the mental image that you
create of Steve Martin in your mind
recreated as a photograph and we can do
it for many kinds of objects again these
pictures are fuzzy but hey look it's
only 30,000 dots you are a typical
picture may have up to a million pixels
on the left an elephant a person an
airplane and then when I went to
Berkeley and I interviewed these people
who are doing this experiment I asked
them what happens if you fall asleep and
they said yes they have fallen asleep in
this machine the MRI machine keeps on
chugging away and creates an
approximation of what you are dreaming
about this has also proven another old
wives tale there's something called
lucid dreaming lucid dreaming is when
you are awake when you are dreaming you
know you are dreaming you can actually
walk and control the direction of the
dream how many people in this room have
ever at some point in the life felt that
they were awake even in the middle of a
dream raise your hand well lucid
dreaming is something that's written up
in Buddhist texts very ancient
phenomenom there are lessons about how
to become a lucid dreamer you have to
take notes you have to have a notebook
of dreams and in Germany West Germany
last year they proved it's correct they
took a lucid dreamer put her put him in
an MRI machine and he controlled the
direction of the dream and so Leonardo
DiCaprio
in the movie inception the movie is not
so far-fetched because we might be able
to actually redirect the direction of a
dream and now let's talk about President
Barack Obama's initiative why does the
president of the United States wanna
dump with the Europeans a billion
dollars to create brain 2.0 a disc that
mimics your brain like the genome
because the short-term goal is to
understand mental illness you realize
that many familiar people from Hollywood
from the music industry suffer from
bipolar disorder on the upper left is
Margot Kidder of the Superman movies
several years ago she was found
wandering stark naked behind garbage
cans as a homeless woman she suffers
from bipolar disorder as many famous
actors and actresses including Princess
Leia of Star Wars well we can brain scan
these people now and we find something
amazing when you talk to yourself your
left temporal lobe is excited and
generates voices that's how you talk to
yourself but in these people to a
schizophrenic they generate voices
without their permission without their
knowledge or permission voices are
generated in their mind if one day a
voice all of a sudden erupts in your
mind without your permission you would
think you are mad that is madness and we
see it in schizophrenics under a brain
scan and we can now look at history
through the lens of brain scans this is
Joan of Arc she said she talked to God
it turns out that if you suffer from
epileptic lesions about ten twenty
percent people who suffer from up
epileptic lesions suffer from hyper
religiosity they see ghosts demons
everywhere if it rains it's because it's
punishment if you fall down a demon
pushed you down they suffer from high
/ religiosity and it's now possible to
create a helmet and induce this effect
deliberately with the flick of a switch
this is called the god helmet the god
helmet you probably seen it on TV have
been specials about it the god helmet
beams electromagnetic radiation is the
mind duplicating this effect and you
feel that you are in the presence of a
great spirit and so what did these
scientists do they decided to get an
atheist and a believer and put them in
the god helmet the Atheist was Richard
Dawkins Richard Dawkins the biologist
he's a famous atheist they put the god
helmet on him and then they put the god
helmet on nuns to see whether you can
shake their belief in a deity well
afterwards the interview Richard Dawkins
do you believe in God after having the
sensation of being with the internal
being he said no he's still an atheist
but the nun says something interesting
the nuns belief in God was not shaken
the nun said God created us with a
telephone in our mind so we can
communicate with God and therefore this
they saw the god helmet as proof of
God's grace the point is you can't win
you're not going to change
you're not going to shake anyone's
believe with something something like a
god helmet but now let's talk about
super genius let's talk about humans who
are off-scale superhuman abilities this
element here has taken a helicopter ride
over New York City harbor including
Manhattan and it's drawn the entire
Harbor including all of Manhattan from
memory from one helicopter ride and if
you want to see it go to New York City
terminal 1 JFK Airport look up you will
see a mural all of the skyscrapers all
the lights bridges tunnels everything
from memory this guy has also done Hong
Kong he's done London and many other
places and also there's a young boy as a
child a bullet went through the left
temporal lobe of his brain another guy
dived into a swimming pool also hit the
left temporal lobe of his brain both of
them became super mathematical geniuses
it turns out this effect can be induced
by injury to the left temporal lobe now
tonight after this lecture do not pick
up a hammer do not bang yourself trying
to become the next Einstein it doesn't
work that way ok these people are
incredible you can ask them what were
you doing 30 years ago on mate second at
four o'clock in the afternoon and they
will say well I was reading page 320 you
want me to recite the paragraph i was
reading one gentleman kim peak memorized
15,000 novel 15,000 books and can recite
line behind any page out of 15,000 bucks
some of us can't even remember the comic
book we read last night think of what
these guys can do now why can they how
can they do this well we're not sure but
one theory is we use the thing that
forgetting was a natural process you
learn and then the memory degrades with
time every textbook says that's the way
memory works but we now realize that
maybe just maybe that's not true that
forgetting requires complex biochemical
mechanisms in other words these p
people have forgotten how to forget they
remember but the forgetting mechanism is
broken and therefore there's no erasing
of these memories that go back 30 40
years one of these people a woman in Los
Angeles says that her vision is like
split level one part of her vision is
what's happening in a reality and the
other vision is what happened to her 30
years ago reliving a day 30 years ago
and she finds it annoying and she wish
it would go away but she just paralyzed
by photographic memory and then we have
Asperger's and genius the greatest
genius in all of science bar none was
Sir Isaac Newton when he was 23 years
old he discovered calculus at the rate
at which you learn it in college he
discovered the universal law of
gravitation and he discovered a binomial
theorem when he was 23 years old but
he's not someone you would want to have
dinner with he had no social skills that
we know of he was not the kind of person
who would chitchat with you he had we
think L Asperger's syndrome and if you
want to see what Asperger's syndrome
looks like watch the big bang theory on
CBS television many Nobel Prize winners
brawls Dirac creator of quantum field
theory he also perhaps suffered from
Asperger's syndrome and then there is
Albert Einstein his brain is still with
us in 1955 when albert einstein died the
doctor during the autopsy kidnapped the
brain took it home put it inside a jar
in his living room for about 30 years
drove cross-country in a Buick with
Einstein's brain in a mayonnaise jar
amazing what Einstein had to go through
now it's at Princeton University and the
brain is a little bit different if you
go to my book I gave you to the details
of how Einstein's brain is a little bit
different from our brain and now we can
also reanalyze Freudian psychology Freud
talked about the unconscious mind and we
now realize that the mind is like a
large corporation
which corporation has a very small nerve
center a CEO but the CEO does not have
to know everything that's happening in
the mail room there for most of the
brains activity is unconscious like a
large corporation not only that not only
is the unconscious mind necessary but
also emotions why do we have emotions we
have emotions because they provide a
rapid fire response to emergencies if
you see a tiger your prefrontal cortex
will debate whether or not the tiger is
strong week or whatever emotions say run
you don't want to debate the finer
points of you know lion anatomy so
emotions serve a purpose that is also
found in a corporation which has to have
emergency efforts to put out fires
independent of the CEO and we also see
the super-ego the it'd and the ego at
work in fact the pleasure Center is
located right here in the nucleus
accumbens we've located precisely your
pleasure Center scientists have hooked
up a mouse with this pleasure center
hooked up to a telegraph key so that
when you hit the telegraph key the mouse
is a great time it turns out the mouse
will hit the telegraph key twice a
second until it dies of starvation they
went up to scale to dolphins dolphins
have been connected to this device
whereby the dolphin goes forward it hits
a plate which stimulates is pleasure
Center so the dolphin would also hit the
pleasure center several times a second
until it realized I am dying I will die
the dolphin stopped went out grab food
and they came back and stimulated itself
dolphins not stupid
and then I want to talk about something
that has consumed the lives of thousands
of people throughout history and that is
what is consciousness if you go to the
library or go to the internet you'll
find twenty thousand articles written
about consciousness by ministers
psychologists psychiatrists twenty
thousand articles never in the history
of science have so many people devoted
so much time to produce so little there
is no consensus as to what is
consciousness in fact Robert Frost once
defined consciousness as something that
starts up when you wake up in the
morning and then stops as soon as you go
into your office
so I'm a physicist I decided to use a
physicist point of view to define
consciousness which will give you a
numerical ranking by which we can
analyze robots by which we can analyze
animals and people a numerical ranking
of consciousness when we physicists look
at a star a planet or an electron how do
we think we physicists try to construct
a model a simplified model of the planet
or electron in space locating this
position in space then we try to analyze
this interaction with other planets
other electrons other stars and then
finally we run the videotape forward in
time to understand how the solar system
the electron evolves with time so we
look at space then we look at
relationship to others and then we look
at running the videotape forward in time
predicting the future I'm now going to
give you a definition of consciousness
consciousness is is the continual
creation of models feedback loops which
describe a model of our place in space
time and relationship to others so how
does animal consciousness different from
ours we humans see the future we spend
the bulk of our time daydreaming
planning strategizing animals have no
concept of tomorrow so let's rank
consciousness numerically I say that one
unit of consciousness is a single
feedback loop like a thermostat a
thermostat registers temperature and
changes surrounding I call that one unit
of consciousness a flower has maybe 10
units of consciousness it measures life
it meant just water gravity temperature
a flower has many feedback loops maybe
10 or so but they are stationary once
they become mobile they become level one
conscious remember the reptilian brain
in the back of our brain the reptilian
brain represents level one
sciousness understanding your position
in space but not much more and then
evolution gave us level to consciousness
that is the animal brain the mammalian
brain which gives us emotions which
determines your social hierarchy where
you are in the tribe emotions I call
that level to consciousness and level 3
consciousness is what humans do alone
and that is we see tomorrow to the best
of our ability animals do not see
tomorrow when it gets cold they
hibernate instinctively we when we feel
the air getting cold we pack our bags we
have to do our laundry we have to do
this and that it's a pain in the butt
planning for the future but that's what
the brain does level 3 consciousness now
you may say to yourself well I don't
believe it maybe there are things
outside your definition of level 1 2 3
that cannot be summarized by space
relationship to others and time like
humor humor is so ephemeral now how can
you possibly judge humor by level 1 2
and 3 well let's talk about a joke jokes
are funny because we actually hear the
joke and then we complete the dots we
finish the joke but then when the
punchline comes is different from wheat
mentally anticipated and we think it's
funny for example WC Fields was once
asked a question about the upbringing of
young people and he was asked a question
are you in favor of clubs for youth and
he said yes but only if kindness fails
and Teddy Roosevelt's daughter was asked
about gossip and she said if you have
nothing good to say about other people
then please sit down next to me
and the Bible says do unto others as you
would have them do unto you except do it
first now why are the quote funny
because when you hear about kindness
towards children and clubs are they good
for children you say yes you complete
the dots your brain automatically
predicts the future the future is yes
clubs are good for people for young
people but then WC Fields twisted by
saying only if kindness fails then we
would use clubs on kids so there's a
twist and your mother told you that if
you can't say anything nice about
somebody then don't say anything at all
right your mother told you that and then
the twist is when it's not what you
thought and when you deconstruct it it's
not funny anymore because you know the
ending once you know the ending is not
funny anymore and so what I'm trying to
tell you is the essence of humor is
level 3 consciousness why are jokes
funny because they violate the level 3
consciousness and evolution means that
we have to anticipate the unexpected in
the forest we have to know all sorts of
bizarre endings if we're going to
survive in a jungle where everything is
unexpected that's why humor was very
important for our existence and now
let's talk about robots what level
consciousness do robots have well I
think it's kind of obvious robots like
as a mo have the intelligence of a
cockroach they can barely figure out
where they are in a room many robots
take about six hours for them to walk
across the room does that remind you of
any of your friends any of your
relatives six hours to walk across the
room therefore our robots conscious and
the answer is yes they have level one
consciousness they can barely understand
their location in a room however
sometimes we think that robots will
eventually have emotions so the
beginning of emotional robots is taking
place now a little bit of level two but
not much more so we see how primitive
robots are there at level one
can barely navigate across the room they
have a little bit of emotions they can
smile but not much more but no level 3
now you may say to yourself no wait a
minute computers can evolve black holes
computers can involve solar systems yeah
in only one dimension only one dimension
can computers simulate the future now
this also means if this theory is
correct it means we can rank
intelligence as well IQ exams don't work
very well people with high IQ as
children maybe them wind up as petty
criminals marginal individuals losers in
society so what is the only indicator of
success that psychologists have found
that is reproducible testable
falsifiable in children that lasts for
30 years there's only one characteristic
that children have that you can measure
that correlates with success 30 years
after the test was done does anyone know
what that one characteristic is
psychologists have done this test over
and over again track these kids for
decades it is delayed gratification as
seen by the marshmallow test the UN a
marshmallow now are two marshmallows an
hour from now and what is the essence of
delayed gratification level 3
consciousness they see the future that
two marshmallows are better than one
marshmallow a college education is
better than a high school education
shortcuts are bad that means they
predict the future think of a
safecracker a safecracker may have low
IQ flunked out a great school but a
safecracker can simulate the future of a
bank robbery better than the police that
means they are more intelligent than
police because they see the future in a
way that the police don't so the point
I'm raising something simple robots have
a long ways to go they're not a level 3
there are basically level 1 like a
cockroach but that is a mean that they
can't eventually
come intelligent who knows maybe one day
late in the century robots will become
smarter than us it's possible in which
case they may put us in zoos put us
behind bars throw peanuts at us and make
us dance behind bars I say when that
comes let us put a chip in their brain
to shut them off before they get
murderous thoughts let me now wind up on
the following note we talked about the
brain project of Obama but if we can
create a disk with your connectome on it
and you die your connectome lives on and
so then the question is did you really
die well it depends on how you define
you if you are a biology biological
entity consisting of wetware and a mine
then yes you have died you are gone but
if all your memories your personality
your hopes dreams your genome survives
then did you really die in some sense no
but that assumes that you are
information and if that's true then
maybe one day we will have a brain net a
brain net perhaps within the next decade
or two decades we will have not just
digital sent on the internet we will
have emotions we will have feelings
memories sent on the internet teenagers
are going to love it on Facebook they'll
stand emotions ricocheting across the
cost Facebook memories are their first
kiss memories of their first date I mean
it's going to explode and your kids are
going to say mom dad you lived in the
world where the internet was digital how
could you how could you live in that
world no feeling no emotion no
experiences well it's coming I bring net
and the movies why is it the movies and
the Oscars always talk about a flat
screen with sound I mean think about is
that stupid everyone making all this hey
about a flat screen and sound why not
send emotions through the entertainment
channels why not have full immersion
entertainment that could be the future
of entertainment
and Isaac Asimov's favorite short story
was sending consciousness into outer
space maybe one day we'll take the
connectome it only has a Zeta byte of
memory put it on a laser beam I
calculate how big the laser beam would
have to be and shoot it into outer space
at the speed of light this could be our
ultimate destiny to explore the universe
as beings made out of pure energy all
consistent with what is known about the
laws of physics and the laws of computer
science and now I like to end on one
note and then take a few questions when
I was a child my role model was Albert
Einstein and my favorite Einstein story
is this when Einstein was an old man he
was tired of giving the same pot over
and over again so one day his chauffeur
came up to him and the chauffeur sad
professor I'm really a part-time actor
I've heard your space so many times I've
memorized it so why don't we switch
places I will put on a mustache I will
put on a wig I will be the great
Einstein and you can take a rest to be
my chauffeur well Einstein loved the
joke so they switch places this went
along famously until one day a
mathematician in the back asked a very
difficult question an Einstein thought
oh the game is up but then the chauffeur
said that question is so elementary that
even my chauffeur here can answer it for
you
thank you very much you've been a great
audience
so I think we have some time for
questions so um ooh one question has any
I stop right now okay love my question
is thank you very much for small how is
a digital brain connected to
biochemistry of our body because a lot
of things a lot of like neurons are
triggered not by anything else but you
know some hormones or some let's say our
body and triggers yeah you ask a very
important question first of all is the
brain a digital computer for 50 years we
thought yes and the answer is really no
in some sense we run a wild goose chase
for the last 50 years thinking that the
brain is a digital computer or a Turing
machine a Turing machine has inputs
outputs in a program but the brain has
no operating system the brain has no
programming there's no windows there's
no Pentium chip there's no cpu there no
subroutines nothing there's nothing in a
computer that even vaguely looks like a
digital computer so what is the brain
the brain is a learning machine it is a
neural network of sorts which rewires
itself after learning every task
therefore it does use some digital some
analog in a combination but as you
correctly pointed out reading reading
what these neurons do is beyond our
capability so what we do in the
laboratories we cheat we simply see a
configuration of neurons corresponding
to moving your arm like this then we
create a dictionary that this means
certain number of neurons therefore when
you think going like this it'll excite
those neurons so we get a dictionary
this way very clumsy but that's what we
do in the laboratory because we cannot
read a neural networks messages and
convert it into digital that was the
problem now we have computers that can
do that create this dictionary that's
how we get these gorgeous pictures of
thought that's how we can move robot
arms but it's all done by cheating
because we really don't know
how this neural networks how it operates
and that's why we want to create brain
2.0 that's why the brain initiative is
being initiated so that we can see the
Miss wiring of people with OCD bipolar
disorder and schizophrenia diseases by
the way which are even mentioned in the
Bible they're so old thank you very much
thanks to the perfect question thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
