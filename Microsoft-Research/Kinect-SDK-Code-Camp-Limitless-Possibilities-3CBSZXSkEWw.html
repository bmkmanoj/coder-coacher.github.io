invited around 40 people from the
academic and developer community to get
the early bits to the sdk and create
some amazing applications i'm the
founder of the open connect community so
i was deeply involved with all the very
early connect hacks i'm really excited
about the kinect sdk visit add some new
things that we haven't seen before in
the open source drivers the content of
the code camp is really with no
seriously connect oops connect of course
it's a new way of competing in Syria I
see that the future would be like this
so after some days so I am really
excited about this exit as we develop
new applications on the pc we're really
going to have to consider the kinect as
a whole nother added facet of
application development definitely and
we're looking at taking them to connect
out of the game space a bit and putting
it in others basis it isn't dependent on
those fine motor skills it's available
to everyone whatever age whatever level
of ability once you've got a supported
platform for for working with the kinect
on pc then sort of
possibilities are endless when I look at
the potential applications from
healthcare from education to
manufacturing to teleconferencing they
are limitless</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
