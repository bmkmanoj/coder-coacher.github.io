you
all right good afternoon everyone so I'm
just yesterday walking or this morning
walking through the building so many
people in unexpected places that MSR
have copies of James book on markov
chains so in not just in the theory
group let's see this extremely
influential but today he'll talk about
something else variant of the LA
hastings levitt of aggregation in the
small particle limit James Norris please
so thanks you've all for the chance to
talk and more generally thanks for the
opportunity to spend some time in this
beautiful place and very stimulating
environment before I go any further so
I've not right written it on on the
slide this is all joint work with Amanda
Turner it was a PhD student in Cambridge
and is now a lecturer in lancaster
university in the UK okay so dear laser
is a famously hard problem and i'm not
really going to talk about dla but what
I'm got to talk about is suppose
motivated by it so or to explain in what
respect the model I'm going to talk
about shares features with DLA and and
look at other other ways in which it
it's different now let's think generally
about you know mar 6 kind of describe
what what da dee la is or what we're
trying to do with mati lazy it's a model
for the growth of a cluster so
mathematical terms you could think about
two clusters being represented by a
compact set in some euclidean space and
it's growing so we've got we've got a
parametrized family of compact sets
which getting bigger okay so k sub t is
how big the cluster is at time t the
mechanism by which the sets grow which I
mean this is sort of physics rather than
mathematics we're imagining lots of
sticky particles wandering around and
every so often the particle bumps into
the cluster and sticks there so the
particles are say moving I mean but the
simplest well one one mechanism by which
you might think of these particles
moving is that you you set them off a
long way from the cluster and they just
want wand around randomly like Brownian
motions and then the first point that
they hit the the cluster they stick
their and the cluster grows a little bit
okay so that the distribution of the
point which the cluster will grow at is
given by the hitting distribution of
Brownian motion from infinity otherwise
known as the harmonic measure from
infinity okay so the idea is that we
should make the clusters grow so that
the growth rate at any point on the
boundary is proportional to the to the
amount of the harmonic measure which
sits there and and immediately you can
see that if you have some boundary which
has fingers pointing out then those
fingers are more likely to be hit by
this Brownian motion than some point
deep in a field of the of the boundary
of the cluster so you expect to see that
the the tips of the fingers will grow
preferential
me and then that's already giving an
idea that I mean suppose you compare the
growth from a nice smooth ball or disc
and from something you know on the other
hand consider a nice smooth ball or disc
with a little pinprick poking out very
small that pinprick will get
preferentially grown so that these two
domains which are very close to each
other their evolution might therefore
you know not be close to each other
because because this all that require is
this little prick out of the boundary in
order for it to have a completely
different evolution I said this is not
mathematics but this is just sort of
heuristics and but but it you know if
you try to make sense of a pde story for
the growth in by by harmonic measure it
doesn't work you try right intellipedia
idiots it's not well posed to you you
can't not do anything and indeed when
you when you look at physical instances
where the growth you might reasonably
think of as being caused by this sort of
mechanism they look random right so you
wouldn't expect it to come out of a PDE
that they exhibit sort of fractal and
apparently random features so maybe pd's
aren't the way to go here okay so I mean
which which is interesting for
probability because often a sort of
particle picture of what's happening it
you know you can you can move over to a
to a PDE picture and you know the scent
is the essential aspects of the dynamics
are captured by the PDE but if you hear
it seems it's not going to be that that
kind of setup so so instead we might
start with a particle model after all
that that's kind of where the sort of
physical picture began and and you know
see what happens as the size of the
particles get small
okay what I mean it is there any kind of
limit object okay now i'm going to work
exclusively in two dimensions which
courses already big disappointment
because we would like to be able to
understand this in three dimensions but
two dimensions is great because you have
all the mechanisms of complex analysis
at your disposal and you know you can
play lots of games which you can't do
three dimensions it's a no this is this
is the era of two-dimensional
probability and so so we're going to
work in two dimensions so like because
i'm thinking about a you know but gone
from thinking about a continuous
evolution for now towards thinking about
while it's moose in discrete steps my my
time parameter is going to be discreet
and i'm thinking about a sequence of
compact sets which grow k 0 is always
going to be the unit disk and i'm going
to progressively make it bigger by
adding adding bits to it i'll assume
that the exterior domain from my sets is
always simply connected and then a first
exploitation of that we're working in
the plane is that i can encode the the
cluster through its complementary domain
in terms of a conformal map because
there's a unique conformal map which
takes the exterior domain of the unit
disk so here's my geez that's k 0 unit
disk and so that the d0 is complimentary
to name i'll get mapped by some
conformal map to the
complimentary domain DN of the cluster
at time n because there's a
three-parameter family which does this
but there's only one which has the
property that it fixes infinity and
doesn't rotate the plane that's infinity
at all so there's a mean come up with
the unique controller map associated
with these two with with this cluster ok
you know about the conformal invariance
of Brownian motion if I if I take a
Brownian motion in two dimensions and I
and I look at this image under ur under
a conformal map then up to a change of
time scale I'm still looking at Brownian
motion so particular if I think about
hitting probabilities if I if I start
the Brownian motion offers infinity here
or if you like on a sort of large circle
around here uniformly well actually I
know then that it's going to buy sort of
symmetries of Brownian motion I know
that the hitting distribution here is
the uniform distribution if I map this
over here that I'm again looking at a
time change of Brownian motion so it's
the hitting distribution of the image
process on here will just be the
harmonic measure from infinity and so
this shows us that if I take the uniform
distribution here and I map it over I'm
assuming the boundaries nice here bandra
this domain is nice if I'm a padova if i
put the measure over here using it using
phi n then then i will get exactly the
harmonic measure on the boundary of this
cluster ok
alright so this this slide describes the
well actually a big family of models
we're discussing just before the full
before the talk that in some sense this
kind of prior work on on this on this
family not all of it published by
carlson and Makarov with the name which
Venus become associated with the family
of models the names are Hastings and and
Levitt off so these are models for
aggregation for kind of growth of
clusters in the plane which are encoded
using conformal maps there's a
one-parameter family of these models
parameter alpha I'm actually going to
talk exclusively about alpha equals zero
which is the easiest one study of this
family there's so see it's working
progress to deal with the other alphas
how far have I will ever get I don't
know there's a recent recent preprint of
Amanda and Frederick Johansson and I'll
and solar where they've begun to make a
minute mitad a bit of progress with with
positive values of alpha just posted on
the archive but but for today it will
part from this slide be entirely about
alpha equals zero but let me describe
the whole family so you how you can so
you can see
see what it is okay so I'm going to
consider adding a certain sort of
particle 22 to the unit disk and two
simple examples you might want to keep
in mind are on the one hand I could
think of adding a slit like that of
length Delta or I might think of adding
a little ball of rate of diameter Delta
so that some that's a family of
particles because I could think about
varying Delta ok now just exaggerate
this picture a little bit suppose that k
and was like that now i really want to
attach a particle here of some certain
size say say it's a delta 0 where the
attachment point is chosen according to
harmonic measure okay so i might want to
attach a little ball here bored might
actually going to do is to attach a
particle at some random points on the
circle and then i'm going to map it over
using phi n now the amount of harmonic
measure on this little bit of boundary
here is quite small as hard for branding
motion to get in here so when I map it
over here to the circle it maps to a
small interval so in order to have a
particle of size Delta hear it have to
be much smaller than Delta over here
right because there's a scale factor of
if it's attached a tangle heater this is
e to the I theta that's the scale factor
in moving this direction so I want to
add a small particle there and if I was
adding a particle of size Delta here
well you know this little bit of
boundary here has got lots of harmonic
measures easy to hit so here I'd want to
attach something which was relatively la
guess right yeah relatively large over
that ok so that actually motivates the
formula given here but the my delta ends
over on this side i take a ball or a
slit of size Delta or Delta n plus 1
this is the pointer right
do you know which button is first to
activate it make sure this is the point
don't you have like a silver pin
okay so all right so take my basic
particle size and then I just if I take
alpha equals 2 it does that does that
adjustment i was describing our four
equals two scales down Delta so that
when the particle is map back to KN it
comes out at the right size so we should
aim to get all the particles of the same
size over here when our four equals two
okay when alpha equals zero you don't
bother to do that so that the pub that
you know the although the particles are
the same size over here we're going to
end up adding different sized particles
over there and we might want to explore
how things varied as we let alpha go
between 0 &amp;amp; 2 obviously alpha equals 2
gives you your best hope for something
which looks like DLA it's believed that
actually the whole family models is of
interest and and possibly the alpha
equals zeros is some sort of connection
with the Eden model which is another
famous growth model in probability alpha
equals 1 sorry yes alpha equals 0 you
can see it's going to be much simpler
because I'm not doing anything here and
that's the one we can do something with
all right a little bit of light relief
why might you be interested in this sort
of thing here are some pictures of
instances either either physical or
computational work where your clusters
grown and they and they show interesting
features they don't look like balls they
look random and they look kind of
fractal mathematics has not really had
much success yet in explaining what's
going on here but it but I think here I
mean don't do write it it's it's that
there's enough to be done here so these
are caused by some sort of electrical
effects like lightning Lichtenberg
figures
famous source of paper weights and
there's a different sort of growth model
coming from biology you can see fingers
coming out but I mean maybe this is
growing more like a roughly like a ball
that a simulation of DNA the colors in
these pictures encoding times at which
particles are rounded and this is a
simulation which which amanda did of our
I'll model HR 0 and it's not it's not
too different to to this simulation of
dla again that colors are encoding
different epochs which one is adding
particles ok and this light just reviews
the model which is going to be the
subject to the rest of the talk so if
you've got any any something you'd kind
of want me to explain then I'm happy to
take questions you know start with unit
disk and fix the parameter Delta Delta
and the ends got to go to zero we're
going to thinking about scaling limits
as the size of the particle goes to zero
the the particle I added each stage will
either be a slick time the side once of
robots look at slits or discs the the
picture here was this picture was the
slit model then there will be some
unique conformal map which which kind of
encodes adding that particle to the unit
disk subject to these normalizations and
the way the model is constructed is the
following it's so that the probability
comes from a sequence of independent
uniform random variables on on unit on
it often lots dupuy on my on the you
know on the circle feature is going to
be the angle at which the the particle
is attached on circle and probably the
best form is to look at to understand
what's going on is this one p is my
basic particle could be a
little disk attached at the point 1 on
the unit circle then you rotate the disk
by a random angle and then you map it
over to the cluster using the conformal
map Phi n so you end up with a new bit
added to the cluster as the cluster
evolves you have more and more particles
the the challenges to understand what
the what the limiting shape of these
clusters described the stochastic
structure of the clusters which form in
this way oh yeah so I mean maybe one
thing to to say is this the parallels
here with the with SLE rights if i look
at the inverse map
then I kind of get the composition in
the right order for a stochastic flow oh
maybe I did in verses because this is
not too visible that so the inverse maps
of these conformal maps are are
stochastic flows if i can i can put it i
can put a point into the flow and see it
evolve and this will follow some Markov
evolution and this I mean you know in in
sna you want to study either the the
trays saw the or the hull what you
actually get access to it through is the
is the love the flow and much of the
hard work is to translate stuff you can
prove for this into properties of this
ok and that's that's exactly paralleled
in the math we do here that we can
understand this map pretty well and then
we work hard isn't it are unable to
understand the inverse yes so this is
the theorem on the shape of the cluster
see what it says the stuff in the
beginning isn't so important you should
look at these three bullets we're really
interested so so so this describes how
the how the cluster has evolved after a
certain number of iterations of adding
adding particles Delta we're considering
that the limit is Delta goes to zero
size of the particles become small
when the number of particles you when
you've added a number of particles of
order 1 over Delta squared you have
grown apart Groner that's approximately
a ball of radius well some microscopic
size so the interesting values of n in
this theorem are really when n is is
like 1 over Delta squared because if you
add if if you scale down the size of the
particles you're adding then you need to
scale up the number of particles you add
in order to see anything appreciable
happen and the way that you need to do
the scaling is is this so what are the
three things say well the first one says
that the when we add a particle then in
fact it ends up close to a scale up by
the current size of the cluster to the
point which is actually it was attached
on the unit circle so we attached a
point at the unit circle we mapped it
over to the cluster it turns out really
just and kind of moved out and scaled up
I mean this is this is despite the fact
that the cluster has a extremely
complicated boundary and in principle it
could be attached it and any where the
particles don't get attached just
anywhere they just get attached kind of
on a scaled-up version of the unit
circle
and the particles don't get distorted
usually they're all close to e to the CN
plus I i theta n the second thing says
there aren't any big holes in the
cluster so any point which is within the
kind of approximate shape occupied by
the cluster there is some bit of the
cluster KN which is close to it so we
fill out a disk and the second one is
simply saying but this accounts for
where all the particles go up to a
certain maximum value of n which could
be taken to be pretty large remember
it's ne- to which which is really of
interest and this so this is much larger
but this is just saying that none of the
other particles penetrates into the
particles are all attached in the
boundary layer that you know it's a it's
a growing disk and and you never get a
particle which which is attached kind of
further in than it should be you know
beyond you know an epsilon ok so that
the the limit shape is a ball fills out
the ball and we have some good control
about where the particles are attached
and there's a final cluster ok
that's it so that's one level of
description disappointing in a way
because it's a deterministic limit
alright and we were hoping to see some
sort of random effects as Delta goes to
zero so the rest of the talk is about
discovering some random effects in the
cluster which you might anticipate by
looking at the picture here what you
know so we're trying to describe this
bar theorem what is there to say well I
mean you can see bits of it are picked
up by the theorem I just stated that you
know it fills out the disk you can see
that as time goes by it accretes in
layers but but what what we were able to
do is to say something about structure
of these fingers okay so there's really
what the rest of the talk is devoted to
understanding with the structure of the
fingers they get access to that we have
to think about this thing we call the
harmonic measure flow
okay it's um it's helpful understanding
these things to take logs in the so the
boundary of the the boundary of the
cluster becomes you know this instead of
e to the CN we're looking at the point
sir there's we CN plus i theta and
there's the boundary of the cluster that
suppose that's the boundary of the
cluster KN and then we add another
particle so that's the boundary of the
cluster k n plus 1 and then when we take
the this is realized by some
intertwining of the conformal map with
with the exponential function with a map
from from this line so it's a week the
the harmonic measure parameterised is
the boundary here by by theta going from
naught to 2 pi okay so so we can map
this by Phi well let's call it a little
little Phi n distinguish it from the big
fan which was exponentiated so this is
parameterize by theta from not to not to
2 pi on the other hand so is the other
boundary the boundary of KN plus 1 is
also parametrized by theta and and and
the boundary of KN is a subset of the
new boundary so there is a map on the
interval from naught 2 pi
which takes the each each point in in of
the boundary here parameterize but by
harmonic measure so suppose that's the
parameter set there gets mapped to some
parameter value in the new boundary of
KN plus 1 only dessert there has to be a
jump the map is essentially the identity
away from some little region here around
the particle but we have to kind of
force in a new bit of boundary here
would so you end up with this this map
GN plus 1 G what I call it G theta n
plus 1 and
so it's a one gets a flow of the
harmonic measure as you add more and
more particles and it's by looking at
this flow that we can understand the
behavior of the fingers so so what the
way it goes is that we take it we're
able to take a limit of these flows in
some weak sense and understand the limit
measure okay in order to do that you
have to have some space in which the
flows live to do week limits
improbability how to understand the
space in which the flow is live in so
this is the space which the flows live
in so is a picture here of a non
decreasing right continuous function
which will repeat itself periodically if
I consider this so that set of all such
functions d oh well without hit here
without the periodic condition then I'm
going to say to two functions like that
are closed if when you rotate the axes
so instead of thinking of it as being a
non decreasing right continuous function
I could just draw axes like that cross
and it becomes a contraction okay and if
i consider to such functions i could
look at the uniform distance between
those two contractions you've got to
tilt your head by 45 degrees okay so I
mean the distance of of this function
from the identity is just the maximum
value of that it ever gets away from the
diagonal for example
this episode instead of looking at the
uniform norm we have to look at some
unusual way of just waking that a little
bit by so it's got a locally uniform
norm
okay so the the harmonic measure flow is
a flow in the sense it has a kind of
normal property that you you'd expect of
flows that you know Hugh if you act by
one foot over one time interval by the
flow and then you flow and flow on more
by along the next time interval then you
get what you expect by taking the flow
over the larger time interval however
this flow the flow property turns out
not to be robust under the sorts of
topology which is possible to put on
this flow space there's a weaker
property of a weaker flow property which
is robust and that's that's written here
that so so these increasing functions
have right and left limits and the right
way to think about the flow property to
make it robust just say when you compose
the left limits over two time intervals
then you get the left limit is something
which is less than or equal to the left
limit over that over the longer time
interval and then something analogous
would inequality the other way around
for the right limits one property that a
flow might have is that it be continuous
in this sense that if you look at how
far things move over short time
intervals is not very far okay so I want
to consider continuous in this sense
week flows
and on that space this way of defining a
metric which turns the space of these
flows into a complete separable metric
space so there you have a an object
where you can start thinking about weak
convergence up to that picture before
that's how you define the distance
between two flows okay now there's a
famous object in probability which is
the coalescing Brownian flow now we
should know want to introduce because it
turns out to be the limit object before
the harmonic measure flows okay so if I
start with them
think about branding emotions on the
circle and take a collection of starting
points I run brown emotions for words
from these points and I have a rule that
if you know I'd go through the starting
points in turn and if I hit a brand new
motion already there I just join up with
it then it's easy to see that you get
something a distribution on coalescing
Brownian paths which is independent of
the order which you set things up and
you can add more and more points in here
so eventually you could have brand
emotions going from every rational point
forwards and then there's a good way to
kind of complete this so that you end up
with a you can say you know for every
point on this line here where it goes to
on on this line and there are pictures
that you end up with it is it is there
actually every there are only finitely
many images every point here actually
has coalesced into one by a certain
later time and so that's what the
function looks like if you draw a graph
of the function then it looks like a
staircase not not not not not all the
same size but the graph of this of this
function is a staircase like that oh so
that so this is some there's a theta
here and it gets mapped to f of theta
over there all of those going to that
one okay so this is eating like that so
in fact you can think of the coalescing
think of arathi as flow as being a
probability measure on this continuous
week flow space it doesn't live I'm just
as the object it's sometimes necessary
to complete spaces in order to support
measures it doesn't live on the space of
perfect flows but it but it does live
nicely on the space of these continuous
week flows
so I mean this is basically a result of
a right here it's just re reformulated
in the language of these continuous week
flows there's a unique Braille poverty
measure on on the space with the
property that if I I mean so this this
means i can i drop a point into the flow
and see where it goes well it does a
Brownian motion because from this and
levees characterization it would imply
that this is a Brownian motion and and
the fact that this is a martingale says
that if i dropped two different points
into the flow then as soon as they hit
each other they perform independent
brown emotions again by levees
characterization up until the time they
first hit each other teeee and
thereafter they perform a single
Brownian motion because as soon as we
get after this time we have to
compensate the thing by the usual
Brownian drift okay so this is a neat
way to to give a martingale
characterization of the arathi alone ok
so i miss kind of more propaganda this
is a good way to think about the arashi
of low you can invert all these
continuous week flows just look at the
inverse map the the time reversal map
which which just takes this inverse
turns out to give an isometry of this
space and it also preserves the law of
the coalescing brown in flowing right so
the harmonic measure flow is going to
converge to the coalescing Brownian flow
and that's because the harmonic measure
flow turns out to be one of these what
we've called disturbance flows so i
describe what a disturbance flow looks
like in general
suppose I take some basic disturbance so
it's causing I call it disturbance
because it's not quite the identity it's
a little disturbance of the identity so
so it looks like the identity for most
values of of theta between north and 2
pi but but then there's perhaps some
little region where it is not quite the
identity okay and suppose that I then
randomized this theta here I can sort of
move this up and down the line to vary
the value of theta okay so there's a
particular function G so that might be a
picture of G theta I specified G naught
and then G theaters is obtained from it
by translation so I fix the disturbance
g g naught ok and then i form a flow
just by iterating with random values of
theta ok so this is a random functions i
choose these theatres uniformly random
how will the point move under this flow
well for most of the time it doesn't
move very much because you're away from
the disturbance every now and again the
disturbance lands close to where you are
and you get moved a little bit and it's
symmetric so you just as likely to get
up as you are to go down ok so just
think about motion of one point what's
the scaling limit going to be well by
symmetry it's going to be Brownian
motion now what about putting two points
into this flow how are they going to
move what's going to be different times
that you move the two points provided
they're separated ok so they'll move as
independent Brownian motions until their
clothes and then when they're close
together they'll tend to get hit by the
city they'll get moved in the same way
by the disturbance
so no surprise and really not very
difficult to show at least for the kind
of finitely many points that the limit
object is is coalescing Brownian motions
okay so but in order to to get the
result we wanted it was necessary to
consider this limit at the level of the
flow is not just the level of finitely
many points ok so I'm so back to the
slide so you specify a disturbance you
get a disturbance flow you can do a sort
of diffusive rescaling of the flow which
is described here don't speak you just
kind of absorb it all but and look at
the flow on on various scales just as
when you prove you know convergence of
random walks to browning motion you can
get to work in a little score a hot
apology to understand that in as a the
rights apology there's a sort of score
ohad metric on on the flow space and in
that metric the the rescaled disturbance
flows converge weekly to the coalescing
Brownian flow ok so so the the limit of
disturbance flows so this is a kind of a
nice way to think it to realize the
coalescing banning flow in fact I guess
I should explain what this what is
criteria so the
one of them expresses that the size of
the disturbance is becoming small and
the size of the sterben siz smaller than
the scale at which we are trying to look
at the flow
ok now
the harmonic measure flow the flow of
the harmonic measure on the boundary of
the cluster turns out to be exactly one
of these disturbance flows and so it
convert these that flow converges to the
coalescing Brownian flow that in fact we
knew a long time ago the but then by
combining that with the sort of precise
location of the clusters which is given
by the by the other theorem we're able
to transfer that information about the
harmonic measure flow to the shapes of
the fingers in the cluster okay so this
slide is just saying that the harmonic
measure flow is converging to the
coalescing Brownian flow now I want to
talk about the the fingers if I take any
any point in the in the cluster there's
a nation of ancestry okay because the
particle attached to another particle
and you can trace back in time and watch
where your ancestors were okay and they
won't go sort of straight radially into
the into the unit circle they'll move
around a little bit so the finger of a
point is this ancestral line in space
and I drawn this picture in there's a
logarithmic scale there's also an escape
route associated with a point if I take
some point and attach a piece of thread
to it and then that thread leading out
of the clusters through the gaps between
the particles and I pull that thread
tight then I get a unique path from that
point out to infinity outside the
cluster okay so for any given point
there's a finger going in and there's an
escape route going out okay
like statements and circle owns this is
misleading because these have all been
distorted by the weather can form that
but essentially yes I mean the escape
routes will have line segments and also
bits which around particles yeah okay so
because we know essentially where all
the particles are by the earlier theorem
we can establish the limiting shapes of
the fingers and the gaps by referring
the particles to their theaters which
coming from the harmonic measure
so in the end it for example show that
if I take a finite collection of sort of
space-time starting points so those will
be you know points in this diagram and
and consider for each point the finger
going in and the escape route going out
so there are two pars associated which
starting point one going forwards in
time on going backwards in time so that
gives a probability measure on I guess
piles which you know finite collection
of paths which coalesce both when you go
forwards in time and they go back and
forwards in time and when they go
backwards in time because the you know
the fingers tend to coalesce but also
the escape routes tend to coalesce right
biggest but it's only to the gaps
velocity of it yeah so true
it's Thea theta from not to pi/2
collection of points to start from we
chase back the finger here and this
finger and this finger should I join up
with that one okay and good time cover
then use chase the escape routes for
this so you know the the cluster is is
is is all over the place right so your
escape which is very much constrained by
the cluster there are no big holes in
the cluster here's my escape route for
this one that alright so there's scape
foods coming out here there are more
escape you know that it's more
constrained than it looks by the picture
because I'm only money considering
finitely many points here but but here
are the escape routes coalescing I said
all of them well okay mr. your penis
some version as a scaling areas of
ah this is this is a picture which I'm
is this is a sketch of something which
is read off the cluster you sort of take
logs of the cluster and you okay but
then this converges in a weak sense to
the backwards and forward lines in the
coalescing Brownian flow that's the
theorem okay so we do understand that's
kind of the stochastic structure and so
you first second oh right so we
simulated the the limit law didn't
succeed in making it very much like so
this is a simulation of backwards and
falls lines in the coalescing banning
flow but exponentiated around the so
that the light blue ones go out and the
dark blue ones go in so if you could see
at each point there is a light blue line
going outwards and there's a dark blue
line going inwards and they all coalesce
right so that's supposed to look like
this one which is the Hastings levertov
simulation well
that's correct you have to imagine the
gaps sure sure but but okay so you can
just look at the dark blue lines you can
get the dark blue lines in there right
and that's supposed to look alike this
one considered in monochrome okay so
I'll stop that no I know roughly are not
the way who did it this is Amanda's
simulation but I mean I ok so it you
basically work out where each pixel goes
it so you know the the slip map
conformal map is something explicit
right it's certainly okay you can just
work it out I mean you know slip map is
for the upper half plane and you just
move around and you get the slip map for
the for the disk ok so that's something
you can ask your computer to do and you
can also get your computer to generate
new random theatres and then you compose
and you see where each point goes hey
you get a picture
a little bit historic perspective
because this picture was not met in this
high resolution hands on it was created
first in the lead at anything and so ten
years before instinctively Rita but that
this there was a talk the only trace had
left in the literature later makara out
of them were from Lisbon he is actually
the only trace of the literature is by a
guy in Greek Richard Roxburgh be the
target of mass conference the title was
actually stochastic movement which so
that's of course we know it's elias
different divisions in many ways the
generation of just composing people
fixed unfollow map with some fat mouth
with the computers were very name slow
wind
so if I glad to have sort of personal
riders to that that I mean I was just
thinking about what happens if you if
you take SLA in you and you drive it by
a possum run to measure all right and
then you and then you of course if you
increase the intensity the passing
around a measure you'd expect to get
back to the bag measure should issue if
you drive SLE but if you drive SLE by
the bag now you just get an expanding
disc nothing interesting so do you get
anything interesting when you drive it
by across on random measure when
actually you do even when the particle
size goes to zero eating when the kind
of effect of each little at them in the
measure goes to zero there's still
something stochastic left if you do
probably rescaling but of course we
noticed don't we look at the law of
large numbers and you do a proper
rescaling and these browning
fluctuations that they're not on the
scale of this cluster they are on on a
smaller scale here so so I okay I I I
reverse from the only from from the SLE
to do this but but but but then fell on
the fell on this older older idea
casting a Makarov I guess
do you think one please take this and
construct a model closer to a silly by
building this but still putting some you
know adding some artificial randomness
on the size of the fingers so in other
words if you look at an individual
finger the expected to look locally like
a dl a finger or just with different
different stretching at least a few
satellite construct will be la but maybe
something that will be a little more
like noon right building this and then
just run yeah it said that this urn
there's another work by the by the three
Turner Jansen Sola and Turner where they
investigate and a rotationally in
homogeneous version of this this story
so they they add particles of different
sizes are different angles and that and
that develops in a rather interesting
way I think so so you could have some
sort of you could side in advance some
sort of random why or what might even
try to think how could you drive that
randomness by I mean it would be the
nice thing to do perhaps would be to
sort of use stochastic fluctuations
which are kind of present in this to to
drive the in a sense putting alpha
positive is doing exactly this right so
that's the hard way to do it so you're
saying well you do it another way and
make it look like the LA yes I think
it's really good idea</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
