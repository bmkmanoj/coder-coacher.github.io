hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
hello and good morning it's a great
pleasure to be here i'm peter lee and
i'm the head of microsoft research USA
it is my great pleasure and honor to
introduce this morning's plenary speaker
dr. Herman Hauser dr. Hauser is a
physicist and I hope you won't hold that
against him he he's a kia physicists of
some some quite nice distinction holding
a PhD from the University Cambridge and
also a fellow of institute of physics
and the Royal Academy of Engineering but
what is equally interesting about dr.
Hauser are his entrepreneurial exploits
and in 1997 he founded on madea's
capital partners and from there founded
or co-founded numerous interesting and
winning technology companies may be one
of quite some note and possibly having
an impact in all of your lives is a coin
computers which spun out the arm
yesterday in discussions with dr. Hauser
I was really amazed to learn that last
month alone there were more arm chips
shipped than in the entire history of
Intel chips which is quite an amazing
fact and so the impact and
transformation of the world has been
quite stupendous of course there are
many other companies of note including
active book Toby varada Cambridge
network limited and many more in
recognition for all of his
accomplishments in the transformation of
technologies on society last year he
became a fellow of the royal society
today I think you should really look
forward to a talk from a man who has an
established record and a great nose for
technologies that are interesting
informational and maybe most importantly
of all winning and so please join me in
welcoming dr. Herman Hauser oh thank you
very much for this for these kind words
of introduction it's not actually last
month its last year that we sold nine
billion arms and I'll go into this a
little later only on the subject of
investing in successful companies I I'm
in the position of sharing with you the
secret that I learned of what really
makes a successful company since I'm one
of the very few people in the world who
has made more than 100 investments and
therefore arguably I have a better data
set than most and the secret that I want
to share with you is that it's random so
here is the pretentious part of title of
my talk you know it's the six wave is
really machine learning but you know the
pretentious way of thinking about it is
really reducing the the human a part of
the kamagra of complexity of whatever
you're doing so here is the content as
every good computer scientist when
you've got six waves of computing you
start with the zeroth then I'll talk
about the six about the clash of waves
you know people have been around for a
little while it's quite interesting that
in you Staind stand back and you look at
these waves that you can actually
discern wave characteristics that are
the same wave after wave after wave and
one of the most interesting ones is the
the change between the leading companies
in these waves and there is no historic
incidence or occasion where a lead
company in one wave ever makes a
significant contribution to the next
wave and I'll go into this when we talk
about the relationship between intel and
arm so let's start with the zeroth wave
and we're rebuilding the edge sac
some of you might know about the edge
tech is of course the world's first
computer there are so many people
claiming the world's first computer well
it's the first computer that was
designed for users hmm Ed's X stands for
electronic delay storage automatic
calculator some of you might know what a
computer was in those days of course it
was a person who did the computing so
these things were calculators was
constructed by a famous computer
scientist called Maurice Wilkes the main
memory in there was a mercury delay
lines it was also first computer that
stored programs there was a very another
famous professor at Cambridge called
David wheeler who invented the
subroutine and concepts like job queue
for example came from the exact because
there's a wonderful picture of people
queuing up with their paper tapes to put
the paper tape into the paper tape
reader and that was the job queue of the
people that cued up to do their paper
takes one interesting sort of statistic
on the edge sack is that it had 650 Apes
these are instructions per second not
MIPS as we're used to million
instructions per second which isn't a
lot although it clocked the ad megahertz
which is interesting of course it was a
serial computer one bit computer as one
of the reasons why it slowed down but
the other one was that the main memory
was this mercury delay line so the way
you executed the the next instruction or
you waited for the next data is you had
to wait for the sound waves in the in
the mercury delay line to make bullet
make it all the way around to get the
next datum so that's why at 650
instructions per second however arguably
at that time the increase in compute
power that was available to users was a
factor of fifteen hundred and arguably
this was the biggest step increase in
compute power that we ever had from when
we year to the next because you know
Moore's Law and factor of two every two
years or so but this was a
actor of 1500 over the the hand
computers that we had another important
aspect of the attack is you know the
fact that it really was constructed for
users not for computer scientists to do
demos and it actually contributed to
three Nobel prizes and here it is it's
of course vacuum tubes is this a laser
pointer neck here and you see the
mercury delay line it is really
remarkable how this work so this was the
only storage in in this design and the
way it's thought the data is there was
these long pipes of mercury and you
banged it at one end and there's this
wave this acoustic wave traveled to the
other end you know and there was a pH or
electric receiver and you could get the
date route and it held total storage
capacity of a kilobyte I thing but what
I really want to concentrate on today
talking about these six waves is the way
it felt to the user and that's where the
big shift is coming in and that's where
I think machine learning really is the
next step in the in the evolution of
computing because we're moving closer to
the human will will you know have
interfaces that are just better suited
to human interface but starting off the
user interface was not very human
friendly because the only way you could
put any data in there is with me a paper
tape the only way you could program it
was in machine code and the only help
you got expressing your thoughts is
David's wheel wheelers invention of the
subroutine you know somebody had to
invent the subroutine it was David so
it's a bit better you know if you if you
wanted to calculate squares and you had
a subroutine that the squares its safety
a little bit of time but not alone a lot
so here is there's the six real waves of
computing if you like mainframe mini
computer workstation personal computers
very unexpectedly smartphones and the
cloud have really become the main
computing platform now in terms of usage
and of course the whole talk is that the
the next big evolution in terms of the
usage of computing worldwide is this
ubiquitin ubiquitous computing sometimes
called the Internet of Things but
actually the key enabler the key driver
is the the ease of use that will result
from machine learning so let's take a
whistle-stop tour of what what happened
so far some of you might remember the
IBM 370 it cost about a million pounds
there were about a thousand of them per
year and note those two there they're
sort of wave characteristics everything
roughly changes back by an order of
magnitude as we go through the waves
nessus interesting pendulum between
multi-user computers where the computing
is done somewhere centrally and then
personal computers where you do the
computing locally the way you interfaced
with it was first punch cards than
terminals and there was a very
interesting lock in effect and this is a
wave characteristic you start off with a
bunch of companies it was literally the
bunch burroughs UNIVAC NCR control data
i think and honeywell but you often end
up with a monopoly in this case IBM and
I remember me Rob Wilmot who ran ICL the
British computer company at the time
complaining bitterly that there was no
way of attacking IBM because IBM had the
the the the hardware interface to the
dasty disk and they weren't allowed to
use that interface and you may remember
the court cases at the time that finally
forced IBM to open up the bass the
interface specification and whenever
you've got these court cases and you'll
see where I'm going through the waves
you can see them now this normally marks
the end of a wave and when somebody wins
the court case against IBM here or
against other companies now it just
shows the end of a way if that actually
it has become irrelevant and no
the thing is really becoming a new
driver so what was the user interface to
these mainframes well it was punch cards
and teletypes in terms of the input but
what what the user saw really was
Fortran and COBOL and maybe some science
libraries you know when I was a PhD
student but doing my PhD I used you know
splice functions and things that they
made available and of course on the
business side it was the business forums
but then came the mini computer again
dominated by a company called deck
absolutely wonderful company at the time
if anybody had said the deck was going
to get into trouble with the domination
of many computers that they had all the
bright people that they had it was
completely laughable and yet deck is no
more so what happened price reduced by a
factor of 10 from a million to 100,000
units went up by a factor of 10 from
1,000 per annum to 10,000 per annum but
really the the most important thing was
the widening of the use of computers and
changes in the user interface so the
videos appeared cat tools appeared both
mechanical electrical and software tools
of course this was the time when the
when the the car industry started
adopting mechanical cat tools and some
of that actually happened in in
Cambridge most of the BMW or Mercedes
cars are produced with software that was
actually invented in Cambridge and
networks appeared like the ethernet but
then there was a new bel jou jou called
a workstation and this is the iconic
computer of the time of course the sun
sparc station which was really a sort of
development of the the alto at xerox
parc pen and same thing happened again
price went down by a factor of 10 units
went up by a factor of 10 and the use
space widened there's also the first
appearance of risk in in the workstation
n and if you look at the user interface
the desktop appeared with the mouse it
became a sort of impersonal machine
really more than multi-user machine and
there was this this famous 3m concept i
think it was first basket who were
characterized that one MIPS 1 million
instructions per second one megabyte of
memory and one megapixel of display so
that you had a high quality display that
and some people added a fourth which was
a mega penny and again ethernet played
an important role and then unexpectedly
the personal computer appeared and if
you allow me a little trip down memory
lane this is my first company acorn
computers which produced the BBC micro
and although arm is probably the company
that I'm best known for as the The
Godfather of the arm it's actually the
BBC micro that I'm most proud of because
it became the standard in British
schools and created a whole generation
of programmers in Britain's at the time
we arguably had more programmers and
more people were being taught
programming than any other country in
the world and many of our games
companies or companies like autonomy
Mike Lynch still remembers the all the
assembler codes for the 65 or two which
was the microprocessor at the time and
those of you are interested that this
period of history there is actually a
BBC docudrama as they call it called
micro men which which shows what
happened during that period there's a
very interesting follow on to the BBC
micro which is called Raspberry Pi that
has when the Raspberry Pi people came to
me and said look this is this is really
what we need of the BBC micro that
educates people on how to use computers
how to use hardware how to create the
next generation
programmers not just in Britain in the
world we want to have this $25 a
computer that can do everything that you
know computers do I they asked me for
advice and my advice was this is a
stupid idea first of all you've got to
change the name nobody will ever
remember Raspberry Pi it's a stupid name
and secondly why would people want to
buy $25 computers that you know that
look like a bear circuit board of course
I so often my predictions were totally
wrong Raspberry Pi has actually become a
fantastic brand we expected to as we did
with the BBC back sure we expected to
sell about ten to one hundred thousand
in the first year well they've sold well
over over a million it's become a real
phenomenon lots of people are building
lots of things around the Raspberry Pi
the PI by the way stands for for Python
say actually you should have a why but
anyway and and and it's great success is
very very sick sizing however the
aconnick product during the pc wave was
this machine the IBM pc and to just give
you a feeling for how and this is not
very long ago on how primitive this
machine was look at the user interface
here this is what you saw when you
switched in IBM pc there's a green
screen it was a command line there
wasn't really any any desktop yet
because windows hadn't had the period
but the most the best demonstration of
how fast our computers have developed
and how fast hardware has improved
really is the main storage of this
computer there are two floppy disk in
there does anybody remember the memory
capacity of a floppy disk no it was
about two hundred kilobytes so both of
them would give you four hundred
kilobytes which was
total main storage of the pc just to
remind you this is not enough to hold a
single picture that you take with your
mobile phones every day you couldn't
store a single picture in the entire
computer so again wave characteristics
price went down by a factor of 10 22 a
killer dollar numbers went up to 100
million again by a factor of a hundred
the interesting thing was that the use
case changed again and productivity
tools became the driver of computer
sales as of course you know very well
with office and I remember going to
Esther dysons conference and we had
where these conferences were all about
feature wars and the feature was were
between the different productivity tools
War was between lotus 123 and Microsoft
Excel and every every year you know bill
would get up and said this is what Excel
now doesn't so much better than lotus
123 and then Mitch Kapoor gets up and
says that i know we now have a better
lotus 123 because you know we can do
pivot tables or something so this this
was fascinated the pc industry again
something that do you think you know
what's the big deal it's not really
where the action is or was what's
interesting but this was what where the
action was and what was interesting at
the time we also towards the end of the
personal computer wave as always we have
almost malapa lee suppliers in this case
intel on the cpu and of course Microsoft
with Windows but what's the user
interface which has come a little bit
closer to the human there's the desktop
user interface office I talked about but
it's not such office there was then a
great plethora of heavyweight
applications I would say like Photoshop
or inner again care applications but
then a new thing happened which
completely changed the base of of pcs
which was the Internet in the browser
and things that you could do on top of
that and of course Google research in
their social but we're also a
breakthroughs again that of course you
know a lot about like connect you know
people got used to the mouse and the and
the keyboard but to be able to interface
with the computer through gestures and
and and in your body was really
something quite revolutionary and and it
is wonderful what you've done with the
Kinect introducing this to the computing
environment there is no thing that's
happening with a company called to be
that we have made an investment in just
to disclose this clearly and this is eye
tracking it will be is the world's
leading eye tracking company with about
fifty percent market share it's a little
company 50 million dollar company not
not a start-up anymore and for for over
a decade they have refined this this
ability to track your eyes eye tracking
is actually not the correct term the
correct term is gaze tracking because it
doesn't track your eyes it actually
tracks where you look and again along
the path of making computers closer to
humans I tracking or gaze tracking turns
out to be very important in human to
human interactions because you know if I
gave the talk like this it you know you
you and I would feel uncomfortable about
this you just expect me to look at you
and I expect you to look at me but you
don't always do it so the next next big
wave which really and then these waves
always come left field this is another
interesting thing the reason why the
incumbents why the the monopoly
suppliers towards an end of the wave
always missed the next wave is that it's
an always unexpected wave and who would
have thought that phones would become
the main computing environment it was
just a very alien thought because that's
what computers where computers where in
our laptops towards the end of the but
this guy you know not the nicest guy
when you've met him but in he almost
single-handedly really revolutionized
the the phone industry with the with the
iphone so let's go back to the wave
characteristics price well went down to
zero you can get a phone for free now if
you're willing to sign up to a contract
numbers again went up by a factor of 10
from hundreds of millions to now
billions last year it was about one and
a half billion a use case widened voice
of course was the starting point with
phones but with smartphones i I think it
has just happened that more people now
access the internet by a smartphone that
pcs and then again very unexpected crap
video from YouTube became became the
main application that's what people do
with you know that time is which these
silly videos and consume all our our
bandwidth but you know it's that's what
happens and that's what they're willing
to pay money for so but it's really
everything that you sort of want to do
in the end the key enabler of that was
the fact that you have it in your pocket
so one of the one of the better thoughts
that I had in my life favorite if I say
so myself I was when I was vice
president of research for olivetti in
the days of olive 80s hey days when
Olivia was the number one PC producer in
the US and I in the in the in Europe and
I categorized computers not by their CPU
or memory or even a user interface or
software but I categorized them by where
they lived so it was the computers that
lived in the air-conditioned room the
computers that lift at the desktop the
computers will have lived in the in the
briefcase which where the laptops
the computers that I thought we're going
to live in here so they're wearing your
jacket I was wrong they actually live in
a pocket you know their smartphones and
then the computers that live on your
wrist and maybe we'll just see that
around the corner gives a lot talk about
I watches or these nike bands which are
really very primitive and there could be
a lot more interesting and they I think
they will be next year so one of the
many ways i weighed made incorrect
projections was this thing about mobile
phones and europe remember just a few
years back europe had it all we had a
company that had provided forty percent
of the world's phones with nokia it was
a totally dominant deep dominant mobile
phone company not only that we dominated
and still do the infrastructure ericsson
is the number one provider of mobile
infrastructure in the world and that at
that time I thought that with a Symbian
we had a reasonable operating system
that could dominate that as well so I
was convinced that it was Europe's time
in the Sun and we are going to take this
away from America that is normally the
technology lead and I was wrong because
Apple completely changed the game and
Europe which of course had the leading
infrastructure as well you must not
forget 3g first rolled out well visible
is a European technology and was filled
first rolled out in Europe so we
actually had the better mobile
infrastructure for a very long time also
better data infrastructure again that
has moved to the US with 4G and LTE very
satisfyingly for for me as The Godfather
of the arm is that when the wave changed
from the pc to the smartphone wave there
was a change in processor as well from
intel to arm and i'll go into this in
the moment
this is a smartphone on steroids which
is all the tablets are it is not a
shrunk down pc actually it's a you know
a smartphone on steroids most tablets
that being shipped at the moment are
basically have a smartphone architecture
and there is a new entrance to the
computing environment because the
smartphone itself is is really a
hopeless computer and a useless computer
that nobody would would really pay the
amount of money for that they are
worried not for the mobile data
connectivity back to data centers so
really all the interesting things that
smartphones are used for happen in there
and as you see there preferably built in
places where there is a lot of snow
because the number one problem that data
centers I have now is not performance is
not storage its energy consumption and
that is one of the reasons why at arm
we're also very keen to produce server
CPUs and you'll see a number of
arm-based servers also appearing in data
center for the sole reason of a much
lower power consumption on both HP and
Dell now produce arm based service but
there's also again a move towards the
human in the in the user interface so
voice recognition has really become good
enough now to be useful a serious a good
example but any of you who know a little
Cambridge company called EV which is a
much better version of Siri because it
has you know a fancy ontology of 20,000
concepts and can as I've demonstrated to
some of you and happy to demonstrate it
later to those of you who were
interested you you can ask it questions
like who was president of the United
States when Obama was a teenager not
only is it very impressive that it
cognizes your your voice you know
because it's this quite a fancy sentence
but disambiguating or interpreting what
what this means and giving you the right
answer is you know is interesting that
you can do this on a on a mobile phone
now but there's also been a revolution
with touch as as you well know and I
tracking is about to I think make a
major entry into user interfaces we're
beginning to see it with the galaxy for
whether it's very very primitive eye
tracking as you probably know if you
look away from a galaxy for it shuts
down and since power consumption and
battery life is such a key thing that's
actually quite a nice thing to have the
other thing that's nice is if you you
know if you come towards the bottom of
what you're reading wouldn't it be nice
if it scrolled up well I tracking can do
it for you but not only do we have touch
and with I tracking we're actually
beginning to have lots of other things
that make a smart phones much more
usable accelerometers GPS maps and an
explosion of apps there are now I think
over 650,000 apps both on the on the
iphone and on on Android and the browser
of course has become a sort of main
interface of doing interesting things
with smartphone and you know the story
about the search and and social and a
new phenomenon has come up one of the
things I always look for when making an
investment in a company is whether
whether they're clean interface is both
at the top and at the bottom in at the
top so is their clean interface to the
suppliers that the company buys things
from and is there a clean interface in
terms of selling their products that
people can build things on on top off
and it's it's very this Facebook home
thing is an interesting new phenomenon
where a company that is you know quite
widely known and widely used is got a
billion you
users may be able to recruit all the
infrastructure that has been built up
from you know hardware to software
operating systems browsers everything
and just do the top layer and pinch the
the user from all the people that have
done the hard work underneath whether it
really will be as successful as they
hope or not I don't know but the fact
that it is possible to put a veneer on
top and pretend to the user that what
they're using is actually all facebook
went really they've they've just done a
tiny tiny sliver on the top is an
interesting new phenomenon Twitter of
course is another one I have a very
exciting little investment in a company
called DataSift in in the UK which has
access to the entire Twitter fire hose
and but and they they give you an answer
within a hundred milliseconds to the
following questions so they've got very
very fancy filters on the entire fire
hose on all the tweets in the world
they'll be able to tell you who in Ohio
male between 25 and 45 has just seen a
Mitt Romney ad and did a negative or
positive tweet about it and this was of
some interest to the Obama campaign but
it does it in real time it also has two
years of history of the of the tweets
now and can use a slider to go back in
time over two years to see when Mitt
Romney ads had run in the past or when
Nike had a an ad in in the past and how
people reacted to that and and plot the
time series and it's actually the time
series that might be of greater interest
than the single data point however the
biggest thing in my opinion going
forward and again you know it's very
difficult to make predictions especially
if it's about a future is about health
you know we all care a lot about our own
health and the health of our of our
loved ones and for the first time
I think the whole computing
infrastructure will make a huge
difference to both health costs but also
our ability to provide health support
for people for healthy lives you're just
beginning to see it with health sensors
on mobile phones and that do heart rate
they too you know you're running speeds
they they do ECG vinodh showed me I'm
Vinod Khosla showed me a very
interesting very impressive application
where you basically take your two thumbs
at the back of a of a smartphone and on
the front you get really quite an
accurate ECG a glucose levels etc but
the important thing is it's 24 7 you can
do you can measure all these things 24-7
and my my guess so my gut feel is that
the that the the really interesting
thing going forward is not the time
series 24 7 of say your heart rate or
your glucose level or your your blood
gas your blood gas levels but the
changes in the vector so it's really the
signature of maybe half a dozen of these
very simple health parameters that that
might contain the really useful
information for you and it's that where
machine learning I think we'll have a
field day because we'll have the data
you know we'll have these time series
people haven't had these time series I
mean even even a 24-7 heart rate time
series is quite hard to get hold of if
this becomes automated because it's just
one of the things that people buy with
their smartphones and all of a sudden
you've got thousands and millions of
them just imagine what machine learning
can do with that especially if it's
correlated with you know glucose levels
blood respiration you're running rate or
whatever because you know if your heart
rate goes up because you just
running up at the stairs you know what's
the big deal of course it has it does
but when your heart rate really you know
your heart starts racing and you're
sitting by a desk and what what is going
on why is this so i think that's that's
very exciting and we do have one example
of this already i don't know how many of
you heard that lovely story of Syria the
people in Scotland compared a complained
bitterly about Siri not working very
well in Edinburgh and they rang up a
nuance and said you know why does this
not work for a Scottish accent and they
said just wait a few weeks and of course
what happens is the speech recognition
is not done in Edinburgh or on your
smartphone the speech recognition is
done in boston at at new yours and they
are collecting all the speech samples so
as siri as more and more people have
used Syrian voice recognition in
Edinburgh it collected all the speech
samples from the Scottish people and
could tune itself to when they is so
another one coming in from Edinburgh
than di is one of those funny guys you
know and I know if you lose it so you
know the data sets are important so
let's come to the meat of the torque
which is why I think machine learning
you know it's I've got a really hard
task here I've got to convince you that
machine learning is very important for
machine for the computing industry same
story again it's not 1,000,000,000 but
tens of billions of things are per year
it's all about Big Data interesting
point about the price you know I I told
you phones are available at zero cost
really so where do you go from there you
can't really go below zero well in a way
you can and the thing that is happening
with the price in the Internet of Things
in the in the ubiquitous thing is that
the price actually is no longer
associated with with the computing
element the price is the thing that
you'd buy anyway like a car or or
glasses that you need or
you know or a thermostat it's just that
now it has these these nice new
functionalities that that make it really
useful because it becomes part of the
environment and and the machine-learning
bit is is is is you know just listing a
few of them and then i'll talk about
biology which i think is that is the
really exciting bit but before we go on
to that peterlee provided this slide for
me which is the only slide I've managed
to dig up on software complexity because
this thing is all about complexity as
well if you remember my pretentious part
of my talking in the beginning and there
are lots and lots of graphs that I can
show you on the exponential growth of
processing power of memory of a
networking speeds but it's very hard to
get hold of of slides on software
complexity and the red one is integrated
circuits and that seems to be something
very magic about a billion you know once
you get above a billion things get
really interesting be in neurons billion
instructions per second gigabyte you
know a gigabit per second things get
interesting and we're just getting to
the billion you know the the latest xeon
processor leads valla a billion lines of
code I understand Windows is now 60
million lines of code and interestingly
you see that the design integration in
texting in months it's actually being
quite constant so we've made fantastic
progress with with tools to allow this
additional complexity to not a cripple
the the production of it with one
exception which is the aerospace
industry which is the the glue bit
though the green bit by the way is the
is the car industry which is interesting
they're actually doing very complex
things but they're doing it more and
more efficiently here you've got the
google glasses which i'm very excited
about
and the thing that excites me about it
is not the first version which I'm
wearing here but the one with eye
tracking because if and I don't know how
many of you followed the google glasses
but it's it's not glasses that give you
a virtual reality or are things that you
or augmented reality but it's a it's a
display up here on the right that you
look up that's where i have this funny
look on my face and and the thing that
I'm really excited about is actually
that with eye tracking this allows you
to make selections not in a virtual
world but in the real world so if I look
at the light here I might get the menu
of things that I can do with the light
so I can turn it down and can switch it
off when I look at the TV I can change
the channel if i look at the air
conditioning you know i can change the
temperature etc so it allows a more
human interface with with the real world
similar thing with the google car or
with lots of cars that that now appear
that can drive themselves you know
there's there's tremendous amount of
machine learning but also a tremendous
amount of data that needs available
because google currently is which I
which I drove in recently can only drive
along roads where there is a lot of good
Street Street you information and in a
very iconic little Silicon Valley
company that there's thermostats yeah
you know you've got out of thermostat
but this one learns you know whenever
you you tweakin it remembers what would
you have done so what is the big what's
the big deal about machine learning well
it really makes the makes the the
Internet of Things the everyday things
that your interact with so far much more
user-friendly much more human but the
big thing which is the rest of my talk
is the the effect this will have on
health so quickly stepping back and
looking at the clashes between these
waves why does the new wave always win
over the old one higher volume lower
price performance good enough it
need to be as good as the the best
performance of the last wave new and
more apps and new users and more human
at pc mobile phone is just the the
change that we're seeing right now and
the last point here is actually an
interesting one who would have thought
that SD cards would become the main
storage device but 64 gigabytes hey ya
can do lots of things with 64 gigabytes
Intel versus arm is a risk versus sisk
story actually and the only reason why
the arm exists is that we went to Intel
and I asked them if we could have the
286 which we thought was a you know
perfectly reasonable process processor
they just screwed out the pin out
because they put both the address and
the database on the same pins and we
said nobody can make a sensible computer
out of that but if you give us the chip
itself will do our own pin out and maybe
we can make something of it and they
said get lost so we said well you get
lost will do our own it's the only
reason where the arm exists and then I
gave two advantages to the design team
that neither Intel nor motorola nor Andy
ever managed to give to their design
teams and the two advantages we're
number one I gave them no people so it's
the only processor in the world that was
designed by two people albeit very smart
ones different Sophie Wilson and the
second advantage I gave them was no
money because we didn't have any so the
only way they could do this is keep it
really really simple this the arm the
original arm was 30,000 transistors
which was the same number of transistors
as the Zed Zed 80 at the time which was
the main 8-bit processor the difference
was that we managed to get 20 times the
performance out of those 30,000
transistors that the z80 dids it was a
real architectural breakthrough which
led to a world record of making us the
world record holder of MIPS per watt
which was not a design team it was a
design goal it was a side effect I mean
our econ computers were mains powered we
didn't care about the power of the of
the processor but it was so so simple
and if you allow me one anecdote where
we actually may
after you know the arm came back and I
bought two bottles of champagne in
expectation that the arm would work
first time it just shows the naivety we
had at the time this was completely new
processor never run before we put it in
the circuit board and and two hours
after this chip arrived it said hello
world I am an arm which meant the
process of work the instructor said
worked the the basic interpreter that we
wrote of an instructional set that we
never had worked well enough to end the
video interface mary worked well enough
that an hour after the processor that
had never existed before arrived as its
first piece of silicon own and up there
and i open the bottles of champagne and
we were all very happy about that and
then we measured the power consumption
so we unsold at the the power pin put an
amp meter between the power pin and the
power supply and measured it and the
recording was zero so we thought well
you know as a physicist you you don't
believe measurements like that and he
said why would that be and then we
realized that the power pin actually
wasn't connected to anything it was a
fault on the on the board there was no
power there going to the ship so why did
it work and he also was that the leakage
currents from from the database and all
the other buses was enough to power up
with the chip and make it work so we
knew we were on a good thing on the
power consumption section so Intel
versus arm well we we have a good marker
chair in mobile phones now and add you
know if you if you round it up if you're
a mathematician and you you ran things
up if they're more than point five we
actually have a hundred percent market
share in in 2012 we shipped over 9
billion arms which is more than people
on earth and more than bin intel has
shipped in its entire history we have an
ambition of shipping over 100 billion in
the next ten years and if you multiply
09 by 10 this is not an impossible task
it's our first 20 billion dollar company
about the thing that people
least realize is that although arm has
become the world's most successful IP
company if you translate this into
dollars because we know exactly the
value of arm chips that are being
shipped through 330 licensees now the
value of the ARM chip uber took intel
sales in the year 2010 so even in dollar
terms arm is now a more important
architecture than the Intel Architecture
and these are all the ice licenses by
the way spot in the middle of it Intel
Intel is also a licensee of arms the
only microprocessors that they've ever
licensed in so I end up on biology as
some of you might have followed encode
which i think is possibly the most
important publication this century it's
a nature publication basically brought
about by another investment of mine
called celexa you'll know about Moore's
law which is the white line the cost of
gene sequencing followed Moore's law
very accurately for a very long time
until two outstanding profs at Cambridge
Shankar balasubrahmanyam and David
Clemen invented sequencing by synthesis
which was is the celexa technology which
we sold to alumina and look at this it
reduced the cost of doing a human genome
from ten million dollars to now just
above a thousand dollars so it's a
factor of 10,000 in five years I've
never seen anything like it the result
of this was a total explosion of
available information genomic data
information it's here is a slide that
John West who who ran celexa for us
produced for me it's 22 petabytes a year
so this is one of the reasons why I'm
become such a believer in machine
learning we do not have enough people on
earth to analyze this data we've got to
have automatic ways of making these gene
Association studies with phenotypes so
why am I so excited about encode but
well it explains what eighty percent of
DNA does just to remind you when we did
the first genome sequence in the famous
announcement with Bill Clinton and in
Tony Blair when we finally had the first
sequence of the human genome that
explained what one percent of the DNA
does because only one percent of the DNA
gets translated it's a big sit sit there
are 32 Institute's that contributed to
that so big science is alive you know
just enormous amounts of data really
good stuff here but interestingly they
also used machine learning techniques so
one of the most interesting bits is that
they have defined seven states of the
DNA and one interesting one is that w/e
it's the week enhancement thing that
nobody really expected to pop up in the
classification analysis of anchored
these weak enhancers are you sure you
remember the genes are sort of regulated
by promoter sites just in front of those
jeans and then there are enhancers there
a little bit upstream from from the
promoter sites that enhance the the gene
expression but there are weak enhancers
there are about a hundred million base
pairs away from it but they're still
clusters so there's still enhancers that
have a significant they would not have
shown up had it not been for machine
learning and then there's there's a fun
story to tell with a seminar that I run
in Cambridge where I like mixing up
computer scientists with biologists and
Chris came to the last one just two
weeks ago and we learned the following
thing from shankha analyst and shank
Apollo subramanya and one of the people
who did celexa with me he discovered a
way of distinguishing between HM sista
as I to say there's another four basic
pairs only one of them gets modified to
affect epigenetic things and later on
they found out that they don't just get
methylated there is an additional
modification that can happen which is
hydroxy methylation which enhances gene
expression again where methylation
inhibits it there are thousand papers
out there on methylation of cytosine
most of them say well its inhibitory but
some of them say well we see some
enhancing effects as well now all these
papers were published before it was
known that there was actually a
modification to this methylation there
was also an edge m version of cytosine &amp;amp;
Schanker just a few months ago found a
way of clearly distinguishing between
these two states so what do you do with
all the papers the thousands of papers
that are out there some of which clearly
will be wrong because they thought they
had an MC when actually they were doing
their research on HM see you know how do
you go back to the data the data
themselves might still be interesting
it's just the conclusion was wrong so
what you need is an evidence engine so
if any of you are willing to engage in
in this evenin maybe it's frivolous
instantiation of wood what I call a sort
of TV evidence engine or a TV veracity
engine which I would like to see where
you at the bottom of the TV screen you
have a little graph that goes between 0
&amp;amp; 1 when politicians talk and one means
that you know what they say is you can
actually find some evidence for zeros
you find some evidence against what
they've just said and I'm sure most of
it it would be at half because you can
find neither evidence for or against
what they have said because most of that
talk is content free as we know so it
wouldn't it be nice to have that in
real-time speech recognition certainly
is good enough to do that and I think we
ought to be able to find evidence for or
against in real time I just want to end
my talk with one of the reasons why
God's so interested in in machine
learning and it's gas ian processes and
it's this unicycle that Karl Rossmann
produced this unicycle knows nothing
about physics the only thing it knows
about is that it's good to stay upright
ins a bad idea to fall over the control
engineers have been trying to make
progress with that doing all the fancy
differential equations and
gotten anywhere and kyle has a gaussian
process with 18 parameters and as you
can see on trial number five this thing
stays out for an amazing period of time
so this convinced me that here we've got
something which humans are very good at
and when it comes to writing a bicycles
we are the kings it's very hard to make
a computer ride a bicycle very well here
we've got a machine learning environment
that for the first time can learn how to
ride a unicycle faster than a human so I
told you a little bit about the attack
six ways of computing the clashes
between these waves and that you know
they are significant that in my opinion
machine learning is the sort of key
technique that will unlock the six wave
and if any of you is interesting
interested in building the evidence
engine that I described I'm I would be
happy to finance it thank you very much
well thank you that's really very
interesting I think we have some time
for for a few questions maybe if I can
start I was struck early in the talked
where you've made a little jab at the
old feature wars in the PC wave so is
there something equally distracting
today are there things that we're
focusing on too much today that well if
you there quite a few of these for
example well it's just seeing the end of
it that people buy pcs on the clock rate
of the processor I think it was Butler
in a conversation yesterday that says
you know is it important that we have
more and more processing power and the
answer is probably no because the
important thing is you need to reach a
certain threshold and once you're above
that threshold this really doesn't
become the key issue anymore as one of
the reasons for the success of the arm
there is no doubt that the Intel
processor is a more powerful processor
but is it really needed you know can you
do most of the things that you can do
with an hour and there are lots of these
stories also in software and the
environment and you know cameras &amp;amp; and
videos great so questions yes XD
now this is a great talk thank you and
we all agree machine learning is
important for the application where
would you actually bed on the
application for the next big wave health
thank you any other questions
everyone's just elaborate on that the
reason why I say this is one is in
biology it's so hard to get solid data
and genomic data knives very solid you
know we really can call base pairs with
great accuracy we can get these phantom
these snips and you know it's one of the
few things where a whole you know
science like biology all of a sudden
found a very sound hard data set and on
the other said on the other hand we've
got the enormous amount of medical
records which characterize phenotypes so
you've got two humongous data sets and
we don't really know how to how to link
them up and there isn't enough
brainpower in humans you know in enough
humans to do that so doing that
correlation and you know starting off
with Association studies but there is a
lot more apologies and says the
Association studies i think is where the
real meat is because if you look at the
amount of money that people are willing
to spend on their own health it will you
know make our spend on computers or
anything else pale into insignificance
that's why the money is you know each
during your talk each wave was getting
more and more human so to speak and so
health certainly goes in that direction
that another one that some people might
argue would be towards social so Casey
do you see that also yes absolutely well
yeah you know Facebook of course and
Twitter a good good examples of that but
how much money would you spend on social
compared on your own health if you knew
that it works at the moment and only of
you know about that rather distressing
statistic that if you take a drug any
drug on average it works on thirty
percent of you and seventy percent of
the time it it either doesn't work or
you get negative side effects is one of
the dirty secrets of the of the drug
industry right yes there's a question
Herman yeah very exciting talk very
optimistic but there's no sign in you
talk about the sort of dark side the
malware the botnets Stuxnet cyber
warfare what's your take on that very
worried i I didn't J since I'm a
perennial optimist I don't dwell on this
but there are two things that really
worried me one it is all that dark cyber
security thing and as you know the cyber
attacks such as exponentially increasing
and it's actually one of our investment
focuses is cyber security and the trust
zone in in the arm is an initiative that
we started ten years ago to help with
that because you really also want a
hardware anchor for for whatever you do
in cyber security but there is there
isn't there is another thing which is
drones you know drones are so easy to
build now again like with you know with
a with a with a facebook home page
although the building blocks are out
there so if you're a smart guy you can
build yourself a drone for a few hundred
dollars now if you can build Joan for a
few hundred dollars you can build
thousands of trends and then you know
make them do things together like you
know invade a city or something and
India just can't shoot them all down so
there are quite a few scenarios which
are quite worrying a general way of
expressing this fear is is one of
intrinsic timescales a trinsic time
constants and this is something this is
the thought that I I actually first had
some 20 years ago at a Harvard sending
seminar where it struck me and in it's
obvious that when did you think about it
that whenever you want to control
anything you've got to have levers with
time constants they're shorter than the
system that you're trying to control and
what we've done here is we've put so
much effort in energy and money
into building a system that has shorter
and shorter time constants so things can
happen faster and faster and faster but
we have not made almost any investment
in investing in the levers that will
allow us to stop the system going awry
you know in all kinds of ways at that
time 20 years ago I thought of you know
a mad Israeli or other tank commander
you know it needs to be somebody who is
a bit mad but also very intelligent you
know putting out on the on the internet
you've seen this horrible thing that has
just happened send me a hundred dollars
and I sorted out and you know a few
minutes later he's got a hundred million
dollars and with a hundred million
dollars you can do a lot of damage of
building you know a thousand drones or
so sorry i've gone gone on for long
enough there are lots of bad scenarios i
think we have time for one more question
yes thanks for you talk so every wave is
defined by both the user interface a
soft well I usage and a hardware and i
was wondering in general is there one of
those three elements that leaves the way
and begs the need for the other two so
do we have new years user interface and
from these new user interfaces we can
think of new usages which begs the need
for new hardware or do we have advances
in hardware which suddenly opens the way
for new I think you such as I think the
right way to think about it this is this
threshold way you know probably under
are the layers below good enough so they
can build whatever you want to build on
top of it and but the really exciting
bit is the appearance of new user
interfaces or new AP is where and that's
why rather cheekily talked about the
kolmogorov complexity in the beginning
of the talk that what you really want is
you want a model you want a set of
you'll be able to express yourself at
such a high level that with with very
few you know commands you can rely on
the
system doing the right thing for you and
you can express yourself at the very
high level so you shift the complexity
towards the system away from what you
have to do and and figuring out the
clever clean interfaces that allow you
to do that I think is the is the agenda
well with that thank you very much and I
guess we'll all be looking for our next
great investments thank you
