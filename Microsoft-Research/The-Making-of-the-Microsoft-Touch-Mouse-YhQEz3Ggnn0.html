mouse but it extends beyond that it's
combining being able to touch the
computer interact with it with something
everybody's familiar with which is the
mus one of the favorite things about
touch mouse is that doesn't have too
many features I mean really there's a
little etching that let the user know
where the sensor is but other than that
it's basically a clean slate and so you
get the chance to sort of work with your
computer in a new way being able to do
things better than you could do them
without the spouse microsoft touch mouse
initially started as a research project
collaboration between Microsoft Research
and the Applied Sciences group and PC
hardware for the first time I think in
Microsoft hardware they're actually
dealing with the device a hardware
device that's more complex software wise
than hardware wise our initial prototype
for touch mouse was called cap mouse and
it's part of our mouse to point no
project where we investigated many
different mice our team first got
involved making a prototype of the
software that would allow more people to
use the touch mouse so it could be
evaluated for research purposes as we
transition this into a product we
recruited more help from microscopy
search and Cambridge things move forward
and it looked like it was going to turn
into a product then we actually took the
existing code base that we put together
to support the research and decided to
use that as a basis for all the product
work that we put together the microsoft
touch mouse is a very tight integration
of a hardware system in a software
system the team is right now really
composed of the Microsoft hardware and
my crease urch both of them are doing
different parts in there we really have
collaborated closely both with the
researchers of on both sides of the
Atlantic and also with the hardware team
we actually remained on the project as
partners as as equal contributors
throughout this process if I had to
summarize the collaboration
amazon one word it would be unparalleled
it's just unique and nothing like any of
my experiences in Microsoft
collaboration on the touch mouse
development has really been a team
acting as one I guess you'd call it more
virtual team than just the collaboration
collaboration sort of a loser a loser
version of what we're doing for this
project this has really been the most
fun project to work on largely because
the people I've gotten to collaborate
with I think the only thing that I could
say at this point is say cheers we did
it
