hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
thank you for coming my name is Amy
graves and I'm pleased to welcome
Itamar Simonson to our Microsoft
Research visiting speaker series
Itamar is here today to discuss his book
absolute value when consumers base their
decisions on reviews from other users
price comparison apps and other
technologies the current mantra is about
branding and loyalty are losing their
relevance
Itamar is the Sebastian s Kresge
professor of marketing at Stanford
University Graduate School of Business
his work has been featured in many
publications and outlets including the
New York Times and The Washington Post
he is recognized as one of the world's
leading experts on consumer decision
making please join me in giving them a
very warm welcome
thank you Amy and good afternoon I like
to talk today about what influences
customers in the age of nearly perfect
information but we before we get there
let's let's take a minute to review what
we used to believe about consumers in in
in the beginning the assumption was that
consumers are generally rational but
because they often cannot assess the
quality of things marketers could
influence their choices using
advertising and branding and loyalty
building and all the other topics that
are covered in the marketing text book
then about 25 years ago it got a little
more interesting there are more and more
studies that we've done and others have
done started showing that consumers
often behave or make decisions that
appeared irrational in fact that's what
where I spent the first 20 years of my
career before I started revising my
opinions here is an article that I
published in the New York Times in
1994 so that will be 20 years ago and I
think that the title the heading tells
you what it was about and who I thought
was in control today I'm only going to
talk about a couple of examples of what
led me to write this particular article
and so here in this is an effect first
demonstrated at Duke University in early
80s here is an example from one study
that we did around 1990 some consumers
are asked to choose between six dollars
this fairly elegant cross pen other
consumers are asked to choose between
six dollars same cross pen in another
pen
that most people almost all people find
less attractive what happens virtually
no one chooses the Schafer but they
share of people who select the cross pen
over the six dollars in other words
they're willing to pay six dollars for
the cross pen significantly increases
okay here is another example that we did
around that time - microwave ovens one
is more expensive than than the other
and has more features both of them are
on sale 35% off now we add another one
this one which is more expensive but in
any case this particular Panasonic is
only 10% off
same deal so now you got here two
Panasonic's you would think that you
added another Panasonic it's probably
going to steal more share from this
Panasonic but not so actually this ship
this Panasonic makes this one looks
attractive because this is 35% of this
is only 10% off and the big loser is the
Emerson okay let me talk about another
one before that last year we decided to
replicate this effect and the effect
that
I'll talk about next what we did we
showed people did it with the doctoral
students tally life at Stanford and same
deal you know some people some consumers
chose between these two shredders and
others chose between another one between
three where if you look at the bottom
one it's more expensive not as good okay
it's dominated as we say okay now we had
two additional cells if you will two
additional versions of this study where
we told consumers in addition to that
information we showed them the kinds of
information you find on many websites
such as Amazon so we show them some
reviews we gave them information about
other options and so on
so that's it would be kind of more like
the information environment that we have
today the effect was gone okay let me
talk about another one this is something
I worked on the I call the compromise
effect worked on that in the mid-80s
actually it's part of my doctoral
dissertation as you see here there are
two cameras and and again one is more
expensive than the other and has more
features again now we add another one
this one it's more expensive has more
feature it's not dominated it's a it's a
very attractive you're into taking
pictures it's a pretty attractive camera
what happened quite a few people
actually chose this camera but more
interestingly more people now chose the
MIL option the one that previously was
the just a more expensive with more
features okay this one now it was a
compromise option and many people
switched to that option and the big
loser was the
the least expensive option okay in other
words this is what I would call relative
thinking why because people do not
choose based on the evaluation of this
individual product whether it fits what
they're looking for they're looking at
the choice set and they check the middle
one okay which means that had we shown
them a different choice set they
probably would have made a different
choice okay again we last year we try to
replicate this study same deal different
cameras two cameras here other consumers
shown these three cameras but again we
had two other versions where we gave
them the kind of information available
to consumers today again in those cells
where we gave them more information
where we showed them reviews where we
showed them more information about other
cameras that are available
the compromise effect was God what's it
was completely in debt in that study it
was completely gone I am hesitating to
say it will always completely go in fact
I'm not sure you but I think it's
clearly significantly decreasing okay
but in this particular study it was gone
now the significance of these results
from last year goes well beyond the
compromise effect why because it's
emmanuel rosen and i call that there is
a general shift from what we call
relative decision-making to absolute
decision-making where more and more
consumers evaluate options individually
based on the value of each option
instead of in relative terms let's go
back to 1999 and suppose you're thinking
of buying this laptop you might be when
you evaluate that when you evaluate this
laptop you might have looked at the
brand name you might have looked at
where it was made and so on you might
have used some generic rule like you get
what you pay for these are all relative
assessments why because you judging this
particular product not based on its
absolute merit but a relative to perhaps
other product by the same brand other
products at the same price level other
products made in the same country and so
on now the problem with those relative
proxies is they they often disappoint
you why because the same brands
sometimes make great product other times
they make not-so-great products
but increasingly consumers don't have to
rely on relative proxies and instead
they know more and more before they make
a purchase what they're going to to
actually get these are some of the
sources of information that that are
available to data consumers to evaluate
each product individually or in absolute
value instead of having to rely on the
relative proxies now if consumers can
predict the absolute value things the
losers are the proxies and the marketers
that rely on those proxies and if you
think about the marketing textbook much
of that and if you have ever taken a
course in marketing much of what we have
been teaching in marketing is how to
create effective quality proxies now to
the extent that consumers can assess the
quality of things in absolute sense then
marketers will have much less influence
let's say let's let's go back here and
think about the factors that influence
consumers when they make purchase
decisions first there is what we call P
everything that's stored in our head our
prior experiences our prior beliefs what
what we know about the world what we
were born with heritable tendencies for
example I'm not going to talk about that
today but we've done now a couple of
studies with identical twins comparing
them to fraternal twins and we find that
for reasons that we do not quite
understand the tendency to either
compromise or not compromise appears to
be largely heritable but as I said I'm
not gonna talk about that but it's it's
kind of interesting it's one of the
things that you cannot explain so you
say okay the best I can do is see if it
replicates and sure enough it does even
though we we tested it repeatedly across
various categories which is kind of
interesting but it may take a couple of
decades before we'll understand why
that's happening so this is P okay the
second one is M which is the influence
of marketers so let's say marketers
advertise they try to persuade you they
use top of mind you know if they try to
create top of mind they use banner ads
they run promotions and so on then we
have au which is the influence of other
people in here I mean not just other
users not just friends also experts you
know people who are demonstrating the
product online and so on so this is Oh
now if you want a summary of what has
changed largely due to the Internet is
the rise of the influence of oh and the
decline of the influence of M now I
should note here that
probably pee the influence of what's
stored in our hands from prior
experience also decline relative to O
because if we have a lot of information
at the point of purchase
we're probably less likely to retrieve
information stored in memory based on
prior experience now this change that I
talked about doesn't apply to all
carriers there are many cases where
people do not check check reviews there
are many habitual purchase when you go
to buy milk or bread or hangers or soap
you're probably not checking reviews and
you just go to the store and if it's at
eye level or whatever that probably will
still influence you but more and more
categories fall in the old dependent end
of things
where people do check reviews in fact if
you go and Amazon and you check the
number of reviews on cosmetics products
you think this is a matter of personal
taste it's amazing how many reviews you
get much of the o most of that what I'll
talk about for the rest of today's
presentation will be about o dependent
products now let me now examine in more
detail some key if you will mantras or
basic things that we've been talking
about and practicing in marketing I'll
talk about branding I'll talk about
loyalty come back to irrationality
positioning targeting and persuasion and
market research let's talk about
branding that's probably the biggest
mantra of all there's really nothing
more marketing than branding if you ask
MBA students why they take marketing
classes there it's branding has a lot to
do with it
and you've all seen all those books
about branding and obviously they have a
lot of valuable things to say and many
people feel very strongly about brands
and it is despite what I'm going to say
brands will continue to have important
functions for example in certain
categories if if you care about status
brands will continue in some cases to
communicate status and there are other
things where brands will still will
still play a row so brands are not going
away having said that the importance of
brands as indicators of quality is going
to decline or is declining already
because as I said today you can evaluate
each product individually without having
to rely on an umbrella brand name now
some people say ah it's just the
opposite in fact
there's so much information out there
people get overloaded and you know
instead of processing all this
information and getting overloaded they
just go buy brand name this argument
appears to be based on the idea that
consumers have just two options either
you process all the information on the
Internet and so on or you rely on brand
names of course in reality consumers
have many intermediate options it's it's
real easy to get a great deal of
information about quality very quickly
and very efficiently and let me
illustrate that in the category of
restaurants chain chain restaurants used
to have one key advantage you knew what
you're getting
regardless of where you are whereas if
you don't know an independent restaurant
you probably wouldn't know what to
expect so you just go with
the chain restaurant you know maybe not
the greatest but you know what you're
getting well that might be changing you
know here is a restaurant that actually
we talked to the owner but it's called
Machiavelli I don't know if anyone here
knows Machiavelli
it's a apparently pretty popular it's on
Capitol Hill pine 1215 Pine Street and
they got here over 400 reviews if you go
to the website they have more than 50
pictures of various dishes you look here
at the rating distribution that's from
Yelp you want to look at select review
sometimes I'm interested to find out
where those people who give it just one
star to start what are they concerned
about is that relevant to me doesn't
take that much time and you can get you
know as much information you like that
it's not very effortful and you get a
great deal of information now that means
that as Yelp in other review sites
penetrate the market we should see a
decline in the relative share of chain
restaurants in fact a michael luca a
researcher at Harvard did conducted a
study where he had access to data about
revenues of restaurants before and after
Yelp entered the Seattle market and what
he found first was that every additional
star on Yelp increase its revenues for
the restaurant by about 5% more
interestingly he found that higher Yelp
penetration leads to an increase in
revenues for independent restaurants but
decrease of revenues for chain
restaurants which is very consistent
with the idea that now with the with the
penetration of their easy access to
review
in all those other information sources
we don't need to rely on brand name we
can evaluate each alternative on its own
merit now you might be concerned about
fake reviews and I'm sure those exist
however hey it's not that easy as you
might think now if you go to a place and
you see a restaurant or a product with
five reviews yeah I think it's
reasonable to assume that four out of
five of our friends and family however
if you have many reviews a pilla that's
that's useful information furthermore
all those websites that rely on reviews
have great incentive to to make them
credible and to file and different
companies have done it in different ways
Expedia and Angie's List are if you will
the most strict and third there are
trade-offs here on the one hand you can
limit the most streak like on Angie's
List to submit a review you have to to
show you they can check whether you
actually bought the product from the
supplier that use that you're evaluating
okay which is kind of that's Amazon for
example doesn't do it
Yelp doesn't do it and many others don't
do it and I think their reasoning is
that if that's what you do you're
discouraging people from submitting
reviews from writing reviews other
people do other things you know some
people you know some companies try to
filter suspicious reviews and by the way
companies and people have developed
pretty sophisticated algorithms for
detecting you know fake or suspicious
reviews there are sting operations
where they would approach companies and
offer to sell them favorable reviews
there's some legal actions actually
there was a recent interesting case
where someone I believe in Virginia a
carpet cleaning service sued some people
who posted negative reviews of his
carpet cleaning service turns out they
never actually used the services Edwards
you know I don't know if there are
competitors but they must have had some
ulterior motives now the defendants in
that case said well you know that's the
first covered by the First Amendment the
court just a few weeks ago said no
that's not the case if you write a false
review then you can be sued for
defamation I'm not an attorney but you
can be sued now you may ask yourself on
what's yelps position on this case okay
because you you could see them going
both ways on the one hand I'm sure they
are concerned about fake reviews on the
other hand they don't want to discourage
people from submitting reviews because
the next day they get sued in this case
my understanding is just from reading
the press is that they were on the side
of the defendants and I think right now
it's it might be on appeal in any case
issues of fake reviews it's still a
problem I think it's not as big a
problem as people suspect and I think
you know in the near future it it will
become much less of a problem than it
might be today now what are the
implications of the fact that brand
names become less important in consumers
purchase decisions we talked with the
CEO of Asus Johnny sheep and he's
when he decided to sell as you may know
he a sous used to make components for
other computer and other manufacturers
so he was a kind of what we call OAM
supplier when he decided to sell his
products under the a sous name people
told him now you have no no chance you
know you have no you know brand
recognition you need to spend a lot of
money on advertising well he said by
2012 a sous was among the top five in
the world in tablets in laptops they've
done very well I think they kind of the
breakthrough product they had is called
EPC they just start selling it at a very
reasonable price the word got out they
got good reviews and they've done really
well that also applies to unknown names
and new carriers as you may know Roku is
extremely successful in there with its
streaming player with very loyal if you
go on Amazon I think they have something
like over 5,000 reviews average of 4.5
stars we've heard recently about nest
these were unfamiliar names that have
done very well so that means that if
brand names become less important then
the entry barrier in terms of name
recognition is much lower than it used
to be as long as you have the right
product as long as you offer what we
call absolute value another implication
is that it's easier to diversify to
enter new categories under the same name
we used to teach in marketing classes
that each brand is associated with
certain perceived skills now if you take
the same name and you try to enter a
different category you will not be
successful because consumers
associate your name just with this
particular industry it's no longer true
if you look on samsung go you know
various other product including
Microsoft as long as you offer value you
can enter almost any category let's talk
about loyalty another kind of favorite
topic of marketing courses and textbooks
I mean how many times we've explained to
people the importance of building
loyalty and they feel there are all
kinds of quantitative calculations if
you increase loyalty by one percent and
you enter plug it into lifetime value
calculations you know it turns out it
makes unbelievable impact on long-term
profitability
well if each product is evaluated on its
own merit loyalty may be not as
impactful as it used to be I may really
like my car but the next time I'm buying
a car I'm just gonna look around see
what people are saying and decide
accordingly it doesn't mean I don't like
my current car but when I am about to
buy a new car I'm just gonna look around
loyalty becomes a little less important
than it used to be it's not past
experience determine it's what you are
offering today this is just from one
particular study done by Deloitte
they found recently that percentage of
guests constantly staying at the same
hotel brand is only 8% but it applies to
many different categories so the
implication is that your success depends
on each product and you know you you're
familiar with Nokia and and we look at
blackberry I mean the okiya was the
brand in mobile phones and and they just
at some point stopped offering they
smartphones that consumers were looking
for on the bright side there are better
second chances which means that if your
next product is great
that will be consumers will forget the
the your previous failures and evaluate
your current product now given the all
the talk about the importance of loyalty
and I don't want to downplay it it used
to be very important in a world in which
consumers relied on quality proxies in
an on past experience so there are all
kinds of measures there is something
called Net Promoter Score that the score
that you might have might be familiar
with was extremely powerful and you know
like how many people say they would
whatever the measure is like five point
seven point scale about how lucky you
are to recommend the product to others
well I'm not so sure you need to spend
so much time on this Net Promoter Score
or you know you got in market research
we spend so much time on measures of
brands brand equity and and branding you
know things are changing it depends you
you know you may have your brand may be
associated with certain perceptions
today if your next product is not so
great
you know this your great Net Promoter
Score scores are not going to help you
let's come back to irrationality and as
I said you know for many years we're
preaching the fact that consumers are
often irrational it was people just
didn't believe us well recently thanks
to you know some popular books it's
become widely accepted that consumers
are you rational not many people believe
that most consumers are irrational most
of the time well you know it's
interesting because just as this belief
in consumer irrationality is caught on
it's becoming a little lost true not
because consumers
are smarter than today or they started
taking courses in rational
decision-making but simply because of
the information environment where you
can evaluate the quality of each product
you don't have to rely on all the things
that caused you to behave in ways that
we and economists regarded as irrational
let's talk a little bit about
positioning targeting and persuasion
again if you have taken any marketing
class you know that what you need to do
you first decide on positioning how you
want your product to be perceived
relative to your competitors and the the
reason that positioning was seen as so
important is that based on your position
a positioning was impacting the
perceptions of consumers and all the
components of marketing strategy
strategy had to be derived from your
overall positioning strategy but in a
world in which you the marketer have
less influence on consumers perceptions
and they're more likely to rely on what
I called earlier Oh on what others are
saying experts and users and so on
perhaps what marketers want in terms of
positioning has less and less influence
here is an example it's it was taken
from this is a thing an h2 an ad for an
HTC phone a thing it was called status
and and was introduced and they were
trying to position it as the Facebook
phone well then walk out people looked
at this phone in a regardless of
position they evaluated it on its own
merit you know based on the normal ways
in which they evaluate mobile phones and
on those dimensions it does it was not
particularly attractive did not do very
well so they might have thought well we
kind of core
the markets for Facebook phone it just
didn't work out let's talk about other
firms that it may you may know the guy
here on the right you know let's let's
start with that as you as you probably
know Microsoft was the first companies
first I know that introduced the tablet
PC I think well before the iPad I think
it was around 2002 it was regarded from
what I could tell is a good product you
know I'm and I'm not and maybe the
obviously there there might have been
multiple there are probably multiple
reasons why the product didn't do as
well as the iPad ended up doing but one
thing that I do know is that Microsoft
decided to target the tablet PC to very
well-defined segments I believe it was
Healthcare was one of the target
segments so they they didn't go after
the entire market and let the market
sort it out but instead they focused on
some vertical segments and that didn't
work out where's I think the iPad did
not have such well-defined targeting
strategy they let the market figure out
who is interested in that and perhaps a
simpler example of that is if you got
this actually photo from what I could
tell for where I got it is people who
are those seniors are actually using an
Xbox you'll be glad to know but I think
we was they when we was introduced a
Nintendo Wii I don't think they expected
the seniors to be among the key segments
I don't think that was planned and I'm
pretty sure they didn't do any market
research to figure out if
motion-sensitive remote is something
attractive it just someone came up with
that idea turns out people really like
that but putting that aside
and it turns out there is a hidden
segment that they were not aware of okay
again it's very hard to predict who
which customers will will will use the
product and marketers should recognize
that they cannot plan and they cannot
direct consumers in certain segments to
use the product if you will it's kind of
more democratic they have less influence
but but it's you know the market will
will discover you know who is who needs
the product it hopefully some do another
thing I just want to mention is you know
we've talked a lot about the importance
of creating top-of-mind awareness
so if you see sony sony sony all the
time when you go to the store and you
want to you know buy something it said
okay it's only top of mind
I'll take Sony well again how would you
buy today products like that you're
probably going you know it's very easy
to to gather information to go on the
internet to check reviews to get a lot
of information top of mind becomes less
important because it's so easy at the
point of purchase to gather information
and it says quality you do not you're
much less influenced but by what happens
to be top of mind so just to summarize
these sections that position in
targeting what's best when consumers
relied on em when marketers but today
this has changed I mean this I know she
that considered marketers can convince
consumers that their products are of the
highest quality just not working as
effectively as it used to be consumers
are checking quality from other sources
doesn't mean you should not create a
generate interest in your product it
doesn't mean that you should not inform
the market allow people who
who create that those reviews have all
the information about your product
that's definitely important you want to
get the word out but saying explaining
why your product is is better and more
useful that's and so on or more reliable
that's much less effective than it used
to be
let's talk finally about market research
now if you think about what market
research is about much of that has to do
with measuring P measuring consumers
stable preferences and based on they're
trying to predict what they will buy in
the future okay if you have ever used
you know techniques like conjoint
analysis or various other things you
measuring the utility functions or the
the you measuring the the prior
preferences of consumers and you're
thinking that if you can measure it very
accurately you can tell what product
they'll buy next year so if you follow
if you give customers exactly what they
said they want you'll be successful well
how do you buy those kind of products in
reality today well P as I said earlier
is becoming less important at the point
of purchase you're going to find out
what people are saying about the
products currently available and it
turns out that that certain features are
particularly important that will
influence your current preferences and
therefore and I should note it was this
notion for for new truly new products
the notion that you can measure people's
preferences about new ideas was always
highly suspect because consumers are
remarkably bad at predicting how they
will respond to things they're not used
to because they tend to think that
whatever they like now they probably
will like in the future
not recognizing that
things will change but this is becoming
much less so I mean there is a clam bill
that you might have seen before
something often people like to cite that
some in a study by you know well-known
research company but they once the
iPhone was announced they came up with
the conclusion that iPhone Yanai may be
okay for developing countries will not
be successful in developed countries
yeah curious I'll tell you it later you
know one of the largest you know there's
media conglomerates but you know you you
should excuse them so it's not it's not
easy but they figure out that you know
iPhone is just not gonna make it in in
places like America so they measured P
consumers were influenced by all kinds
of there are all kinds of things but in
part Oh which means that you know
measuring PE loyalty brand perceptions
it's it's becoming less important and
something that marketing researchers
should spend less time on of course if
you're you know if you selling something
like toothbrush and you want to find out
whether purple is gonna be more popular
than red sure market research will still
be helpful but for many products
including those that you tend to be
involved in it's it's not very effective
much more important to track oh and be
responsive another thing that I know you
you do and many other companies do is
take advantage of the fact that it's
become so easy to conduct experiments
with the real thing run experiments
let's say that you're you have a search
engine let's call it Bing and you want
to find out whether arranging the the
the presenting the the results in a
certain way will will have certain
effects that's very easy to experiment
with
experiment look at the results run
another experiment and continue it's
much more effective much more effective
so I just summarized I guess the
overarching thing we're talking about is
the shift from relative to absolute
value based decisions which has
implications I didn't talk about
everything but I think the the pretty
much the entire marketing textbook and
marketing principles needs to be
re-examined
I'm not saying as I said brands are gone
or the Lord is totally not important but
they're becoming less important
significantly so and need to be
re-examined so with other brand loyalty
irrationality positioning targeting and
persuasion and market research shouldn't
so now consumers are more likely to
evaluate things based on absolute value
which means that proxies of losing their
impact and marketers are becoming less
influential so you know they they're
they need to recognize the changes and
do a good job of tracking and responding
quickly experimenting let me and with
with that and open it for questions
yeah did you have your hand up nope yes
so this is very valid for b2c marketing
whether it be to be marketing do you
have any opinion you look at it in that
field yeah absolutely
I used to teach that class at Stanford
for a couple of years I usually taught
the marketing core which is kind of the
general the basic marketing class I
think it applies to need to be to be as
well now you might say that with b2b the
customers have always been Finnish
sophisticated and in many cases they
have their technical staff could
evaluate products based on its absolute
value before so in that regard the
significance of the change is not as
much I mean they are ahead of the of the
see okay of they of their consumer so so
that is that that that's correct I think
even their I think that you know of an
obviously brand name I mean it's all
about b2b you know you talk about
relationships you talk about individual
the people's the people that you're
dealing with your account executives and
so on you know it's there are there
differences but I think that changes and
their ability to to gather information
and to know advance that's also
happening there but I agree that it it's
even more important in the b2c market
yeah um so you talked about a lot of
there's a lot of things that are invalid
right we're previously taken is like
four tenets of marketing so um from
these changes now like what what do you
draw to replace that so what is the
value now of marketing and what should
be the goal that's a good question and I
hesitate just to say this and I think
marketing has a lot of important things
I think overall if I could say that kind
of it it's kind of dangerous to
generalize too much I think that
marketing function will become a little
less important than it used to be
because much of marketing and I hope
there aren't too many marketing people
but I think that much of marketing had
to do with the creation of those quality
proxies I mean the thing that marketers
could do better than others was you know
oh they knew all this brand leadership
and brand this and brand that okay no
one else knew so that was then it was
something it's like magic and they
probably were familiar with the price
you know value pricing and those kind of
thing you know as I said you know
marketers now a PR is still very
important and I think that marketers are
said should be
able and have become really good at
tracking consumer response in real-time
and responding very quickly okay so I
think that it's very important
experimentation is important creating
awareness I'm not setting the time here
about persuasion creating awareness
that's marketing so you know and some of
the other things that we used to do
they're not going away as I said branch
still have the function so I would I
don't want to take it too far but I
think if you're looking for an overall
statement yeah I think that the
marketing function is becoming a little
less important than it used to be yes
any predictions about ads funded
business models so we see some companies
really deriving a lot of their revenue
and profit from advertising are those
companies at risk what what kind of
companies do you have in mind
take for example Google or Facebook or
are you gonna what's out you know
acquisition I I think that if you look
at search engine advertising I I think
that's that will continue to be
effective yeah I don't know what's the
click rate on let's say it's 2% where's
banner banner ads might be another point
1 percent in terms of clicker I'm just I
don't know the exact numbers okay
what's it accurate okay may be accurate
but whatever what what what I mean is
when you search for something that's the
moment in many cases where you are about
to make a decision there for search
engine engine advertising that's likely
to be continued to be effective compare
that to you know other companies that
just you know you were looking for you
know let's say you were about you want
to communicate with your friends and on
this side there you see some ads for
something that you're not about to buy
right now I think that's that's you know
maybe would be less well
in the long run unless you kind of
somehow in a fine and effective way of
catching the the consumer at the right
time but yeah I think it depends on it
you may ask the same thing about the
advertising agencies and and so on I
think that will change and it's already
changing they what what they do and how
important certain functions are yeah did
you know there's more emphasis on oh
then your predispositions marketing but
like how do you get to if we go in the
first place from zero state zero think I
feel like it's pdnm are still very
important and they contribute you're
going to know like when you launch a
fair Apple launches a new i watch or
something they will have a lot of litter
and the the day of launch there'll be
big lines which kind of contribute to
growing that Oh so instead of like I
would say it's become ensemble then just
like swinging banners on your face
you're absolutely right I mean they're
not going away you prior beliefs and and
knowledge about brand so on that is it
will have some impact into the future so
it's not like each product is a
standalone evaluated based on its own
merit that is true and marketers as I
said for the kind of products the o
dependent products will be talked about
I think that's the persuasion becoming
less less important there in terms of
you know this is telling you this is a
high quality product
so yeah sure marketers can create
awareness could they can still do a lot
of useful things and obviously what we
have stored in our memory that will
continue to have impact we don't let
relative changes and I think the big
change following the internet is to rise
fo and I think that people you know
looking at people who predicted what
will happen
when they introduced when the Internet's
you know let's say in a mid-90s you know
I've kind of became popular people were
debating what it will do to pricing will
we see lower prices on average because
people will compare will quality become
there are all kinds of debates I don't
think that people are anticipated the
sharp rise in all those reviews experts
and users and their great impact that I
think to all those you know future you
know people who specialize in in
predicting what will happen I don't
think they expected that it wears today
we know that this may very well be the
the the most of you know certainly one
of the most important things the fact
that you have reviewed the view you have
access to easy access quick access to so
much information you know so much about
products even before they introduced if
you think about diffusion of new
products you know a lot of the diffusion
theory was developed based on corn
farmers in Iowa I believe and if you
think about opinion leaders those kind
of concepts and and word of mouth it was
a very different world for example one
of the key drivers of diffusion adoption
of innovation with something that
innovation experts called observability
to what extent you can observe the the
innovation and all communicated think
about how easy it is to do those kind of
things from the internet but do you
think that's where the marketing and
like that's where contributing to
growing that o is where those efforts
are born into now where you have like
rockstars endorsing brands or endorsing
products I think I think that's much
less important if you think about in the
wet I forget when was it that under
Agassi was the big spokesperson for
Canada I you know famously saying image
images everything you may be too young
to remember that
and and you know today it wouldn't have
much impact you see a what's his name
Ashton Kutcher
he said advertising Nikon I don't think
that it's helping Nikon as much as
Andrew Agassi helped Canon and in the
old days because yeah I made like Ashton
Kutcher or not I don't think that I'm
going to decide on my next camera on
that basis yeah how do you feel about
vocal minorities and the communities
where you going different articles you
see who's the loudest and I think
especially in the tech industry where
there's it's called bamboo ISM where you
just like Android just because it's
Android and anything that Google does
because it's Microsoft you just anything
that Google does or just hate do you
feel that like the community or like
that mob mentality is I think these
might be people that you pay close
attention to and I think in certain
circles they are a very influential you
know I'm not sure if I mean depends on
the kind of products if you know about
products with wide potential market
example what's it I can give an example
so for example our Xbox one release we
had a lot of negative press and people
said it's only the minorities or the
smoke people that are talking on the
different articles but position 4 is
selling well but I know at a point when
my younger siblings are like yeah Xbox
you can't play your use games on it you
know and that was getting to the
playgrounds and spreading that way yeah
you know I think it it put it you know I
you know with video games that a lot of
coolness is is certainly important and
what you French will think about the
video games the cheap place like your
music
you know that's influential you know I I
think that I mean it depends which
segments if you know about the hardcore
video game players yeah they're probably
influenced by those kind of things you
know about your you know
or kind of average light to medium user
probably much less elf yeah so yes we're
in brand strategy so I take it all back
so one of the things that strikes me is
that the nature of the product has
changed as well right so the nature of
what is the value I mean I think that in
terms of you know if we look at some of
the examples that you had their
microwave example the nature of product
today feels like it's incorporated some
of the other the other piece right the
other piece have been dragged in whether
you talk about distribution or you talk
about packaging you know the product
experience itself is kind of taken in a
lot of the things they previously would
have been in the role of marketing I'm
not sure I follow what what you saying
so let's say the microwave says you know
are still being sold yes not the most
exotic product but it's a they're still
being so what so what it's changed well
I think that microwaves you know have
gone a little bit to the hanger side of
the equation right there's a
commoditization that is happening
microwave I don't know if you buy a
microwave wouldn't you check reviews
right I definitely would right so so
I've called that whenever it users check
reviews it's on the laptop the Oh
dependent side of the continuum right
I think that in if you're if we're
looking at the products that are on the
kind of the right the right side then
you can monetize to the side it feels
like it's not it's not commoditized it's
not commoditized I mean there are
certain things that are either not
sufficiently important like you know you
know you're not gonna check you know
before buying toothbrush I'm just gonna
go to the store and get one that looks
good you're not checking any review
that's all independent and maybe colors
and promotions and those kind of things
they will still affect you so it's not
it's not sufficiently important you know
there's some things and that where
status if you are you know if you like
to buy Louis Vuitton handbags you're
probably not doing it for the quality
and not mean to insult the quality of
content bags they're probably very good
but you apparently the type of person
who likes to be seen with a Louis
Vuitton handbag you're not doing it for
the quality you know in that regard the
brand is still very important but I'm
not sure I answered your question maybe
I did well I mean certainly when we look
at products in our industry right which
are increasingly becoming a mix of
product and service right we are a lot
of the things that the tradition that
traditionally were in the domain of
marketers
right whether it's packaging the package
design the way that you know the box of
soap looks on the shelf or you know
these are things that now are part of
the product development
the service development process and so
there's been a shift I think in terms of
the linearity of an industrialized
product and how you then you know create
engineer the product manufacturer at
market and selling and I think that
that's one of the things I think that
we're really grappling with in terms of
how we appeal to people beyond just
brand right but the thing is as I said
it's hard to predict and clearly you
know product development extremely
important and we put that under I mean
it's covered in a marketing textbook so
that and that's so important and true
what's the contribution of marketing
usually it has something to do with
market research right market that market
research means that you can measure
people's preferences and based on that
guide the R&amp;amp;D people as to how to
develop the product we're saying you
know that's really that's becoming much
harder to do effectively I think it has
always been kind of a little over
estimated especially if you know about
completely new products but putting that
aside yeah I think it's market research
is not as effective unless you somehow
can predict how oh we react which is
really hard to do yeah so what is the
recommendation Microsoft give it a
dimension
what's it pick a dimension food
recommendations yeah no I mean you know
I'm here just lecturing it sounds like
but it probably varies by product and
I'm not sure I can as I stand here right
now I can there are a lot of really
smart people at Microsoft from what I
hear and they're thinking about it so I
probably need to give you at least five
more minutes one of the problems with
the board it is its history it's what
its history of people who have given the
reviews based on their prior experience
but in this era of rapid innovation
you're trying to get them to evaluate
your most current offering which people
may not have had that much experiences
so is that a challenge in trying to
implement this approach I mean isn't it
true that today you introduce a new
product instantly you got review some
time you get done an RFP called I'm
still beta testers but you got people
who are looking at the product
beforehand or there are early adopters
you get reviews in no time about and you
can look at the most recent reviews see
if they're different than old adopters
and I think that if anything you get
much faster feedback but for service
like the hotel you staying on the
restaurant you want to go to it's it's a
lot of that history and things keep
changing no that's that's virtue if you
look at this Machiavelli restaurant that
I was talking about it's not actually we
tracked their kind of history they
started with a couple of reviews and
then few more and then a few more and
you know more people try the restaurant
it's it takes some times but if you look
at the cumulative information there is a
great deal of information there that's
you know tells you a lot about current
quality
oh that's a tough choice because I see
down there but ok you start over
targeting and positioning
so in thinking about a lot of planning
and development feel like I mentioned 30
differentiate the rear fenders so how do
you think about
I what I said is that it is much more
difficult to predict which segments will
be most important and if you make the
wrong assumptions and you build and
promote the product accordingly you may
miss some high potential segments and
you know to some extent it seems like
it's a much much more risky when the
actual demand depends on what other
people are saying now you know maybe you
can figure out I mean I don't know I'm
not a great believer in focus groups for
example another thing you can you know
take people ten people in the room of
you know do ten focus groups and let
them have a discussion and figure out
based on that who is gonna use it and I
don't believe that's particularly
effective so I think it's really hard to
predict now if the Pradas obvious flaw
yeah that's something that you know you
may be able to find quickly but that's
not what you're talking about yeah you
do need to some extent to decide and
you're looking at what's happening what
kind of products let's say you were a
successful follower and you see that you
know everyone like said in our phones
with you know that replace cameras that
have you know a lot lots of megapixels
yeah that's something that you can learn
and say well that the market based on
the response to other products appears
to appreciate that let's include that in
our next poll yeah that's nothing that
makes sense I'm not sure if you if
that's what you're referring to
differentiating a product that kind of
each know who your audience is to
differentiate from
right okay so you've been doing things
differently right I mean sometimes it is
successful I mentioned in intended we
you know dominated the market for like
three years because they had came up
with the great idea not based on market
research just someone came up with that
idea
and you know you don't know how many
other things they tried that didn't work
out but you talked about something in
terms of general managerial practice you
know look do some research figure out on
what we want to differentiate you know
if you like it may work out if you look
at trends it's becoming less effective</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
