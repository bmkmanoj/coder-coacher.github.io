Greg and we were talking about Twitter
BOTS and basically what I learned is
that there's a lot of learning that we
can do from this history of Twitter bots
and he pointed out a few which I'll just
share some of the ones that stood out to
me is this one that spits out tweets
that are in iambic pentameter and rhyme
one that tweets pairs of anagrams there
was also a sorting hat one and yes I'm
in Gryffindor one that matches up logos
and what he pointed out is like I think
what a lot of people here when they're
building their BOTS are trying to tap
into surprise and delight and and humor
in conversation and a lot of these
people have been building bots on
Twitter for a long time that have tapped
into these things so just like thinking
about what can be what can be learned
from these art projects or fun things
that people are building on Twitter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
