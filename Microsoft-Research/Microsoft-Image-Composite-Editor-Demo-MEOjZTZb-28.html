to go out and document the world and and
take lots and lots of pictures of some
space that they care about or some
bridge that they care about or some city
that they care about and upload that and
share that with the world so so the goal
is just really to make that process much
easier for people and and allow them to
document the parts of the world that
they care about
Microsoft ice is our software that lets
you take multiple pictures and assemble
those into a massive panoramic image one
thing we've noticed that people want to
do is take lots and lots of pictures
they want to assemble in this case
somebody sent us a two hundred image set
of the Golden Gate Bridge and in the
first working device that took a little
while you know two hundred images is a
big project
and one of the new things we're adding
is the ability to very very quickly
import these 200 image sets let me just
select all these pictures that I just
showed you 200 images of the Golden Gate
Bridge open those up don't blink there
we didn't Microsoft ice wasn't told
anything about the order of those
pictures I just picked 200 pictures that
happen to be the same thing and in that
amount of time right there that wasn't
sped up or anything it figured out how
to align these pictures now we hit okay
but the user doesn't have to do anything
else that's it they say yep that's what
that's what I wanted to capture and ice
figured it all out for you the other
feature we're adding to Microsoft ice is
this publish to photo since button and
then you can upload that to the Internet
to share with anybody so you can share
all that detail that was in those
original pictures as one massive
panoramic picture and once I've done
that I can go to the Photosynth website
and here's that picture and notice all
the detail and the originals is
preserved but it looks like one massive
pic ice figured out everything how to
put everything together and you can
share this with the world live off the
web so this really lets people document
spaces and places that they care about
in all the detail that they want to
share it in and that's the new version
of Microsoft ice please visit our
website try it out let us know what you
think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
