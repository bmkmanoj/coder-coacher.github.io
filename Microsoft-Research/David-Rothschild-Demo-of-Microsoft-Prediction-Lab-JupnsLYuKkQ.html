Microsoft blog here at the Microsoft
Research building to talk with economist
David Rothschild about the recent launch
of Microsoft prediction lab you might be
familiar with David's work from his
predictions for the Oscars the Obama
Romney election as well as earlier this
year when he recently predicted the
winners of all 15 World Cup knockout
games so David we are now at Microsoft
prediction lab at prediction Microsoft
comm and this is the page you get after
you sign up and login right that's right
so when you log in for the first time
we'll ask you a few key demographic
questions which we utilize to customize
the site in to make our answers more
intelligent but normally once you log in
after the first time you're gonna end up
right here and this is our home page and
our home page centers around a series of
questions which we know will answer in
the next week or so here we're asking
about whether or not Obama's going to
announce the new Attorney General 27%
says yes
72% says no now just to be clear here
these aren't the number of people who
responded this is not a wrong count what
this is is people are wagering points
which we give them any given week and
they are saying do they think the
current probability is too high or too
low so this is not a count but this is
an actual probability of it happening
okay so how would I weigh in on this
question you'd wait on this question
very simply I have a couple of points
remaining here for this week you have
put in a hundred points as our default
you press place it pops in I have 200
points remaining there you go all right
it's as simple as that and then probably
the next thing you're thinking okay now
I've just placed a wager I just think
that the Attorney General is going to be
announced and what you can do is you
head over to the scoring tab
and the scoring tab is going to have a
couple of different things in it but one
of them is going to be showing how
you've done in the wagers over the last
week and you'll be able to see how these
update as different predictions are made
you really like to say there's kind of a
pork or draws to to making these match
number one you go in and you can see
what's going on that's fine number two
you're influencing the Krauts you're
actually getting your voice heard there
number three and number four really
about following your predictions both
here you can see your predictions you
can see how they do and actually follow
that over time and really learn a lot
about you know are you smarter than your
friends that's the challenge I throw out
there people are going to be sharing a
lot of personal info their opinion on
who should win their opinion on social
issues how secure is this info this is a
very tightly run website and this data
is not being shared out for any other
purposes that's number one number two is
that we've taken a lot of steps to
ensure that people don't manipulate the
answers here as well - and that's
something that's a great challenge for
us having a login function a lot of
things like this they don't do login
function well you mean so that we want
me answers that actually means something
and part of that is logging it it's
seeing the questions that people have
responded to it's testing to see if
people are pushing questions and one way
or the other in some sort of weird way
all of these steps that we're taking to
ensure that these are not just a fun and
exciting game which we do want it to be
but these are auks actually also
meaningful answers that news will report
on and that will help us understand the
world at large
