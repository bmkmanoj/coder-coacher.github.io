professor at the MIT Media Lab where I
lead a group called high tech and today
what I'm going to talk to you about is
kind of the technology DIY community and
gender and kind of it connects
tangentially also to fashion I wanted to
start by kind of returning to this thing
that that Kevin brought up this morning
which relates to my talk in a couple
ways so I wanted to give this talk with
some declaim disclaimer so two of them
the first is that the work most of the
work that I'm going to talk to you about
is really old and so I have a bit of
this feeling like oh yes I can talk
about that work but I've been talking
about it for a long time and probably
some of you already know the work that
I've done in this space so there's a bit
of that in this top just kind of old
stuff and then the other part of this
talk is super super new stuff that's
like I would say worse than half baked
maybe like quarter baked or eight fake
so some stuff that we're just starting
to think about in my group and that's
not really ready to talk about but i
think is interesting and especially
relevant to this context so so with that
means that the meat or jehanne we this
will still be a weird one okay so let me
start by in you some context about what
I do with my group at the villa so my
foundational interest is developing new
technologies that give rise to
and more specifically I'm interested in
developing tools that empower diverse
groups of people to create technology
for themselves and I work specifically
in the domain of hardware so interested
in involving people in building their
own physical technologies so what I'm
going to talk to you about today is a
product that i've been working on for a
while it actually came out of my PhD
research the project called lily pad you
know and what this is is a kit for
building interactive fashion so this kid
with us consists of a set of syllable
electronic modules that you can stitch
in your clothing with conductive thread
and then you can program that
construction to take on kind of dynamic
interactive behaviors so this is what it
looks like it was released commercially
in the fall of two thousand seven so
it's been out and about for about four
years now and it's been adopted and used
by a really interesting group of people
so we both educators and artists and
designers and most prominently by an
interesting group of DIY audiences about
a hundred over a hundred thousand forms
of now sold and so there's a significant
kind of community out there to look at
to give you a sense of the kinds of
stuff people are building
show this short video so you can see
yeah well this is all about clear
crossovers to the burning down crowd
here
right from right to left each length of
stitch all right so we'll kind of leave
it at that we will go through a whole
bunch of more products but so they can
do a sense of kind of the things that
people are building with this kid and
what they're doing and then also kids
start to give you a sense of the kinds
of people who are using this kit so was
that kind of come back to this kind of
agenda that i started with which is that
I'm really interested in developing new
technologies that give rise to new
communities and once there was this
community people out there using this
kit it became possible they'll return to
that question and see hey did I really
succeed on that front this really
happened and so what we did about two
years ago now in 2010 is I use
Mechanical Turk to have people go out
and collect information about all of
these projects that are out there kind
of posted in online and DIY forums and
stuff so we collected a whole corpus
projects that were made and also
corresponding kind of collection of
information about the people who are
making these projects but it seemed like
in order to make sense of this data we
need to compare it to something so we
also collected a similar set of data for
a more traditional kind of electronics
audience community so we collected that
information for lily pad projects and
we've had adopters and then also for a
traditional electronics hobby community
namely the people who use the
quote-unquote traditional are we know
and this is a collection of their
projects and kind of what they look like
and so what chemo out of that studies
that these communities are really
similar along several dimensions so
they're kind of from the same places
mainly the US Europe and they're about
the same age but they're really really
different on one dimension guess what
that might be so when we looked at the
gender of these builders this is what we
saw so these are the two communities of
makers of kind of DIY builders so the
Arduino community what we found is about
two percent of the people who are
building and posting are we know
projects online or women and when we
look at the lilypad community that
dynamic is kind of flipped completely on
its head and what you see is about
sixty-five percent of those projects are
done by women so coming back around to
this question of did this new technology
you really give rise to a new community
it seems to the answer seems that you
here yes there are lots of interesting
questions that you could continue to ask
here the first one that occurred to us
is well maybe this sixty-five percent is
just kind of like all of these people
but getting really excited and kind of
gathering together in the same space so
are they people who are already doing
this kind of stuff just kind of
mass of them or are they new people and
so to answer that question we could
interview that subset of these makers
and we came up with some pretty
convincing argument that that was not
the case that indeed that a lot of these
people who are changing and building
stuff Lilly had worked completely new to
the DIY technology space so the tool
really brought them in and you know
enable them encourage them to
participate in this and a construction
of Technology so yeah super sites so new
communities of kind of technology
builders this is also kind of proves
this piece it's that this is possible to
do and that you build appropriate
technology really change the cultural
dynamics around technology yeah sunshine
um what but then we kind of started 10 0
notice some other patents were we
selling um so what happened is when that
young woman that I just quoted he's all
excited about doing the hardware what
happens when she posts her project on a
prominent electronics a hobbyist blog
for what happens when her project
project its feature on a website like a
hack a day like spark fun so what often
happens looks like this so what I mean
blinky kids take a step back you see
more focused on fashion he
be like shirts and when I'm around cool
pull up you know outside of the reins
and clubs this is useless junk well
maybe I'm just a dinosaur or something
but I just don't get the whole textile
thing I've been involved with
electronics for a lot of years in this
application is among the most lame I see
fashion it's not electronics it's
crafting and there's no way the
electronic gravity I've been waiting a
long time to say that but you're
supposed to set me off like a rocket
it's too easy and it takes away from the
real electronics hobby um so what we
started to see was this intense sense
that that we had invited people this new
group of people to presence of hate in
this community and encourage them to
come and be part of this faith and when
they did look we kind of encourage them
to do when they showed up and they
participated the existing communities
that you don't belong here you are not
like us and in fact you threaten our
identity you don't you not welcome here
and so what we're kind of in the midst
of doing now is trying to make sense of
this face so make sense of the complex
dynamics that are emerging out of kind
of developing this new community and
having it collide with
community and there's just lots I think
of interesting stuff there we're just
starting to kind of collect a corpus of
this kind of data and this of course
these are a few really inflammatory
comments there's all sorts of more
nuanced discourse happening in these
forums I'll just show you a couple of
those when I wrap up so here are a
couple of people kind of responding to
that intense negativity in an
interesting way so this person is saying
like you know well you know this person
you know is not like us you know that's
okay like here's if it's not like us
there should be space for that year and
maybe even that you know this guy's been
gener generous here again maybe engaging
people with different perspectives could
actually score kind of new ideas and
innovations this person really starts to
talk explicitly about gender which of
course really underlies a lot of this
discourse so this person said you know
hey it's not the beautiful respond this
way just to textile we respond this way
to kind of anything with this kind of
girly aspect to it so he should be no
self reflective about that and have that
knowledge about ourselves so so I should
wrap it up there and yeah they said
we're kind of just looking at these
complex ecology between kind of not only
the technology that we built and then
then sparked a community but then this
complex Bennett because
it joins in chem the corner so thank you
all yeah
here so he posted kind of tasks on
Mechanical Turk that asked people to
identify projects that were made either
with the Arduino web Mila noble origin
see on the left or with the are you know
lily pad or would you see on the right
those are a snapshot about it to
collection this seems like a dream of
beautiful for lotta things like cars and
home automation a listening to point be
more interesting I mean cure the genders
was different that is something about a
specific event I would strongly push
back against that actually i think the
lily pad is is no are we know is no more
lily pad is no less useful than the the
arduino it's identical technology and in
fact you can do all sorts of things with
the willing have that you can't do with
RV now you can screw this into a wall
for example right but but i guess what i
want to push back on a bit is this
assumption that this is more like
generic for general purpose I don't
think that's true they're just really
different and what they're seeing is
that difference is like how will be tied
with gender so my question with the fact
that it almost seems like you now have
fashioned electronic parts like it its
own thing that that's its own little
vertical and you know it's always made
of this cute right
ah that's not really real that's not a
real thing and then that's the other
thing is your bills like oh yeah you're
a grown-up we're not going to automate
your house that we're going to do you
know go down this vertical and really
make portage park like that they're more
useful more seeing that area it's not
super strength right that's what we call
me cute but not real it's almost like to
start up some things that are very big
yeah no I definitely resonate at your
point I think there are a lot of
opportunities to make similar technology
for lots of different spaces like
farming painting all sorts of things
that you can imagine kind of alternative
version probably all the time we have an
unfilled response aaliyah after second
so thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
