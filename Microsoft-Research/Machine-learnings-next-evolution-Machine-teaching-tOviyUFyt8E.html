another phrase for machine learning it's
the idea that somebody who has what we
call domain expertise let's say somebody
who's in the medical profession they
understand the medical world very well
but they're not an expert or machine
learning or computer software how do
they use computers to solve a problem
well if the if the computer uses machine
learning then that domain expert can
teach the computer using their domain
expertise it can teach the computer to
solve that problem we have much more
demand for machine teaching than we have
supply and so we can try to make the
tools better but what we really need to
do is to increase the number of machine
teachers and what this technology is is
about democratizing machine teaching so
that anyone can do it it's the really
exciting thing about the field machine
learning right now is that we're
starting to take the first steps towards
building truly intelligent machines
machines which would maintain an
internal model of the world they would
capture uncertainty and they would be
continuously learning from data updating
their models and interacting in the
world in intelligent ways</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
