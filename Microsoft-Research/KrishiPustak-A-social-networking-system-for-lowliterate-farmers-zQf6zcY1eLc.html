with the wide penetration of mobile
internet social networking systems are
becoming increasingly popular in the
developing world most social networking
sites make heavy use of text and are
therefore unusable by low literate
populations and while smartphones are
increasingly available they are still
out of reach for many poor people in
low-income context users often access
the technology through a friend relative
or neighbor who owns or knows how to use
it we call this mediated use of
technology we ask what would a social
networking application for low literate
users look like how would it be used and
can the technology work through a human
mediator we designed chrissy poo stock
an audio-visual social networking mobile
application for low literate farming
populations in rural india a number of
user and system constraints had to be
taken into account to design this system
first it had to be mediated that is an
expert user who owned the phone could
help low literate farmers use and manage
the application second the system was
designed for use in settings with
limited or no connectivity third since
the system was aimed at low literate
users no text was used and all content
was audio-visual finally because the
application was intended to increase
communication among all the farmers in
an area everyone was connected to
everyone else and we did not have the
concept of friends or groups we worked
with digital green and bife to nonprofit
organizations who disseminate best
practices in agriculture among farming
communities they work with mediators
from local villages and communities to
screen videos and demonstrate
agriculture techniques we worked with 8
agriculture mediators who are given
Nokia Lumia 8
20 phones to register and work with
farmers on chrissy poo stock let's see
how a mediator registered a farmer on
the system the farmer records an audio
message introducing himself mera naam
danisha on melon to log on film then he
captures a self photograph with the
phone's camera here is a list of all the
farmers that the mediator has registered
on his phone now once the farmer has an
account let us see how he makes a post
the farmer can make a photo post or an
audio post on the top of the homepage he
taps the camera icon captures an image
and then records an accompanying audio
message he then selects one of the three
tags agriculture personal or animal
husbandry selecting a tag will later
helped him toggle views of relevant
content on the home page to make an
audio post he would tap the microphone
icon in the home page beside the camera
icon and then record an audio message ya
mehdi guy hey Rosie Ottilie de Bobadilla
now let us see how another farmer can
view in reply to posts another farmer
selects her picture from the list of
people registered on the mediators thumb
to login to chrissy poo stock on the
home page the most recent posts are
shown at the top of the page the farmer
sees a photo and taps on the loudspeaker
icon to hear the accompanying audio
message
to make an audio reply to this post she
taps on the microphone icon above the
photo yachi guy he won't apse guy TV to
make a photo reply she would tap on the
camera icon on the photo to manage
intermittent internet connectivity
mediators can synchronize content with
the server whenever the internet is
available by tapping on the vertical
bars on the login page in addition to
user-generated posts farmers can view
third-party content that we seeded on
chrissy poo stock we pushed a digital
green video into the application to
study uptake among farmers over four
months 306 farmers registered through
the mediators phones and used chrishi
postdoc to make 514 posts and 180
replies user evaluations show that post
had a strong professional theme
sixty-two percent of posts were related
to agriculture with many pictures of
cows and Hydra cultural fields similarly
the digital green video on cattle
mulching was very popular among our
users however farmers were also
interested in other more social content
such as pictures of families village
events religious images natural scenery
and such in the future as smartphones
become more available we hope to use
what we've learned from Chrissy boo
stock to create mobile social networking
applications that are useful and usable
by farmers as well as other low literacy
groups in both rural and urban settings
