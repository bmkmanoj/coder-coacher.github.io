high energy and moving quickly and yeah
we'll do questions at the end so my name
is Dan Driscoll I'm a developer at
Microsoft Research we publish the bot
framework I can tell you about what the
bot framework is but you have web
browsers you can just go to the website
and you can see it and so I'm going to
talk a little bit about the services
that we include in there and why and I
think the why is the more important
piece why you'd want to put these
services in a bot so to start out with
let's think about some of the bots that
we're familiar with right we know of
like chatty bots that seem like they
have a lot of magic in them and we can
almost like put those into one category
and then you can also think about really
simple bots-bots-botswana into it you
can think these sort of non-intelligent
bots at the other end and I think this
spectrum where we have simple bots on
one end and intelligent bots on the
other end is a bit of a myth that this
spectrum even though it may exist is not
actually all that important and I don't
want you to think about bots as being
simple or intelligent the reason why I
think this think about the interactions
that you have with people day to day and
think about you know you have deep
emotional connections with your friends
and colleagues where you have share a
lot of context with them and they have
like sometimes they will have authority
to act on your behalf um you may also
have transactional interactions with
people who you only interact with for 30
seconds or more right folks like you
know when you're buying a coffee or wait
staff at a restaurant you have
transactional interactions and you have
more emotional interactions but in both
cases these are intelligent interactions
and I think BOTS can be the same way if
you imagine what people would were like
if they were like the bots that we have
right now you would go to a you know a
coffee shop and if it was your first
time in a particular coffee shop and you
had a question about something on the
menu they would say I'm sorry I can't
help you or if you were riding transit
in a city that you have never been to
before and you you know got on the bust
and had a question the bus driver would
be able to you know let you on the bus
but if you had a question they wouldn't
be able to help you out so I think
intelligence is something we should put
in all bots and that intelligence isn't
like this magic a I you know magic chat
pod stuff
individual things to solve its
individual features to solve individual
problems and the Microsoft pop framework
has a lot of tools to do this we have
cognitive intelligence tools so that if
your user type something in in a way
that you didn't expect we can correctly
classify that if you have like hashtags
that committee need to break those apart
we have tools for that it's not this
magic a I sprinkle that you put all over
everything its individual purpose built
tools and and Ben's gmail so I think
that was kind of my rapid-fire
high-level pitch for I think why you
should think about putting a I in every
single pot that's out there not just the
ones that are full up artificial
intelligence that all bots should be
intelligent and I think that our tools
are great but honestly like the ones
from IBM are fantastic the runs from wit
that I are fantastic look at them and
find the ones that work for you and if
there are some of ours from the
Microsoft bot framework and the
cognitive services teams let me know and
I want to make them better so I think
that's that's it for me are you ready to
go now not yet we're gonna hold
questions until all six are done right
thank you Dan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
