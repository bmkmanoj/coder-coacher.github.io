you
it's my pleasure to introduce Sunu Pak
who's here today from Korea via Bellevue
and he's in computer science at heist in
South Korea received his BS and computer
science from seong-chil University in
Korea and the MS in computer science
that at Kai's and just finished us his
ph.d and he's done a lot of work on
media and news and today he's gonna talk
to us about detecting media bias Thank
You oh thank you very much for having me
here
I'm Sunil from Caixa I'm very glad to
talk about my PhD work which was about
understanding the different views of
news media and exposing readers to the
diversity of viewpoints and what I'm
going to talk about today is the overall
context and the big picture of this work
for the first 5 minutes and then I'm
going to focus on two papers which I
believe to be relevant to this group
although a lot of material in this work
is about dealing with traditional news
media I believe the results in an ideas
provides many implications and has
possibility of extension to social media
so I hope you all enjoy the talk if you
have any questions feel free to
interrupt
Oh
all right this project was started by
taking a critical view to news media
focusing on that even the same reality
can be delivered differently depending
on news producers and that has a great
impact in readers cognition let's think
about an example together well this is a
pretty old example but I have to use it
it's really symbolic one there are two
pictures about a summit and when you
first see these two pictures
you probably think these pictures just
capture at different moments two
different moments out of hundreds of
other pictures taken that day but when I
saw these two pictures in the front page
of these news media it was really funny
to me to give you some context this
previous president of Korea was
considered as a very liberal person and
an important issue that divides liberals
and conservatives in Korea is the
attitude towards us whether you're
trying to be more independent or you
will try to be maintaining a more
friendly relationship and the newspapers
on the left are very conservative news
media that consistently try to emphasize
that there is a problem in the
relationship between the United States
and this president is causing many
conflicts and it's amazing coincidence
that they all use this same picture they
pick this picture out of thousands of
others the picture which shows a fist
and a stern face of President Bush now
do these two pictures seem to
communicate the same feeling so they're
not just about different moments about
different impression and they probably
selected this in purpose in order to
shape readers cognitions in a certain
way so our project had a aim to design a
news consumption space where people can
discover these different views of news
media and have a more comprehensive
understanding of the reality under the
belief that having access to diversity
and considering them would lead to a
more positive result to the community
and why I think this area can generate
many research issue is because this news
industry has their own well-developed
process that evolve evolve for a long
time they have their own system own
culture so there's a lot to look at it
also regarding this issue of bias
research and mass communication says
this is a structural persistent problem
of the media industry rather than
problems specific journalists
I'll explain by quoting one experienced
journalist who said news production
process itself is a continuous objective
valuation process and as he said during
news gathering they choose what events
and topics to cover during news writing
they choose the style of coverage during
news editing they choose the style of
presentation which article should go to
the top which folder to select and for
each decision making a fair choice is
never easy because they're always
influenced by various factors their own
political ideological views external
external forces owners advertisers so a
news article can be simply seen as a
document written in front of a desk but
if we look at this entire process we can
see what kind of various activities
happens before actual writing and this
generates many research issue for
example a lot of work on news article
analysis opinion mining sentiment
analysis and there are their view down
to the writing style expression of
opinion or sentiment in text but what
this process tell us is that viewpoint
can be expressed also before writing in
the selection of topic or agenda sample
we commonly see different media pushing
different agendas and it can be
expressed also after writing in the way
they create the presentation layer of
layer of contents all this stays has
many other factors in writing allocation
of space combination of stories in the
layout so taking account there's a
structural view of the news production
process can much widen the scope of
research and our basic idea is to look
at this problem from a reader's
perspective we thought it's possible to
support readers to overcome specific
media's view and this would mitigate the
effects of bias to some extent an
effective way to do this is to have
thought an effective way is to help
readers to always recognize the
existence of different views and compare
them so we try to develop automatic news
browsing tools that expose readers to
diversity and change their daily news
browsing behavior
and I think this is a really practical
approach there could be other approaches
if we take a wider view to multiple
disciplines we can example we can think
about the efforts of journalists at the
news production stage they try to
observe journalism ethics and standards
they try alternative reporting formats
point/counterpoint roundtable
discussions but these efforts require a
significant change in the news
production process and success depends
on individual journalist and after
production there are some researchers
experts who try to manually monitor and
diagnose bias and contents there are
some limited trials trying to measure or
correct bias but the point I want to
make is increasing diversity would be a
practical way compared to these
approaches because other approaches like
measurement correction inherently
involves difficult or very questions
like defining what bias is or defining
what an unbiased news is it's a very
difficult question which is hard to come
up with the clearer definition because
of its subjective nature but it's still
possible to say if there is a difference
between viewpoints and just reveal that
a few points without judging a specific
view has bias and by doing so we can
avoid these difficult questions and I
think this also fits well with our goal
our goal is not to assume an unbiased
State and pursue that but is to
encourage readers to have access to
diversity and considerate thing does
that does that make sense
and before I finished the discussion
about this big picture I want to provide
an overview of this research space and
talk about the parts that my work
covered I think there can be about four
main dimensions that characterize this
research space first the domain of
article you deal with because the
characteristic of discourse is going to
be different and second the framing
method there are many ways how
viewpoints are expressed in news
articles third the development of the
technique for news article analysis and
fourth design and evaluation of the user
interface and my work first started by
studying the most common type of article
that we face in ordinary news browser
succession which is straight news and
then studied are closely related framing
method which is fast collection and then
try to develop technique that can
capture diversity for straight news
article considering the different fact
selections and then studied the impact
and user experience and we later
extended this work to deal with news
articles of specific domain that many
people have interest and I think a lot
of future work can be made by following
each of this dimension of a sample this
research could be extended by covering
another domain of article like interview
or editorial or it could be extended by
studying a different type of framing
methods like photo selection space
allocation so I wish this work could be
considered as an initial work that try
to open a big research space now I'm
going to narrow down to the actual work
which consists of three parts the first
part is about the system we developed
for a straight news article which serves
as a basic framework implementing our
approach and later parts our component
technology we paid for more advanced
news article analysis and in this time
I'm going to mainly talk about the first
two parts the system we developed I'm
just going to use an example to help you
make sense of this system imagine that
your government announced a new property
tax plan and let's assume the news
articles you get to see about this tax
plan or like this this is an actual list
of news articles captured from Google
News Korea you can see a lot of articles
talking about the tax increase when
readers are only exposed to these
articles they may instantly feel that
the tax is going to be increased for
their houses but this is news cue the
articles that talk about the tax
increase are clustered into a certain
area and the system provides an overview
classified view of articles that
provides different information about
this plane you can find an article that
covers the argument of the policy
designer who says this is a
normalization of property tax and how
this collected taxes is going to be used
suburban
and also there was an article that says
the plan doesn't affect houses in most
districts at all and these different
articles provide different viewpoints
and information about this tax plan and
we also later observe that being aware
of these different stories lead to
different perception about this plan so
the system was designed to encourage
readers to browse through these
different stories well in many new
services news articles are typically
organized based on offense so when our
user visits they select and read one
article per topic and they move on to
under the topic well it would be very
rare but even if the user wants to read
different stories related to the same
event as Michael they would have to
expend this event and they clip this
small link and then they would find a
lot of articles in a simple list
interface so if you have to go through
and try to find different stories we try
to change this interaction sequence so
whenever the user clicks an event the
system provides an overview of different
stories and even when the user moves on
to a specific article that interface
keep tries to give awareness on a
different articles that the user to the
Nexxus we conceptualized this way of
news browsing as aspect level news
browsing which means it helps readers to
browse through different aspects of the
selected event that are not covered in a
single story so the goal of the system
was to lay a basic framework that can be
used to test if diversity can be
achieved through automatic news browsing
interfaces although this is a single
design goal there were a wide variety of
issues we had to deal with in
development the breadth of issues you
get to deal with when you build an
automatic system so in the first part of
this work we focused on characterizing
these issues and find a feasible
solution for each issue rather than
going deep and try to find an optimal
solution for a specific problem and
among those I'm going to talk about
mainly talk about three issues that we
deal with in this study first one is how
this concept diversity should be
interpreted for straight news articles
and the second is how the classification
methods to capture this diversity and
the third one is whether this
presentation of diversity have impact
and user experience now a fundamental
issue is how this diversity should be
interpreted for straight news which
means what should be the criteria when
we just the difference between articles
this isn't very important but difficult
questions because it can be many
properties related to viewpoints for
example nuance of specific words tone
style of writing so we try to find a
solution that provides a basis
considering the characteristic of our
data straight news is a typical form of
news that mainly intend to deliver facts
to inform readers and doesn't include
much journalist commentary or opinion we
try to interpret this diversity from an
information selection view which means
different viewpoint would lead to
different selection of information as in
these example articles although they
cover the same event the central theme
articulated in the story that we call
aspect is different memorials and this
also fits well with a widely quoted
definition on news framing of the mass
communication literature which says
different selection of aspects in a is
an important way of expressing
viewpoints well we could consider other
factors like tone or style of writing
but these factors are inherently
subjective to some extent and has
subtleties so it's hard to interpret
clearly so we first focused on this
different selection of aspects and why I
believe this interpretation provides a
basis it's not just because it's related
to a mass communication theory but we
also try to we also verify the
effectiveness of this interpretation
experimentally to try to see if people
have agreement when they interpret
diversity in this way which means if we
give this criteria do people interpret
it in the same manner we did
to experiments the first one was we
asked people to interpret the
articulator aspect for a sample of
article we asked them to select the core
sentences that seemed to describe the
articulated aspect so if they
interpreted similarly they would select
the same set of sentences and the second
experiment was to see the agreement in
the classification when greement when
they judged the similarity between
articles so we gave we gave them a set
of news articles covering the same event
and then asked them to perform a spirit
level classification and then observed
the similarity between classification
results and in both experiments there
was a high level of agreement which
means interpreting diversity in this way
is an effective approach so the goal of
the classification method should be to
create a classification result that is
similar to a manually created the
classification result that is agreed
among different people and the second
issue is now about this class how we
should make this classification method
this itself is a big research problem
there's a lot of work on doc document
indexing feature extraction document
classification but we try to build a
unique solution specific to our data
because we deal with this specific type
of document straight news articles which
we try to build it based on close
observation of news reporters news
outlets and discover some useful
heuristics that can be combined with
conventional oil NLP techniques I'm just
going to briefly summarize the key ideas
here we observed how journalists write
stories to understand how they put the
key information in the news articles and
we've found this rule called the
inverted pyramid style of writing which
says they put the key information first
and they support it in the diminishing
order of importance in the main text so
there's tell us where the important
terms are likely to be located and how
much they're important based on how much
they're supported in the main text
and for classification we use this
framing cycle when multiple news outlets
cover the same event there's a certain
pattern as in this example this example
shows the news articles that cover the
same event the amount of article
published over time and the color
represents the covered aspect in this
article and as you can see at the start
of the event most of the news articles
cover the same stories and the covers
aspect diverged over time and this is
closely related to the news gathering
behavior of porters at the start of an
event they tend to rely on identical
news sources like press releases news
agency reports and later depending on
their editing direction they reach out
for different sources different
stakeholders experts and as they do to
cover the aspect diverged when we see
this framing cycle from a classification
view we can see a long tail like
distribution of classification result
there's a big article group which
include the majority of articles which
cover their early stage aspect and then
there are several small groups as a
result of that of this divergence well
I'm not going to go I'm not going to
explain the detail of this algorithm but
knowing this kind of distribution of the
classification result in advance can
support the classification task
significantly I think an analogy can be
made to latent semantic indexing LSI
tries to use the latent meaning behind
the term right what I tried to do was to
use this latent distribution of
classification result in the
classification task well if you have
question I can explain about the details
later
is this a very very general atom that
you observe across like different types
of news events might say disasters or
unexpected events versus expected events
my characters were certain outcome or do
you see differences
this is I have served regardless of the
category news category and it was quite
general but the difference I observed
was which news events that evolved
really quickly this pattern is quite
different for those for example if the
event transforms into a different event
and evolves differently then this like
shrinks and there's another big spike
later that that was the difference I
observed no use if it's okay we also
observed that applying these kind of
ideas can improve the performance we
measure the accuracy by comparing the
classification result to the manually
created classification result which was
obtained in the previous experiment
remember the experiment we asked them
people to manually classify result and
we measured the similarity using the F
measure and we observed that planting
this ideas could you know improve the
accuracy the similarity of the
classification result to the manually
created classification results and the
last issue is the user experience study
and these are very crucial experiments
because it verifies the idea whether
News browser interface can shape
behavior and cognition the experiment
was twofold we try to see if the system
encourage readers to select and read
more diverse stories and later try to
observe whether that has an impact in
readers cognition and considering this
behavior aspect we traced what articles
people read when they use the system we
conducted a between subjects study so
one group used news cube one group use
Google News one group use random cue
random which has the same interface as
news cube but the articles were classify
randomly so by comparing the news cube
with Google News you can see if the
difference of interface lead to
different behavior and by comparing news
cube to random cue
you can see if a proper classification
is necessary and we measure the number
of articles read by each user and also
the diversity of read articles the
belief is briefly summarized the result
the news cube users did read more number
of articles and also more diverse
stories which means which indicates that
if the interface more prominently
displays the articles that give
different information about this this
selected event that definitely seems to
increase the chance for a user to
selected and I think it's possible to
speculate more about additional factors
which may influence readers article
selection by comparing with another
closely related work there's a group in
University of Michigan who did a very
similar study Shawn Munson and professor
Paul Resnick did a study on the
relationship between readers
satisfaction and the amount of liberal
or conservative items and the
recommendation list and they tested some
visualization technique like
highlighting items or changing orders
and they somewhat reported a
contradictory result says readers
satisfaction didn't significantly change
depending on the visualization technique
and I thought this may be this may
reveal the different motive of users
which would be another important factor
and their work they used politically
explicit content like blog posts
political commentary and the participant
also had a clear political preference so
what the interface is asking is close to
I know that you have a certain viewpoint
and here are items that express opposing
viewpoints what would you select but in
our case we use straight news articles
which doesn't explicitly explicitly
express political preference and many of
the participants didn't have a clear
political preference and also we
organized them based on topic so what
the interface is asking is close to here
are articles that give different
information about this select an event
that you don't know although this look
may seem to be a subtle thing but I
think it can be a
important one that can lead to different
interface strategy example people may
not be generous to the content that
expressed opposing view but they may
want to read the article that give
different information they don't know
about the selected event there could be
motive to seek opposing views and there
could be motive to seek more context and
information and if many people show this
kind of behavior being generous to
articles that give different information
I don't know the interface can try to
keep increased diversity further by
using primarily fact-based articles or
organizing based on contents so helping
users to find more relevant but new
information and as such I think it's
going to be possible to discover
additional factors and try to find more
elaborated interface strategy and coming
back to our work considering the
cognitive aspect we try we try to more
closely observe the opinion development
process we recruited both people who
have a clear political preference and
also those who didn't have a clear
political preference and for each group
half of them used news queue and half of
them use Google News and we observe the
difference between them and we did
observe some promising points I'm gonna
summarize them here regardless of the
existence of a predetermined views use
cube users that show some difference
from Google News users these cube users
when they use the system they instantly
recognize that the news events they're
reading are can be our contentious
issues so it can be seen from different
perspective but compared to that the
Google News user who didn't have a
predetermined opinion they tend to just
follow the viewpoint based on the
article they read this was the first
difference and another difference we
observed was while we did the interview
when the when these cue users explained
their viewpoints they brought up much
more detailed information compared to
Google News users because they read more
articles and get better aware of that
event and another point
was when they explained their viewpoint
they brought up different views and
commented about them and why they did it
follow those few points well I'm not
saying that they accepted or agreed with
different viewpoints but at least they
knew it and they brought up commented
about that so we could see that they're
considering it and I would like to
conclude this first part by mentioning
some interesting future research
questions considering the behavioral
aspect I think it's going to be
interesting to see if people
consistently seeks diversity or they
just return to their original behavior
in long term and as I mentioned it's
going to be interesting to see
discover more interface factors and
strategy and considering the cognitive
aspect one interesting thing we observed
was some people were more confident
about their viewpoint after being aware
of different views because they consider
it and they had reason why they picked
this viewpoint but on the other hand
there were also people who hesitated to
pick a specific position after being
aware of different views so I think it's
going to be also interesting to see if
there's a relation between greater
exposure and paralysis and epithet and
before I move on to the second part if
there's any questions I can answer you
if there's no questioning to just move
on okay
now after building the system that we
try to more focus on specific domain of
article that many people have interest
and absolutely political news articles
was one of that important area and what
motivation came from the responses from
art user studies many people expected a
clear opposing category of news articles
like liberal or conservative but
actually when you look at news articles
it's difficult to put them into this
clear opposing frame in many cases but
anyhow people expect that pretty much
because Simmons similar to us liberal
versus conservative is a very typical
frame that people use to view politics
and although this frame has many
limitations it's also used in many
studies political discourse political
science studies use this frame to
characterize the discourse a lot of
studies on internet contents based on
this frame also there are many studies
on characterizing people's political
preferences but the problem is that it's
really difficult to interpret political
orientation from news articles political
discourse is very complex it's involved
in wide variety of issues politician
parties government social policy foreign
policy even religion and the discourse
is realized differently depend on
depending on each of this issue let's
take let's see some example arguments
about this health care reform debate
reported in the US articles and as you
can see here the text doesn't simply
says for health care or against health
care they address various different
topics around the reform emphasize
different facts articulate different
arguments well people who have the
knowledge about this issue can interpret
whether the arguments are supportive or
negative to the reform but it's
difficult to do that computationally and
what makes more difficult particularly
for a news article is that the discourse
changes rapidly a new quote new fact
always appears and people respond to
that update
this course rapidly change continuously
changes in a daily basis or sometimes
faster now we can think of several
directions of solution for this problem
the first one would be of course
approaching based on text analysis
actually there are a number of works
that employ this approach they often
pick some specific issues and conduct
case study on those issues but I thought
this approach is has somewhat limited
somewhat limited to apply in real world
scenarios because well here's how they
do what they pick an issue they use some
data as training data and develop
classifier and tested and other
documents addressing the same topic but
because this classifier is specifically
trained to this specific issue whenever
a new issue appears you have to do this
all over again
it's a very costly process if especially
when this course changes rapidly as in
news articles and another thing we can
think of is using the metadata on news
articles I really I got this question
pretty frequently what says can we
identify the new political orientation
from the source information and this is
partly true it's easier to find liberal
stories form the New York Times and find
conservative stories from Wall Street
Journal and we conducted a quick
analysis measuring the proportion of the
news articles published from the sources
which have a clear political preference
and you anyone who wanna guess oh no
idea it was about 25 percent so for like
74 percent it's difficult to directly
infer the political orientation from the
news source information well this was
done with news articles in Korea and
some so it might be different for but
anyhow and also regarding this 26% the
articles published from the sources
which have a clear political preference
they don't always produce like
politically biased contents it
you have to think about some more ideas
and we thought there will be something
valuable in social annotation on news
articles and tip approach using them
because it includes collective knowledge
of people who are able to interpret
language issues also as political
context which is required for political
fuel analysis we specifically use the
comments on news articles actually if
the comet errs we thought there will be
people who actively react a political
orientation of news articles and provide
valuable feedback because people tend to
have a strong and clear political
preference and that can't be
characterized either as liberal or
conservative and these political
preference is likely to be consistent
over time and consistent over issue I'm
going to show some example comments
responding to an example news event
which was about nomination of a prime
minister in Korea may I have the Korean
president and well the first comment
says I'm good at translating so the
president is very smart but the nominee
was considered as the potential
presidential candidate also from the
opposition parties so the nomination
looks bipartisan the second comment says
that comments about the nominees thought
about a government project the nominee
looks like so naive or if he's not then
he's being stupid and the third comment
responds to a story about a suspicion
related to the nominee saying well
what's basically about it's just
swearing the nominee well anyhow we can
see that these commenters all understand
the meaning and the domination and
express their thoughts in the comments
sighs is it the new cycle of people to
new comments yeah so okay so this gives
a glimpse of our idea assume there's a
person who actively leaves comment too
many news articles and let's assume
she's liberal and there's a certain
pattern in her behavior when she reads a
liberal article just tend to leave a
positive comment and when she reads a
conservative article say she leaves a
very negative come we call this pattern
as sentiment pattern the pattern in the
sentiment of comments responding to
political orientation of news articles
if this sort of if this sort of pattern
is quite common this problem can be much
easier just by identifying the sentiment
of comments we can predict the political
orientation of New Zealanders and
identifying the sentiment of comets is
likely to be easier than analyzing
political orientation because comments
tend to be concise they people
explicitly express sentiment and they
often include explicit words like great
worries bad so our study was to analyze
the usefulness of this sentiment pattern
for various perspectives whether we can
really observe such pattern and how
common that pattern is and how regular
the pattern is and I think the
contribution of this work is majorly
in the detailed empirical investigation
of commenters and helping follow-up
works to think about how they can use
this and I think understanding and
characterizing these this kind of
behavioural pattern will be also useful
in social media tweets it's this these
this kind of ideas can be you know fly
to social media and the data that we use
for this study we look collected all
data from navy news which is a very
popular news portal in South Korea we
first example two sets of news articles
the general set is made by crawling the
political issue archive which records
major political issues and the popular
set is made ah the general set includes
articles with many comments and also
those with few comments and the popular
set is made by crawling the 20 most
popular political news of the day for
six-month period and as the stories are
popular they all have many comments and
from each said we extracted top 50
commenters who believe the most common
and from each commenter we sampled 40
comments to trace their common history
and we observed this data regarding
these three questions these are the
major points we need to understand to
see how effective this approach can be
first whether there are active
commenters those who leave comments on a
large amount of articles if there are
active commenters it's possible to deal
with a large number of news articles
with small number of commenters second
whether they show a clear and consistent
political preference either as liberal
or conservative and third and the most
important is whether they really show
this kind of regular sentiment pattern
I'm going to summarize our observation
regarding these points we measured the
covered amount of covered our articles
by these top 50 comment and as you can
see here is these top 50 commenters
covered both of the popular news
articles but the coverage seems to be
low for general news articles but this
is mainly because there are many
articles that have few comments if we
this red dotted line here shows the
proportion of news articles that have at
least 5 comments so if we only consider
these articles the covers is not low
it's actually significant and covering
the articles with many comments is
important because news articles that are
located in visible places like Center or
head of a webpage they get many comments
and the news article that don't have
only have few comments they were the
articles that were located in
unnoticeable places so this results
indicate that these top 50 commenters
are elected to cover the most of the
articles that people
are likely to be and we also also
observed that these top 50 commenters
are active for a long time
among the commenters of the popular set
near 70 74 percent left comments more
than six months and during this period
they also left comments frequently we
measure the time between two consecutive
comment of commenter and that was less
than three days in most cases so with
92% chance they come back within three
days and leave another comment the
result was pretty much similar for the
general set so I'm just gonna skip this
and then we studied whether these
commenters were clear political
preference we observed the preference
based on the position they expressed
about the issues they discussed in their
comments for example if the position was
consistently conservative we classified
the commenter as conservative and if the
positions would switched at least once
in our sample we classified the
commenter as a vague commenter and we
observed that most of them do show
consistency for the general set 54
liberal 38 conservative popular set 62
conservative okay 24 liberal and wait
this might be because maybe there are
people who well I'm not sure but this is
just a rumor but anyhow there's a story
that the government hires some
commenters to leave comment that support
their agenda
conservatives don't make the look
outside anything right in front
part of me I said we're the
Conservatives only look at the thing
that's right in front of them
I have any breath hired sort of
reviewers review spam on occasion
science I'm in a commercial environment
I think politically is any size out of
way that it seemed like it but I
actually
this data was observed under this
conservative administration and maybe we
have a lot of conservative for the
populace it because maybe they target
popular news article to have access to a
lot of people and last time the most
important was whether these commenters
show a regular sentiment pattern it's
important though it's important to note
that consistency of political
orientation doesn't guarantee a regular
pattern example even if a person is
liberal the person may leave negative
comment to any article regardless of the
political orientation of news articles
the person may always attack
conservatives regardless of the content
of the news articles that's not the
pattern we expect what we expect is to
leave expressed different sentiments
depending on political orientation of
new sort and we characterize the
sentiment pattern with two types of
commenting behavior positive mass and
the negative meds for example if this
woman is liberal positive matches to
leave a positive comment to a liberal
article and negative match is to leave
neg negative comment too conservative
article if this woman was conservative
they would indicate the opposite we
observed how frequently these positive
matches or negative matches appear in
the common history if there appear most
of the times that means the person shows
a very regular sentiment pattern and for
each person we measure the degree of
regularity using conditional probability
and we observe that some commenters do
show pretty regular sentiment pattern
it's not that general but there are some
proportion of people who show this kind
of regular sentiment pattern and I'm
going to talk about how we use this
regular peep who people who show regular
behavior we model each individual
commenter as a base classifier which
takes the sentiment of a comment as
input and outputs the maximum likely
class of the political article it's
really simple very very simple model and
we conducted experiments to see the
accuracy
this idea we compared three methods to
versions of our idea and a typical
text-based classification method the
difference between the two version is in
how we analyze the sentiment of comment
for the first version we did it manually
so this shows the upper bound of the
proposed idea and the next best text
classification was a very typical one
tf-idf combined with an SVM classifier
and we first used 14 commenters who show
a really regular sentiment pattern and
as a result the method achieved around
75% in both general and popular set and
both versions I'll perform the text
analysis method and we also measure the
coverage of the proposed idea we call
that we only use the small number of
commenters who used who expressed who
shall really regular behavior the
coverage was about 31 put the popular
set but it was really low for the
general set which is mainly because
there are many articles with few
comments if we only consider the
articles which have more than five
comments the coverage increases to 21%
and in the second round we included more
commenters who show a little bit less
regular behavior so we added 25 people
and measure the performance and the
accuracy drops a little bit as we
include this less regular commenters but
it still it sees around 70% and both
version still outperforms text-based
analysis method and this coverage
increases significantly it's cover
almost the half of the news articles and
another important experiment was about
the learning curve we analyzed the
accuracy while varying the size of the
training data from 5 samples per
commenter to 20 samples per commenter
and we observed that the accurate
accuracy was quite stable regardless of
this size of the training data this mean
that we don't need that many samples for
training this would much believe the
burden and view usage scenarios
and we also tested one extended simple
extension of this idea which is to use
multiple commenters who comment on the
same article it basically aggregates the
prediction of individual commenter this
could be more robust to irregular
behavior of one commenter because it can
be complemented by other commenters and
this is the result which is pretty
straightforward if we use more number of
commenters equity tend to increase but
the coverage decreases because more
number of commenters have to leave
comment so I'm going to conclude this
talk by discussing some of the potential
future work I think this kind of study
provides meaningful implication to other
types of media like Twitter or other
social media first of all I believe
similar pattern can be also observed
from them social media but of course the
way how user revealed their preference
will be different because in social
media their identity is quite revealed
so the style of language may be
different people may have different
motives they may try to recommend some
content and they may show some different
patterns and also I think also this kind
of behavior pattern will be observed in
other cases when people react to
products companies brands so it would be
possible to extend this idea to these
different domains and also I think more
sophisticated modeling of this behavior
would be also possible so we could we
maybe also think about how we could use
other social annotation data like
Facebook like button block things etc
I think I talked about an hour so you
this is the part I prepare so there's
any question I would be happy to take
questions if there really are prettier
talk so well I'll talk about another
paper in the health lives we'll come
back around 20 or so there's some work
for the bright white and Eric Corbett's
here on cyberchondria cyberchondria and
a few singers paper but it's a tendency
that when you're searching about medical
conditions on lines it like very quickly
think you have cancer or some totally
horrible thing you know you start off
searching for headache and before you
know you're reading about brain cancer
and you're all paranoid or whatever so
anyway it's kind it's a fun paper but
they think the general point of that
paper that might apply especially the
first part of your work was that the the
probabilities that are conveyed to you
in the search results are actually
totally out of whack with reality right
so when you search for a headache google
shows you lots of links about brain can
actually so it looks like I have like
based on the links it's like a 50%
chance of brain cancer but in reality in
points I don't intend 100,000 or so how
that relates to the first part is you
know you were pulling out these sort of
different
tributes and viewpoints into into
different sections so there may be a
role for conveying like what wasn't what
about taxes so opinion is one thing
right you know the different sides but
think about taxes like or maybe a role
for conveying to the user somehow
something that conveys the probability
of outcome are sort of their underlying
reality of the situation because it
might does that make sense so you sure
that the example is there's a whole
bunch of about taxes and it's like you
might think oh my god there's gonna be
some big tax honey well is there any way
to find out like what is the likelihood
of so it's one thing to say you know
here's the prom' taxes appears that they
open if pro is actually very likely to
happen then maybe owner you bump that up
or or something I don't know if there's
a way to sort of incorporate some notion
of these kind of underlying
the sort of probability of these things
actually happening we could you could if
you have like that really a multi-tool
auditor that's right I mean you show it
I think before correct my school my
grandbaby yeah the tax property tax
situation but let's say you show for but
you have you know twenty I know you
could you could serve make it visually
clear which one is or was it similar
yeah so the aspect to most of the ones
about yeah exactly like right so when
you pull out you know the counter
example or something if only two out of
a hundred articles we're actually about
the counter maybe I don't convey that or
somehow use that to give users almost
like a little bit of a meta perspective
we should go
think about example the portion of these
articles that cover a certain aspect and
also the portion of articles that cover
different aspect we can display that
kind of information to help leaders to
make sense about the distribution but
hmm well news cube system is actually
trying to increase the likelihood of the
display of like minor things that are
not reported in majority of news
articles pushing people to you know yeah
yeah yeah get more variety of
information opinion pieces and
viewpoints
in fact I was thinking about when I were
talking my music you guys think about
this cyberchondria stuff I'm using that
interface in these health context could
be you know might might be kind of
useful because I think that the standard
interface that doesn't make any
distinction between the thing that's
highly unlikely and the thing in reality
and the thing that's very likely you
know it is actually doing that user a
real disservice I wanted to show you
this chart which is about why I you know
why i sticked on this idea of increasing
diversity
this shows a market share and newspaper
market share in south korea and this
three lines shows the market share of
the three very conservative news media
which i showed at the first slide and
the top line here shows the sum of these
three media showing how much the market
is concentrated to these three media
while they hold about like 60% of the
market share consistently for decades
these these poor two lines shows the new
market share that are considered as
liberal you can see an amazing clear
imbalance this is like having like three
fox news channel in small country or 30%
or so yeah those are not like clear
doesn't which doesn't have a clear but
mostly like many of the newspapers are a
conservative side in south korea
gonna have half okay let the selections
flip in an election but pretty much
close to like half and half yeah not
representing great granulation
similar terms with the TV channels so
are like three major TV channels and if
any
like popular new health you know
some news and all the traffic channels
show and that everyone can do I mean
everyone in Korea basically loves it
it's not Punisher here that's the best
sorry
very good
I have a wonderful question so you
mentioned about the reverse pyramid is
the structure but use newspaper and
that's that makes
years to extract some of the aspects
that would it apply to other I don't
know like paper you know searching let
me know because there are like you know
certainly viewpoints you know for
operating system let's not use the
you know they're like very controversial
before that they you know or you know
they're very um yeah so it doesn't only
apply to the newspaper or it can be
generalized to other materials like
research papers or a box of journals are
there would be another kind of structure
for other type of documents pretty boys
and acts I think there actually are
works that use the specific structure
for research papers a lot of people use
the terms in the abstract section more
important find about proper structure
yeah I guess and this inverted pyramid
structures like that it's been like an
implicit standard for a long time when
journalists write stories because it's
related to like you know when you write
a story and then you don't have enough
time to edit it but you have to put it
but when you got when you get another
advertisement you have to cut the
article from the bottom you can simply
cut it that's why like it's kind of
obviously we all yeah so you want to get
the most important information only
because we don't even know if people are
gonna read yeah and I mean that's also
what automatic summarization that's the
simplest base let's always to take the
first one first two sentences and it's
very hard to read that people are doing
that with research paper on your
research papers do like you said there's
a pretty clear structure right it I mean
my the abstract first of all there's the
abstract but thank you god there's an
intro here's a related word my finding
is the discussion
and there are also many works to try to
analyze the relationship between papers
based on the related sector related work
section the sense of yeah other the
sense when they put each other
website that's anything yeah what was
the response I'm just curious and how
many did you get some media coverage
well it was like more than probably
maybe four years well at that time it
didn't make left like it didn't have big
impacts I didn't get any media coverage
and only a small portion of people use
it it was like several hundreds low
thousands one reason might be because if
I want to make this site to have really
a big impact I had to compete with like
internet news portals which provide a
lot of different services and you know
when the users of news cubes they just
first visit and says oh this is pretty
new thing and it's really different but
and they go on to the news website they
usually go so it didn't work I did I
didn't get a lot of traffic
yes terrible scenario
but I think situation is pretty much
better these days because what people
are Twitter example to advertise their
work I think a lot of access to really
many people even if it will be a short
time mister but anyhow you have much
more access to many people these are our
three but you can use Twitter to tweet
out different viewpoints on the same
right right right yeah exactly
just take your same stories it just pump
them out in Twitter and just say a few
point number one you might know where to
go whatever right you know just push it
at people basically yeah that always
helps get users Thanks thank you thank
