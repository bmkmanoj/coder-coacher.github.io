you
so good morning everyone thank you for
coming it's my pleasure to introduce
Sophia anon the odd Oh she'll be giving
a talk that's titled extracting events
from biomechanical relevance from text
so currently Sophia is the director of
the National Center for text mining the
University of Manchester as well as a
professor in computer science there
I've had a long the pleasure of knowing
Sophia for quite a long time and the
first bio NLP workshop which it was at
2001 or 2002 I remember attending so - I
remember attending that workshop because
I was really interested in text mining
for biomedical from biomedical text and
Sophia and professor sushi both
cautioned me they said you shouldn't go
into this unless you have a partner in
biology it is just too too much
otherwise and so I heated their warning
but now I have partners I you know both
at Microsoft and at University of
Washington but it's really been a very
interesting field and I'm excited that
Sophia will tell us more about it thank
you thanks Lucifer introduction so I
would focus on one only area I mean
we're doing several things in at the
ethnic time well just to give you the
first slide to understand what who we
are and what we are doing like time
resides at the University of Manchester
and that's what you said you need to be
co-located with biology so they placed
us at the Manchester interdisciplinary
bio centre with the mainly chemists
biologists and people like that who are
actually quite interested in why we're
doing so or we started around two
thousand and four and five and we
focused predominantly on providing text
mining services solutions for the bio
domain the medical increasingly the
medical now the main now we are a
sustainable Center I just provided only
two or three of our funders we have been
funded by industry and other all the
different types of funders so
I so all the things I'm gonna say today
are being power part of the center the
work we have been doing but mostly I
will focus on more amost recent work on
extracting events as a qualifier of
biological relevance and explained
what's that why we're talking about
events in biomedicine we have what we
call this fragmentation and different
types of specialism suspect sub special
isms there are different components
aspects in systems biology or in systems
medicine increasingly the deal with
chemistry the biology medicine and lots
of omics different levels from
transcriptomics to genomics metabolomics
proteomics etc so all this type of the
translational to deal with the various
translational aspects for different
applications one needs to go into a kind
of deeper type of analysis of text not
just of course keyword extraction or
Association mining but trying to find
out more complex information as I'll
discuss what is an event I will also
talk in play some emphasis in my talk in
some applications which are related with
events so I'll skip all the rest so the
whole discussion is going to be about
event extraction and how this has been
realized in different applications so in
case you haven't heard before I don't
know whether your background some people
of course know all about that much one
was processing people but maybe some of
you or not if we take a simple sentence
that he find any paper midline like
expression of Araby enhances
phosphorylation of essex k1 and for EBP
1 which is a normal sentence this
sentence includes various types of
events some are complex aren't simple a
simple event of a type is an expression
which was realized with a nominalization
expression it has a trigger and the
themes the object is Aurora B you have
another event dealing with
phosphorylation
whose team is s6k one and another event
and again which it starts from
phosphorylation another object 4e b p1
now those events also have if you look
at the event for which is the under
enhances after enhances you have two
types of regulate positive regulation
and the positive regulation has a kind
of cause and effect and the cause
includes another one event the event one
the expression which you will see here
do you have any a pointer perhaps I
guess you do yeah this one so you have
this so they went one and then they went
to which is phosphorylation which is the
theme here and another more complex
event so it's to give you an idea of the
types of analysis we need to do why we
need to do that is because you're going
we need to go to a level which is
bridging the universe of text then all
you know the sphere of text with with
knowledge and biologists care really
much more about first for you know more
sort of biological events of biological
pertinence what is biologically
important then what is actually the
expression in text so I have now that
you've seen what actually we're trying
to do by event is beyond relation so
people in the past have really focused
on extracting protein protein
interactions gene disease associations
so there's still a kind of binary type
of relation which is instance somehow
simpler to do but what we are dealing
here is much more complex is really
going into a type of bridging to the
knowledge sphere of biology so it's a
what we call a more an event is a
dynamic a bio relation which most of the
time is has many arguments so very
rarely it's a kind of binary and all
those events how we draw them from
reality we use ontology is very often
use go ontology but you can create use
define or merge different types of
neurologists
and they have lots of participants in
languages we call them Fein cause
whatever can be arguments but this roles
are really geared by the domain
basically the domain dependent and the
various types of participants could be
as you so before other entities like bio
entities proteins or genes but
increasingly they have they have other
events so a bio event has it's a white
is quite complex because it draws from
autologous and includes different types
of other entities so this is going to be
basically the focus of my talk I'll just
focus only on events and I will explain
how this what kind of technology we have
used to build that as part of members of
my team and how we applied you this
event extraction to search the semantic
search existing systems we already hired
like media our systems were actually
mine associations directing direct
associations where you can do this
including events increasingly events of
course are very important for like
extracting bio processes like
angiogenesis and also if you want to I
go talking about my first slide the
various omics types of problem if you
want to integrate multiple levels of
biological organization which I will
discuss in addition we have included
integrated this technology in towards
pathway reconstruction and I don't say
construction because we don't do
automatic triggers like yeah that's very
difficult but how you can actually
produce the types of evidence to enrich
the pathways and last but not least is
actually a quite everything a very
interesting and a coming area is what we
call the event interpretation so what
are the experimental findings or what is
not known information or old or
hypothetical or speculative that
actually could be very important when
you're
building for certain for all the above
and for pathways for that I will not
discuss you need of course to have most
of our techniques currently have been
supervised so you need are not training
you need to have training data and I'm
not going to talk about this but you can
find the one I think quite a few people
know by in Ferran genia another event
corpora that we have basically built and
last but not least I ended my talk with
the share tasks were extremely important
in the community first of all to inform
and evaluate our tools but also to
obtain the training core prefer to be
able to build more tools so this is the
focus on the applications is basically
semantic search hypothesis then
generated is very important for medical
clinical applications in order to mine
direct and indirect associations
extracting events across multiple
domains and reaching pathways and also
to do that I will very briefly allude to
an environment a platform we have built
which are integrates the processing
components and annotation which is very
important for the curators so basically
what I said before it's a kind of nice
diagram and because I've done it why not
it's exactly the same thing I told you
before this scent is basically can
represented by the various events
phosphorylation binding with different
types of arguments here you have for
instance aside theme and then the top
are basically event is negative
regulation this is what the biologist
when they want to search they're
interested in negative regulation in
positive regulation in inhibition and so
on the very rarely if you start
searching with keywords you would have
an enormous amount of noise of not the
most much relevance for biology so for
that we have one of the tools I
represent briefly and if you want the
lots of papers that it's basically me
was work who used to work with Genesis
team in Tokyo and where he started this
actually told and now he's working with
not
so he went mine is basically detects
extracts event structures and is using a
deep parser nju I'm not going to talk
about angel because it's basically
extracting predicate argument structures
so it's a kind of more deeper syntax so
what he does what event mine does maps
from the deepest results into event
structures and his mill has used all
sorts of different features experiment
as you will see for classification
shortest paths bug of worlds and so on
and it's an SVM type of you know is its
training classifiers because we am using
various annotated corpora for each
module annotated corpora have been
mostly used by the shared tasks that's
why they're very important and of course
the the work of genius that we have
janeshia has built over several years so
how this I actually work very briefly if
you want more you can read especially
the last those papers where he describes
in detail event mine
it's a pipeline is a kind of a
traditional pipeline of an event
extraction system which has fallen
component so each component is done in
sort of module dependently you have the
triggers the entity detector so you have
a phosphorylation extracting identified
entry guess is a quite challenging stuff
often because lots of ambiguity and
there's been quite a lot of work of
people trying to improve actually the
extraction of triggers so you have
foreign deep negative regulation
inhibits another trigger for binding for
the event binding is binding and
entities then the next part is actually
once you identify the triggers you have
to find the arguments or the edges and
for this you have as a it's based on
engine a parser
so you have inhibits and phosphorylation
inhibits the by
and inhalation of fame the arguments
binding in cd40 and so on the I think
what we believe is a very interesting as
you will see later own part is how
you're dealing with multiple arguments
so you have then a multi argument event
detector so you have here inhibits has
causality so you have this type of
information and binding and theme and so
on complex basically events and
multi-argument event detection is
extremely important for the types of
complex events we were talking about and
this will be seen with some of the
results they have produced the last but
you have on top of that once you finish
with that multi-argument detection you
had the modification and the
modification is mostly information like
hedging speculation contradiction
negation and so on so in the bio NLP
task equally it receives actually he has
been he got about 58 percent 15 which is
really one of the top of scores so
somewhere further information which you
can find on under the latest paper is
the type of it's basically a multi class
multi-label classification problem and
some of the feature types are described
here for triggers for arguments shorter
paths terminal nodes worse around kunti
pairs and so on and for mark the
argument for modification so they have
been several extensions to event mine
which we thought they were quite
important especially when we are dealing
with full papers but i think the most
important is for when you're trying to
adapt event mine to different domains
not even even within biology and
biomedicine so if you're trying to
attract persons for pathways you have
signaling to metabolic pathways you have
different types of arguments and you
need to adapt your type of event
extraction so the first the see this is
basically that in this recent paper
everything is
right there so I'm going to repeat the
same paper but just very very briefly
talk about the current resolution and
the domain adaptation in the end I will
talk about the meta knowledge assignment
so in a sense event mind after you know
after you extract multi-argument vent
there's three more things it has
currents it is it already has include
some component for domain adaptation
using various corporate leaders meta
knowledge assignment basically
hypothesis negation speculation
well a very simple thing what is the
correct forints resolution you have to
link mentions mentions and antecedents
so in this case is a very simple example
example of the MS treatment was also
associated with a rapid induction of
June D gene although expression of this
gene was prolong compared to that so you
have you need to link basically mentions
with the antecedents this is
increasingly important it's very
important for full papers rather than
less than abstracts so users can be seen
when you're dealing extracting events
from full papers although I have to warn
you you don't find a kind of Wow and a
fantastic you know improvement in the
event mind in the event cognition so
still is a difficult problem that's the
face you so this basically includes a
kind of rule-based core efference where
you actually have to detect dimensions
candidates then the antecedents and then
the links so so basically how those
sorry how those results are integrated
into the event extraction system is by
modifying the parser is also mention
semantics in to share the dependencies
this is the PR feature and then
extending the features to have
qualifiers core official mentions to
argument detector features the FE so
what you see here is
basically this is the best performance
here by adding all those features and is
about 58 from the baseline 458 15 a 58
81 so in the tiny one tiny one so this
was actually not trained he was trained
on abstracts and applied to full papers
so it's actually not bad I think we
believe it if we had the annotated
corpora on full papers with core
efference then it would have been
slightly better on a domain adaptation
which I think it's a much more
interested and he used two methods so
the main adaptation the stacking methods
and then the weighting method which he
has applied for the instance weighting
method which has applied for they took
types of research tasks Virginia 2009
and 11 the interesting thing is here
actually in that in the last sare tasks
they have been different types have been
full papers and abstracts and we had
also types of relations and the events
which are quite different types so they
Infectious Diseases for distance or the
epigenetic corpus had different types of
events and of course the other
phosphorylation and the additional sare
tasks so when you're actually comparing
the performance you have to see it
across different domains in this case is
the epigenetics or the infectious
diseases and different types of effects
full and abstracts so actually from here
you can see a quite big jump from 47% to
51% and fifty to fifty 2.39
so basically there by including those
components I don't know same thing else
that oh yes compared with other systems
and you might say well you know it's Y
event extraction you will not have the
performances you have any entity
recognition it will still be in the
quite I think top could close to sixty
current
very it's a very good actually result
but it is important in comparison to
other systems to be able to deal well
well with full papers and abstracts to
be able to deal well across various
different types of corpora which deal
with different types of events and
basically this is and in a sense for
food papers you do quite a bit better
much better if you incorporate
Corrections so this is basically some of
the enhancements of for the event mine
which actually boosted a lot the
performance and about performs or the
systems if you want more about all the
details it's in the paper so they're
fairly safe from masses readers riddle
riddle is the payer the name and to coos
the kissing in in Finland so those are
the top episode this is how it compared
with the top system it's a system
compared with the top system so I'll
risk is all that all the details and the
less that led us by informatics paper so
how we use that now so what I find it we
have fun improving performances in my
new details so first of all biologists
want to set want to this type of says to
be as much as as accurate as possible as
possible to do search so we used media
which has been built by Junichi when he
was in Tokyo before he joined Microsoft
and we enhanced it we maybe already was
doing semantic search based on Fox there
was a system which was actually in 2006
quite very novel was actually extracting
facts from the whole of midline based on
only only pausing and so for instance
you can extract what is activated by
circadian clock what cycles are
regulated so you are basically
neutralizing all these
syntactic variability that you have a
text and when you making this query you
really extract proper subjects and
objects which at the time it was not
possible for the systems this is the
system you can still well this Andrew
I'm gonna talk about Andrew with the
Junichi been here and but if you won't
find about information is basically on
its ps3 so this how it looks like before
we added the events so if you put for
something is not on the website of
noctem so you can its open people can
use the web services so can hook into
this if we want to it's based on the
whole of midline and if you ask any kind
or I currently we use a template type of
subject-verb-object
so you can ask questions like which then
translate it into a quest in the query
p53 153 activates what you have here are
basically the sentences which as you see
they're basically you have may amplify
you have it's a kind of an expansion
with oncologists and extract sentences
which are pertinent to this query mmm
so so basically and as you can see here
it deals very well with passive voice
and all that which is very important and
also you can change the the the for the
format you could look at in a more
tabular you know form so you can see
here you have verbs like amplify
mediated activate which are senior names
and they're very relevant to your query
and immediately the user can see from
what we 50 activates from those
sentences extracted sentences if they're
of interest and if you're if they're of
interest then they can click to the
title of the paper and also they're all
linked to all the various databases so
you can just click into a gene or to a
decision and I have access to all the
various databases so take him going back
to events wall obviously is kind of
multi-argument how
connection now changed my idea and add
events how we can search with events so
we used now this type of events based
again on the share toss that's why shut
offs are important because it's quite a
lot of work you have to in in a sense
the in molecular biology these are the
types of events of upper level that
people are looking for so if you ask
them what else do you need the world
come back to quite high level
phosphorylations binding positive
regulation and so on this is what they
want to search so if I if I just put my
query as localization so you will have
people interface localization off you
don't have to split you can specify the
type of thing the object or not if you
don't specify what you will have now our
sentences which basically are retrieved
within a specified location and theme
okay so there are still sentences
retrieved with a localization event as
acquiring you can then just to give you
an example
you put localization of tnf-alpha you
specify so this is these are the
sentences extracted with a specific type
of argument and you can have this is
actually in a different a tabular form
so you can see immediately oops
go back did he say it again and this is
a much more complex where you have a
positive regulation and another event as
well phosphorylation of and various
arguments so although this sounds quite
complex in the sense this is exactly the
type of type of information that if you
want to for instance reconstruct
pathways or if you want to ask questions
of biological relevance this is the type
of upper level information that people
want to know so what you have in text
are just various instances various
realizations of this upper level
biological events and you can specify of
course the site or the cause if you want
to but currently gives you the sentences
automatically from the whole of my
line that respond to this kind of query
so and that's a different way for the
present so you see here you have it's a
kind of fact and not a frame and
knowledge frame really which is
extracted from from text right now so
you have various types of responses to
this slot so this is actually one type
of event M how complex events or if I go
back to this can be integrated into a
search system like median so you can
update it to just do that but also they
can upgrade it to a search vents of
different types of biological pertinence
so if in this case we have molecular
biology but you can work or you can just
absolutely train event minor event mine
to be able to extract different types of
events as long as you have the
annotations that biological relevance so
going back to that another follow-up
actually work on events was at the
realization that most of our focus for
the past ten years was on molecular type
of entities so we were extracting genes
proteins chemicals and drugs and very
often we really focused on as I said on
them simple of binary types of
associations like protein protein drug
and drug so and very again for whatever
biologists are telling us is you need to
actually expand to go from from the
molecule level to organism so this is a
very recent work we we just stopped it's
just going to be published in the next
month but for Mattox is actually event
extraction which goes from across levels
so from the molecular to the anatomical
cellular component cells tissues and
organs to organisms and in the end if
you have from this one basically
have that you want to be able to extract
this type of information in the end as
well so right now we're going somewhere
here but we want to be able to extract
about growth about an organs about
anatomical information and so on so this
is where we have really worked most of
the community for protein post
translational epigenetic regulations
molecular mechanisms but what this is a
kind of limitation of going forward
especially for health this is extremely
important to go across levels so I the
approach that we we did we have done
some work on extracting complex bio
processes based on angiogenesis this was
in collaboration with AstraZeneca
actually last month is project famous
but we created a very nice corpus which
had the kind of this type of very
detailed information which is actually
publicly available all this is a small
corpus but it took a lot of time to
prepare but initially this one used to
the type span representation so they the
new work we're doing across level we
basically added event representations we
extended the types to have more
anatomical entities and other which you
will see later immediately now and based
on OBO go and cairo which are anatomical
entities so here is actually the types
of entities we used examples organisms
anatomical system organ multi tissue
structure developing structured tissues
and so on organism substance
pathological formation this is mostly
following Carol and for entity Anatomy
level events those types are like skin
development of fiber formation growth of
factors tumor remodeling breakdown death
cell proliferation and plan this is
mostly from uh not only a level
processes from go so what is actually we
have used actually this mostly samples
work
and me was we used tools we use the vent
mine and we stand you we used first of
all secure Sandra then you apply vent
mine to adapt to the various types of
events and then you you need for this
specific domain but what you recognizing
now here as you see is organ multi
tissue structure pathological formation
organism substance and so on so this is
actually extending the problem to go to
a much more to do it more multi-level
the some of the results here for by
categories actually a combined of the
baselines fifty-seventh of F 52 and
using various other believers a
notational resources and anatomical for
entities 81 76 and molecular 72 so it's
okay the resource all the resources are
on the our website the corpus it's
called Emily and it's actually an
extension of event extraction to various
at different levels of biological
organization
it's very richly annotated with about
8,000 entity and 6,000 event annotations
and also in a sense ostrich so how I
went mine could be also be used in this
type of domains and you know we used
various resources like oncologists and
so on so some of the references are here
the initial corpus was that and by
processes we did for angiogenesis and
this is the one which is published well
very soon about few two weeks time so
now now I'm going to I changed again it
can events is the theme but it's like a
different system so again an application
we have used and this is actually I
think closer to medical because it in
the factor system which have developed
we have changed a lot since 2008 we have
we remind direct and indirect
associations it's very much the chanson
type of hypothesis of you know if a
related to B and B to C A to C as well
so this is a kind of straight quite
well-known approach to for knowledge
discovering hypothesis generation in
biomedicine the system currently has
been initially - as I said operation the
whole of midline and how it works if you
go on our website if you put a query
like caffeine it gives you a priori we
have identify some concepts which we
were thought were important when you're
searching genes diseases symptoms drugs
and compounds which are ranked different
types of measures I'm not going to talk
about the whole factor right now but
there's obviously point one mutual
information and frequency and so on so
what it does basically if you're
clicking into a cafe in the
interrelations direct relations between
caffeine and fatigue you will have these
types of snippets of text extracted from
MEDLINE abstracts so this is the types
of the actually most of the medics quite
like factor and the like very much they
direct but also the indirect
associations but this time fact operates
on queries and requires could be complex
but basically noms
you know concepts its concept
associations so I'll tell yours a bit
slightly one slide about the indirect
then direct is the two-step the Swanson
type of hypothesis you're doing a query
from through a pivot concept so you want
to say for instance how the diabetes
affects where it's over diseases by of
which genes for instance and normally
additionally factor with a coder in
here's another example he will tell you
if your query is a khadeem you got in
this case our target is diseases related
with the cadine
via proteins so this type of indirect
associations tell you this is really the
most interesting part for most medics is
that if Katherine is associated with
Parkinson's disease via a cast for and
description factory being so on now
events again who code so we thought well
we can enhance factor to do this type of
search but we can add events so so not
only cut therein but in this case we use
the genie ontology you know for the
molecular again it's on the molecular
level so this can be of course enhanced
with different types of events so if
you're searching for positive
regulations but the fact that now we
will do would extract not only the
associations between tumor in e-cadherin
but related with positive regulation so
it does concept based direct and
indirect associations with events and
this is another example actually which
is a positive regulation so I have sort
of given you an example which escaped
now this is actually a level two walls
you can enhance factor with different
concepts and with different event types
and we thought also it's very nice to
visualize it because people fed up
looking at the long list of names so
this is how it looks if you find direct
associations with liquid air in so you
see here how important is not to various
other entities concepts and you can see
the indirect associations and you can
see here how the indirect associations
are linked paint with melanoma with
various other concepts which have to do
with that we have chosen disease and
gene and this is actually a more various
ordering diagnosis from different other
ways and that one here is with events so
basically you see indirect
or direct associations with an event
query and you can visualize it so you
can see immediately that well I'm not
automatic so how Iike Doreen is
indirectly associated with the nervous
system disorders basically like
Alzheimer's Parkinson's disease and
epilepsy and we can just go and drill
down to the documents but in this case
we thought it was very interesting to
show you an application how event
extraction can be embedded into existing
search systems that they do either more
complex like media who have more they
used on parsing or factor which is more
on concept associations so now somehow
changing the sift and I'll tell you
another application why how again how
event extraction has been used his East
currently has been used for pathways
just slightly different topic but the
same thing so I don't know how many of
you know about pathways construction or
I don't know the way your background at
all but pathways are again very like the
core of systems biology systems medicine
and increasingly people want to see how
we can link evidence from text to
pathways so and that's a very
challenging problem very automatically
post acting pathways it's really like
the Holy Grail but we think we can do a
lot towards providing lots of lots of
evidence to allow people to make
decisions and construct models and very
actually I'm just to give you an example
for the mTOR pathway
people to construct this pathway hard to
read 519 papers so this is a manual
process till now they denta fied for 960
for entities and about 800 reactions so
because this is manual clearly there are
lots of things are made
the discontent the literature is how you
first you search to find the documents
and how you identify which components
are important to basically create the
tool to say this is a reaction which
interacts with another reactant and so
on so this is where we started actually
this is work we started with the genichi
a few years ago and we wrote the grant
in 2006 I think and the system I will
talk about this path text which is still
ongoing we keep on upgrading and
updating it and it's actually using
linking with all sorts of different of
pathways so the architecture of path
text is basically if you have various
models or you know it's a kind of
various parameters here so you have
interactions or reactions between
where's modify modifiers or we could use
in this case a thing is cell designer
but you can use any kind of editor 2sp
ml models to represent this kind of
knowledge you need to bridge that gap
that between models with text so in our
case our path text links to two of the
systems that's why I explained to you to
understand a bit about pathways I'm
going to talk about this so it's
basically named entity search but fact
then may they are providing especially
enhanced with events are providing the
type of information that is needed to
link pathways to text how so well this
is exactly a one kind of snippet to see
how this various result so here is the
pathway in this case pathways are
independent in this case would aspire by
how is a kind of interface between cell
designer which is a very common way of
annotating a pathways that the different
editors of pathways but what is
important for
to see how basically we can use the
various from publications from PubMed or
full papers use our systems to integrate
it with this type of model and give the
evidence so what perfect does is
actually giving you the evidence to
update your model and for this you also
need a workbench platform to allow
people to make decisions about their
ranking of reactions in the ranking of
documents I'm sorry if it sounds and how
I'll just try to make it as simple as
possible because it's a bit sometimes
too much illogical knowledge here anyway
this is how it looks we can forget it
now remember the exactly the heat is
actually bridging the gap the reason I
put that is it's again it's based on
events so what are you looking at
reactions the reactions are events so if
you see here this information like this
which is a protein just with that one
here you have this little square here
it's a reaction and that reaction is an
event and this event goes to this
catabolism basically event so this
protein beef is linked here this
actually degrades a 3G but also has
another one here this kind of Diamont
which actually induces this activity as
well so this is how in order to link
this type of representation in this case
with cell design that you have a square
or a diamond in other editors you might
have all the types of semantics notation
and notations this is relevant in the
end what you're doing we're trying to
find out is linking events finding
events in text with various entities and
this is how basically paths text is
doing that is very much based on
extracting events and linking them with
pathways and so an example is if you're
clicking for reasons right now to a this
specific part this one you'll have about
8
144 text mining it you see here you have
automatic text money and you can do a
manual so you can do annotations as well
and give them back to the system so the
thematic goes to a factor or to make
them mostly and would extract this type
of information and rich with events and
the the curators that the biologists
will see which one is of relevance so
what is basically your you can do is now
you start querying reactions by events
so in order to link text with pathways
you need to have a kind of interface so
you're doing for like for instance at
the Diamond Association from these two
complex it's basically the query is a
protein reaction and event and your
result is basically from media a binding
event so this is exactly the type of
information the biologists get
automatically from from text to be able
to update and unreached and find the
evidence in new pathways so to do that
if you just want to put a whole
architecture of the whole image of what
we are doing right now is here your
pathways your users or biologists what
do you use here is that it could be
anything we're using cell designer
because our systems biologist your cell
designer gitanos team so this is kind of
a interface but what we what we are
doing is basically we're working on
building the queries using events we are
very much working on using gathering the
relevant feedback from the biologist
curating basically the results and to do
that we have our toolkit the well-known
end to event mind but their systems but
to at least part of component I will
talk briefly now it's a platform that
allows creation so what you need to do
is when people are giving you this type
of information when you are extracting
automatically the information are the
biologists interested in that do the
thing it's relevant so you need to be
able to get the feedback to improve the
ranking
so that was actually you have and the
query then because it's based on machine
learning with taking all this
information and every time we improving
the system for the specific type of
pathways so I in a sense this kind of
sort of closes the loop of why you need
events why you need to extract deeper
information why you need multi arguments
if you wanted to link the information
from pathways which is at the core of
systems medicine with text um so I don't
know how much time do I have because I
have quite
so a very small deviation but this is
important because we suggest to use it
for us our shared task as well so
Photoshop actually talked about it
so um one of the way of using that is
very often now people use components for
processing for text mining system
processing components and annotation
component somehow separately so we have
lots of annotation tools and left of
different sophisticated sophistication
but we also have text processing
components very much based on a you in
market actor and philosophy so it's
important to actually integrate the
processing with the tools with the
annotation tools but also to allow users
to create text mining workflows which
actually they can store they can use
they can share the can reuse and so on
so what two systems that we have done
one was the you compare which started to
meet the team and we expanded it by
using multilingual wiki which I'm not
talking right now at all another I'm
talking about our hope with a Greek ship
yeah it's very briefly I'll say what it
does so what it does is basically a
links with your compare as well takes a
lot of processing components it's a
web-based application it doesn't have an
installation you can access through a
web browser and it's very interactive so
this is actually what curators can use
to accede annotations and to decide from
the text mining results if the notations
are okay it's ooz and then basically you
know fit it back to the system so very
briefly this is basically the whole
thing this is for for both developers
for workflow designers and for
annotators so for developers you this is
links with you you compare you can
actually have all sorts of search
engines name and recognizers targets
editors example factors and so on so the
workflows there people were actually
allows you to
design if you want to do for instance
extract name entities
it will include tigers species
disambiguate errs and end up with a name
and recognizer and actually compare as
well various types of workflows the plot
you can actually process all the
workflows remotely without people
looking at this and then the annotation
editor is actually allows you to look at
the results and make changes if you
don't like so this is very important for
curation basically and the is using
various web page services it's on our
website you can have a better look I'll
just tell you later so here is the
workflow and you can have various
components you can add your own
documents you can actually allow
basically link to other people's
documents and you have a kind of you can
also store workflows so a list of
current and past workflows and here is
actually the panel where you designed
you just do drag and click the work of
the components if you pick up various
components and you just select the
workflow of clio is a subsystem a
species Tiger itself has another
workflow annotations and various cars
writers and this is how they look like
basically which is manually explained so
um what basically does here is it's an
example of a workflow is to you can
actually store these various cars
writers by basically you can actually
even allow to have different form as
plain text XML and so on so you can
actually create and store the simple
workflow with an annotation editor and
in this case we have used this is a
robot for events we have also used
another armed system which actually
started mostly stock use bone to send
sample have worked it's black this is
for events so we're using those two
annotation environments for our NGO
mostly for entities and creating
workflows and bread for events and this
is how it looks like for you can
actually remove change Adam put various
properties and this is where you find
the system is they were still developing
it but it's already made sort of decent
stage to have a look at and of course
we're very interested in actually having
all the people contributing and sharing
workflows and processing components
another just very very briefly it also
allows you to evaluate so if you have
different components you can just do the
comparison towards in the base of a
reference evaluator right so now and
some people are tired so me too and I'll
finish my talk very briefly about the
last one which is the most the very
recent work is the last enhancement of
event mind which allows you to do extra
modification of events so as you realize
them now we are all event based I'd like
them or not on but so what it does
matter knowledge annotation is nothing
new people have work talked about this
for many many years and there are
differences we are all based this kind
of we can talk pragmatic and disk or
information on events so this is the
main difference so then it gives you
different dimensions different types of
information different based on an event
and the important thing is allows you
basically to detect what is new
knowledge from this kind of meta
knowledge and various types of
contradictions that you have in text
it's extremely important forces of
applications for search of course but
also for scholarly communications
because you can use citation counts and
all sorts of things you can integrate
it's quite interesting area of research
thing so this is actually an annotation
example to show you that the same type
of event about X activates expression of
Y could be presented in text in
completely different ways meaningfully
different things so even if you have an
event which says about activation of an
hypothetical protein with a vertical
gene what what the author wants to say
about that
so the first thing you can say is about
we found that Y activates the expression
so it's a no you know you have a kind of
knowledge type examined you can have
this result suggest so it's a bit of a
speculative and not certain or there has
no effect the polarity or slightly
increased the manner or might affect
certainty so it there are various cues
in around an event that tell you that
this thing is perhaps not so certain it
has a different would be negated could
be some speculative and so on so just
don't have to look at so much basically
this is the whole the whole schema but
we've different manners certainty source
if it's in this specific paper all the
people are citing that if it's negative
positive if it's an investigation and
observation and Method effect and order
so what all those things are telling you
basically combined new knowledge or
hypotheses to do that we took the genie
event corpus which Tunisia has done in
2008 I think or nine and we annotate it
was quite a lot of work actually with
meta knowledge so we took all the
inventor types and we created about 56
well the existing one and we had we used
to annotators a biology expert and and
in whist exhale annotated the whole
corpus would by or meta knowledge not
actually very good Internet inter
annotate or agreement
so let's order of the course statistics
as you can see actually the certainty
level tells you what about how people
write in text so you can have different
types of knowledge types or
investigation and methods on observer
very certainty l-3 but also lower
certainty the six percent and the 2.1
percent we think is very interesting so
you have facts which are deported with
not so much certainty so that might be
quite interesting if you want to
construct pathways on the basis of lot
not so certain facts so you know you can
put weights for distance polarities and
manors and so on
so rather than Soho now we integrated
all that is this is a well-known event
mind we added meta knowledge to a bat
event mind so we have the pipeline in
the end you have methanol is a notation
when part event mind does it tells you
it extracts events and also tag them if
they're negative if they have its
analysis if it's high and so on so
basically you have this type of extra
information here so as I said the
difference so you have a knowledge
analysis a certain l2 not so negative
amount high and source current from this
paper so basically what you do you are
actually going a step further to provide
more and our analytics to events and
which can be used again for search and
for pathways that I as I said before and
for up with other other versus for
scholarly communications so just go very
quickly on that so some results on the
event mind I am which we are used
actually on the annotated corpus and
also we added on the ser tasks that we
had it's about you have different types
of performances on them and knowledge
type certainty polarity here and for the
negation of speculation as you realize
this is a lot of work to be done yet so
we're really struggling around the 35%
and so on it's actually with using
various it's actually doing quite well
mind with all the various clues and
based on different trade this was done
on the on the genie and applied on the
shared task but basically we are all
about you know some people it it
performs actually quite well across
where is negation speculation the total
is overall better and it's more what I
said the performance is more stable
around various types of hedging and I
think this is very as you can see some
you know in some case other people you
have a lot of negation but much better
speculation so thing is quite important
to have more stable perhaps results
across documents and also across various
types of information like of aging and
this is actually a and abstracts and
full papers it was also trained on
abstract so did okay with full papers
then you see again we are reaching about
the 37 percent which is the top
basically performance this is I wanted
to stop basically with that another note
with this is that we I think this is a
very important area of research is
hugely important if you want to take
types of information what are the really
certain are them in litigated are the
contradictory so and how we can
integrate so we need to improve that we
need much more work on that the
community needs much more work on that
to embed into their existing systems
I'll finish because I'm really tired now
to tell you the future again which is a
very important project funded by the UK
government and we work on full papers
and not only abstracts with all this
event of the open access out of the two
million papers twelve percent are open
access what we have produced now is what
we call the evidence finder which you'll
find here and what it does we're going
to
in bad events now and meta knowledge and
that's why I'm finish with this what it
does you have a query like EGFR and
breast cancer because our users are
medics and they don't want to even think
about on plates and subjects so if you
say subject and object they will never
use the system what do we do with
generating the questions for them so
based on it's all we used and you its
parsing and so extracting fax but once
the system oops
you put the query the system extracts
creates a number of questions which we
know of course they will be answered
because they exist in our store pass
results and then they look at the
extracts and if they like the answers
they click on that so this type of
system now they want to add they're very
interested in the meta knowledge which
is a challenge for us because we are in
the for things so they're really which
is actually kind of the future people
are very interested in the kind of
hedging medications in that it's a
speculative isn't contradictory
who said okay of course there are the
components will you pay UK PMC so this
is the text mining part and so just very
quickly I learn if you go there you just
go through various entities as well
which are highlighted but this type of
system will now finish my talk now is
going to be for the next couple of years
and reached with events of different
types or not be more likely but more
even with event mind and also meta
knowledge so but because we have two
thousand million full papers this is
going to be a kind of full scale
analysis or full papers the search
system based on full papers and
abstracts on events and on actually a
meta knowledge thank you for your
patience hope I didn't tire you too much
and all the things I said today
all the services are on our website on
services I all the tools event mind
everything's on our website and all the
publications so any misrepresentation is
utterly mine are there the people who
are actually have been extremely
important I don't messenger needs
because he's been well he's still our
scientific brains but the people who
have been involved the current / are
currently well in the center these and
of course extremely undated to all the
hard work and now I finished with what
we're going to talk after so I want to
introduce you now the cons well our
suggestion for a cancer genomics by an
LPC task in 2015 which we will talk
later
during the break and we want to work on
abstracts and full papers and you can
select basically this is a follow up of
them multisearch events of course it's a
follower apples of the angular Genesis
corpus and also the corpus Emily corpus
which we made available to the community
and we like to extend it to new areas
work with people oncologists in the area
of cancer and add more types of
processes which would be of interest to
have a surtax on on cancer genomics now
we would very much like to make
available for the community and user are
going broad platforms for people to use
and prepare also the share tasks and we
are calling them for people to work with
us and this is where I stop thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
