you
thanks very much and the last words were
really important maybe I left a lot out
we also left a lot out as you will
notice in this what I'm going to present
here it's some after thoughts on work
that I did with Luka and Andrew really
started ten years ago so it's another
anniversary that we have here that was
the period which actually connects to
the description that huge Shapiro gave
on his work with his PhD student he play
gift because her work also stimulated
our interests we got in touch with her
found her thesis she sent it to us at
the time when things were not yet all
published and this stirred our interest
in this and then we got into contact
with Luke how Andrew was also just
arriving still he still hadn't finished
at beach diseases and we were starting
to play around with approaches that were
of interest to us namely to understand
the dynamics of gene regulatory networks
so that's the work that we then
published in 2006 which gives an
introduction to how to use the
stochastic pi calculus for the
description of these networks in part
the works of course motivated by at that
time really novel work by Stanley blur
and Michael elevates who had this famous
paper on the repressor later which is a
synthetic gene circuit in which three
genes are made to interact through a
combinatorial swap of the promoters such
that as in the terminology that otter
they used today a ring oscillator is
generated in which each of the genes is
suppressing as repressing one of the of
the other genes so that this kind of
circular thing arises and then of course
there is some reporter gene so the
question is how would you describe such
a simple network which is she can
realize the bacteria in the plasma and
so being a physicist so this is a
collaboration out of the biologists and
the computer scientists with but a
physicist at the computer scientists so
it's like people who are both not
perfectly having don't have the perfect
biological visual at least not at the
time we were really trying to make sense
by way of abstractions and one way of
abstracting is of course the programming
language
we use my calculus but the other
abstraction is of course how do you
model this gene because of course you
can say the gene dynamics I can take
account lots of molecules that may
intervene but being a physicist who of
course motivated by say Occam's razor or
einsteins version of its saying you
should simplify but not too much so the
question is how far can we simplify and
the model that we made essentially oops
is based on this short small number of
reactions the first is a basal
transcription so we take a gene as the
prime actor which is producing an output
B which you can interpret as an mRNA or
as we did directly as the protein itself
so we ignore the whole level of mrna it
sort of shifted in the transcription
rate then there is a transcription
factor binding reaction that is a
protein a can interact with the gene
with a specific rate and put the gene
into an active state or an inactive
state and it's immediately releasing the
protein again this is a controversial
reaction I will come to that and then we
have two possibilities this sort of
activated or say enhanced gene and has
two possibilities that either relaxes
back to its original state by producing
new protein that's would be degraded the
activating process or it's a repressing
process in which this gene is just doing
nothing in stage ii prime and then
returning at a rate ETA back to state g
and then of course the proteins a and b
can be degraded so i already mentioned
here two notions pause an egg that will
come up in the next slide because that's
the way how the upcoming slide because
that's the way that these genes have
been represented then in stochastic
calculus in fact what we do is we write
down processes that here this is
directly copied from our paper at the
time where in fact all interpretations
already written so I mean you don't have
to read them essentially the gene is
represented by its product which is the
transcript
factor that is produced there is a
stochastic delay which simply means the
simulation is being done with the
underlying kill SB algorithm and so this
rate is essentially reflects just the
waiting time until this particular
reaction occurs and then there is the
parallel process again of this
transcription factor that explained
later and the gene the origin the
initial state the transcription factor
indeed corresponds to an output so on a
channel B goes back to the original
state and then there is a choice between
either this production or a degradation
with a corresponding the relation rate
or waiting time in this case and then
based on these two underlying processes
you can build two essential elements for
our G networks this is the negative gate
which so is negatively regulated it's
repressed or it's the post gate which is
positively regulated so they actually
the output is activated and this is
again than just a composition of these
processes before so this is an input on
a is the inhibition delay then the
process goes back to itself and then
there is the combination of the
constitutive transcription and going
back to the initial stage the same here
but here of course a little bit
complicated because then of course you
need you have the two possibilities of
output so I notice actually yesterday
morning that the notion of Paz neg has a
long history because when Gordon Plotkin
showed your PhD work these specific
terms were already mentioned in the
stick and stones where they certainly
had a different meeting but it was just
a parent for me so once we have this we
can then start building small gene
circuits just by sort of compositionally
composing these genes and here I only
drew those that are sort of repressing
but of course you can do the same family
with the or the activating genes so it's
like a self regulating gene something
which will actually turn out to be a
bistable system so two mutually
same genes then the famous repressor
later with the three genes that repress
each other in in a circle of fashion or
of course the second class would be sort
of linear chains genes that are
repressing each other downstream or
activating so the repressor later is
this with a marked error that I detected
because this is not very procedure here
should be an a because indeed now the
nomenclature the definition of the gates
and such that you can immediately see
what's happening here a is the input B
is output output B is input here then c
is output is input here and then in
order to close this properly this should
be an a so the way it's written here
it's more like a modified by stable
system so this is the output it produces
a beautiful oscillations the protein
number as a function of time of this
circuit and this is no surprise because
that's what the repressor later really
does so qualitatively that's okay but it
nevertheless posed a problem because why
did this thing oscillate in the first
place what actually makes it oscillate
the version of the repressor later that
was published by our state library they
also did simulations or computations
beforehand but they only worked in a
deterministic setting so they wrote down
differential equations for the protein
concentrations and in these equations
one typically puts for good reason
what's called a cooperativity hill
coefficient into these equations so
there is a non-linearity and in fact
that's non-linearity is needed it
corresponds essentially not to just
having monomers proteins that act as
transcription factors but rather dimers
or higher order structures because only
in a deterministic setting only if I
have this non-linearity then the system
actually too has states of each gene has
a state of low and high protein
concentration between it which between
which it can switch so it needs some
sort of by stable at least the
possibility of having a bistable
it and the non-linearity guarantees this
but in our stochastic simulation we were
only considering monomers proteins we
neglected the dimerization step of
course we can put it in it's just one
more reaction no problem with that but
the thing oscillate already without any
cooperativity so the question is why
does that happen and then this was the
thing that at the time we sort of had
some ideas about because indeed in the
stochastic system there is always a
possibility that the system can go to a
state of no proteins and then it can
sort of revive again the state of no
proteins is not accessible in the
deterministic system so that's indeed it
turns out to be the also the
quantitative correct interpretation but
we can now make me more precise about it
and then after the work that we did Luca
and Andrew we published two papers that
Andrew showed on this in two thousand
six and two thousand eight and I had
some two postdocs that continued all
work a little bit and I just indicate
briefly what are the main outcomes of
this because in one of the papers what
we did we did some more really detailed
comparisons between a stochastic system
so we see here now not the protein
concentrations as a function of time but
the phase diagram so to say which we
have only the concentration against each
other and so you see the sort of fuzzy
limit cycle that this produces and in
the deterministic setting you see indeed
beautiful limit cycle oscillator but how
do we get to a deterministic system from
our stochastic reactions to begin with
well I'm hiding this because this is of
course a technical step there is no one
unique way of right deriving
deterministic equations but one way
would be to say we look at at an average
over a cell population that is
synchronized then we can write down
equations both for the gene and for the
protein concentrations and indeed the
outcome the stability and the degree of
non-linearity that's needed in order to
have a limit cycle very much depends on
the details of the dynamics that means
if I take only the protein
concentrations as dynamical variables
that ignore the gene
then I need a higher cooperativity then
if i take the genes as proper variables
themselves as well so they indeed indeed
increase the phase space available for
the limit cycle behavior yeah this juice
gene circuit that I showed before is
indeed already a properly by stable
system that was noticed at the time also
when we worked on the repressor later
and with different methods so this is
the calculation again with the PI
calculus but other people have noticed
that as well so indeed on this is a
fundamental feature without
cooperativity you can have a bistable
system again you would not have that
over the deterministic system this
really feature of the stochastic system
and then what's the solution well with
another post doc we finally did
something very detailed because we just
looked at the self regulating gene in
both its repressed and its activating
version I'm skipping over all the
technical details because we could solve
actually the master equations for the
system exactly and that means you have
access to the full probability
distributions in the whole parameter
spaces and that really pinpoints then
what happens here for a particular set
of parameters you can see that the
probability distribution as a function
of protein number indeed is bimodal that
has a minimum it has excuse me has a
maximum at specific concentration of
proteins or number of proteins and it
always has a maximum for particular can
have let's say at zero protein number
and that why is that always it's zero
protein number it's never at a finite
protein number so it's never something
which has two Maxima at finite protein
numbers that's indeed a consequence of
the peculiar choice that we made of our
reaction namely this one which has
always created a fight with referees
because it's clearly an abstraction in
the sense that there is no transcription
factor complex that exists for it exists
only 40 time because it's like a
reflection you
say this is like the protein interacts
with the gene and it's immediately
reflected off the drain its transformed
into an activated state so we have no
complex between the transcription factor
and the DNA which of course is there in
reality and the consequence of this is
indeed that in our model there is no
maximum at finite protein number at low
concentrations but there is always the
possibility of having this bimodal
structure and that means that the
feature of by stability is always there
and this guarantees that in these
stochastic simulations already the
oscillations can appear so that is the
short story this is an afterthought to
this model we now have not understand
much about biology but we have
understood something about the model
that we put in and I think that's the
main message here is to try them if you
want makes abstractions of course i can
say i represent biological reality in
all detail but then i make a model
that's as complex as biology itself so i
have to cut down in terms of the actors
of this system that i represent and this
is a way to say really quantitatively
within this abstraction what are the
properties that i can build in in order
to get the behavior of the system
qualitatively correct for this i like to
thank luca and refer very nice
collaboration that we had for a couple
of years before we sort of part it in
different directions I would then also
went into much more complicated
biological situations namely i worked in
recent years on a regulation gene
regulation in eukaryotes particular
level of chromatin and it's also like to
thank my postdocs cloud you and Eve for
their work they put in to polish up the
final questions a little bit in this
model and of course I thank the
organizers and happy birthday look
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
