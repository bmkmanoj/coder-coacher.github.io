hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
thank you for coming my name is Deb
Crawford and I'm pleased to welcome a
carmine Gallo to the Microsoft Research
visiting speaker series carmine is here
to discuss his book talk like Ted the
nine public speaking secrets of the
world's top minds TED talks are the
golden standard for public speaking both
in tapping the most interesting people
and ideas and providing techniques that
will make any presentation more dynamic
carmine has broken down hundreds of TED
talks to reveal secrets that anyone can
use to create an engaging persuasive and
memorable talk he is a communications
coach for many brands including Intel
LinkedIn and others and an author of
seven books including the presentation
secrets of Steve Jobs he is the
president of the Gallo Communications
Group and has been featured in several
publications including the Wall Street
Journal New York Times and writes for
Forbes calm please join me in giving him
a very warm welcome thank you all right
thank you and good afternoon everybody I
am so excited to be around so many
people who have amazing ideas and that's
what I like to talk about today is ideas
because I think ideas are the currency
of the 21st century in the information
age the knowledge economy you are only
as successful as your ideas and yet
communicating your ideas is much more
challenging than ever
I believe the ability to communicate
your ideas persuasively is the single
greatest skill that will help you
accomplish your dreams advance your
careers and certainly move the brand
forward famed venture capitalist Ben
Horowitz who I interviewed for one of my
forms columns just a couple of weeks ago
said storytelling is the most underrated
skill especially for entrepreneurs and
management-level employees he said your
story is your strategy when I asked him
what he meant by that
he said if you cannot clearly tell a
story that you don't have a well thought
out strategy so today I want to talk to
you about communication skills and
storytelling and is it it's not just me
who believes this it's not just ben
horowitz billionaire Warren Buffett
believes in the power of communication
and public speaking listen to this video
clip when Warren Buffett was speaking to
a class of business students I believe
it was at Columbia University listen to
the value that he placed on
communication and public speaking in the
workplace right now I would pay $100,000
for 10% of the future earnings of any of
you so anybody wants to see me after
this is over
if that's true you're a million dollar
asset right now right if 10% of these
worth a hundred thousand you could
improve about most many of you and I
certainly could have what I got out if
just in terms of learning communication
skills you know it's not something that
start I actually went to a day on the
finding of course later on in terms of
public speaking but but if you improve
your value 50 percent by having better
communication skills that's you know
it's another five hundred thousand
dollars you know in terms of capital
value see me after the class and I'll
tell you so why does he say that why is
he willing to pay someone a premium to
be because they are a good communicator
because as Daniel pink who has also been
here for the speaker series said like it
or not we're all in sales now that means
we are constantly pitching ourselves and
our ideas and our products and services
both the internal and external audiences
so you have to look at yourself as a
brand and you have to think through how
am I telling the story behind my brand
my ideas yeah we have a challenge
because we live in a multimedia
generation so how can we sell our ideas
persuasively when we communicate in
photos videos in 140 character tweets
one organization that has done a really
good job of bringing together the
world's greatest presenters and and
business leaders in fact leaders in a
wide variety of areas is Ted of course
having recently celebrated its 30th
anniversary how many of you have seen
TED Talks most of you probably online
great this this is awesome because I
don't normally get that many hands going
up I do get a majority of hands but this
is pretty much everybody so this is
awesome because I think you'll be able
to tell some of the methods that I'm
extracting from these TED Talks and what
I want to do today is help you apply
what the world's greatest presenters do
to your everyday business presentations
and the way you communicate the vision
behind your own ideas how do we do that
ideas that spread have three components
this is based on a lot of research it's
based on watching 500 TED Talks and not
all of them are great it's about a
hundred and about 150 hours worth of TED
Talks
I've interviewed the world's leading
neuroscientist and researchers who study
the science and art of persuasion and
I've also interviewed personally many of
some of your favorite Ted speakers so I
got a little behind-the-scenes look at
what they do to make their TED talk so
inspiring I found that ideas that spread
have three components they all have to
be emotional you need to touch my heart
before you reach my head they need to be
novel ideas that spread teach me
something new and they're memorable
they present content in ways that I will
never forget so let's break down each
one emotional and again I'm going to tie
it into your business presentations
ideas that spread our emotional above
all you have to be passionate passion is
everything when it comes to persuasive
communications you cannot inspire unless
you are inspired yourself dr. Larry
Smith who many of you might recognize
because he gave a very famous TED talk
several years ago said passion is the
thing that will help you create the
highest expression of your talent well
when I interviewed dr. Smith about
passion he's been studying passion for
40 years as an instructor I asked him
how do you define passion what does it
mean to be passionate and he pointed me
to an excerpt from his now very famous
and viral TED talk here is dr. Smith's
definition of passion probably the best
one I've come across let's listen
passion is your greatest love passion is
the thing that will help you create some
very frustrated of your talent passion
interest it's not the same thing are you
really going to go to your sweetie
say marry me you are interesting hahaha
won't happen won't happen and you won't
die alone what you want what you want
what you want is passion
it is beyond interest you need twenty
interests and then one of them one of
them might be grab you one of them might
engage you more than anything else and
then you may have found your greatest
love in in comparison to all the other
things that interest you and that's what
passion is about so you can tell dr.
Smith is really frustrated he's agitated
and I asked him about that I said you
sure look frustrated and annoyed in this
video are you always that angry and he
said wasted talent is a talent I cannot
stand and that's what happens when
people don't tap into what their passion
is but I love that line passion is your
greatest love now how does that apply to
us as as entrepreneurs as business
leaders and as communicators let's think
about this carefully when I say you've
got to be passionate as a communicator
it doesn't mean that it's all raw raw
and hey I'm really excited and raise
your voice that's not what I mean by
being passionate I when I say passion I
mean tapping in to your greatest love
what is it about your product your
service your idea that you really love
and don't be afraid to share that so for
example when I interview entrepreneurs
for my Forbes columns for my books let's
say I interviewed Richard Branson which
who I did a few months ago and I asked
Richard Branson what is your greatest
love you will not hear that his greatest
love is getting people from point A to
point B on an airplane that's not his
greatest love his greatest love is
disrupting the status quo his greatest
love is elevating the customer
experience that's a much more
interesting and inspiring conversation
than I'm in a company that builds
airplanes when I interview Tony Hsieh
the founder and the CEO of Zappos calm
one of the great customer service
stories in e-commerce his greatest love
is not shoes
in fact he doesn't even like new shoes
he wears old shoes till they're pretty
much worn out it's not about the shoes
his greatest love is delivering
happiness how do I make my employees
happy how do I make my customers happy
when I interviewed Howard Schultz for
one of my books this was several years
ago this was a big revelation for me it
was this completely changed the way I
look at communication because I
interviewed Howard Schultz for almost
two hours he was not the first person to
bring up the word coffee I was and he
said yes
carmine coffee is what I make as a
product but that's not the business that
I'm in but that blew my mind when it
comes to communication because I
realized the world's most inspiring
leaders are not passionate about the
product they are passionate and excited
about how that product can change your
life so when you talk about when you
talk to Howard Schultz you realize it's
so much more than the coffee he doesn't
even talk about the coffee he talks
about creating a workplace that treats
people with dignity and respect
a workplace that elevates the engagement
that employees have with their
management he talks about the romance of
the coffee culture but it's not so much
about the coffee after I interviewed
Howard Schultz he appeared on CNBC I
want you to watch this short clip from
the interview that he gave the host on
CNBC the host had exactly the same
reaction that I did when I interviewed
Howard Schultz the host had to stop him
in mid-sentence and say wait a minute
are we talking about coffee or are we
talking about something else
watch Starbucks in a sense has become
the quintessential experience brand and
the experience comes to life by our
people we've been able to I think create
a system of attracting retaining great
people building a training system that
replicates what we do and I think the
only competitive advantage this is you
know
compared to a tech companies we have no
patent we have no secret sauce
whatsoever the only competitive
advantage we have is a relationship
we've built with our people and a
relationship they I've built with the
customer so when we go to you mention
competitive advantage you haven't
mentioned the word coffee not your
competitive advantage is not your cause
well I'll get to the quid you said you
can image I agree with you yes the
relationship yeah with your people and
the people with therapy with the guests
and in fact if you ask me what business
we're in we're in the people business
we're not in the coffee business
of course we are as a product but we're
in the people business 135,000 people
hiring three hundred people a day
serving forty million customers a week
it's all human connection it's a sense
of humanity in the sense of community
that we built in our stores so at the
end of the day what we've been able to
do is crack the code on being able to
create an environment where people are
treated well they're respected they're
valued customers come in and they
recognize this is a different kind of
environment almost an oasis almost an
oasis is he talking about coffee or is
he talking about something else so you
need to ask yourselves what business am
I really in what am I really trying to
pitch and ask yourself deep down what am
I truly inspired about and by the way
passion is contagious researchers at the
University of Minnesota are studying
passion they are finding that if you
meet someone who is genuinely and
authentically excited enthusiastic about
their idea it will change your
perception of that person and that
person's idea passion really does rub
off passion is contagious but I think
you really need to dig deep and identify
what is it though that I'm passionate
about and then how do I transmit my
passion to you how do I transfer that
passion the easiest most effective way
is through mastering the art of
storytelling we have to start telling
stories stories informs stories
illuminate stories inspire in business
very few people tell stories and I can
say that confidently because I work with
some of the the most well-known
executives and brands certainly in
America and a lot
global brands as well they rarely tell
stories and yet when you expose them to
this concept they get it they get it
immediately I just don't think they're
really been exposed to it remarkable
things happen to your brain on stories
research out of Princeton University is
finding that when I tell you a story the
same areas the same regions of our brain
light up we are literally in sync Sheryl
Sandberg the Facebook CEO recently
learned this how many of you are
familiar with this movement that she
started that encourages young women to
achieve their goals in in business hum
what is the name of that movement I
everyone knows the movement men okay
what's the name of it
lean in I argue and none of you would
have heard of lean in if it had been for
the power of story
in 2010 Sheryl Sandberg gave a TED talk
18-minute talk just a conversation about
why we have too few female leaders that
conversation went viral it led to a
best-selling book which led to the
movement however right before she gave
the TED talk true story
she she was ready to give a conversation
and a presentation in her words that
were chock-full of data and no personal
stories all data
she's a data person she was ready to
talk about all the data that shows how
women are being kept down in the
workplace a lot of data no stories right
before her TED talk and I would not
recommend this because I recommend
practicing for any mission-critical
presentation but right before a TED talk
a friend pulled her aside and said
Cheryl you seem a little out of sorts
what's going on and she said ah it's
just been a rough trip right before I
came out here my little daughter was
pulling at me and screaming saying mommy
mommy don't go and the friend said why
don't you tell that story to everybody
when you get out there and Cheryl said
you in front of people you actually want
me to tell that story in front of a nod
yes she was very skeptical about and
then she realized she had a brainstorm
and she realized ah wait a minute this
is how I how I can connect with my
audience because I'm going through some
of the same things that they are and I
can connect with them on an emotional
level so this is how she started her TED
talk in 2010 now at the outset I want to
be very clear that the speech comes with
no judgments I don't have the right
answer I don't even have it for myself I
left San Francisco where I live on
Monday and I was getting on the plane
for this conference and my daughter
who's 3 when I dropped her off at
preschool
did that whole hugging the leg crying
mom you don't get on the plane thing
this is hard I feel guilty sometimes I
know no women whether they're at home or
whether they're in the workforce that
don't feel that sometimes so I'm not
saying that staying in the workforce is
the right thing for everyone my talk
today is about what the messages are if
you do want to stay in the workforce and
I think there are three one sit at the
table to make your partner I let it run
long because I want to get back to this
rule of three that she used and by the
way she also reinforced each point with
a story so again it's the personal
stories that resonate with people they
don't always have to be personal stories
about your daughter or your child it can
be a case study it can be a story about
your experience with another brand those
are all stories I have found after
analyzing 500 TED talks that if we go
back to Aristotle the father of
persuasion I'm a real communication geek
so I really get into the research behind
it
65% of the content of the best TED Talks
fall under what Aristotle called pathos
emotion storytelling 25% data statistics
the data to back up and to reinforce
your argument and about 10% ethos or
establishing credibility meet Bryan
Stevenson Bryan Stevenson received the
longest standing over
in Ted's 30-year history he's an
attorney Brian Stevenson is a civil
rights attorney who successfully argues
cases before the US Supreme Court that
means he knows how to talk really really
well and he's very persuasive
he told three stories in his 18 minute
presentation when I asked him why did
you tell a story about your grandmother
he goes oh I always tell a story about
my grandmother carmine why because
everybody has a grandmother it gets
people to like me I connect with them
now the story did reinforce his theme of
course you can't just tell a story out
of the blue but the point is he is
always thinking how am I going to
connect with this particular group on an
emotional level how many of you like to
consume organic fruits and vegetables
organic okay so yeah many of you many of
you you're into organic that's good that
you have this woman to credit her name
is Myra Goodman Myra Goodman started
earthbound farm earthbound farm today is
the largest grower of organic fruits and
vegetables in the world
I've known Myra for several years I live
in California I do a lot of work with
technology companies and over the last
several years I've really been doing a
lot of work with agribusiness as well
who are really into technology so there
is there is a carryover Myra Goodman had
to give a very prestigious TEDx event
she had to give a TEDx talk in Manhattan
that is an annual event that's all
around food and agriculture it's a very
prestigious event in New York and they
wanted her to be one of the key speakers
so she knew that I had written this book
she contacted me in October so and I
suggested my reaiiy told her you've got
to tell stories I want you to tell the
story of when you started earthbound
farm with you know in a two acre
raspberry field in Carmel California
with your husband I love that story and
she said yeah I always tell that story
carmine I said yeah you tell it to
internal people but most people outside
of your world have
ever heard the story and that's how
you're going to connect with people and
when you tell the story Myra I don't
want to see any words on the screen I
don't want to see any text on your
PowerPoint I want to see pictures that
reflect and reinforce the story it's
like a movie think of it like a movie
telling the story showing the video or
the pictures behind you this is how she
started her TED talk which she just sent
me an email I think last week or two
weeks ago it was voted the number one
talk of this entire event here's the
here's the back story just between us
she doesn't really she's not very
comfortable with PowerPoint
she's a farmer she doesn't give
powerpoints and yet she knocked this one
out of the park here's how she started I
have been a passionate advocate of
organic farming for thirty years I can
still remember the exact moment when I
knew I didn't want to use chemicals to
grow our food it was just two days after
my husband Drew and I moved on to our
original two and a half acre raspberry
farm in Carmel Valley and I was standing
between two rows of raspberries near a
little orchard of fig trees surrounded
by the gorgeous Green Mountains and the
miracle of what was happening around me
was stunning I was 3,000 miles away from
my 11th floor apartment on East 86th
Street here in Manhattan but I felt like
I had finally come home I just knew in
my heart that we shouldn't try and
conquer this beautiful earth with
dangerous chemicals Dru felt the same
way so right from the beginning we made
the commitment to learn to farm
organically back when we started
earthbound farm Drew and I were two
faces of small organic so here what you
see is passion if actually you use that
word as soon as you walked out here's
what I'm passionate about and you saw
stories that's how you connect with
people emotionally emotion is number one
you have to touch people emotionally
before you reach their intellect ideas
that spread are also novel they teach me
something new
something entirely unexpected I love
this quote by a neuroscientist who I
know in Berkeley our brains are trained
to look for something brilliant and new
something that stands out something that
looks delicious
this is the way our brains have evolved
we are constantly looking for something
new fresh and exciting when the brain
detects something that is new or maybe
an unexpected twist on an old idea it
releases dopamine into the system which
acts as your brains natural save-button
for part of my research on Ted I
interviewed someone who gave an
astonishing TED talk this this gentleman
Robert Ballard gave a TED talk with
about 57 slides no text on the slides
we'll talk about visual representation
in a minute but he discovered he
discovered a little boat called Titanic
in 1985 two and a half miles beneath the
surface of the Atlantic and he said
carmine your mission in any presentation
is to inform educate and inspire but you
can only inspire when you give people a
new way of looking at the world in which
they live a new way of looking at the
world that's why people like Steve Jobs
for example could could introduce a new
phone and completely blow away your
expectations on what a phone should be
but when he delivered the presentation
on the iPhone for example it was new and
unexpected not just the product boat the
way he delivered the news does anybody
remember or have seen on video Steve
Jobs introducing the iPhone in 2007 a
few of you you what do you remember how
do you remember recall the one way that
he introduced the phone that just was
really memorable you introduced it is
something to get three very definite
things an internet communicator and iPod
they give sign no three words up forward
the phone fine
and he said do you get it good and put
it up so he walked out that nobody gets
this wrong nobody gets that question
wrong it they always go right to that
part he gave that was a 90 minute
presentation but you remember yeah and
you remember the one part where Steve
Jobs said I've got three products to
introduce to you a new iPod a phone and
an Internet communicator and then he
repeated it several times and pretty
soon he said aren't you getting it now
these are three products they're all in
one that was an emotionally charged
event which I'll talk about in just a
second it was a way of creating
something new unexpected fresh
surprising taking an old problem and
repackaging it into something completely
unexpected this is what neuroscientists
call a an emotionally charged event so
when you experience something that is so
fresh surprising and unexpected they say
it creates a heightened sense of emotion
which literally stamps the message on
your brain who has been doing this
somebody you all know really intimately
mr. Bill Gates has been doing this
really really well Bill Gates has
studied communication and knows
communication and has been radically
improving the way he tells complex
stories especially with the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation so when he gave
his TED talk is now very famous TED talk
and I think was 2009 on the causes of
malaria what does everybody remember the
release of the mosquitoes that's what
neuroscientists who have seen that said
carmine that's them that's the part that
connects with everybody because that is
what's called an emotionally charged
event you do not expect Bill Gates
delivering a PowerPoint on the causes of
malaria to open a jar mosquitos in the
middle of the presentation completely
jarring unexpected fresh
so here's how he here's how it went down
drugs then are put into malaria
now baldness is terrible things it was
also funny and rich man mistake are
afflicted and so that's why that
priority has been set but malaria they
even two million deaths a year caused by
malaria greatly understate its impact
over two hundred million people at any
one time are suffering from it means
that you can't get the economies in
these areas going because they're just
it holds things back so much now malaria
of course transmitted by mosquitoes I
brought some here so you could
experience this will let let those roam
around the auditorium a little bit there
there's no reason only poor people
should have have the experience
not those mosquitoes are not not
infected all right thank you bill thank
you uh that audience the reaction of the
audience was interesting first it was
shock what is he doing so it was quiet
and then some people kind of started to
laugh when he made the joke about not
only poor people should get the
experience and then they started
applauding and cheering and they
realized they had been had that they
realized wait a minute we are seeing
something that's extraordinary this is
so different so new so refreshing it's a
novel event and Bill Gates ever since
then has been improving his
presentations to where they are really
really powerful presentations are
they're fun to watch the even the
displays the presentations the the
design of the presentations are very
very compelling I'm going to show you
some examples later how many of you have
heard of this lady named a man the
Palmer maybe some of you have seen this
TED talk she is a performer and a
musician I actually don't know how to
label her work maybe some of you do I
don't know if she's an indie artist some
people call her cabaret rock or punk the
point is she brought down the house at
Ted 2013 her video has been seen more
than five million times she asked more
than 100 people for feedback on how best
to present her story and the story had
to do with the music industry and why
they should embrace alternative models
of distributing music she started with
something so startling so unexpected so
novel that it caught people's attention
and they couldn't stop talking about it
through the rest of the conference
here's how she started
so I didn't always make my living from
music for about the 5 years after
graduating from an upstanding liberal
arts university
this was my day job and here I paused it
here but her day job was one of those
living statues and now she's going to
tie in her day job with her experience
in the music industry and why they
should build a new model of music
completely unexpected
you need it now I'm showing you extremes
I do not expect you to get on a milk
crate I don't expect you to release
mosquitoes that would be a bad thing but
you do have to think about and it can be
simple as something as simple as what
Steve Jobs did in 2007 how do I take how
do i package content and messaging and
information in a way that shocks people
that jars them out of their preconceived
notion of what they expect me to deliver
novelty the brain cannot ignore
something that is delivered in a new
refreshing or unexpected way so novelty
is very important but none of this
matters if I don't remember anything you
told me so let me give you some very
specific techniques that work these are
proven they work really really well
techniques that you can use today for
your very next pitch or presentation
almost guaranteed almost guaranteed in
fact I will guarantee it your message
will be remembered if you use some of
these techniques now I can't guarantee
that they will always be acted upon in
the in the timeline that you wanted
those acted upon but if you structure
your message or idea like this guarantee
they'll be they'll be remembered because
these always work there's science behind
them they always work first we're going
to stick to the 18 minute rule every TED
talk and most of you know this is
limited to no more than what 18 minutes
so it doesn't matter whether you're Bono
or Bill Gates or Sheryl Sandberg
you only get 18 minutes there's science
behind this the Ted organizers have
found that 18 minutes is about the right
amount of time to have a serious
discussion on something and not put your
audience to sleep to keep them alert all
if you look at all the academic research
out there depending on what you read
there is a point at which people are
going to lose their attention and that's
typically between 10 minutes to again
depending on the research to 18 minutes
so I guarantee that many of you some of
you like this gentleman here who's taken
a lot of notes after he's obviously
engaged in fact he's so engaged he
doesn't know I'm talking to him right
now so you're taking a lot of notes but
I guaranteed after about the first 10
minutes of the conversation your brain
probably started to stray a little bit
you were thinking gee what am I having
for dinner tonight or you know I've got
a meeting after this and I'm not fully
prepared for it it's just a natural way
he's obviously engaged he's taking notes
but after about 10 to 18 minutes you
have to re-engage you have to bring
people back how do you do that I'm
trying to give you some videos so I'm
introducing another voice another
character that's one way of doing it
stories demos don't wait 30 minutes
before your demo introduce your ID and
then demo in the first 10 minutes 18
minutes it works really really well that
does not mean that your presentation is
only limited 18 minutes but try to
re-engage people within 10 to 18 minutes
by the way a lot of great things can
happen in under 18 minutes John Kennedy
inspired a nation in 15 minutes Steve
Jobs
gave what many consider the greatest
commencement speech of our time at
Stanford University in 15 minutes
and it took Martin Luther King a few
extra minutes up until 17 minutes to
outline his vision for racial equality
so if these folks and Sheryl Sandberg
launched a movement in 15 minutes if all
of these
folks can get their idea across in under
18 minutes that's probably plenty of
time for you to get your idea across so
think about that reengage in people
within 10 to 18 minutes also this is so
powerful in communication theory that I
want to spend a few minutes on it it's
called the rule of three
the rule of three simply means that in
short-term memory you are only going to
remember about three or four points of
information somebody sent me this
infographic which shows how the rule of
three pervades every aspect of our
society even slogans like just do it or
yes we can certainly in literature the
three musketeers the three little pigs
the three bears the rule of three great
writers know this directors know this
movies know this movie directors
understand this comedians often break up
their comedy sketches or their jokes
into three if great writers know this
why can't we incorporate them into our
presentations and our pitches remember
Brian Stevenson how many stories did he
tell in eighteen minutes three three and
he received the longest standing ovation
in Ted history and as I suggested
because he successfully wins Supreme
Court arguments he knows how to persuade
and he likes to break things into three
who else likes to break things up into
three huh the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation how many of you read the
annual newsletter for 2014 three myths
three myths that block progress for the
poor they were poor countries are doomed
to stay poor four and eight is a big
waste and saving lives leads to
overpopulation
those were the three myths that they
tackled in the newsletter
why not 19 why not 19 it's easier to
follow and it's easier for people to
pick up on that in conversations when
Bill was on Jimmy Fallon show Jimmy was
like hey tell me about these three myths
that people have about poor countries he
knew it it was easy I've got five
minutes tell and Bill
got three things he wants to tell me so
it leads the conversation all of the
headlines all the headlines on blogs
newspapers magazines that covered the
newsletter look like this these are real
headlines three myths of global aid Bill
Gates debunks three myths of global
poverty three big poverty myths
the rule of three I do a lot of what's
called media training so I actually
train executives before CNBC or other
high-profile shows we do this all the
time if you've only got about five or
ten minutes to pitch your idea your
product give me three reasons to back
your idea not 22
I'll forget them all three is really
really powerful and it works in most
situations if you have a presentation if
you've only got a 20 minute pitch or
presentation break it up into three and
finally think visually pictures are more
memorable than words
now this is very very well-known in the
academic literature how many of you give
powerpoints like quite a few you know
right I'm like daily powerpoints weekly
powerpoints it's very very important
whether you use PowerPoint or Prezi now
a lot of people use present your Apple
Keynote I don't think you know sometimes
the tool PowerPoint is demonized death
by PowerPoint it's not PowerPoint it's
not the tool I've seen stunning
PowerPoint displays beautifully produced
and design powerpoints I've seen
horrible powerpoints I've seen gorgeous
Apple keynote presentations and really
bad Apple keynote presentations it's all
about thinking visually how do we do
that everybody within academic circles
who study this they realize that if I
deliver information to you verbally
you'll remember about ten percent of the
information if I add a picture retention
goes up to sixty five percent so if
somebody asks you tomorrow
yeah you know you went to that Microsoft
speaker series and you
you saw that guy who wrote the book What
did he say about pictures how much of
how much content do you retain if
there's a picture associated with it
most of you will remember 65% because
you're hearing it from me and you're
seeing this on this beautifully designed
graph which I had a professional design
and that's okay too
that's certainly okay the average
PowerPoint has 40 words in the best TED
Talks and the best presentations I've
ever seen
whether it's Ted or whether it's in
business today it's hard to find 40
words in the first 10 slides so why are
we cluttering our powerpoints with too
many or excessive words Bill Gates is
doing a lot of this too when he wants to
focus on one word or one theme that's
all you'll see on the slide this is a
real slide from a Bill Gates TED talk
called innovating to zero it was about
reducing carbon emissions he said it's a
simple formula the more co2 goes the
more co2 we create temperature increases
which leads to really bad things that's
a simple slide in fact there are more
words on that slide than there were on
most of the other slides there but what
Bill Gates realizes and a lot of great
communicators realize is that the more
complex your idea the more complex the
discussion the simpler the slide needs
to be otherwise you're literally
overwhelming and taxing the person's
brain and you're asking people to
multitask and we can't multitask as well
as you think we can so we can't listen
to something very complicated and read a
hundred words on a slide at the same
time so think visually and that's how
you make things more memorable ideas
that spread or emotional novel and
memorable they have all three they have
to have all three you can't have one
without the other
I want to end with this though I believe
all of you have the capacity to move
people to educate to electrify to
inspire
you have ideas that are meant to be
heard and it's your ideas that will move
this company forward that will catapult
your career and quite possibly change
the world so you really need to focus on
how you tell your story and how best you
communicate your ideas to really inspire
your listeners and to move people to
action thank you for inviting me here to
share my ideas with you today I
appreciate it thank you I would love to
sign some books but before we do are
there any questions that you think might
benefit the rest of the group yes ma'am
um Jeff resources they used how people
learn and television arrange resources
to help people tell the story
i-i've often referred to a couple of
books but there aren't that many if you
have resources I would love to hear what
those resources are storytelling is a
pretty broad area right now the way what
I like to tell people is all of you have
a story to tell when I went to
Northwestern for journalism school I got
a master's at Northwestern for
journalism
I remember a professor screaming at me
when I came back from a shoot and he was
he was yelling at me and you know his
blood vessels were popping and he said
because I walked back and I said there
was no story
I have nothing because there's no story
and he said carmine there is always a
story and I'll never forget that so the
way I look at it is everyone has a story
to tell you just need to think about
what is the story behind this idea what
is the story behind this product there's
three different types of stories it can
be a personal story how did you arrive
at this idea or maybe it's a personal
story of somebody you know who had a
problem that this idea solves it can be
thirty Seconds that's a story it can be
a story about brand success or brand
failure another company another brand it
can be a story about other people who
have a particular problem so the way
Steve Jobs always
used to introduce a product he always
told a good story behind the product he
never just started by introducing the
product
he's only spent maybe two minutes
outlining the problem before the product
introduction that's a story that's
introducing a villain the problem before
the hero it does not you don't have to
make storytelling too complicated just
introduce the villain before the hero
and the hero's course your idea or your
product yes ma'am
when you present I hear a certain tone
that you use a certain tone like a
almost musical that you go up and down
open up and up and down I think most of
the presentations I've been to yes that
bore me to death he's not because the
visuals are not good or the story is not
good it's also the presenter just keeps
on talking like this like this dog is
alone and it was me to see here that it
like you're the passion that you put out
not only up there either you're giving
but also I hear a tone I go how to say
another write my word but you bring this
up and down I wanted to see if you can
share if not is important representation
or not how do I absolutely most people
underestimate the power of the verbal
ability and their body language and
their gestures they don't think about
that they spend most of their time
making sure the font on slide 32 is just
right yeah in setup instead of you know
what you have to do and I know this
sounds counterintuitive but I have an
entire chapter this book on practice
most people don't practice for important
presentations again they spend most of
the time on the slide and then they just
sort of internalize it and say to
themselves oh yeah I know what I'm going
to say when I get there but most people
don't practice if you practice and you
internalize your content then it frees
you up it frees you up to start thinking
about how am I going to deliver it what
body language am i going to use what
gestures am I going to use the greatest
presenters were the ones who practice a
lot ahead of time much more so than
you'd think dr. Jill Bolte Taylor is a
very famous TED talk er she gave the sec
most successful TED talk of all time she
told me that she practiced 200 times 200
times most of us have never practiced
200 times in our entire careers so I'm
not suggesting you got to practice 200
times for every presentation but if you
have a mission-critical mission-critical
presentation internalize it about 10
times so that you can really focus on
how am I going to deliver this now and
you don't have to worry about what comes
next
I think you had it did you have a
question oh I just wanted to share that
a really great forum to practice a good
a good yeah if you could speak up a good
for a good forum to practice it is
Lester its Toastmasters Toastmasters hmm
there's clubs internationally and we
actually have a several here on campus
so you can find them online if you go to
Toastmasters comm and it's just a great
forum to practice itches and public
speaking in yeah and I write for
Toastmaster magazine quite a bit and so
I'm a big fan of the organization I did
not know that they actually had
Toastmasters groups on the Microsoft
campus oh cool Oh multiple okay great
yeah excellent yes sir do you believe
that your approach can be applied to
highly technical presentations where we
have actually explained how something
works I love that question I get that
question all the time all right
the question is does this approach apply
to highly technical presentations and I
would argue that it it must apply to
highly technical presentations because
they're so complicated if it the more
complex the idea the simpler the story
has to be behind it I do I'm very very
confident that this approach works for
the most complex communication and I may
not have been able to say that up until
a couple of years ago true story I'm in
New Mexico and I was working with the
toughest group of people I've ever come
against there was a very very long
difficult day and it was a nuclear
scientist at Sandia National Labs
there is nothing I know
what we do here at Microsoft is complex
nothing is more complicated than nuclear
science and there was a lot of pushback
a lot of pushback oh this will never
work for us car might it's too simple
okay so by the end of the day some
people were coming around because I
offered the science behind it two weeks
later the woman who had organized this
particular group and it was a safety
group said that we had a safety
presentation and internal safety
presentation and she said a car might as
you can imagine knowing where our nukes
are is a really important presentation
so she said in this safety presentation
the gentleman who was in that workshop
applied pretty much everything we talked
about he wanted to give it a try it was
the best safety presentation we've ever
seen everybody was engaged the whole
time rather than tuning out after the
first few minutes so but but you have to
have a balance if you walk in to your
boss's office and you give a
presentation with nothing but pictures
that's not good right so there has to be
a balance of things but when Bill Gates
says look this is a very complex area
and I want to simplify it for you the
slide has to be simple too
or maybe there's one statistic that he
wants everybody to know why clutter the
slide with 50 numbers or statistics why
not just put the one statistic that you
think is the most important for that
presentation those are like those are
simple steps to take rather than blowing
up the entire culture you can't do that
so I understand there has to be a
balance I'm showing you extremes these
are extremes now you have to kind of
pull it back to where you're comfortable
question over here yes sir and when I
was young I did a lot of practice before
I presented
you're still very young I'm not sure how
you
I am right now okay when you were
younger than you were right now yes you
did a lot of practice and then I went
before and then something happened what
I've presented something changed and I'm
completely lost oh god some practice and
after that I just told myself I'll just
be confident when I talk and not really
practice a lot okay so you said I'm not
going to practice a lot now different
different things work for different
people and in this general what's your
first name
Oh Watson what was it all right and
Watson said that he now he doesn't
practice and he feels like it is more
effective that's fine but you also
mentioned an important word confidence
you're confident so somehow you are
getting yourself into a state where
you're really confident about your
presentation and your message for most
people for most people practice
rehearsal raises confidence levels so
that's why for most people maybe not
yourself but for most people the more
they practice and internalize the the
more confident they are I actually
worked with a CEO of SanDisk many of you
know SanDisk are the pioneers of flash
memory the cards that you have in your
cameras are the CEO of SanDisk was
introducing a new product at CES this
was several years ago and he practice
for weeks and he thought I was crazy I
said you got to practice this every day
every day you're going to be doing this
he thought I was nuts halfway through
the presentation it goes down the
computer you know locks up they can't
get it back without missing a beat he
goes through the rest of it just has the
conversation with no visuals behind it
and later he said carmine if I had not
practiced I would have froze I would not
have known what to do next but but I was
so comfortable and confident that it
helped him through the rest of the
presentation and nobody knew any better
they just thought it would that was the
end of the presentation so I think
practice leads to confidence let me let
me go over here we'll go back and forth
yes sir why not
the simplicity of your message of making
that a a lot of TED Talks incorporated
great questions for the beginning
throughout and at the end can you talk a
little bit about the power of weaving in
those questions throughout okay so he
said that great TED Talks weave in these
awesome questions throughout that speaks
to novelty and unexpectedness so the
number one TED talk of all time is Ken
Robinson who is an educator and his the
title of his TED talk is why do schools
kill creativity so that all that's
unexpected it's surprising well wait a
minute aren't schools supposed to foster
creativity so that by starting with the
question school why do schools kill
creativity all of the sudden within the
first few seconds you're intrigued you
want to hear more and he uses that
question throughout the presentation so
I think that's what you're talking about
so sometimes a great presentation can
begin with a question a question that
people don't necessarily expect or they
want to know the answer to that question
so that's another great method there's
different methods of engaging people
different methods of engaging people but
I think that regardless of the method it
has to be emotional it has to be new and
unexpected and it has to be memorable in
some way back here yes ma'am how do you
think this method applies to trying to
sell something to our external facing
customers on a website maybe we're
selling a product or we're engaging them
for support or help do you think of it
something like this applies how does
this style apply to external customers
most of the brands that I work with we
use this style for external customers
edmunds.com is the number one automotive
retail research site they've completely
changed the way they do their stories do
external customers based on this type of
method the very clean uncluttered slides
very visual breaking it up every 10 or
18 minutes breaking out break
the presentations into threes and there
is no question that their customers are
saying we like this they don't even know
why they like it they just like it
because they see 10:10 marketing
presentations a week from different
vendors and then in comes Edmonds
completely different and it's it's new
it's refreshing it's unexpected people
don't even know why they like it but
they like it
we did this with LinkedIn - I worked
with LinkedIn before they went IPO
completely change the way they tell
their external story and I didn't get
any shares from that IPO yes ma'am
you address this at the top of your
visitation which I missed the first
minute how affected is this framework in
delivering your pitch if it's written or
to this lady's point that's on a website
or is this framework really to be
applied if you're delivering your pitch
verbally oh no I the question is how
does this framework apply to an email
pitch or on a website a few things that
I didn't really go into but number one
would be the rule of three rule of three
so in an email what I would expect you
to say is here is the most important
thing I want you to know this is so
there has to be a headline just like a
great newspaper article there's got to
be a headline what's the one thing I
want you to know about this product
supported by three ideas now if you go
to the Apple website the Apple website
is ver is beautifully created because
they really study communication and dr.
pradeep actually the gentleman i showed
you is someone who helps design websites
with persuasion in mind and I noticed
that when I went to what the the
examples he showed me on websites
there's like one product and then three
reasons why you should buy the product
so it's very uncluttered as well so you
have to think about how am I going to
reduce the clutter how am I going to
reduce the clutter on a site in
marketing material and in an email an
email that's too long
not going to be read an email that has
space in between and maybe three bullets
and maybe a story or a supporting point
is much more likely to be read than just
a string of words right just like a good
PowerPoint presentation yes sir let's go
away in the back are there any cultures
around the world where this is less than
optimal for them this protein secondly
when you argue a presentation and it's
being translated and there's a bit of a
less we okay I love I love the first
part of your question which is are there
any cultures that where this approach
may not work as well funny you say that
I was speaking in Japan years ago
several years ago and in Japan they do
the opposite of this right it's their
powerpoints are are very very dense and
very cluttered and after I presented to
many many workshops in Japan after every
workshop people came up to me and said
we really like the American style of
delivering presentations and I didn't
quite understand what they were saying
but it was the whole Steve Jobs more
visual more passionate more engaging
more storytelling but I reminded all of
them that it's not just you know it's
not every American who does a great
style of presenting you know you're
going to find great presentations in
every culture in every country there's
plenty of bad presentations here as well
we all know that but they like the style
they didn't know what they liked about
and they just liked it I wrote a column
for Forbes last year Japan won the 2020
Olympics I think of the Summer Olympics
they won the bid and how did they win
the bid they actually created what they
call even the Japanese called a very
unjam ease like presentation to reach a
global audience I talked to the people
who designed the presentation I talked
to the people who deliver the
presentation and I actually in
food slides from the presentation it was
unlike anything most people have seen
they all had to tell a story each one of
the presenters had to start with a story
of why the Olympics were so important to
them and so important the country
it was very visual it was very
storytelling they practiced they
practice their verbal delivery they
practiced their body language it was
unlike any other presentation that the
other countries gave and it blew away
the judges and they won the 2020
Olympics that's not the only reason of
course that they did but it certainly
persuaded the judges in a big way so
that taught me and there's always
something you can learn about
communication that taught me that
anybody any culture anyone can learn how
to communicate more effectively and some
of these models that we're talking about
are very transparent and are very
consistent across cultures because our
brains sort of process information in
the same way we speak different
languages but they still processes
information largely the same so I'm
finding that this models is working in
many countries and look at Ted TED talks
are in 145 countries and they have a
very similar model to this so let's do
this folks it's 135 I appreciate
everybody coming out oh I need to sign
some books so I can get you on your way
and you can go out there and get back to
your daily business but thanks again for
coming out thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
