you
I tried to to present to you a a path
that will lead the to look like a deli
but in a peculiar way first of all
something happened long ago we don't
know how but a very complex molecule get
organized into a membrane and there was
Luca as formed by membrane lots of
proteins and and inside it this
incredible complex molecule for the
second but by luca now i mean the last
Universal common ancestor there is
indeed the common belief that as we all
share all living beings at the same DNA
test matter different amount that is
actually just one occasion in history
where this happened long ago but what
happened after Luca there is an apparent
increasing of complexity namely we start
from one DNA structure and membrane some
proteins that's original bacteria the
bacteria still as they are now then
eukaryotic cell where there are many sub
substructures microtubules there are
mitochondria a chloroplast and much more
than that you can measure for example a
difference of complexity by counting
membranes and something that Luca can do
very well and even more membranes if you
go to a multicellular organism so again
by some topological measure you can eat
say that there is an objective
increasing complexity the story of
progression sort of progress towards
what well if you look at primates then
they get more and more complex at least
muscles of the hands the face the
neurons the number of neurons number
connection more and more complexity
fantastic progress did the ious product
of animal evolution
we got here so we got from Lucca to Luca
happy birthday Luca well to be fair it
didn't work this way no it is not not
exactly this way well I will try to
summarize a short analysis of a
marvelous work done by stephen jay gould
a biologist of evolution concerning it
an attempt to justify the increasing
complexity because you see what i said
before even though not in a linear we're
in a progressive way did happen at the
beginning they were just a membrane with
DNA and then something got more complex
where and how without aim without a
direction without aiming to look at to
be honest but how to analyze this then
gold in the book which is very informal
is a biologist book about evolution
plenty of data observes that there is
surely no bias you see it because if you
have a bias toward more complexity and
you put here some sort of measure
complexity and time here all living
beings would get more complex in a way
or another well this is the actual
situation bacteria still there not more
complex that the original one perhaps
perhaps they have some more protective
it is but basically even the simplest
one are still there so the analysis by
gold die by goal which is based on
polanta logical evidence is that if you
put some sort of complexity measure here
on sorry here on our own on this on this
line not yet specified by Sir mg not not
specified very clearly by gold and here
you put the least complexity the
bacteria and as a value to the density
of biomass biomass density you have the
shape like this still now bacteria are
about fifty percent of the biomass so
from this original situation the
explosion of back here there's like
complexification you go to something
like this how comes that there is a
complex ification well this is just a
random diff you
but in a symmetric one the basic idea
informally that we did model in more
careful way is that when you have an a
somatic diffusion like an explosion of a
gas against the wall there a symmetry is
propagated even by a purely Brownian
motion by just a random path that
compose any diffusion intuitively you
can understand the Brownian motion of a
particle here bumps against more
particles on the left and then is forced
on the average to move slightly to the
right this happened in this very access
free space of a complexity let's make
clear one point the concerning
randomness that randomness in biology is
not noise unfortunate has been the be
dominating a paradigm seems long we're
even evolution is seen as the result of
noise none randomness must be understood
in a completely different way because
randomness implies variability which
implies diversity and adaptation which
are a component of structural stability
in most physical theories randomness
disturbs stabilities and then you get by
resilience back to a viable situation in
biology is quite the opposite
variability and diversity are a
component of a stability of species of a
population even an organ is our lungs
are more stable because there is a
random component in the generation of in
their morphogenesis the similar
similarly for the vascular systems and
so on we didn't organize within a
population within a species again I
insist randomness is an essential
component of stability it now how to
understand these spontaneous symmetry
breaking that is at the core of the
dynamic dimension and also how to be
precise in measuring this phenotypic
complexity an atomic complexity you see
if you look at them at the lines of a
frog they are just two two containers
with the topological complexity you can
measure diffract ality there is just a
surfaced external surfaces too if you go
to a primate for example you have to
topological structure here and here and
you can measure here the fractal
dimension which is about 3.2 and here is
2.4 because one optimizes the
distribution of mass of matter and
energy of a volume within a volume the
other one optimizes the resolution of an
urgent matter by surface into a volume
so you can compute this and you can say
get two point four and three point two
are greater than two so there is an
increasing complexity going from one
case of another what we did at some time
ago and look already hurt the more
lately lecture about that what I want to
go to some more recent facts is that you
can evaluate mathematically associated
number do this an atomic complexity
there is no analysis of functions
suggest anatomy of the dead animal you
can make make a counting as you see the
number to the differentiation you can
count the number of tissues is very
pissed emic because you decide what is
at issue but this rather bust you can
measure a connect City and fractal
structure for example we have 600
muscles a cow or horse as 400 muscles
and they say 600 is more than friended
you can measure the fractal structures
as a gate before an example and there
are also metabolic relation you can
measure networks a neural network is a
typical paradigm we have more neurons
than many other animals but David an
elephant for example as many neurons as
we have but you have many more synaptic
connections so these are associated
numbers being more complex doesn't mean
to be better evolutionarily the bacteria
are the best because they are still
there and they are still the majority of
the biomass so by specifying by
specifying this informal notion of
complexity we could model the the
process of complexity complexification
just as a random diffusion where the
diffusion is always based on random
paths technically this is done in by
mimicking a Schrodinger equation which
gives the dynamics of a probability may
sure while we did describe the dynamics
of a potential of variability and this
is the mathematical model what's been
very surprising to me is that some
leading biologists of cancer got
interested in these analysis of
complexity long evolution as they see
cancer as an evolutionary problem within
an organist as an ecosystem an organism
is also an ecosystem is not only an
ecosystem because it has a much stronger
greater and structure that any ecosystem
yet there is a particular peculiar
phenomenon that is the lack of control
or evolution inside an organ is that the
way these people consider cancer and
then we started discussing together and
the approach we are working now to
cancer concerns the lack of control or
proliferation the main assumption that
we make is that selection is an
essential component for the controller
pro variation on ecosystem and that
within an organist is it what keeps
cells wife the default state is
proliferation with variation is not
creations in an organ this goes against
very much against the dominating curious
in particular case of cancer our thesis
is that the cells is an organized are
just cells are living cells so a priori
they proliferate with variation however
the tissue the organs the neural system
the monetary system the organizer
together controls in a differentiated
way the proliferation of cells what
happens is that in a cancer jury is a
rather surprising fact is probably the
only disease which causes that there is
an increase of complexity according to
our measure for example topologically
this is the normal situation of the duct
this is a section of a duck in a cancer
you have the lumina the lumen that
increases so you can measure to increase
in complexity due to uncontrolled cell
proliferation what happens is that
complexity increases but functionality
decreases and that's the problem of the
pathology so
goes on currently with a fine analysis
which also associate exact numbers to
vitalia cancer which are eighty percent
of the known cancer so and it allows at
least to make some sort of preliminary
discrimination within this view that
cancer is development that goes worry is
this just part of evolutionary process
where a carcinogen goes in this peculiar
ecosystem and this wraps the control of
proliferation so this conjecture hours
because I mean we are confronted with
very complex empirical evidence and an
incredible incredible amount of work
i'ma say because that's of course the
disease which is much studied
unfortunately because is strongly
increasing so what's surprising is that
in spite of the increasing success of
therapies I mean therapies are fantastic
now medicine is justice and surgery in
particular is a strong and effective the
dead are not decreasing actually are
slightly increasing and that's because
for any age group the cancer is is
increasing and this increasing largely
because endocrine disruptors you know
last century we produce at 80,000
artificial molecules and there is clear
evidence that finite combination of
these molecules are endocrine disruptors
and thus indirectly carcinogens now
finding the finite combinations of these
eighty thousand molecules and not a
trivial fact okay I stop here this is in
my view a fundamental book for the lives
of the disease which is be increasing
successful that's my first book in in
biology and that's our recent work
doesn't discuss at all issue of cancer
but which is a chapter on this in on
this issue of increasing complexity
around evolution okay happy birthday
