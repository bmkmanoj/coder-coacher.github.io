of demos we're gonna show today today
we're going to show you a couple of
mobile natural user interfaces so what I
have here is a muscle computer interface
a system that senses finger gestures
based on my muscle activity up my
forearm so if you look at this screen
over here what you see is the signal
that's coming out of this device and if
you look down at the bottom you'll see
the computer sensing my finger gesture
is based on this device now what we're
going to show you is an application of
this in fact I'm going to play air
guitar hero now usually I'd have a
physical guitar in my hands but in this
case I'm just going to use my fingers
you sort of get the idea here let's move
to our second demo hey I'm Dan Morris
I'm going to show you a similar
technology for enabling mobile natural
user interfaces so I'm gonna do here is
control this mock phones and a mock
mobile phone scenario just by tapping on
my arm so for example let's listen to
some music I hear some great Microsoft
songs with music how about that third
song so now maybe instead of music I'm
gonna go and play some games play a
little Tetris again I'm doing all of
this just by tapping on my arm so the
great thing about this is this is an
input device that goes with me
everywhere unlike a keyboard or mouse
for example back to our phone scenario
you might imagine that I might want to
go check my email now just go take a
look at my email so if I have some
important email with our tech fest I'm
so that gives you a good feel for the
kind of things you could imagine doing
on the go with natural user interfaces
using the body as an input surface
