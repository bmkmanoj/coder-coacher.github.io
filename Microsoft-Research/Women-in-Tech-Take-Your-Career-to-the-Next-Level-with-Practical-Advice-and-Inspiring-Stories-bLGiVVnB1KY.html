hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
hello thank you so much for coming my
name is Amy Draves and I'm so pleased to
welcome Tara van vlack to the tara
wheeler ban black to the Microsoft
Research visiting speaker series she's
here to discuss her new book women in
tech which discusses the framework that
many women find themselves in joining
the field as well as success stories
from professionals who have made it Tara
is the co-founder and CEO of fizz mint
and she's also founded a web development
company called Red Queen technologies
and started an initiative to add
diversity to the infosec conference
speakers she also founded the hack the
people Foundation which is a non-profit
mentorship program focused on
underprivileged people in technology
this is her debut book please join me in
giving her a very warm welcome thank you
so very much it's a real pleasure to be
here today I don't know about you people
but I am stupid tired of talking about
diversity and technology raise your
hands right I'm a little tired of it I
imagine probably you are too and yet we
keep having to talk about it I think
that most of the reason why we find the
topic fascinating and yet kind of
dangerous is the amount of fear that
surrounded the fear that will say
something wrong do something wrong so
one of the things that I want to promise
to you right now and I hope that
everybody in this room will join me in
it is that you can ask me any question
that you want to if you're trying hard
not to be an asshole you're probably
going to succeed it's okay to be
clueless and I will never ever ever
punish anybody for a clueless question
you'll know the difference when you hear
it right so if you want to ask me a
question and it's a little clueless go
right on ahead there will be no penalty
for it ever what I'm going to do is talk
for a couple of minutes here and then I
would always always love it if you would
raise your hands and ask questions if
you'll ask me anything that you want to
know we'll talk mostly about the subject
material I brought for you here today
for the first like 15-20 and then open
this on up to conversation a little bit
more please stop me if you don't
understand anything or you want to know
something
I actually used to to work here by the
way I used to work at Microsoft i was on
the halo team for a while in fact my
former boss is sitting in the audience
right now it's a lot of fun to get to
work on things that we love to to play
games to have this joy in creation in
technology in gaming I'm a nerd right in
in every single direction kind of
pathetically so I i step on Mordy force
than legos probably I think so how many
of you in here have been part of
role-playing games okay video games keep
them up okay all right how about any
other kind of nerd activity Chess Club
in high school raise them up that's
right that's what I'm talking about so
we're part of this conversation not just
because we want to to create greater
voices in technology but also because we
all seem to love the same stuff right
that's why we're here so why do we keep
having to have this conversation I think
a lot of it has to do with compassion
with real compassion and being willing
to hear the things that other people
have to say without necessarily
immediately jumping in to tell them why
you're not a bad person and why they're
wrong so the main thing I want to
encourage all of us to do here is just
listen to what other people have to say
I have been in startups and technology
for an awful long time and I've seen
really that it's a matter of unconscious
bias and unconscious assumptions that
often keeps women and people of color
out of technology I don't want to leave
in this conversation questions of people
of color or genderqueer people out of
this conversation this is not just a
binary issue it's not men and women it's
what we expect to see in technology and
the people that are actually trying to
get into the field right I don't think
it's uncommon for us to see people who
talk right now and there's there's been
a tumblr thread running around over just
the last couple of days who conflate
issues of Technology and kind of what i
call nerd landia right because we're all
part of this big conversation where
we've felt from the beginning as if we
are outsiders in a lot of ways
right technology nerds mathan gaming
whatever it was we were doing 30 or 40
years ago it might have been the AV club
and drama right now it's computers and
chess and RPGs this coming in a couple
of weeks I'll be actually running what I
am beginning to think of as a super
awesome oneshot D&amp;amp;D campaign at the
Tribeca Film Festival for defcon and I
get to play an amazing game with amazing
people and and create a wonderful
challenge and I think of that as being
very much part of Technology I think
there's a big connection between the two
so this is why I bring this passion to
it and I can tell you now why this book
came about if you'd like to know I'm
also kind of a crowdfunding nerd I've
done several different crowd funding
campaigns I did a campaign in 2012
called lady coders to do videos to help
women get into tech jobs and what I
found was that crowdfunding is a really
great way to give yourself about a
thousand bosses for a year and a half
and that's seemingly winded up happening
again this time with this book it's a
really great way to find out if there is
a if there's interest in a topic and it
turned out hoo boy they're really really
is I've done a lot of crowdfunding and
the experience that I had with this one
was pretty unique how many of you have
considered writing your own nope first
how many of you have written your own
books before in some fashion and gotten
them published okay how many of you are
considering or are currently writing
some kind of book right now okay how
many of you plan on writing a book
sometime in the next five years on some
kind of topic that you okay good so a
substantial chunk even half of you are
planning on entering publishing I want
to very much talk about what it's like
to write a book like this on a sensitive
topic and get a lot of people interested
in it I could keep the I'm going to keep
the stories of what it's like to project
manage eight famous women to a bare
minimum mostly because I'm afraid of
most of them and yet what I do want
every one of you to know is that
crowdfunding is a really great option to
create something like this it gives you
the chance to find out in advance if
people are going to be interested in the
topic so one of the things i'd like to
do right now is ask the people in
this room I never know when I'm walking
into a room like this whether or not the
people that I'm talking to you are going
to be more interested in the process of
creating the book in what it's like to
make something like this happen or if
you're more interested in the topic that
we're here to discuss in terms of
diversity and technology which one of
these two things are you more interested
in because I've heard both peep I've
heard both sides come at me and ask
questions are you more interested in
learning how to make a book on a
sensitive topic like this or about the
topic itself and some of the topics in
the book thrown at it ask actually tell
me what you think just shout it out the
topics you do one of the topics okay for
those of you that are interested in the
process the crowdfunding what it's like
to actually create like this and go find
a publisher please let me know just
follow me on Twitter and then talk to me
there that'll be the fastest way to do
it okay the topics in the book the
biggest one that people seem to talk
with me about in this book and I was
very careful in how I worded this in the
book given where I live in Seattle but
the biggest one seems to be salary
negotiation for women I'm aware of some
of the recent controversy around that
topic in this area like right in this
area like right about I don't know maybe
a mile and a half that way to a mile and
a half that way and take a big circle
right about here and what I have found
is that when you mean well you've got a
place to start and everybody involved in
this conversation means well right
there's no one here that's saying out
loud I think it's a great idea to pay
women eighty-one cents on the dollar
right that's killer they're clearly
worthless so we're starting from a place
of wanting to fix the problem everyone
is and one of the biggest things that
I've seen and this is going to kind of
blow your minds the biggest fix that
I've seen people in terms of salary
negotiation if we're going to talk about
that topic first make the biggest change
is this advertised salary is negotiable
in every job that you post how many of
you in here are hiring managers of some
kind or another or have some
responsibility for hiring or writing up
posts in those posts right salary
negotiable the reason why is women will
adjust their behavior but men will not
adjust theirs and this is there's
there's a lot of studies to show
this women will begin to say okay if
salary is negotiable then I can
negotiate men we're going to negotiate
anyway okay that's the biggest change
that you as a manager can make now you
as someone who is negotiating need to
know two things first and foremost do
not do not name a number first don't
name a number first what is rule number
one first rule number two is never say
yes to the first offer ever say yes to
the first offer the first offer is ten
to fifteen percent below where they
think you're going to end up what does
that number sound a little bit like the
gender gap and pay there's a reason for
that because that's where most of the
gender gap and pay comes from is that
moment right there I call that minute 0
in the gender pay gap if you have a
salary that you are negotiating over
assume that they came at you with ten to
fifteen percent lower than the amount
that they think that you're going to end
up that makes sense for how many of you
is this an absolutely terrifying thought
to say no look I know what real estate
prices are like in this area i've been
here since 2009 his ass hired me right I
I know what it's like to be here and to
be afraid for your bills I know what
it's like to do this and as somebody who
teaches people about technical
interviews I constantly interview for
things you will find that almost
everybody at a certain level and
technology on is always interviewing
even if that interview just looks like a
cup of coffee even if it just looks like
a dinner with a friend in San Francisco
you're always interviewing for something
I know what it's like to do this
constantly and I know why it's so
frightening it's because you are giving
someone else the opportunity to reject
you after they've said they accept you
right yeah why would you give somebody
that opportunity what's what is what are
some of the feelings that you have in
that moment I would love to know if you
want to raise a hand or two and tell me
those of you who have been in the
situation you've had an offer especially
those who have had someone come back and
say why didn't you negotiate later what
was your feeling in that moment yeah do
you do oh that's a great question that's
not even about the money itself about
who you are as a person why did you make
it about who you are as a person why is
it hard not to
you think my suit for the people are
they oh absolutely the question is
because you're worried about whether or
not you deserve more do you really
deserve that much money okay it's a
great question do you so that's not the
answer that question do you oh yes what
do you deserve equal pay yes yeah that's
it that's just answer the question yeah
and it's okay to say that one of the
things that I found that works very very
well is to know in advance with the
expected salary for that job is and how
do you find that out go Tate or somebody
who has that job and find out glassdoor
calm salary calm hmm these are some
really great places to go find this
information out and yet they don't
necessarily tell you the whole story
right they don't necessarily tell you if
they've got a range from between 140 to
180 thousand dollars on say a senior
technical program manager position
whether or not you should be being paid
140 or 180 how do you know and at that
range you should be negotiating for that
position right it is in bigger companies
especially at Microsoft I understand the
rate system at Microsoft it's um you you
have almost a place that you are locked
into and then a thin band where you're
negotiating in there right most of you
have had this process happened before
okay I've seen that happen before and
what usually ends up happening at that
moment is the way you negotiate is on
what i would call nonlinear benefits
things like whether or not you can
telecommute part of the time how much
funding you would get for something like
parking transportation there's ways
around a lot of salary caps at that
point so you ask questions like you're
gonna pay for my gym membership instead
of child care which I don't need I'm
hang on one second and go ahead your
first year so it might make you feel
better but doesn't it for pitch with the
sorry yeah yeah the salary what makes
you feel better actually sorry no she
were the
they from home or yes I'm assuming that
there is a that there's a band in a cab
for something like that in most
companies that's not the case but I'm
focusing what I know on what I know of
the culture here and the pay rates here
which is that there's a band in a cab
right so you can't negotiate above and
below that cap there's no way to do that
right they're gonna do they're going to
assign that based on your years of
experience the things that you've done
the degrees that you have right
absolutely and then your question I'm in
some positions that i have seen on it
instead of letting the negotiate the
salary they you can negotiate assigning
mm-hmm that help or else you done
signing bonus is something that often
has no cap and no band on it signing
bonus is an excellent place to make up
for some of that difference please do
negotiate hard over that the takeaway
point on salary negotiations is this by
the time it may appear to you as if
there are thousands of people vying for
this job and at any one moment one of
those swooping hovering vultures is
going to swoop in and grab the job right
out from under you right there are
thousands of people we know about the
work show the the the shortage of great
jobs for people in technology right so
it seems like at any moment they're just
gonna be like Matt we're gonna go with
person number two you know you're a
hundred percent but you know they're
99.9 and they're less trouble than you
right is that what we're afraid of
exactly it's not true the truth is and I
know this in almost every major
technical company in the area as well as
especially small companies in the area
the truth is is that that job interview
that opportunity never went out to the
public for most really great positions
instead what happened was an internal
email was circulated and you found out
about the job probably you probably most
of you didn't actually just straight
apply through the microsoft site and get
hired right someone called you or a
vendor agency brought you in or you had
an interview with a friend or someone
recommended you for a position or
someone stuck your resume on top of a
pile how many of the people in this room
had zero contact with any person at
Microsoft before they applied through
the microsoft site with just their
resume and then got the job raise your
hand
that happened to you that's what I
thought right that means that by the
time you've gone to that job there
really may be only five to ten
candidates for it and by the time
they've gotten you through the process
that means that they don't have anybody
else waiting you're the best one out of
all of that and they're gonna have to go
through another month of back-breaking
recruiting and a lot of trouble trying
to find somebody else to put in this
position instead of you you have so much
more power in that moment than you think
you do that it is ridiculous yes I don't
want to change momentum however at the
same time a lot of this is focused on if
you're trying to get a job here mm-hmm
what about the people who already have a
job here what next cuz it seems to be
that's embraces you get yeah you know as
you move from roll-to-roll or you're the
ear you don't really have a chance to
really ask for more right once your if
you was done and your rave is locked in
mm-hmm can't go back and say well I want
more money this is the money you got so
how does what you're saying play a part
in well you've been here people are
already here okay i'm thinking of
interviewing for internal candidates the
same way that i'm thinking of an
interviewing for external candidates so
thank you for letting me know that there
is a difference between the two but even
for internal candidates transitioning to
another position there's still the
perception that there is that there's
competition for that position right is
there ever a perception that you that
there's no competition for a job and you
have been selected for it and you will
now move into it probably not leave
there's at least a couple of candidates
for any open role even if they're all
internal right right the same logic the
same negotiating strategy still applies
they still want you in that position so
when you say it feels like there's no
bandwidth to negotiate in that moment
like you already have the salary set and
the cap set why not out of starting
bonus in it's a different role that's
the moment the only moment that you will
have to change your salary you don't
have it when you're in your role right
in technology it's very rare although I
know Microsoft does do promotions and
does do increases in salary year by year
it's very rare to substantially change
your salary without changing jobs and
technology
that is the only moment you're going to
have to make changes in what you're
doing and while it has been a while
since I was working at Microsoft I know
enough to know that that moment is one
of the few that you will have to
substantially change your compensation
right yeah that's the only place you
that's where you can change benefits
salary the way that you are being seen
I've only seen one other tactic work to
drastically substantially change your
salary your position the way you are
viewed by a company and that is some
kind of major educational milestone like
a degree right or a major postgraduate
certificate that's the only thing that
I've ever seen anyone be able to go to a
lead or a manager and say I have
substantially changed my value to the
company look I have more letters behind
my name it's the only silver bullet I've
ever seen other than changing a role
that could substantially change your
compensation at a company in the grade
that you're in yes industry recognition
that is less likely and the reason why
is industry recognition if you were to
receive some kind of an award of some
kind and you're going to go and
negotiate for a salary increase based on
you know you just one independent game
Game Developers awards or something
along those lines or you just received a
citation for excellence for a triple a
game or a product right it's almost more
likely that you'll be seen as
negotiating for salary there as a
preliminary to leaving the company
actually I've seen that kind of thing
happened before so and that is that's
anecdotal everything else that I've said
has data and studies behind it but that
right there is just anecdotal because
there's just not that many people who've
received substantial industry awards
such that I could give you some kind of
statistical survey of it okay does that
make sense it's not comfortable but
that's the only location you're going to
have to make that substantial change
were there any other questions okay so
when it comes to salary negotiations
again rule number one is do not name a
number first number two is never say yes
to the first offer and the third thing
is you have so much more power than you
thought you did in that moment that is
crazy
so let me ask you now there's there's
some sensitive topics we can talk about
him i'm not sure what you would like me
to broach but yes name number so they
ask what is your expectation what's the
right answer to that question what
you'll do is that you'll come back in
that moment when when they say what is
your expectation you'd come back to them
and you say the information that you
give me when you tell me what you expect
of me by giving me a number first tells
me how you'll value me at this company
does that's the phrase you use those are
the words you use when they say and and
remember sometimes that you are speaking
to somebody who has no real power in the
situation probably a recruiter sometimes
who's getting a range on your salary
just to make sure that no one's time is
being wasted and what will happen then
is they'll say I'm sorry we I have to
have you name a number first and you say
okay let me know when you have a number
and then i'll be happy to continue the
conversation yeah that's what happens
when you've got somebody who maybe is
just trying to get a from you any number
whatsoever but the second that you have
named enough named a number first you
have lost you are either going to name a
number that is there's no way ever for
you to magically hit on the correct
number because you will either name a
number that people there think is too
high or too low if too low you're making
eighty-one cents on the dollar if too
high you're not going to get the job or
you're being perceived as asking for too
much and what are we all afraid of being
called and we go into interviews like
that entitled a bitch right now I have
clearly based on my wardrobe choices
chosen to gone the bitch route and
that's okay for me I'm comfortable and
happy with having some people not like
me that's all right there are gonna be
some people that are just never gonna
like me I had to be okay with that I
mean I might be a little too okay with
that but yeah you had a question for the
range just say for this job position
once the range tell me the range and
then I'll give you my number and then
you go for the height into the range I
mean not the very high end but you know
I always go for thai into the range but
don't don't phrase it as tell me your
range say the information that you give
me when you tell me the range for this
remember it's not it's not tell me it's
not a command to them it's a request to
them
to help you this the thing that the
women in this room are going to
experience again and again is if you are
to direct in this moment you're going to
flip a switch and you are going to get
seen as that bitch right so what you do
is you always always phrase this in
terms of being a team player the
information that you give me when you
give me the range that you're willing to
pay for this this job tells me what I
need to know about how your company
values me and what I will bring to the
team okay always phrase it as a team
player situation always phrase it that
way do you understand why when women are
seen as team players they are more
highly rated they are more highly
appreciated and they are more highly
valued and promoted you don't get the
option to be the lone wolf player right
you don't get the option to be you know
you we all know what titanium silos of
excellence are right the days is it Mike
likes to say this actually the days when
you could slide a six pack and a pizza
under a door and there was a developer
in there in six weeks later shipped code
would come out or gone right yeah we're
we're all we're all in source control at
this point sorry about that thing that
one time by the way yeah go ahead you
will just wish to hook to a third-party
recorder but his job is or her job is to
get people together right so they get
food from someone getting hired so there
you can communicate the information more
freely and then an appraisal on politely
both ways so they would work with an
intermediary actually that's not
necessarily always true I found that
third-party recruiters are often not
only friendly but totally clueless and
it does really help to push to speak to
the person that you're going to actually
be speaking to at that point yeah it
does work really well and I've had
probably about ten experiences with a
vendor and recruiting agencies in the
area that would tell me that when when
you have no information and that person
doesn't have it they need to they need
to push and you put you in touch with
the correct person and I another
question over here go ahead they asked
you what your current I tell them I'm
sorry I'm not able to disclose that
information mm-hmm because that's true
you know why it's true because you're
not able to currently disclose that
information yeah because you decided
that you're not currently able to
disclose anything it's always true right
you're never gonna lie you're never
gonna lie
ever never ever ever lie but that
doesn't mean that you can't let them
assume something that isn't necessarily
true in this case which is that you have
signed some kind of document did you say
you sign a document you didn't sign a
document but I'm not able to reveal that
information currently it's absolutely
accurate every single time you say it
you know why cuz you feel like it's
totally accurate another question I
think over here someplace all right do
you feel like we've had the opportunity
to really talk about salaries you do you
have any more questions about this
concept of salary negotiation do you
want to know anything else some of the
craziest things I've ever seen okay so
one one thing that's really interesting
to me is it is I've never and I want to
make sure that you all know this in here
and it's the last anecdote will go with
in terms of the salary negotiation
situation it seems like this is the most
sensitive one that you all wanted to
talk about the most so I'm happy to have
more of a conversation with you on all
this but the thing that I want everyone
here to know is I have never even once
been or heard of someone being turned
down as a woman for a job when they
negotiated ever every single time they
get more money they don't always get
that extra ten to fifteen percent but
they always get more money and they've
never lost the job and as far as I know
no consequences have ever come out of it
I know of one person who after she
negotiated for a position didn't get the
job and it was because the recruiters
sister had applied for it okay you can't
you can't fight that yo you can't fight
that so when nepotism is at play that's
about all you can really do in that
situation I have never even once not
gotten a job I've gotten respect I've
gotten pushed back and you know what
when I got pushed back from that
recruiter I don't know if we can we can
go back and ask for more money for
something like this and I said well I do
about you go back and ask for more money
and I've had pushback from that person
before and then I never saw them again
and i was making 15 g's more a year I
feel super bad about that you guys right
ask yourself what's more important in
that moment that someone that you're
never going to talk to again likes you
or that you make enough money to make an
extra payment on your house right
sometimes it's okay to not be liked it's
never okay to be dishonest it's
never okay to not be courteous but
sometimes it's okay to not have
everybody like you and for somebody that
you're never going to see again and have
no part of and yet they're the one
you're negotiating your salary with
bring it on all right I want to open it
up to a few more questions I know that
yeah go ahead comment from someone we've
got a hundred and nearly 200 people
online and wonderful said that um they
got a rescinded offer when they when she
tried to negotiate because they assume
they couldn't compete with Microsoft's
offer mm-hmm so it sort of there was a
good it's the small company that was
assuming they couldn't possibly meet her
negotiation you're always going to see
edge cases with something along those
lines but the the reason that that's
important is what was the reason they
didn't give for not wanting to hire her
in that moment not that she was not that
she was a bad person not that she was a
bit sure she has for too much but that
they assumed that they couldn't compete
with another better offer that she was
already getting right that's good that's
awesome I love that it's not great since
she might have wanted to move to this
other company but in a case like that
that's not really about salary
negotiation that's about making sure
that the people that you're talking to
understand not just that that they
should value you but that you value them
that's certainly a moment where you want
to go to the people if you want to move
away from a position where you're making
more money to less money and they know
that you want them to know that there
are reasons why you're moving they're
not that anyone would clearly ever want
to leave this hallowed and beautiful
campus with Stu every once in a while
you may for some force a good reason
want to take a job someplace else if
that's the case and they don't think
they can compete with the benefits that
you've been experiencing here make sure
that they understand that it's about the
culture that you want to move to maybe
an opportunity that you weren't going to
have unless you went to them but that's
not about salary negotiation it's not
about being a bad person it's about
convincing that other party that they
have something special that you want to
be part of and for that reason it's okay
to take a little less money and you
would be willing to do that and that
it's important to you all right any
other questions on salary negotiation it
actually doesn't surprise yes go ahead
play well team mm-hmm could you
I talk a little bit more about that part
not just about celery how do I get a job
and haven't come on board but also i
show up better as a team player quit up
room as you called it what are some tips
sir oh yeah the the question is how do I
show up better as a team member how do i
i'm gonna i'm going to interpret a
little bit here is the question how do i
get credit for being a leader on the
team how do i get credit for my
accomplishments without sounding like
someone who's bragging is it are we
getting kind of close to the question
this is the flip side of what we're
talking about here and it's a really
interesting question the flip side to
the salary negotiation question is when
you get onto the team and you've said
while I deserve this much to be here is
how do I continue proving on a day to
day basis that I deserve to be here am I
going to get credit for the projects
that I'm part of and we know that one of
the major problems with women being
promoted and given achievement and
awards and technology is often that
they're just not given the opportunities
right they're not seen as people who are
stepping up interestingly enough there
often doing a lot of crazy hard work
behind the scenes I've heard a term
before which is an ugly one but it's
called office wife how many of you've
heard that term before yeah exactly the
person you always make sure that the
donuts are there the person who always
makes sure that the climate is
controlled because you're trying to make
sure that the people on the team are
comfortable and happy you are serving
your team right that is the job of
somebody who's part of a team is to be
part of it to serve that team and yet
sometimes it seems like the people that
are the loudest and the least team
player II are the ones that get the
credit right it's kind of frustrating
when that happens you're caught between
a rock and a hard place sometimes as a
woman in this situation and one of the
most effective tactics that I have ever
seen for showing people that you are
authoritative that you are there that
you're showing up and that you're
showing up well is to use a tactic I
have thought of as forcefully giving the
credit away to someone I saw this happen
when I saw a former co founder of mine
she was sitting at a table with several
different people who one of whom was a
little bit loud and taking a lot of the
credit and
one person who'd clearly done eighty
percent of the work soprano optimal team
right so twenty percent of the team does
eighty percent of the work right well
she was the twenty percent of the team
that had actually gotten it done and my
co-founder lean forward onto the table
and said I just want everybody here to
know that I think that Lisa did a
spectacular job getting all of the areas
of this project covered in time and I
think we need to give her a great deal
of credit for that she stood up to do it
stuck her fists down on the table just
like this lean forward and said I want
everyone here to acknowledge what an
amazing job she just did what did that
do for my co-founder who at that point
was on that team not a rhetorical
question what did it do yes Oh back here
okay yeah yeah so for one thing that's a
power position mm-hmm second it's
establishing leadership mm-hmm bye-bye
doing the recognition you're actually
showing that you have the authority to
make that recognition absolutely that's
exactly what that is what she did in
that moment was she expressed that she
had a huge amount of power personally
and that she was giving the credit away
and as a result she got all the credit
for being a strong leader in that moment
by strongly giving credit to someone
else and as a result she didn't
compromise her position as a team player
does that make sense that is one of the
most powerful moves I've seen someone
make I do upon occasion a little bit of
coaching behind the scenes for women who
are worried that they're not showing up
really strongly and I always offer that
as an option to them when you see that
your voice is not being heard give it
strongly to someone else because that
person is not going to take anything
from you all you've just gotten in that
case is more power for you and not less
for anyone else right the more strong
and giving personalities there are in a
team the better as long as you're
willing to work together is there any
way to fix that whole problem of someone
who is usually the noisiest and allow
dastaan a team's talking um they're not
not usually really is there honestly you
can pair those personalities away over
time sometimes they end up in manager
roles sometimes they end up out of the
company
there's not really a lot that people
have been able to do about it than I've
been able to see other than when I'm in
charge I fire assholes yeah but setting
as a team norm this giving credit to
others and appreciating each other out
loud mm-hmm um can turn some of those
noisy voices into cheerleaders among and
within the team um and talk a little bit
less about themselves and a little bit
more about the work and each other so
I've seen that transformation once it
was lovely it's beautiful to see there's
always a suggestion to and this isn't
just for the men in the room and for the
but for the women in the room also when
someone has the floor when someone on a
team is talking when someone is
presenting something and they are
looking for strong feedback it's very
common for a couple of members of the
team to to start participating in the
discussion in such a way that they are
not asking questions but instead are
sort of taking over the situation if
that makes sense where they're the ones
who start presenting on behalf of the
other person they want to clarify on
behalf of the person doing the
presentation they want to be the one who
gets the credit and so they will raise a
hand and say wait no here's a here's my
opinion of what needs to be happening
instead and it always masquerades that
way think instead before every one of us
opens our mouths when someone else
basically is getting the situation
handled when they're doing the
presentation when they're doing the
talking and make sure that you're not
trying to steal the spotlight from
anyone everybody gets their turn in the
spotlight everybody always will but let
questions be questions and let
suggestions remain on paper so that
you're not taking away from the person
who's clearly worked hard on what it is
that they've been doing I've seen that
happen a lot when women are in front of
audiences especially that are mixed or
often don't have a great deal of women
in them where they'll ask for questions
and instead what ends up happening
sometimes is they'll get pieces of their
time taken over by people who want to
clarify or provide their own content
work hard on making sure that you are
the one listening in cases like that
yeah I'm jumping into somebody yes
return the focus to that person ask them
a question as they want they only about
what person you know what the person
just said or not you're throwing this
boat like button exactly and if it
happens to many times sometimes you need
to take somebody aside and say I don't
know if you realize this but you raised
your hand four times and there was no
question right you know seven minutes
out of that 60 was you not them so that
often helps is just when you see someone
doing that most the time they don't know
that that's happening right they just
haven't realized that that's been the
case so you just take someone aside and
say I don't know if you've realized that
this is happening or not but this is a
different persons time right now and so
letting someone else have the credit is
a strong way of asserting your own power
in all of those cases and still staying
a team player does this make sense to
everybody wonderful all right so what
other questions do we have right now
yeah so we've talked a lot about you
know individual students and their
creators of salary etc but what can we
do to make take a place that is more
inviting to women that is a wonderful
question the thing that I always like to
say is the way that we pay women more
money is pay women more money I strongly
advocate the tactics that Marc Benioff
at Salesforce is taking right now where
he is openly doing salary analyses of
all of the people on his staff and
raising salaries for every woman every
person really to a commensurate level
with everyone else in their pay rate
because he's finding out that women have
not negotiated and men have in those
paper in in their salary ranges and what
he's doing is he's making it clear
inside the company as well let me think
about what that does culturally speaking
it means that if you are one of the
managers who has a team full of women
who are being paid less than the men on
your team all of a sudden you're sitting
there thinking to yourself I need to pay
more attention to this because my boss
is noticing the fact that I am
discriminating against women on my team
that is a culture of accountability
right there in an impressive one right
so you open it up and you say to
yourself what is my company doing
that i can fix we should be asking
ourselves that question whether with the
top of a company or were the people that
are turning the lights off at the end of
the day always be asking yourself what
you can be doing to make your team a
better place these are the people you
spend more time around than the people
you married don't you want to like them
you know at least as much as you
hopefully like your partner right we're
gonna spend 14 hours a day around these
people you should probably like them and
respect them and treat them well right
because you want to be treated and liked
and respected well yourself alright when
it comes to that question of equalizing
out salaries that's a really solid one
one of the other ones that I've seen is
the thing that I just brought up about
making sure that when everyone else is
asking questions you are also asking a
question instead of making statements or
taking over the discussion that's
probably the single biggest thing that
I've seen women get irritated with
because there's no defense against it
there's no defense against it except for
fixing it afterwards or finding some way
to carefully work it into the
conversation make sense yeah the other
thing that helps is making sure that
when the conversation turns to this
question of diversity and technology
that it is not one where only women are
in the audience this is actually a
pleasantly gender balanced discussion of
the problem right at the moment believe
it or not and there is no way that the
proportion of women in this room sorry
but this has got to be true is
reflective of the entire staff of
Microsoft right I work here too right so
and yet there are more men in this
audience than as usual for a discussion
of diversity and technology so I really
do salute you all for being part of the
conversation I really like men what
super big fan you know I work I work
around them all day long I was gonna go
into technology like if you don't like
men why would you go into tech I mean
they're gonna be ninety percent of the
humans you talk to so and I I recognize
that and so I I play rpgs and I hang out
most of my friends are men and I like
them just fine super big fan you know I
I get along with them really well and I
don't hate or have a problem with men I
think that really the the flaw in all of
this conversation is some kind of
assumption that men have like a deep
conspiracy I mean
I've had pizza with lots of dudes
there's no conspiracy happening there
all right so there's no conspiracy
happening it's just yeah I love that
look right there nope seriously no
there's no way there's a problem so if
the question is just one of how do we
take great intentions and transform them
into wonderful actions that are positive
and actually have an effect the positive
and actually have an effect portion of
this is make sure that you are paying
women equally make sure that if you were
on a team with women that you see them
getting at least as much credit as the
other people around them and if you are
part of the culture of Technology when I
say culture I'm talking about the whole
culture of tech whether or not this
means that you have a game of thrones
viewing party or you have any other
participation in kind of the bigger
culture of tech games and the industry
and space robots and any part of it you
make sure that the voices of all of the
people in that room are being heard and
I do not just mean women in this case I
also mean people who do not identify as
male or female anyone who may exist
outside that traditional gender binary I
don't know about you but I basically
don't carry that much what gender
somebody is I care whether or not they
make good cookies I care what they care
about arrow because that whole Felicity
thing is just awesome right I'm a nerd
and I like talking to nerds I don't
worry as much about the gender until
someone makes me have to care about it
and then I get resentful of that I don't
want to care I don't have to care about
the fact of what I'm wearing before I
walk into the game store when I know
that 30 of the 40 people in there are
going to be people that work at the same
tech company i do right let's not
pretend that the the larger kind of nerd
and geek culture and technology and
software and gaming isn't all
interconnected with one another that
these conversations that we have in in
cosplay and in video gaming and in chess
and in robots and in logistics and where
we buy and sell our books don't all have
something to do with one another be a
good participant in this larger
community because you're stuck here
you're not going to cease liking comic
books I promise you I've tried there's
no way to give them up I have tried and
there's you know the sooner or later
they're just going to migrate to your
you know your mobile devices said I was
going to say iPad I feel like that
little tasteless right at the moment
sooner or later they're going to show up
on your mobile device but you can't give
them up right I can't give up cosplay I
can't do it and this is a larger
community we're part of what are some of
the communities that you're part of nerd
communities throw them up magic magic
your way nerdier yeah I feel like that
as a bee Club get out all right come on
give me some more what's that maker kill
Oh hila okay so glow forward you seen
the laser desktop cutter oh yeah that's
super cool all right what else you go
curse what's that that goes Lego
Mindstorms so cold what else we part out
citizen science initiatives she's cooler
than everybody is what I'll see you part
of steampunk sure absolutely all of
these cultures are things that we enjoy
that we take part in and that we bring
to who we are in our work there's a
bigger problem here I really think then
quote ladies in tech the bigger problem
is one of inclusiveness and community
and not feeling like because we
ourselves were excluded once I certainly
was that we now have the right to
exclude others instead that needs to
transform into a responsibility to
include others yes good the last topic I
can talk about on the book is this the
process of making this whole thing
happen has been one hellacious one
behind the scenes and at the same time a
very rewarding one up front because it's
really started to be part of the
mainstream discussion there's a lot of
frustration and anger I think in the
community of people working to solve
this problem and sometimes it spills
over into anger at well-meaning people
who are just learning about the problem
when you get people who ask questions
about how to help in issues of diversity
and technology and they get told to
educate your damn self right I also get
frustrated every once in a while when
someone says to me on Twitter tell me
about why you care about the women and
technology issue I would love to know
more about diversity in tech and it's
Twitter so clearly I don't think before
i post
and ice I might you know if I'm in a
particularly bad mood snap off something
along the lines of gee if only there was
a way for you to find that information
out yourself rather than expecting to
take up a substantial portion of my day
teaching it to you there's a difference
between the internet like that and
sometimes that can be a little more
hostile climate and thoughtfully
reasonably asking questions of the
people that are around you maybe who
have different identities than you do so
here's the last portion of what I want
to talk with you about today which is
how do we educate ourselves about this
problem in such a way that we are not
putting a burden on the people who are
already experiencing the problem there's
a lot of great examples from what I've
done so I'm gonna give you I like to
think of the definition of awesomeness
is being willing to learn when you have
made a terrible mistake to not make it
again so I'm gonna be awesome right now
I i recently had a situation where i had
someone very angry at me because I said
something that I didn't know was
inappropriate and what happened I'm you
know what I'm gonna I'm gonna back a
little bit off of that one instead give
a different example of one them because
that one's a little too sensitive and
still kind of ongoing so instead I'll
give you an example of this one I also
spies teach college classes I teach
introduction to programming stuff like
that information technology to
disadvantaged adults and I had a student
recently who was a woman of color um
sometime over the last year or so and
she was she was a nerd she was awkward
she was exactly like me at the time she
was very frustrated and very angry about
what she saw at very rightly so as a lot
of the in justices facing especially
women of color and technology and I
didn't know how to help her I didn't
know if it was my job to help her and
what I did was I went and asked to
spectacular women developers I know both
women of color and said to them I'm in a
situation where I can help and mentor a
young woman who is frustrated and angry
and I would love to help her succeed and
and have her know that there's a way to
solve these problems without having the
people around you run away from you
because they're afraid of how angry you
are and I said clearly there is no way
that I'm going to sit there and tell a
woman of color to be less angry
because that's dumb and it's it buys
into a stereotype but I want to help her
succeed and help her know some of the
things I needed to know about other
people to get to wear my where I'm at
and I told them both here's my plan to
do what I need to do will you tell me if
you have the opportunity to if I'm
correct on these points and let me know
if there's anything that I can do better
or maybe offer me some resources that
might have helped you the difference
between going to people and saying
educate me about the problems that you
face because I feel like learning about
it about it right now and what I did was
this I tried to come up with a solution
on my own and I asked for critique
showing that i would put the time in to
try to fix the problem when you show
that you're willing to put the time and
to fix the problem somebody else who
cares about that problem is way more
likely to help you all right does it
make sense why I would approach that
problem that way the reason I did that
this time is because previously I
screwed it up I have screwed that
problem up before I've gone to someone
and said I don't know how to help this
person what's all this stuff you do
educate me about your world and they're
like out of time for that so instead
this time I went in googled and I found
resources in the area and something that
I could offer this young woman to help
her and I asked for critique on my own
efforts instead of someone else's day
that's the best solution that i can
offer you for if you yourself want to
learn about a problem a very serious
problem right now is the issue of the
transgender community in technology how
they're being treated how people who are
transgender and tech do not have the
same opportunities and face profound
discrimination at every level in
technology in gaming in the the larger
culture okay and I'm not always perfect
as an ally there but I'm trying and I'm
learning and I screw up all the time be
willing to accept that people who have
been discriminated against their entire
life sometimes can't always be perfect
either just because you're right doesn't
necessarily make you perfect all right I
do my best to be a good Ally to people
who have different identities than I do
and I'm grateful for the men that I know
who have been wonderful allies to me the
last piece of this is when you have the
opportunity to help someone to make the
community a better
place please do so the greatest
mentorship that I've ever received to be
frank almost all the mentorship I've
ever received is from older rich
straight white sis males I'm presuming
hard on the straight and the cysts I
don't know for sure glad I don't but
these are these are the men who helped
me because they're the ones who've
gotten to the places that I want to go
to there aren't enough women there yet
to help me and teach me what I need to
learn sometimes they're not perfect
either and they come to me and say how
can I be better and I put my time in
helping them right I want to live in a
in a technological world where I can
take joy and what I create rather than
experience pain of being excluded from
something that I love I've had that a
lot in my life I think we've all
experienced the exclusion from something
that we love I don't like that much I'd
rather live in a world where I get to
participate in anything that I want to
and people joyfully welcomed me into a
collective instead of one where they
keep me out based on what I look like
that is a stupid ass reason to keep
somebody out of aggro of a group of
really awesome gamers right or one
killer open source project I want to get
into a world where I never again have to
tell my students my female students that
they need to use a gender neutral name &amp;amp;
avatar to get their answers on stack
overflow and I still have to do that
let's get to that place first all right
any last questions that any of you have
go ahead so what was that's what
question partial I got a suggestion you
sure to appoint a lot the problem you to
community of those gamers you know what
subsonic acknowledge what for example to
take me while every books right what I'm
here but also I program for cooking and
carson john tonight i'm really parking
to snow the comedian get them further
reason the movie part and fill out a lot
of frustration will be coming that well
being part of in your culture doesn't
necessarily translate to be
that's what people what they are doing
all those things being naughty and so on
but maybe they're not really good I
might not understand the question what's
the question is that this equation for
their community and being actually being
able to do the walk mm-hmm except only
for mature that was a lot of frustration
but what people feel that they are part
of the immunity and everything and yet
maybe they're not good at the actual
technical part I'm not too worried about
you people here yeah I'm not really
worried about the I'm talking about the
inter lap between the culture of
technology and actual technologists so
if you're a nerd and yet you don't code
this I'm not talking to you right now
I'm talking to technologists who are
part of the overarching culture there my
not the world that might not be always I
know were some more questions I think
anybody else I think they want me to
sign a couple of books back here I am so
glad to have had the opportunity to be
here in front of you today thank you so
much for your attention any of you that
want to talk with me further please just
let me know come on up and have a chat I
am really looking forward to it thank
you so much for your kind attention
