hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
alright welcome everyone my name is on
the res monroy I'm a researcher hidden
Microsoft and i have the pleasure to
introduce nancy beam she's a principal
researcher in Microsoft Research New
England in Boston where we sure I was
there for a year so we worked together
there she's also a visiting professor at
the MIT Department for comparative Media
Studies she was formerly a professor at
the Kansas State Kansas University not
consistent and so she moved to Microsoft
what three years ago now right as we
were lucky to have her join microsoft
research and so she's been writing about
the internet for many many years
actually i was looking at your
publication record and I saw a paper in
1993 talking about soap operas and
usenet how people use you know
discussion groups back then to talk
about so a person so I was like well I
was in Middle School so impressive like
people were already like thinking about
these issues and I'm sure you know one
of the things that I really admire about
Nancy is the fact that she was one of
the earliest scholars thinking about the
implications of technology especially
the Internet in society and I think
maybe when you were starting people
where they had the internet what is that
and today obviously you know this
company is built around that and tons of
people interested in this time I really
admire her commitment to to this
particular topic and you know today you
see that she's well recognized by
everyone as one of the most prominent
scholars in this field so we are further
ado I have the pleasure to introduce
Nancy thank you and thanks for showing
up either so many more of you than I
feared it's funny that you said that in
introducing me because it is true that
when i first started giving papers at
academic conferences about the internet
you'd have like 15 minutes at a
communication conference to give your
whole paper and i would literally spend
this first seven explaining the concept
that computers could be used to talk to
other computers and that there were
humans actually doing this and it blew
people's minds it was like 91 92 they
had it was
it was fun times I'll tell you that I'll
tell you that so I just heard you saying
oh the Internet has changed so much and
it has and that's that's what I want too
that's what I want to talk about um so I
wanted to start by asking how many of
you saw this op-ed in the New York Times
a few weeks ago fear of you okay this is
a sherry Turkle out that and I say
sherry Turkle is coming to speak soon
and I to three weeks or two three months
she's gonna be I the date was up there
she's going to be giving the talk this
talk sherry has also been studying the
internet for a very very long time and
she has come to take the position that I
think a lot of people identify with
which is uh oh the internet is ruining
everything our conversations are going
to hell although in this case she's not
particularly as concerned with the
Internet as she is with cell phones and
what cell phones are doing to our
conversations and I'll get back to that
in a minute but I wanted to highlight
this article because it raised a lot of
discussion and a lot of people really
identified with the concerns that she
raises about what's happening to our
conversations are we able to really pay
attention to one another are we able to
experience empathy in the same ways I
disagree with her conclusions about cell
phones I agree wholeheartedly with her
conclusions about the value of
conversation of course it really ought
to be titled stop googling let's Bing so
I want us to think about interpersonal
communication which is the field that I
come out of in the stance that I
approach all of this from so
interpersonal communication is one of
those things that's kind of invisible
and yet obviously completely germane to
our daily lives it's those little
moments where we're talking to each
other where we're communicating with
each other one-on-one maybe there's a
few of us maybe we're just bumping into
each other in the hall maybe we're doing
that thing that I think Turkle and many
others mythologize where we're looking
deep into one another's eyes and having
a communion of the souls paying full
attention with our whole selves once in
a while most of the time it's not very
special it's just the ordinary stuff of
everyday life you know hey did you get
milk oh hey have you seen the stapler Oh
which staples do you like these work you
know I think the slinger line works
better than the book whatever you know
this the little things but they add up
and they add up in a way that forms our
personal relationships our closest our
dearest our most intimate our arch
enemies all of them are acquaintances
all of that it adds up through the
secretion of these little moments and
those little moments as they accrete
into relationships also accrete into
social norms into a sense of this is how
we as a society do things right we value
these ways of treating people we value
these kinds of relationships we value
these connections with other people and
these ways of doing it so those social
norms are really the underlying fabric
of everyday communication of everyday
relationships and of most social
behavior so what happens when the
internet comes along is that they're all
kind of thrown out of whack and not just
the internet but mobile phones mobile
technology in general because social
norms depend on knowing how to
categorize things what belongs where
because you treat things differently
depending on which kind of thing it is
and if the boundaries have been
disrupted then you don't know anymore
what's what so new technologies provoke
us because they blur the boundaries
we've taken for granted and in the book
I identify a number of the boundaries
that get blurred and what happens when
these boundaries get blurred is that we
have to rethink okay well how should we
be doing things we could take it all for
granted when it was invisible but when a
new technology comes along suddenly it's
visible somebody's walking around with a
thing in front of their face it's hard
to not notice that it's there right so
then we have to say oh we didn't walk
around with things in front of our faces
before that was not a thing we did what
does it mean that we do that now is that
okay right so we have to rethink these
norms and that's where the tensions come
up so I think it's helpful to just get
really concrete and none of this is
going to be news to any of you but I
think it's nonetheless helpful to get
concrete about well what are these
boundaries that are getting blurred
time and space the collapse of time and
space is obviously a huge one you go
back to the very very earliest
communication technologies pretty much
the oldest one is some bone scratchings
which they think were used to account
for sort of how many grains did you get
out of this bushel or whatnot it was
meant to transcend time and to transcend
space to allow messages to be conveyed
to a place other than where they were
spoken and until the Telegraph that
couldn't happen in real time and I love
these early as the USA is only a few
minutes why'd you can telephone all over
the world they had to advertise these
things and not that long ago the idea
that you could in fact transcend space
instantaneously with modern technology
and I think it's useful to ghent ooh see
these things because this is not that
long ago right this is not like you know
ancient Mesopotamia this is the 20th
century so that collapse of time in
space also raises issues about our body
and our self is our self always in our
body can our self be someplace else but
our body be here and this is one of the
big complaints about cell phone use
right you're not really here you're
there wherever there is alright and many
of us have been in this situation right
where you're talking to somebody and
they're not hearing anything that you're
saying because there may be texting with
somebody else and this would be a fun
point to make a point about teenagers
except for that the fact of the matter
is that parents are doing it more than
teenagers are so I'm not going to go
there and I know because I've got
teenagers and I'm the bad one and I also
know because research so when you have
body and self in the same time in place
then you can assume that people are
accountable for their behavior right
because it was that body and they did it
and as soon as they get separated it
gets a little bit complicated especially
when we can have different identities in
different places all over the internet
so we can be on linkedin being mr.
professional guy who's got lots of
contacts who highly recommend me and we
can be over on Facebook being chatty
person who just goes on and on and on
about the kids and favorite recipes or
biking biking to work every day or we
can be on Twitter secretly trolling and
attacking people for expressing their
opinions and being really mean and rude
and getting out it and maybe fired one
day we can have a lot of different and
mean what we can be over on pinterest
collecting all our gardening things
right oh I just love this bouquet of
flowers arrangement so which one is the
real one when they start contradicting
each other who's accountable how do we
decide where the boundaries are who gets
to be do what who gets blamed who's just
having fun oh and I went too far this I
think is one of the most challenging
boundaries is that on the one hand we
get so much control with these
technologies and on the other hand we
get so controlled by them right so on
the one hand i can tell you i'm running
late at the last minute i can find out
where my kid is all the time there's
nothing more infuriating than when
people you like to surveil turn off
their cell phone or they run out of
battery and you feel like wait I don't
get to control I've lost control you
know you're out somewhere in the world
and I don't know exactly where and I
can't tell you to come back or whatever
but on the other hand by the same token
we're being seen all the time as well
and we're constantly accountable to
others for our whereabouts and our
activities and that can be very
constraining and of course in the
context of big data and surveillance and
the kinds of scales at which data is
being collected about us this is really
transformed even since the first edition
of this book a few years ago the
boundary between interpersonal and mass
communication gets blurred so that what
used to be maybe two friends chatting
can suddenly become an international
phenomenon or a video log made for a few
friends to watch can be
come really widely viewed or a personal
message can become the front page news
paper sensation right so there's a lot
of ways in which the boundaries between
this used to be one to one and this used
to be a mass message delivered to large
groups is collapsed and then finally the
boundary between public and private is
very very skewed in this environment and
it's scoot in ways I think so profound
that I'm not even sure that privacy even
works as a concept to begin to hold all
the things that we want it to hold and
to do all the work that we want it to do
I think that what's visible and what's
invisible is has just been strained to
its limits and we probably need some
some really profound rethinking of the
very concept of public and private so
ultimately what all of this means is
that we're left with the situation where
it's not really clear what's real what's
real and what's not real the punch line
here is here you are I've been all over
the internet looking for you the idea
that we might go online right and yet
internet of things right my husband
likes it turn the blender on and off
with his cell phone what's real and
what's not my son got a lot of credit on
Facebook for having a dad who connected
his blender to the Internet of Things so
against this backdrop it makes a lot of
sense that we would be worried about
what is all this technology doing to our
relationships
so maybe I'll just stop for a second and
ask you guys like what are your concerns
what do you sort of do you guys feel it
ambivalence about these technologies and
what they're doing yeah types of apps
have changed the way that people date
and like the social norms that people
accept of what's appropriate what's not
appropriate and expectations yeah
expectations are dating definitely
changing yeah fine then we're at least
my personal experiences that you make a
lot of mistakes because how particular
type of communication how effective it
can be is kind of hit or miss so you
know early days of email people thought
oh this is great and then there's so
many misunderstandings because people
didn't realize the limitations of the
media and what wasn't there so we have
natural unmediated communications that
we grow up with and our brains are kind
of tuned to and then there's all these
new ones and it takes a while to figure
out what you can and can't do with one
particular thing a lot of mistakes good
yeah so figuring out what are the norms
for using this medium appropriately and
I'll get back to that meditation I see
my teenage kids on there constantly on
their phones and I'm concerned twofold
what is I'm afraid that they won't be
able to communicate with other people
outside of text messaging you know can
they actually argue something can they
put you know some logic behind what
they're trying to say I mean on the
other hand I see some kind of obsession
with it it's like they can't be away
from it it's always about oh look what
somebody snapchatted it looks up with
somebody you know put out there and
they're always connected and they feel
that if they're not next to it they're
missing out on something whereas in the
past you know you'd be missing out if
you boring with other people but now you
even seen out if you're not next to your
phone classic there yeah classic concern
that a lot of people have an often
pointed at children or teenagers yeah
another hand oh I sure this did that
same problem by teenagers as well at the
same time there's also a commonality
that I can bring to
as well a lot of instances you might see
you know hey we saw this interesting
thing at school but in old days you
couldn't look at who's in a textbook for
now they say look at this and you can
then to have a discussion around that
thing it says it does open up some doors
of communication network harder to come
by as well yes yes and I think that's
and and I love this back and forth
because I think this is exactly the
tension right is on the one hand oh
there's this thing that might be
happening that might be really bad we
might be being taken further from one
another it might be impairing our
ability to really connect with one
another on the other hand wait it might
be a resource for connecting it might be
an at enabling bringing new things into
our interactions or it might be offering
common ground where there wasn't common
ground addresses yeah father it's wrong
all right so in the olden times x of
units or you know that I used to be for
some used to be compartmentalized okay
wait i just have to say i love that
we're saying olden times usenet and
fight on it okay yes it was
compartmental it is simple you talk
here's a bullet up there so you can
connect up feelin it's pouring why
should those people are going to see
able to say they're right and the second
thing is being Emeril so it's got some
but we didn't quite do it but make sure
disappears how is everything is saved
everything is archived somewhere
concerns for it yes yes so these these
concerns i would say are about collapse
context the idea that you can see what
you should have said to these people
over here now they're going to see it
over there and and the persistence and
searchability yeah so i'm wondering what
my Kita's dewey and with whom and what
are the communications when he's in
front of a screen all day yeah but then
i realized that when I was his age I was
out with my friends interacting in a
different medium but my parents had no
idea what I was doing or saying or even
where I was at least with my kid I
physically know where he is and and that
he's not in any
physical danger and I don't have to you
know make sure he's home in time for
dinner because he's right there and
that's the control controlled problem
right there right is I don't have
control I don't know what my kids doing
but I know where he is yeah I have to
say I on the plus side he to have one
eye one child who's very reserved and I
find it's actually helped her social
life because it's much easier for her to
text and quick things and so she
actually has more social interaction but
there is an addictive quality that
particularly the other one has then just
scares me but I recently saw a cartoon
or something that had you know a bunch
of people sitting around you know on
their phones and then next to it a
picture of people on a subway car
everyone introduced in the newspaper
yeah you know I don't know if it's
really yeah you know that there's some
things that really aren't part a specs
that aren't new right you guys couldn't
be better plants and this is a that's
perfect i'm going to stop right here
because that's that's just exactly where
i want to go next is that we tend to
think of this as this is a thing that
this new technology is doing to us right
and we're these helpless victims of this
new technology that's come along and is
damaging our children or is addictive
and taking our power away from us and
yet at the same time these are in fact
concerns have been raised about almost
every technology and i have some amazing
examples in a second um it's a two-way
street right these technologies are
taken up in very different ways in
different cultures they arise out of
cultures I mean we know that being at
Microsoft right Microsoft came out of a
very particular time in place and the
products that were created we're not
like mana from heaven totem arising
fully formed it took people right
embedded in social situations to create
these things and they bear the legacies
of that and they change in response to
how people use them so I want to focus
on three particular fears which I think
have gotten addressed here one being are
our interactions worse do we no longer
is it harder to have conversations now
that's a concern that sherry Turkle
raises you've just raised this about
young people are our relationships
damaged are we not are we having
inferior relationships were less able to
connect and feel close to others and
finally are we substituting some kind of
virtual interaction for a real
interaction are we substituting having
our phone for being with other people
and these are concerns that as Andre
said I started looking at these things
in nineteen ninety people weren't
talking about him so much then but by 94
when AOL merged with the rest of the
internet and suddenly the public was
online I did a study its I talked about
it in the book of letters to Ann Landers
and dear abby and when they start
showing up in the late in the mid-1990s
it's all oh it's so fun it's so fun
there's some great cuts in there so
let's start with this question of
quality are they are the interactions
worse right so this is a study I love
forty percent of the messages are
pointless babble well how do you
determine that forty percent of Twitter
is pointless babble you create a
category called pointless Babylon
anything you don't see the point of you
put it in their totem but very old
concern here we have it in 1927 about
telephones hold the line a minute dear
i'm trying to think what i have on my
mind 1927 and it it goes back even
further than that right on it goes back
even further than that this is what
socrates had to say about the alphabet
he's quoting in egypt it's play-doh
quoting socrates quoting an Egyptian
goddess so make of it what you will but
this discovery of yours will create
forgetfulness the discovery is the
alphabet will create forgetfulness and
the listeners souls because they will
not use their memories they will trust
to the external written characters and
not remember of themselves the specific
which you have discovered is an aid not
to memory but to reminiscence and you
give your disciples not truth but only
the semblance of truth they will be
heroes of many things and will have
learned nothing they will appear to be
on mission
and will generally know nothing they
will be tiresome company having the show
of wisdom without the reality that
doesn't sound anything like people
things people say now does it I'll let
y'all to finish taking your pictures
before I go is it going is it if you
gotta love this I mean this is like 350
BCE right and you see it all there you
see it's going to appear to be reality
but it's not really reality people are
going to be tiresome this technology's
damaging our relationships and it seems
so absurd now to imagine seeing the
alphabet and writing is that kind of
threat but it was and one can argue
actually it did damage orality is that
where you're going with that she
memorized I'm terrible at that stuff
thank goodness what we filled it up with
so much more varied stuff but yes this
is true we had lost ways of memory we
have lost ways of remembering now that
may or may not be a problem but it was a
realistic concern right whether or not
we've all become tiresome company who
know nothing that may be an
extrapolation so I got really interested
in this question of what is what do
people think about the quality of their
communication i did a study with
undergrads at the University of Kansas a
large Midwestern university as we call
it in social science research literature
and I asked them in general how do you
feel about communicating face to face or
on the phone or on the internet and they
wrote things like Oh face to face is
best because I can he see them and I can
hear them and the telephone is next
because at least I can hear their tone
of voice and the internet is worse
because it's really hard to read people
and I and I don't have a sense of their
their feelings or anything like that and
it came out like it was a script like
these people had all had this drilled
into them in grade school or something
although they hadn't right so you think
wow that sounds really sincere I also
asked them to think of the most recent
conversation that they had had and they
got different versions of
survey that manipulated whether they
were asked to remember one face to face
or online or on the phone and whether it
was with a friend or a family member and
acquaintances or a romantic partner and
then I had them evaluate the quality of
that particular conversation so you
would think from this whole you know oh
face to face is so awesome and then the
phone is okay and then face the Internet
is the worst you might end up with
something like this right where oh this
is perfection face to face is here and
phone is there and oh that poor little
internet is merely mediocre this would
be generous but what it actually looked
like was not like this what actually
looked like is this so again this is a
perfect conversation face to face came
in at 3.94 phone call at 3.99 and the
internet 3.75 which is to say first of
all the phone was the best and
statistically the phone was different
from the other two but the other two
were not different from one another
actually our pinky talk how the fact
that face-to-face computer takes more
effort or a range cuz then we have to
travel oh no what no yeah I mean with
all that this is is think of the most
recent voluntary face-to-face
conversation you had okay so it's the
most recent one so um so what you see
here is this is actually a pretty common
finding that the phone the use of the
phone is really related to intimacy the
cliff you think about it you probably
have voice calls with very few people on
any regular basis there's work from
telenor the norwegian telecom company
showing that the most people have boys
phone calls with five or fewer people
regularly so those are the people that
were really close to the Internet yeah
it was statistically not as awesome as
the phone but it was still pretty darn
high quality conversation um but this
suggests that maybe we're romanticizing
face to face a little bit yeah this is
say about equality of me
it may be highly correlated to why they
use phone so you mentioned that usually
people use phone calls to talk to close
friends and it it doesn't it doesn't
count for the relationship it does
control for relationship what kind of
relationship because we had four and in
fact what we found is that by far the
best predictor of low quality
conversations this is my advice to you
if you want to ensure only having high
quality conversations do not talk to
acquaintances that's by far the best
predictor of how good your conversation
is it matters who you're talking to
every that's all that matters in a lot
of ways is who are you talking to right
the medium we work through and I'll
order to say that about that in a minute
okay so let's talk about the quality of
relationships are we having damaged
relationships of the relationships not
as good if we're dating online is that
messing up romance well that's kind of a
whole other kettle of fish because is
somebody you met online capable of being
as good a partner as somebody you met
face-to-face or is it is it authentic is
it inadequate is it somehow impoverished
so again if we go back to thinking about
those kansas kids and their those
relationships that they had
conversations and i also asked them in
this relationship what percentage of
your communication would you say you do
in each of these three media so that you
could sort of say well this person talks
on the phone with this person a lot more
than they see them face to face and this
relationship is much more face-to-face
than it is internet and so on and what
we found there and I don't want to get
lost in the numbers but the main thing
that we find is that when you look at
relational satisfaction and relational
closeness all of the correlations with
face-to-face telephone and Internet are
all positive and i'm giving you the
examples from my own research but the
book has a lot of other studies that
support these same kinds of perspectives
so you don't see that face-to-face and
telephone are positively associated with
satisfaction and closeness but the
internet is not
you see that the internet is also
positively related and of course these
are people they chose to have a
conversation with it was a voluntary
conversation right and they're not
statistically different I also did some
research on the website last.fm which is
like a social network for music
listening and that that had the nice
quality that when you loaded it your
friends showed up in random order so I
did I worked with the people on the site
to do a survey and people would bring up
their profile they take the first friend
and they would fill out a big survey
about this friend so how did they did
they know each other face to face how
far away did they live did they have an
age difference those kinds of questions
and then also how many different ways
did they communicate and in a 18 item
scale that measured how close they were
and what we found was that for any of
you stats geeks it was a multiple
regression analysis and what we found
was that the factor that erased all of
the other variables and that accounted
for sixty-five percent of the difference
in quality of relationship was how many
media they used to communicate so what
I'm saying is each medium they used they
got a quarter point closer on this
relational development scale and each
one of those media contributed to
closeness so rather than seeing that one
is less associated with closeness or
another is more what you see is that the
closer you get to somebody the more ways
you communicate and then you can think
about the phone right and oh yeah but
certainly surely all this texting these
texting relationships cannot be good
this calling people on the phone cannot
be good work she'd be sitting in the
park chilling out and instead we have to
be in communication I did another survey
at Kansas where we surveyed people about
the person that they use their phone
with
most their mobile phone with most and
this is a map showing what we found and
I won't go into a whole lot of details
but what I want to summarize for you is
that using the phone together created
expectations that they would use the
phone to maintain the relationship if
they never use the phone together we
didn't expect they wouldn't expect each
other to but the fact of using the phone
creates an expectation that you're going
to keep using the phone to communicate
with each other and on the one hand this
creates a sense of interdependence we
rely on one another we're connected to
one another and that increases the
satisfaction and the relationship like
the phone brings us closer because we
were more dependent on one another but
at the same time it also creates a sense
of over dependence and of being trapped
which makes us less satisfied with our
relationship so they're both happening
at the same time we're simultaneously
feeling closer to our friends because of
our phone relationship and feeling
trapped and less satisfied I think
that's really the crux of the matter is
that it's both this is the sherry Turkle
concern what about using the phone
together you're with somebody and you're
on the phone that can't be good these
are all Flickr Creative Commons licensed
images by the way um so another study
that we did last year this was published
we asked people we we searched the
literature and newspapers and remember a
couple years ago there was that there
was a huge Rao about somebody talking on
the phone while buying something at a
store in England and it was all over the
Internet you know I think that there was
a video and the cashier went crazy and
she's right it's an injustice it's
horrible um one of those viral things so
what we did was we collected a list of
norms about cell phones like you know
don't cuss when you're out in public on
your phone or when you're having a
conversation with somebody don't look at
your phone those kinds of things we came
up with a list of them and we gave them
two pairs and we said d on a scale of
one to five do you think this is a rule
in your peer group on a scale of one to
five how much do you agree that this
ought to be a rule
how much do you follow these rules when
you're with your partner and how much
does your partner follow these rules one
there with you so it's and then we had
the whole quality of relationship scales
so the idea is that you can sort of see
well does this mean that the people who
don't follow the rules have bad
relationships like we always hear all
the time this is what people are always
telling us I was called on the call-in
radio incredibly naive and ignorant for
thinking that in restaurants not
everybody is on their phones all the
time I actually started thinking
everybody's always on their phones and
restaurants actually that's not really
true yes it is your Sony grown you're so
naive right I started looking in
restaurants like in any given moment
there's like one table where there's a
couple of people on the phone and that
table moves around right but bending
moment most people are not on their
phones but these guys both are which
they found entertaining enough to
photograph so what we found was that
following the social norms had
absolutely no relationship to the
quality of that relationship absolutely
none what did affect relational quality
was if if was following the norms that
you personally held dear so to
oversimplify that might be like if
you're the kind of person who doesn't
really think it's important to have a
lot of eye contact in conversation
because you know your intimate and you
don't really need to prove it and your
partner is also that way you're fine but
if you're not if you're that way and
your partner isn't if you're not looking
me in the eye you don't love me norm
then you've got a clash right so what
we're set what this shows is being
similar to one another having the same
norms is more important but also it's
following the norms yourself that
matters it's not just having your
partner follow them it's you yourself
following them it's messier than that
but that's the short version i'll give
you last concern
are we substituting fake relationships
for real relationships are we
substituting mediated relationships for
face-to-face relationships as the woman
over there said with the photo of people
on the train this is a really old
concern right this is I think 1954 I
think this one is so you have the woman
daydreaming of the romantic dinner while
sure husband keeps his nose in the paper
my 15 year old said yesterday I was
teasing my 15 year old I said hey let's
spend some quality time and have a
conversation you know the kind we used
to have before cellphones ruined our
relationships and he said Oh mom
cellphones didn't ruin our relationships
you would have just been looking at the
paper okay so that last.fm study where I
asked everybody how many ways do you
communicate with each other is to the
best of my knowledge still the only
study that has actually started with the
relationship and said how many ways do
you communicate and how does that affect
how close you are and again I don't want
you to get lost in the weeds of this
table I just want to show you these are
all the different media that we asked
them about and their correlations with
one another and the main point here is
that there's no negative signs all using
any one medium makes you more likely to
use another medium so face-to-face
communicating face-to-face is positively
related to all of the other means of
communicating except for communicating
via last.fm so there you go this is a
phenomenon called media multiplex it II
that the closer you are the more media
you use to communicate so I think that's
really important right because it means
we're talking additive here we're not
talking substitution and when we hear
fears like oh no they're texting they
can't have conversations we're
substituting Facebook for real
friendship we're doing a grave injustice
to our understanding of ourselves
because in fact we're doing both okay so
what I take from this
is the conventional wisdom and research
disagree and which side do we want to be
on we're all for research right so what
I've been covering comes out of my own
research which I wanted to highlight in
part because i am in house and it might
be useful to some of you to know well
what kind of research skills do i bring
but the book covers a very wide range of
research from the last 20 30 years that
covers covers these things and by and
large most of these assumptions that
people have about harm do not hold up
very well just as they haven't held up
but especially well for prior media that
said I'm not one of those people who
says technology is fantastic it solves
all our problems it's great rah rah rah
it does come with complications it does
disrupt norms it does make patterns that
were taken for granted questionable and
create new patterns that we might find
questionable there's huge questions of
etiquette that we have not begun to
resolve of how to be a polite and civil
person with your devices when other
people are around or how to behave
through these technologies in ways that
are civil and polite and we've seen a
lot of I don't know if you guys saw the
essay going around the other day by a
umair hake saying twitter is dying and
it's because of abuse it's because we've
built all these technologies and
nobody's paid attention to treating one
another nicely and ensuring that we
treat one another nicely a perspective
but a valid perspective in the sense
that there is a lot of abuse there is a
lot of meanness there is a lot of
nastiness there are a lot of problems
that arise around these technologies so
etiquette is one set of these runs the
pressure to use them when you want to be
free of them is certainly so that I take
the point about feeling anxious when
you're not near your phone I wouldn't
want to say it's only true of youth
because I certainly see a lot of adults
on my Facebook and Twitter going oh
that's the house without my phone today
I'm always sort of relieved when I find
I left the phone without my
like a day free from pressure i couldn't
i left my phone at home that pressure is
is very very real and is a problem right
and then you get into these questions of
data collection that I feel personally
very concerned about the fact that so
much of our social interaction has
shifted onto media that are privately
owned or that are publicly held but that
our corporate for-profit corporations
and their mining our personal
interactions in order to maximize profit
and to sell us stuff which i think is a
very very problematic inflation of
interpersonal connection and the
sacredness of human connection and
capitalism and selling and just because
we can get the data we should kind of
thinking that I would hope that we as a
company could think more about that and
have more to say about it but that said
despite the complications despite the
concerns that are raised the company
here is mixed but sociable whatever the
internet is doing whatever these
technologies are doing they are not
making us less social I think they've
research from the last 20 30 years has
consistently in case after case this is
not to say there are no counter examples
right there are people who will argue
this some of us might say some of their
data is somewhat cherry-picked um some
of us might quibble with the methods but
by and large the body of research as the
whole suggests that people are not
getting less social because of these
technologies they're getting more social
because of these technologies so what to
do about this I thought I'd finish up
with just some some some recommendations
about what do you do with this kind of
information and the first thing is think
about that cell phone study showing that
if you are not following your own norms
in the relationship then you're less
satisfied with the relationship one way
we create good relationships is by being
clear on what are the standards that i
have for technology use
in this relationship both in terms of in
my communication with this person
through technology but also in terms of
in my use of technology when this person
is around what are the standards that I
value and am I living up to them because
we always tend to seem to start with
you're doing it wrong especially if you
are a teenager we love pointing our
fingers at teenagers and the research
consistently shows that teenagers are
way less bad than grown-ups on almost
all of this stuff right as much as
grown-ups blamed it's sort of like
teenagers are this mirror where we look
in them and we see all the things we
don't like about ourselves and blame
them so are we living up to our own
standards this is one that we hardly
ever do because we don't actually have a
whole lot of conversations about our
relationships in general with our
partners but I recommend that people
have explicit conversations about how do
I feel about your you the way you use
the phone how do you want me to use the
phone do you like it when I call you you
were saying you know it's hard to know
which medium to use people are different
right sometimes it really helps just to
say you know are you a phone person or
would you rather text do you want me to
email do you want me to call what works
for you right because people do have
very different preferences and when
we're not clear on those differences we
start blaming them for things that they
did that were maybe that was what worked
best for them right I've got a colleague
who's all about long emails right and
I'm all about your down the hall just
talk to me right and that causes a lot
of conflict but then you can have those
explicit conversations and at least you
learn that the problem is not that it's
it's not a problem between you it's a
mismatch right it's a mismatch not a
dislike but it that way given that these
are concerns that have come up with
technology after technology after
technology as somebody who is very
concerned with people having high
quality relationships and holding on to
that desire that we have to have that
kind of personal connection with other
people and having consistently found in
the research that
new technologies are not actually
destroying our relationships I would say
hey if we're really concerned about our
relationships let's think about what are
the underlying structures what are the
underlying causes that are causing
relational conflict right and sometimes
it's that we don't actually get along
very well it's not about the technology
at all it's about the people lots of
times it's about these larger social
structures like the fact that we all
have to work all the time and our
colleagues and employers expect us to be
available after hours to work even more
right lots of times when moms on the
playground looking at her phone mom is
talking to her boss or her colleague or
her client or something like that so we
need to think about how do we as society
support healthy relationships if that's
what we really want and said goophone
bad which is a lot easier way easier and
always a preferred strategy I don't know
if you guys know about the famous comic
book study where or that the commission
to look into comic books that said that
the reason that there was so much youth
crime was because of comic books okay
and then finally as a technology company
I think we can be pushing for
technologies that don't just say yay
technology is great at less people
connect but that think seriously about
the kind of conflicts that technology
causes in relationships the inevitable
ways that technology pushes us in some
directions pulls us in others and push
for technologies that allow people to
manage those competing demands of
relationships I think by and large most
tech companies this goes back to your
concern about things being isolated and
not being that most tech companies think
that if you know somebody in one place
you want to know them everywhere right
and it's all about and it makes sense
because of course if you're thinking
from a data perspective if we can get
all that data in one place if we've got
your whole social graph then we know so
much about you and we can totally serve
up the ads you want right but we might
not want those people in the same place
as one example right there's a lot of
ways in which we might want to manage
and I think you know there are ways in
which technologies are getting more
sensitive
to these needs but it's something we
have to keep pushing for because I think
at the same time that you have a public
that often says oh these technologies
are harming our relationship so much you
also have tech companies that say the
solution to all of society's problems is
the right technology right and that's
unfortunately just as misguided right
there's a in between there which is
technologies can help technologies can
harm we have to be conscious we have to
be iterative we have to be aware of
unintended consequences that
technology's having have to keep paying
attention to the how they're being used
once they get out there yes you talk
about the containing demands of
relationships like I have you looked at
what what those are generationally so
like for how that's for young kids
versus cuz i can only understand it from
my perspective the demands of what I'm
in but I don't understand it for someone
that's a teenager or middle school
student like how have we looked at what
how that's different um are they the
same that's a great question I you know
I think the day the demands and
relationships depend a tremendous amount
on the contexts that we're in so they do
differ a lot by age group so and I think
about people say in middle school they
are constantly immersed in their peer
group right and by the time you're in
our age we may like our colleagues a lot
but we don't spend all our time with our
peer group right so that's a huge
difference that's going to change the
tensions around our relationships and
the uses of technology right there so if
you look at cyber bullying for example
it's almost all an extension of in
school bullying it's not this radical
weird phenomenon that's happening out
there whereas if you look at bullying
among adults I'm not sure that would
hold that it's the same people were with
all day who are the ones being mean to
us online so that might be one example
of change but you also see variation
amongst different populations so for
example i just edited a special issue of
a journal about selfies and one of the
thing one of the articles in there was
by somebody who had done research in a
fluffa vela and brazil
he was looking at the way that the
teenagers they're used selfies and they
were using selfies as a way of saying
look mom I'm okay right and as a way of
saying hey guys I'm participating in
social life but I'm not going to say
anything that could get me in trouble
with anyone right because there's no
words it's just me smiling right so
that's a really different use of a
selfie to control a really different set
of pressures from what it might mean for
my 15 year old son to post a selfie
which might be like hey I'm looking good
aren't i right and maybe there with
selfies and teens we tend to go for the
vanity and narcissism explanation right
which may I don't actually think it does
apply but it could apply in some context
but it certainly doesn't work in the
favela that's not what's going on there
at all so it's always really important
to dissociate the particular form of the
medium or the use of the medium from
what does it mean in that particular
context to those people right and
they're going to see a lot of even
amongst teens you're going to see
variation by cohorts no so that's
basically all's I got for you so I'd
love to hear your thoughts and talk
about this more I believe we have some
time so yes ever interesting question or
sort of observation that leads to the
question going to see if you complain
for the research on it maybe ten bucks
it's on the year the notion of media
multiplicity mm-hmm and you're showing
how they're additive right so clearly
what is it taking away from the other so
I'm curious if there's any work on the
what can you or can you not communicate
through these different media because it
seems like if people are ganging up and
using multiple modes for people their
most intimate with than they're having
multiple forms of communication which
things are they doing yeah that's
correct and then and what are the
consequences if you were to artificially
subtract some of the modes that really
would be best fitting but for some
reason they're not
likes a distance between people who want
to talk face-to-face i would say that in
general there's a unfortunate lack of
research like i was just saying that
starts with the the person and/or the
relationship and says across all these
different possible modes what are you
doing and what's working they tend to go
what are people doing on this how do
people using facebook how are people
using twitter how are people using
snapchat or in so unfortunate we don't
have a lot of cross cuts like that that
said there certainly some stuff we know
like the cell phone there's a lot of
research talking about micro
coordination and how useful it is for
those little things like running late be
there in ten minutes right which it
doesn't make a lot of sense to go to
somebody's house and say face to face
right or even necessarily to call it can
be easier to text there's research
including by people in our MSR cambridge
lab ye oldie cambridge about skype and
the centrality of skype in maintaining
long distance romantic relationships and
and immigrant relationships between
people who've left the country and
people who stayed behind so clearly
audio video is much better for a
intimate relationship maintenance over
distance in a way that other media
aren't but as in terms of sort of a
systematic here as a table here's what's
good for what if you look at some
completely mediated activities say open
source software development
collaboration they've evolved into a
certain culture because the
communication media was limited to a
certain type so the interaction models
that have evolved in order to do that
are ones that don't require channels
that weren't there whereas if you look
at say the workplace where we may try to
replicate group team building and
working collaboratively together but
we'll try and do it across geographies
with webcams and that sort of thing
we're trying to take a face to face
thing and augment it and it maybe make
you from a workplace perspective it
seems like having a better understanding
of what's likely to work and what's
likely a lot okay well we will switch
our norms to this because we need
everybody to be working together and if
that's not possible under these
constraints so we'll eliminate the ones
that have that so yeah yeah I've just
run into a lot of that sort of cyber
tribalism you know where you've got like
one group of people who work together
and another group of people work
together I refer to it in my own work as
two tribes on a wire I like things that
go wrong there yeah I've encountered the
probable lot and I'm just curious now
that you yeah well there is in the field
of organizational communication hour
there's work going back and in fact the
earliest work on communicator mediated
communication was when do we need to get
people together for in person and when
can we get away with the teleconference
and when will a phone call do and that
generally suggest that it's related to
ambiguity that the more ambiguity there
is and the more right solutions there
are the more the more face-to-face helps
i hope i'm getting that right it's in
the book there's there's trade-offs
right there's trade-offs if you want
everybody's voice to get on the table
then anonymous can be more important
than in person where some people are
going to be cowed into silence and some
people are going to talk all the time so
there are there are there are quite a
few factors to way there but at the same
time I think your point about the open
source community evolving norms to
manage working with the constraints that
they had is really important because
what that says is that
if you give humans a task to do and you
say here or if humans decide we want to
do this task together and a limited
medium is the only thing they have to do
it in instead of saying Oh can't do it
they'll figure out how right so it's not
always clear to me that there is a
one-to-one match between what you want
to get done and which medium is going to
be best and that all of the people who
are going to be involved in that task
are going to agree that that's the right
medium for that job so it might be that
maybe for you skype would work perfectly
for this task but for those people they
get all flustered and Skype meetings and
they don't remember what they wanted to
say until it's over and it would work so
much better for them if they could do it
via email where they have the time to
really write out their thoughts right so
I guess I kind of go back to the having
conversations about what works instead
of just assuming that what you're
feeling about it or what they're feeling
about it is what is other questions or
comments or punching matches ready to
get going nice to see you alright thanks
