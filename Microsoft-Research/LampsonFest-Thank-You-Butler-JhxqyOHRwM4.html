you
title of my talk is not terribly
original here we all have lots of
reasons to thank Butler the whole world
has lots of reasons to thank Butler but
you already know what those are so this
is a personal thank you of what I have
to thank Butler for first a little bit
of introduction this is me Lamport this
is Butler lampson now I realized there
was some confusion about this when
someone sent me email mentioning my
turing award a lecture so you should
learn to distinguish us I'm the one with
the beard Butler is the one with the
Turing award okay now I met Butler and
sometime in the early 70s we can't
figure out when and in 1977 I
interviewed at park I wanted to join all
those brilliant wonderful guys who were
doing these wonderful things and I give
an interview talking in it I'm said a
fault-tolerant distributed system must
use real-time otherwise it can't tell a
lost message from a slow one and I knew
I was just hand waving you know it
sounded reasonable but you know it was
just you know very informal now Butler
has a habit of going to sleep during a
lecture uh-huh someone forgot to turn
the counter on I guess that gives me a
couple more minutes as a habit of quote
going to sleep during a lecture of
course he's not really asleep and then
at some point you will open his eyes
raised his hand and ask a question that
completely demolishes what the speaker
was saying so I don't actually remember
whether Butler was you know had his eyes
closed during my lecture there in 1977 I
see his eyes are open now that's that's
good a good sign and he did raise his
hand and say bogus well in those days
people didn't say bogus but we did say
is that he said
pointed out that I was just waving my
hands and this motivated me and a few
days later I said Butler an email with a
proof of that unfortunately I dont still
still don't have don't have anymore but
it wasn't really a rigorous proof and
you know it wasn't very good and yeah I
just forgot all about it well fast
forward to 1985 and this paper by Mike
Fisher Nancy Lynch and Patterson
impossibility of distributing consensus
140 process the famous flp paper and
like everyone else I was completely
blown away by its elegance and the
generality of its result so thank you
Butler you pointed me in the right
direction but I just wasn't smart enough
to get there and perhaps it was because
of that I wasn't a smarter just wasn't
smart enough for work at park that I
didn't get the job so instead I went to
sr I uh and actually that turned out to
be a pretty good career move I'm working
on byzantine generals I did lay tech of
course if I had been at park maybe I
would have done had worked on Bravo and
maybe instead of coming here from
California I would have come down to
have to come down from orbit to get here
but that's another story so uh so I
don't know if you were responsible for
my not getting the offer but if you were
thank you it really worked out well for
me then an 85 I moved to you know people
many of the people from Park moved to
deck sir can I moved there too I don't
actually I don't remember but Louise
even at my hiring talk but I talked
about snapshots and maybe photography is
one of the few things that Butler
doesn't know a lot about but he did not
raise any
objections and I did get the job so
Butler at deck circle is in Palo Alto
and the deck engineers were in
marlborough and pint the time Butler
would go back and talk to the engineers
there and the story that I heard was
that butler would spend a day at
Marlborough and that would leave the
engineers with enough to do to keep them
busy for six months so on behalf of the
deck engineers Thank You Butler and
while i was at serkan 1989 i discovered
or invented the paxos algorithm now I
thought that was an important algorithm
and one thing I learned from Dykstra in
particular from his dining philosophers
problem which became very famous is that
the way you get people's attention is by
having a cute story so at essar I
Marshall peas and Robshaw stack had
developed some idea which they called
interactive consistency and my biggest
contribution to this whole business was
changing the name from interactive
consistency to Byzantine generals and
indeed that did get people's attention
so uh when i discovered the paxos
algorithm i decided to make a story i
wrote this story about a Greek island
and where people had pseudo Greek names
which was actually the names of computer
scientists and this was a total disaster
people looked at the God hung up in the
names tried to read them nobody paid any
attention to what the late the paper
actually said so no one paid any
attention to that algorithm except
Butler I know I don't know perhaps
Butler paid attention to because of the
papers ending which I
you put his laughter that he does
remember and this was the very end of
the paper general named blah blah blah
established a military dictatorship well
those of you who are not fluent in in
paxos impacts on this was the latex
source of that of that ending so perhaps
because of that a butler told everyone
to use Paxos to build reliable
distributed systems and they listened to
him because he is Butler and people are
smart enough to listen to Butler and
that's what they do today so thank you
Butler well meanwhile in actually a year
earlier Brian okie and Barbara Liskov
published a paper called view stamped
replication blah blah blah i don't
remember the complete title but and they
presented that at SOS p in 1998 and
butler together with bill while
discovered that Paxos and view stamp
replication were in fact the same
algorithm so when Barbara you see when
Barbara invents it out something neat
she builds a system when I defend
something neat I make a story I'm sorry
Barbara but even a bad story beats a
good system and so the algorithm is
known today is packs honest
okay go ahead to Naples in 1995 I was
invited to give a talk at some
conference that marked the 150th
anniversary of some kind of famous
scientific Congress that had happened in
Naples and remember exactly what the
teal details of it were but for a
15-minute talk on the future of
computing you know blah blah blah you
have nothing to say my wife and I were
flown business class to Naples we stayed
at a four-star hotel we were entertained
for a week it had a lovely time well the
night we arrived we were invited to
dinner by our host who is the head of
the computer science department who is
the one who you know was responsible you
know if we're inviting the computer
scientist and in the course of Congress
dinnertime conversation as he was
serving the drinks here's what he said
that you Butler for a wonderful vacation
okay so why have I been invited I've
given the great honor of talking at
Butler's a birthday party well I've
worked sort of at the boundary of theory
and systems and there's a wonderful
thing about doing that you see the
systems people would say boy with
irritation this lamp or guy knows quite
a bit about systems and of course
theoreticians would say will for
assistant or person this lamp work i
knows a lot about theory well
unfortunately i really couldn't keep
that up very long and even that couldn't
even convince the theoreticians that i
was assistance person ah but so now but
people will still say yo for a
theoretician Lamport knows a fair amount
about systems so how do i still fool
them well secret of my success the words
of igor stravinsky or the birds of Lobo
jeff's key plays your eyes and my
knowledge of systems has been stolen
from two people there's Butler and our
late lamented Jim Gray so thank you Jim
but thank you Butler an example in
December there was a butler talked at a
birthday party for Fred Schneider and
because of that talk I'm now telling
people about retroactive security so
thank you Butler now this being a
birthday party I actually have a
birthday present for Butler it's on a
memory stick here that I will
to him now Butler needs it because he
now describes algorithms in what I
regard as a as a form of pseudocode he
calls it spec and well so what's wrong
with pseudo code well there are two
things with wrong with pseudo code first
it's pseudo so what's wrong with that
well you can't check it and why you need
to check it well for reasons that I've
actually forgotten about 10 years ago I
googled there wasn't any Bing been a
quick sort and tested the first ten
algorithms that I found half of them
were correct everyone not written an
executable code was wrong that is the
ones that were correct we're only
correct because people had debug head
they were written and executed and they
would debug and what else is wrong with
pseudo code is that it's code if you're
talking about algorithms you shouldn't
be thinking at the code level you should
be thinking at a level higher than the
code level it's hot and it's hard to
think about the code level when you're
writing code so the replacement I have
for pseudo code is called plus cal it
looks like a toy programming language
but an expression in it can be any
mathematical expression and it gets the
plus cal code gets compiled into a TLA
plus specification and you can model
check it and you can get a grad student
to write a completely machine formal
machine checked correctness proof of it
it's not something you're going to want
to do yourself Butler as I think you
realize and I'll just illustrate it with
an example this is a paper don't ask me
what this paper is about you though I'm
an author well I do it no bit a bit it's
a real Lily pure theory paper and I have
no idea why people should be interested
in this
my job and this operation was I was the
formal Iser for this paper and I don't
know people know Ellie Gaffney he's you
know wonderful guy you're really smart
but he is no fan of formalization I
don't think he's well he hadn't before
he saw a plus Callie hadn't written a
anything formal in his life as far as I
know but when he saw the plus Cal
algorithms that I wrote to the scale
version of these algorithms in this
paper he was clean you is really blown
away by how elegant it was so i'll just
show you one of them is the simpler one
of the algorithm plur of the algorithms
this is what it looks like when you use
the tools and the two-hour r IG e this
is what the pre printed version of it
looks like this is the simpler of two
algorithms and the algorithm appears as
a comment in atl A+ module and don't try
to read it I just want to point out you
know just one little thing about this
thick well it declares proc to be a
constant which is going to be a set of
processes and you can see that there is
a process declaration so this says it's
a multi-process algorithm with one
process for each element in proc it has
labeled to specify a concurrent
algorithm you need to specify the grain
of atomicity and impacts in plus calots
is done in a really neat way be with
labels and an atomic action is an
execution from one label to the next and
now I want you to just look at this
there's a declaration of a variable a1
and what it says is that a one is the
initial value gives its initial value
and it says it's a an array indexed by
natural numbers and for each I a one of
I is initially the empty set so that's
what little piece of TLA
us notation it's what you most people
would write with a lambda notation but
lambda is has so overload and with over
loaded with other stuff that I invented
a new different notation for TL a plus
anyway and here's an assignment
statement it says known this variable
known is equal to known and the union of
this expression what is this expression
n union of a1 well it's defined here and
what that does is it defines an union of
a 1 a 1 is an array index by natural
numbers so it's the union of this
infinite number of sets a 10 a 10 1 etc
and that's just the typical statement in
a plus Cal algorithm we're not at the
code level anymore toto this is your
viewing this is really abstract you know
it's math it's really great but you can
debug it with the model checker and what
I did is I wrote machine check proofs
that it implements its specification and
its specification was also written as a
plus cow algorithm so Butler I've been
trying for years to get you to use t la
plus so this present maybe has welcomed
as a Christmas fruitcake but like a
Christmas Christmas fruitcake you can
regift it and unlike a crypt Christmas
fruitcake you can regift it as often as
you like so here is plus cow on a memory
stick has made the HDL
okay and thank you all like that you
want oh it turns out go tues are harmful
in programs everything you've learned
about programs you know most of it
doesn't apply to specifications or two
algorithms photos are bad because
programs because programs are
complicated but you have something
that's really nice and simple like that
a go-to isn't a problem and in fact it
can make it you know I wrote it with a
go to not because i didn't had to use a
go to be with but because it was clearer
little go to more questions anyone if
fading towards the end of the day so I
let's thank Leslie again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
