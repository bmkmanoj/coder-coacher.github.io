is my Kowski and we are both from
Microsoft Research Redmond and we are
going to present a joint project we did
together with Eric Horowitz on wind flow
basically trying to estimate the high
level winds using air crafts as sensors
so essentially wind patterns are very
important to do a lot of things so for
instance you know if you know exactly
what the winds are doing you can very
well predict how much time will airplane
take to go from point A to point B and
if you know the direction of the wind
you can actually exploit that in order
to trim down the flight time for
instance also the wind patterns are
extremely important and doing any kind
of weather with a modeling if you don't
really know what the winds are doing it
would be very hard to predict whether a
storm is coming
or whether a front is passing through
and finally like one of the biggest
challenges in you know path prediction
of hurricanes or tornadoes is the fact
that we don't really have very fine
level of details about how the winds are
acting in an area so you know the
current state of the art is very
manually manual intensive and very
primitive so basically if you look at
the map over here the black triangles
are the regions where NOAA which is you
know the atmospheric agency that that
provides all these forecasts for the
continental United States they provide
some of the predictions for these black
points only and the and the way they do
it is that they would you know release
some weather balloons at maybe couple of
times a day and as these were the
balloons go up through the atmosphere
they'll record the data transmitted back
to the stations and they will do some
number crunching on it again very
manually intensive very sparse and time
as well as in space so our idea is that
we can actually leverage a lot of
information from the airplanes that are
already flying in the air so this is a
snapshot of continental US during some
times in the afternoon and as you can
see there are thousands of aircrafts
already in the air so as they are
traveling to the air at different
locations different altitudes you can
actually say
what are the kind of wins they are
experiencing and use that harnessed all
this information to to come up with very
fine very refined predictions of the of
the of the wind field over the
continental US so that's basically you
know our contribution in this work and
the way we do this is it's very simple I
mean a lot of information about this win
wins you know basically it was
encountered by the aircraft can be
inferred from the data and the web
already so when you go inside you know
search for instance for you know a
flight status for Boston to Seattle's
right you can already get you know how
long it's going to take and when it's
going to arrive right if you look little
bit in detail it's going to give you the
ground speed the ground velocity at
which the aircraft is traveling a little
bit more detail you can actually find
out what's that intention was right so
looking at all this information you can
do a little bit of number crunching you
can do some machine learning techniques
based on you know Gaussian processes in
order to infer what is the head wind or
tail when an aircraft is encountering
and you have ten thousands of those
thousands of those right and you
incorporate all of these in the model
and come up with a much better much much
you know much denser I would send much
more accurate estimation of the wind
right why you know why don't we look at
a very specific example that you know we
we we actually used to test our
hypothesis whether this will you know
give you a good model and Mike Sisco's
is going to walk you through that
all right thanks ashish i'm here to show
and demonstrate some of the detailed
experimentation validation that we did
with the algorithms that Ashish was just
talking about and to do that I'm gonna
use this application called world wide
telescope this is a three-dimensional
topographical display of the earth and
where we can show data and flight paths
and win but vectors and things like that
so hopefully this will be able to
explain a little bit better detail about
what we're talking about so here on the
screen we're showing northwestern
Washington this is the Puget Sound
region and just kind of gives you an
idea of where we are in the world
but I'm gonna display here is a a grid
of yellow arrows these arrows are
essentially wind vectors that are
determined off the NOAA weather
prediction that Ashish was describing
earlier they launched these balloons in
about eight different locations about
three times a day and that generates a
three-dimensional grid of predicted wind
direction and velocity in this area now
what we decided to do was pick a spot in
eastern Washington in a Rondo and and
test a balloon launch and from that
location if we used these wind
estimations to predict where that
balloon would go when we launched it
this is the path that it would follow
and you can see it takes a bit of a
north easterly heading ends up somewhere
over here you know kind of north of the
Columbia River okay by using the
aircraft sensor network data which is
comprised of I'm sorry let me put this
on so you can see little bit better all
these little purple airplane icons are
the aircraft that we're flying around in
the vicinity during this experiment was
about a two-hour window and there are
various altitudes and locations the it's
a non-uniform set of information but a
lot more detail than what we're getting
a lot more timely and a lot more in
terms of spatial opportunities and what
we were getting from the balloon
information so using these aircraft data
we can then create a new wind prediction
grid and if i zoom out a little bit
you'll see that the the wind pattern
here has a little bit more northerly
prediction to it than the previous one
then the yellow arrows which I'm showing
here it's a little hard to see but I
think maybe you can kind of pick that
out so by using this this updated wind
flow technique then we're able to
predict that the balloon would go here
and this is about a hundred miles
difference in variation from where one
prediction versus the other would be so
quite a bit different and you can see
that the trajectory is
is relatively similar in profile but
definitely different in and where it's
going and then we actually launch the
balloon and if I spin around here I'm
going to show you where it actually
ended and there's maybe you can catch
that on the on the screen but that
little red flag indicates where the
balloon landed and you can see that it's
much more close to the new wind flow
prediction algorithms than what we were
predicting with the industry standard
wind forecast model
