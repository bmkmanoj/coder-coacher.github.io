Asia and I want to talk to you about
haptics today we've all had the
following experience it's cold outside
so put on my gloves go outside the house
take out my car keys and I want to open
the car door with my remote I cannot
feel the buttons on my key because I'm
wearing a glove so I looked down take a
glance at the buttons press on it the
door opens the fact that I cannot feel
these buttons does not bother me because
I can always look at that key and find
that button and execute a price now what
if I tell you this is exactly how we
have been interacting with our computers
we touch that screen with an ohm hand
but we cannot feel anything other than a
piece of code glass we're developing
technologies that's going to enable you
to not only touch but feel that computer
screen what we have done is we want to
create a sensation when you type that's
much more similar to a key click not
just an abstract sound not just an
abstract vibration so we do this by
taking the screen actually literally off
of that phone and put piezo electric
materials under the bezel now when you
have a keyboard you are typing on the
phone that glass literally bends
instantaneously very small bending but
that's enough to tell your finger that
it feels like a key click this is our
surface touch cover except it's only a
cover we have taken everything outside
and put different things in there again
we use piezo electric actuators so when
I send a high voltage to it they buckle
and that is the mechanism for creating
that sense of click under your fingertip
and we find that people do type faster
and they make less errors when they can
have this kind of key click as compared
to just sound feedback which is
typically implemented in most of these
devices let me move on and talk about
feeling things on the screen so here I
have a checkerboard on a Lumia 920 phone
the black part view is a bit sticky and
the white part feels smoother now we do
this by putting a piece of glass on top
of the phone and we again use the
wonderful peers or electric actuators on
top of that piece of glass and we
vibrate that glass at very high
frequency this way up and down but what
happens is when you run your finger on
that piece of glass it can trap a very
small piece of air between your finger
and that screen and this is what makes
the screen feel smoother
the last demo is very similar we change
surface friction so you can feel
different regions as different textures
but we do this with a different
mechanism we call this electrostatic
haptics the finger tip is filled with
fluid here so when there's charges here
it attracts the opposite charges towards
them so that creates a force that posts
the finger down now when you move your
finger back and forth I can fool people
into thinking that something's happening
on that piece of glass I hope that we've
given you a glimpse into the future of
human-computer interaction where we can
not only reach out and touch but feel
what's on that computer screen thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
