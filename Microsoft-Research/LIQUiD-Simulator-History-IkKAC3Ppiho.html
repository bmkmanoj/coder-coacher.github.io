author of liquid microsoft's language
integrated quantum operations simulator
I'd like to tell you a little bit about
myself and about the simulation system
and hopefully get you interested in
using it for yourself I originally
started in electrical engineering moved
into business and then into Microsoft
over 20 years ago to do msn version 1
and handheld PCs and pocket pcs and
tablets and speech recognition systems
spent a lot of time doing a lot of
different things and along the way I
wound up in cloud computing doing linear
algebra on very large systems and this
almost naturally led me to quantum
computing the thing about quantum
computing is when we talk about Big Data
this is really big data 30 cubits which
is not very many fits in Oh 30 gigabytes
of main memory and if I wanted to go to
forty five cubits it would fit in a
petabyte of main memory I can't
distribute it on lots of machines
because the linear algebra takes too
long to run it has to all sit in shared
memory so when we look to build the
system we tried to figure out how much
could we do and how efficient could we
be on a classical computer simulating
quantum computers this is why you need a
quantum computer as soon as you get to a
couple hundred cubits you're beyond the
number of atoms in the universe and
trying to simulate that on a classical
machine will never work so liquid was an
attempt to build a general platform that
we could use and eventually make
available for academic use which is what
we've done in the very recent past on
Windows OS X and Linux and on this
website you can find all the pointers on
how to get yourself up and running with
the simulator yourself we've used it to
do research in too many areas including
quantum chemistry quantum materials
variational algorithms quantum error
correction cryptography whole gamut of
things so it's a very useful tool and
the thing about quantum computing
is it's at the very beginning it's
probably anywhere from 10 to 20 years
away before we can really run algorithms
generally on quantum computers so why
are we doing this now we want to be
ready the fundamental algorithm is you
need to do quantum computing just like
we needed to do digital computing are
just beginning to be known they're on
the order for fundamental algorithms
that we use in quantum computing and we
know there's more and you may be the
person discover one of the new
fundamental algorithms so we look
forward to using the simulation system
it's written in a high-level language
it's easy to load onto your machine and
to run and it's something that I'm
fairly proud of I've worked very hard
for a long time to make this tool
available for our own researchers and
for researchers around the world and I'm
glad to see we're getting it used by
lots of people thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
