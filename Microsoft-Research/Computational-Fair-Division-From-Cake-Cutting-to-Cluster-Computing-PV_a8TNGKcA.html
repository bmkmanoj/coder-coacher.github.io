the next talk last one before the break
is by REO who's going to talk about
computational fair division from
cake-cutting to cluster computing area
so I want to talk about computational
third division it sort of an emerging
sub area of this interaction between
economics and computation they want to
try to be pretty embarrassed and try to
give you a broad view of several things
I'm interested in in this 20-minute talk
so it's going to be pretty fast I'll
mention three topics one of them is K
cutting we'll talk about that briefly
another is allocating computational
resources may be plugging in a bit what
randy said this is going to be more in
the direction of economics informing
computer science and also talk briefly
about allocating indivisible goods that
will be more in the direction of
applying computational thinking to
economics so very briefly about k
cutting this is want to talk here less
about research and more you know about
the inside and sort of the things people
are interested in in fair division it's
just a simple model that distills the
essence of fair division so in creating
we think about this rectangular cake
that we want to divide between a bunch
of players the cake is a true genius so
you know different parts of the cake
differently and each player has its own
valuation and it gives you a value for
its of cake thing as different players
have different valuation functions so if
you show the same piece of cake to two
different players they may give a
different value for that piece of cake
but we do make several assumptions about
these valuations first we assume they
are additive in the sense that if a
crumb worth alpha and birth bet if I
give you both of them that will be worth
alpha plus beta will also assume just
for convenience that the valuations are
normalized in the sense that your value
for the whole cake is 1 this is just for
ease of exposition and also the cake is
divisible and sour devaluations in the
sense that if you have a piece of cake
worth alpha and they give you
some lambda you can cut away a sub piece
worth lambda times alpha so if your
priest is worth one half you can cut
away some piece worth point one point
two or even 1 over pi so I want to jump
straight to you know surf a classic a
cutting algorithm that will help me
illustrate his concepts it's an
algorithm from 1961 due to dublins and
spaniard and here's how it's going to
work will have an example with three
players we're going to every furry was
slowly moves the knife over the cake
until he reaches a point where the piece
of cake to the left of the knife is
worth one third to one of the players
and at that point the player shout stop
so we're free is slowly moving the knife
over the cake until I have a player
shouting stop at that point afraid that
this is my attempt to compete with good
on at this point the referee is making
cutting the cake and we separate that
piece that piece is worth one third to
the player shouted stop let's call them
the yellow player then we repeat this
protocol with the remaining two players
and the remaining piece of cake so we
move the knife until a player shouts
sauce the referee makes the cut and the
player shouted stop let's call him the
blue player gets the space to the left
of the cut the last piece goes to the
left player let's call them the red
player now we want to argue that this
protocol as fair in a formal precise
sense that's called proportionality
which means that each of the end players
gets a piece of cake worth at least one
over in in the case of three players
each of the three players gets a piece
of cake worse at least one-third this is
pretty intuitive for the yellow and the
blue player each one of them shouted
stop when the piece was worth 1 3rd and
got that piece for the red player
noticed that he didn't shout stop so the
two allocated pieces are worth at most
one third to that player and here we're
also using the additivity of the
valuations as we know that his value for
the three pieces need to sum up to 1 is
value for the yellow piece in the blue
piece or it most one-third so is value
the red piece should be at least one
third and this argument also extends to
more players that's pretty intuitive the
distance proportional however this
protocol won't give you an env3 division
the reason is
for example we have no idea what the
value of the yellow player is for the
blue piece it can be as high as
two-thirds so we could have a situation
where the yellow player envy is the blue
player right in a sense that he would
rather have the blue piece then have his
own piece I thought and between us was
defined as no player would want to swap
his piece with a piece of any other
player i like my piece better than any
other player so in this example I could
have an i could have envied between the
yellow player in the blue player in the
sense that the yellow player would
rather have the blue piece so in fact le
fitness is pretty hard to achieve we do
know that it's always achievable in the
sky cutting setting we do know how to
achieve it but it's a lot more complex
than achieving proportionality more
generally there is I think a really
fascinating interaction between computer
science and NK cutting so computational
thinking really gives us a lot of
insights about k cutting some of the
things that came up in my work as well
or things like complexity how do you
know what's the complexity of getting
and the freeness representation how do
we represent these pretty complex
valuation functions of the players and
what does that mean for algorithms
optimization how do we optimize things
like Social Welfare subject to fairness
constraints and how do we quantify the
trade-off between fairness and welfare
communication what can you get with one
round of cake cutting and so on so these
are many many challenges that come out
of computational thinking but this is
not what I want to talk about today so I
want to focus a bit more on this issue
of allocating computational resources
and here you know the sum of these
intuitions that we just gained will also
play a role so lets you know maybe start
by contrasting these two settings now we
want to talk about allocating resources
like CPU RAM bandwidth memory bandwidth
and so on now we have multiple resources
so before we were talking about one cake
one good that we want to allocate here
we have multiple good that we want to
allocate but in contrast to the cake
each of these resources is homogeneous
we're going to think of like one pool of
CPU one pool of RAM and so on
the simplification of reality but an
assumption that will make here now
another assumption is what the demands
of the players look like so the
assumption is the players demand the
resources in fixed proportion so the
setting you want to keep in mind as they
have a job that needs multiple tasks
each task needs this much CPU in this
much RAM and if I run multiple tasks
that demands for this tool resources
will scale but will say in the same the
same fixed proportion okay so there's
our scaling but staying you know maybe
if it's a one to two ratio the ratio
will stay at 122 as they scale so this
is the setting we have in mind now this
setting of multiple resources and these
proportional demands was introduced by
God Seattle in a paper coming out of
Berkeley and the setting you want to
think of is a setting where you have a
shared cluster for examples a good
example to think about is the cluster in
at MSR where we have multiple researcher
who share the same cluster so all of
them have their different demands
different jobs that they want to run and
we have to decide how to allocate the
resources efficiently but also another
thing we have to keep in mind is these
fairness considerations so we want
things like proportionality we want each
researcher to get his proportional share
of the resources or at least as much you
would get from an equal split of the
resources obviously things like envy
freeness play important role and so on
so go to you at all asked you know can
we divide the resources in a way that's
efficient but also subject to these
fairness axioms now what we are doing in
this project it's a project that was
funded by the center of computational
thinking is trying to take the setting
into a more dynamic now thinking about
it more dynamically obviously in reality
you don't have a situation where you
know everything up front and things are
static you have situations where users
come over time leave over time change 30
minutes and so on and it was a
completely open question of how to model
and tackle these dynamics that come up
in practice so what we're trying to do
here is introduced
dynamics by thinking about a setting
where players arrive over time and will
say that this departure from the static
setting really makes us rethink fairness
you know what what can we achieve and
let us fairness even mean in a dynamic
setting like that so I want to show you
one of two mechanisms that we have in
your paper for allocating these
computational resources it's the simpler
to two mechanisms and I think it's quite
intuitive so we're going to see an
example where we have two different
resources what we're saying there is the
surf overall pool of the two resources
so far nothing is allocated and we'll
have three players that provide one by
one so the third player the first player
comes in and I tell them you know you're
entitled to one third of each resource
knock yourself out please use as much as
you can now this player needs a lot more
of the left resource and then the right
resource so I'm going to allocate is to
resources to him maintaining a fixed
proportion which which is what he needs
until he uses one third of the left
resource and at this point this location
is worth to at least as much as what you
could get from getting one third of both
resources he can't use more of the right
resource with one-third of the last
resource now the second player comes in
and again I tell and here's your
entitlement of one-third of each
resource use as much as you can this
player needs a lot more of the right
resource than the left resource so again
we're allocating to him and in the
proportion that he needs which is sort
of complementary to the proportion of
player one needs until uses one third of
the right resource now at this point
notice that the two players together
have used a bit more than one-third of
each resource now I want to be saved and
remember that there is a third player
coming in so to give them as entitlement
I should make sure that they save at
least one-third of each resource but I
can still continue allocating resources
until I reach this two-thirds points for
each of the two resources so now I tell
the two players and i'll just keep
allocating to you at the same rate until
we reach this two-thirds point so i just
allocated the two players at the same
rate because their demands are
hurry the two resources are allocated at
the same speed until I exhaust the
resources up to the two-thirds point now
the third player comes in and i can
again give him his entitlement of
one-third of each resource his demands
are identical to player 1 so he needs a
lot more of the left resource than the
right resource and we allocate to him
until we exhaust the left resource and
we can't allocate anymore ok so why is
this protocol fear so first of all I
want to argue that it's proportional
each player gets at least as much as an
equal split of the resources or at least
one-third and the reason is that when a
player arrives he is immediately
allocate one well allocated one-third of
each resource so obviously this accion
is satisfied they get at least as much
as data location now this protocol is
not envy free in the sense that if a
player arrived before me I may Envy that
player but on a conceptual level you
know you can ask am I even entitled to
envy a player that arrived for me but
also on a more rigorous level you know
we've proved that this kind of envy
fairness in the aesthetic sense is
incompatible with basic notions of
efficiency so the type of envy phoenix
you get here as a player cannot envy a
player that arrived after him and the
reason is that when a player arrives
after you he starts by getting his
initial entitlement but then if he is
allocated you're going to be allocated
at the same speed I'm cheating here a
bit but this is more or less how it
works ok so you know so so obviously if
he's getting more you're getting more at
the same speed and no envy will be
created now this protocol also satisfies
dynamic notions of efficiency and game
theoretic properties that are a lot more
delicate I don't want to get into them
but from a technical level that are
interesting when you try to balance all
of these requirements to gather and
analyze the mechanism to show that all
of these things are satisfied together
and like I said in the paper we have a
different protocol that looks at a
different set of axioms different
relaxations and it's even more subtle so
this is a this is from joint where
with Ian cash was a researcher in MSR
cambridge UK and sr Shalem a student
it's a paper called no agent left behind
dynamic fair division of multiple
resources and it was published a few
months ago so one reason I'm excited
about this project is that it's
essentially the first model of dynamic
fair division and for that reason I
think it's exciting not only for
computer scientist but also for
economists who have been working in
third division for decades but decision
dynamics never came out because it's not
really motivated in the economic setting
where as you know this computational
setting really gave very strong
motivation for thinking about dynamics
and introducing them into the models the
model that we talked about the
theoretical model is highly simplified
so there's still a gap between this
model and reality but I think it does a
good job of distilling the essence or
the you know the essential challenges
that you need to tackle as you go from
the static setting to the dynamic
setting in these settings of allocating
computational resources this was very
much the topic of ongoing discussions
with ms our colleagues so Ian cash was
our core in the paper heaters belani
also friend from ms or cambridge ish i'm
gonna share from em sir edwin sebastien
de hay and dev panic from ms or New York
and also called at CMU and Duke
University okay so I want to use my last
few minutes to talk about the third
topic that of dividing indivisible goods
and this is sort of fundamentally
different from the two settings that we
talked about so far where we thought
about the visible goods we can defy the
Dominican divided as much as we want
when we think about indivisible goods we
think of things like a house that can't
really be divided into several parts and
this is really fundamentally different
from the farthest point of view because
the same notions of fairness don't
really apply so if you think about a
setting with one house and two players
you'll have to give the house to one of
the two players and then the other
player would be envious the other player
would not get his proportional share so
notions like envy penis and
proportionality are not really relevant
when you think about
indivisible goods and there aren't any
good mechanisms or notion in place in
order to think about the case of
multiple players with indivisible goods
and how to allocate things between them
so what I want to present to you as a
notion that you think is pretty
compelling and some results about it
that give us a way of approaching this
problem of dividing indivisible goods
between multiple players so think about
the setting where we want to divide an
estate between three players and what I
meant to do is I'll tell the first
player you're going to divide the goods
into three bundles but the catch is that
you'll choose a bundle after the other
players have chosen so if we happen if
we have a risk versus player what you
try to do is divide the bundles in a way
that maximizes his minimum value for any
bundles it's going to try to equalize
his value for the three bundles so maybe
his partition looks like this he puts
dimension in bundle number one puts the
Mona Lisa in bundle number two that's
pretty valuable but you know but the
third bundle so maybe things this
randomly spilled paint it doesn't know
what that is it's a Jackson Pollock
painting but it doesn't really recognize
that you know it's the ring from the
Lord of the Rings but all of this stuff
it doesn't recognize it's all in the
third bundle and now we tell player
number two go ahead and choose a bundle
for this player recognizes this valuable
stuff and chooses this larger bundle
then they a third player let's call them
the red guy goes ahead and chooses
dimension and our divider the blue pipe
layer is sort of start with the Mona
Lisa which is a pretty good outcome now
the worry is you know this seems
intuitively fair to player 1 the one who
divided because you know we told them
you divide in a way that you think is
fair so even if you choose last this
seems whatever happens that's going to
be pretty fair to him but the red guy
can say well if I were the one to divide
I would do it completely differently for
example you know I really want the ring
in order to rule the world but if I
don't get that I have sentimental value
for the two cars so I want to put the
two cars into different bundles and at
least make sure that if I don't get a
ring I'll get a car but in this
partition because I chose second
that woulda mention that i don't really
like so you know so this red guy can
complain hey that's not really fair i
want to be the one who divides the goods
and the question is can we allocate the
goods to the players in a way that each
player simultaneously gets as much as
you could get if he were the one to
divide the items so it turns out that
the answer is it's almost always
possible you know so it's extremely
difficult to find cases where this is
not possible in the worst case there are
situations where you wouldn't be able to
do that but the counter example is
extremely intricate however and you know
this is a place where computational
thinking concern and you know where it
informs how we can tackle something like
that what we do is that you can
guarantee each player two-thirds of this
value which is which we call his cut and
choose value cutting choose fairness
value each player can be guaranteed
two-thirds of that value in the worst
case so even though we can't guarantee
you know this exact value always we can
always almost always guarantee it and in
the worst case we can guarantee
two-thirds of that value but this is
very much informed by you know common
the common way of thinking in
theoretical computer science this was
from work with Zhang Sheng Wang a
manuscript that we wrote a few weeks ago
so one reason why I am excited about
this is that in the last year or so have
been working with the same you
undergraduate jonathan goldman on
building a third division website where
the idea is that you know taking this
plugging into this huge literature in
fair division where there are many many
clever methods that could potentially be
very useful but were never implemented
and creating a website that people can
actually use to solve their everyday
problems now hopefully making the world
a bit more fair some of the things we
tackle are things like when divisions
are very very clever solutions for it's
a very widespread problem but you know
nothing was ever implemented assigning
scientific credit especially in fields
where author altering is alphabetical
and you need to find a good way to do
that in order to avoid conflict are very
very clever mechanisms
of doing that again that have never been
used but when we came to problems like a
state division or dividing indivisible
goods even after discussions leading
experts on fair division we just
couldn't find any mechanisms in place
that are able to do that in a satisfying
way and by leveraging these theoretical
results that we just talked about we
were able to design sort of multi-tiered
mechanism for the setting of a state
division that I think is the first
satisfactory mechanism for dealing with
a setting like that and giving
theoretical guarantees okay thank you
very much for your attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
