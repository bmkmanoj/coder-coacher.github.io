you
alright so hello always a dangerous will
be in between just before the lunch so
i'll try to be quick so this is really
the work was done with a five elf ogre
who is still a PhD student we have this
MSR inria research center joint research
center in paris and this is his advisor
so the work was done pretty much last
year he paid a visit alright so it's
pretty much based on a paper it's a nips
paper as a web page with a code some
examples and things like this as far as
the problem goes let me start with us
you I guess many of you might be very
familiar with this so what is given is
the following suppose your goal is to
rank a set of objects items and what is
given to you as input is basically
information about pairwise comparisons
so C is going to be a comparison matrix
so having a 1 if I is ranked higher than
J observed to be ranked higher than j0
if for example there is a drawer that
there's a missing comparison and minus 1
if otherwise is ranked lower than J so
this is very standard now this is the
input and then you want to order items
in and order natural order in some way
kind of is align with what is given to
you so this problem has been studied I
don't know at least to my knowledge
since 1920s or something like this she's
very interesting I mean there's a work
there's a test on paper night 20 1927 or
third or something I didn't there's a
Zen mellow a German scientist and
surprisingly there's a lot of interest
sexually today so because the problem is
very natural and there are many
applications you do want to rank items
so in terms of the related work let me
just glance through this very quickly
some of you might not be entirely
familiar so Bradley Terry or sometimes
Bradley Terry loose would be a model
based on a probabilistic model when you
say each given item is associated with a
parameter which represents kind of a
skill or value of that item and then you
specify
in a comparison between a pair given
these two corresponding parameters of
the other given items in a pair was the
outcome was a probability of one being
ranked and higher higher than than the
other one so this is really a specific
model of that kind it was studied by
Bradley and Terry in 1950s but it really
comes from zealous work in i.t twenties
anyway so and then there's this piece of
a very recent work actually people from
MIT studying pretty much the same model
but not looking into maximum likelihood
estimate of these parameters
representing skills or values of items
but looking into something else which
may be for various reasons one reason is
if you look into a different scheme so
as to estimate these parameters you may
say actually something about a problem
for example you may specify how many
pair wise comparison is enough to
observe so as to rank within some
accuracy error or innocent precision
thirst on this is I mentioned there's a
well-known example true skill something
developed actually in this lab and then
there are these other schemes so somehow
you may bucket these given to to be
based on a probabilistic model and our
latent parameters and then these other
ones are kind of either no comments some
of them common-sense schemes for example
it's very natural to may be associated
each item with a point score
representing goodness or behavior and
for example that could be just counting
the number of wins against other items
if you like so I don't know in football
leagues typically you have kind of
something similar to this not exactly
the same and then the a bunch of this
other scheme his kind of PageRank style
computer principle ikea vector which may
be seen as a very kind of to account to
winds which are no direct means so it's
not only counting i given item one
against the particular item but also you
look into multiple hops so i guess many
of you might be very familiar with this
so what our work is about is kind of
looking to a different way to do this
which is very
simple idea which goes as follows so
again we are given this comparison
matrix and instead of looking into Cano
scores which is associated with them as
a starting point we are going to look at
how different color pairs compare in
competitions with kind of other
alternatives or items so I and J so so
let's see in a picture where this
equation means so it will mean the
following if i take consider nih a pair
and then you take a reference item k you
say it's caught up a plus one because
they actually they both this would mean
they both won against k for example
likewise if they both lost you scored a
plus one minus one if they contradict
some meaning 11 the other one lost and
this is the way you will construct this
essentially kind of similarity in
performance the high-level idea is let
me just move the high-level idea is
somehow to create a ranking such that
items that are similar in comparison
with other items come close or near in
the output ranking so this is the kind
of intuition now Syria rank is a speckle
algorithm it's kind of very simple to
describe so I'll tell you what it is and
then i'll tell you why is it like like
this so it is actually a very simple
reason is not out of some very obscure
something obscure so input is a matrix
comparison matrix then we compute the
similarity matrix s the way I described
before and then what it does is kind of
computes course if you like previously
we have seen some methods to compute
scores associative the items these
scores are going to be corresponding to
the elements of an eigenvector over
laplacian matrix of the similarity
matrix and you compute this eigenvector
i'll tell you in a minute what fiddler
eigenvector is and then you order in say
in decreasing or increasing or
decreasing order your pick one which has
the smaller number of upsets if you like
way to choose one of the two so it's a
very simple again a spectral method like
page
case or some other schemes similar
schemes feel the eigenvector is nothing
else but AG invaders are going to be
non-negative there is an eigenvalue of
value zero and then you look at the
smallest eigenvalue you call it a
fiddler eigenvalue and the corresponding
eigenvector is feel that eigenvector so
this is well known some of some of you
might be actually very familiar with
this so as to compute the field lag
effectively just solving this
optimization problem with a video
quadratic objective functions now there
are a few things have to be mindful the
time so so what what is it I mean so
basically what I said by now I kind of
told you I hope you can admitted that
the scheme itself seems to be quite
natural second the algorithm is simple
Alan said maybe why is it like that and
what kind of questions you want to study
is to see but actually this ranking
actually makes sense is it efficient is
it able to recover say a true ranking if
you define what the true ranking is and
say accurately exactly or maybe within
some approximation so a very kind of in
terms of the framework what is very
convenient is to consider this notion of
Robins of matrices so think of this is a
matrix symmetric matrix which has this
property so there is certain
monotonicity order so class of matrices
we say it's a robin's of matrix see that
holds we say PR it will be a pre our pre
Robinson if you can find if you can
permute rows and columns by a given
permutation so that the resulting matrix
becomes an our matrix and then we say
it's strict if the only two permutations
that actually can do that our identity
or reverse right so this is like just
just to maybe say a few things and then
once we have defined that what is
interesting is that may be the last
statement which says if the matrix a
happens to be strict Robinson then the
field liking vector elements of the fig
filling vector that's strictly monotonic
so basically you can all the items there
is no confusion right so why is this
kind of strict Robinson property
interesting is that if we start
with the following thing so suppose the
true ranking is going to be identity
ranking I can take take any but suppose
I have items 1 to N and really the order
is meant to be 1 to 2 n so the input
comparison matrix is consistent with
this this is going to be true ranking
assuming there are no corruptions and
missing entries you are going to deal
with us later so a given input matrix C
and then if you compute the similarity
matrix is going to look like this and
this is a strict our matrix so what this
means if we run spectacle algorithm that
the cereal and that I defy before you
are going to the order induced by the
fiddler's augen vector elements
correspond to the identity so in a way
you can do exact recovery so you have a
correctness of the algorithm in this
case now in reality you're not going to
find these matrices this would be like a
very simple so basically here we assume
here for each given pair is compared and
it's like really there are no
contradictions in reality are going to
be missing entries a few of you prepare
comparisons observed and contradicting
with it and you're not a transitivity
may not necessarily hold right so but
it's a good starting point to start with
something that you may corrupt and then
see when you had these corruptions or
kind of noise to what extent the scheme
is robust so there are few things you
may kind of note okay so let's maybe try
to argue when the scheme is better maybe
than the other ones and we are going to
compare with a point score which means
count the number of wins for each give
an item against the other ones five
minutes excellent right so this is
basically telling you if you do isolate
it's like a very it's a paid to Beijing
it's an IEP tribution assume only one
pair you per tube and it's not like you
know very neighboring items so if you do
this you're going to induce a tie for
the point score while a similarity
matrix book is going to remain strict
Roman Sun which means you can do exactly
covering so those are very very kind of
a toy examples of perturbations but for
those you can demonstrate
kind of a better robustness you can
extend these 2m pair comparisons you
have the same claim so you can do a
little bit little bit of extra and then
if you assume that these corruption so
corruption would mean like an item is
ranked higher than itemized better than
higher than J but then you flip it this
is the corruption so if you do this for
say all the end think of it is from all
the rain elements then with the say
constant probability let me just maybe
rephrase it like this you're going to
find the exact the accurate ranking so
this is maybe the last the reticle is
also pretty much in the paper a nice
paper we have the kinds of these things
and something that some things that are
emitted this is more of a working
progress that's something we want to
establish for some of these schemes that
I previously mentioned people manage to
say the following which is interesting i
believe for example if I have n items
clearly if I have order n to the two
observations I should be able to come up
with a good ranking so now what you want
to do is to do something to sub linear
it n to the two and people have found
schemes for which for example n log n
order or sort of think of it nearly and
linearly in the number of items in there
in the number of also the number of
pairwise observations that are
sufficient is basically roughly speaking
order n so this is kind of giving you a
similar skate statement for serial rank
I saw the pretty much is like think of
this result is kind of being nearly
proved it's still not entirely so it
relies on kind of some perturbation of
matrices spectral analysis and things
that is in terms of a empirical
evaluation we looked at and I have a
very little but anyway so they looked
into synthetic data sets I think of this
one I start with this identity like a
silly matrix comparison matrix which is
kind of there no contradictions so this
is the one I introduced at the very
beginning and then you corrupt it so
meaning you flip some of the entries or
maybe you Annja late put some entries to
zero meaning like they are not observed
and you may do this uniformly you may do
this in some structural way and then the
second item is real world examples
looking to top coded data and then
England football premier league so
overall conclusion is going to be it
does compatibly with other schemes so
what what do we have on this plot maybe
let's start with one just to explain it
and then serial rank is the one I
described this is the point score this
is the rank sensuality which is kind of
think of it blindly Terry particular way
to estimate parameters and this is the
maximum likelihood predatory so this is
a correlation coefficient to higher the
better so you see pretty much all of
these other schemes they line up to this
curve we do slightly better in here so
the higher the better but it is not
always like this there are certainly
cases where actually we do works for
example in here the red one so point
score is going to perform words but then
Bradley Terry would be better but
overall not too far off is not really
kind of it's not a crazy scheme to do a
page I'll get them to do again this is
this one is to our favor pretty much the
same but this is like a missing entries
and some corruptions and something like
this in terms of real world I just maybe
fast forward so this will be top coded
data and here actually it does quite
well so this is looking into number of
upsets or kind of the non-conforming
orderings with respect to the given
input data for top K or ranked items so
the cedar bank is going to be a red one
and you see that some of the schemes
actually there are very worse this would
be the point score it's quite a bit of a
gap between the two and then the red one
actually is not too bad i mean sometimes
it is beaten up by another one but it's
not very conclusive there's no strict
order between the schemes this is
similar data but for football which is
the premier english premier de málaga
2013-14 or something like this and maybe
this is the nearly the last slide so I
hope I'm been in time limits this is if
you do it was very 2013-14 football data
if you do all of these different ways so
this is the official like a three-point
win scheme which is common using
football that the standard way to do
this is the point scorer awesome
sensuality bellaterra see rank and
something else let me not go into it so
overall other day some agreement to the
top as you would expect then at the end
I don't know you'll see some noise
overall in here kind of surprisingly
there is that all of these schemes or
ranking matters not all of them this one
actually is a way of they kind of
confirmed for the top-ranked team but
Nate before the second and third for
some reason actually in here we have
chelsea and liverpool order in that
given very well the original one was
this so i don't know so bomb a looking
more closely into what happened maybe
the chelsea overall was performing
similarly as mark manchester city in
comparison with other teams it's kind of
a very intuitive a maybe to explain it
anyway so in summary it's kind of a I
think I don't know to my knowledge is a
new wake and a principled way to do
ranking based on this kind of notion of
similarity there is a spectral algorithm
for it and what we aim to do is really
kind of get some sense whether this
algorithm make sense at all I how robust
it is to corruptions missing entries and
things like this and a glance to
empirical results and anyway so i'll
stop at this point questions to is
actually two different criteria for
example the topic a performer that
you're shown that seems to me it's not a
statistical problem right it's a pure
optimization of oil doesn't have to it
doesn't try to recover one true ranking
that we is assumed to exist but it just
tries to match the existing triple
circular tool is that you observe as
well as possible right
Stickle element and the statistical
evaluation it's sort of assuming a site
model can you recover that under certain
models of corruption so you have people
walk and a few look into other
immolation criteria what is actually
let's say the user study what is a
plausible ranking what is agree with
this human assessments or is that not
push this is really admitting kind of
aggregates like a lost function approach
on meaning you say Kendall lost function
or something like this and and try to
see what kind of a distance you have in
terms of which one of those will be
deemed kind of more natural in on a
practical setting either now so the top
K is more for example can clearly
speaking top K is more kind of driven by
common sense intuition this is something
you may care about well then the candle
tile correlation just comes because
people and typically you do i link
aggregation you take a particular loss
function and then you see how it's done
is in some sense is an optimization
problem but I guess the question maybe
is like which one of these optimization
problems are kind of unnatural ones
because I guess most of them they can be
after all formulated a certain
optimization hope that answers a little
bit at least yes packing persons that
are wasted rather being binary all right
yes is he in the paper I focus pretty
much in here like comparison matrix
being minus 1 10 valued we also did
something could be for example in an
interval minus 1 to 1 and then that
could be according to planetary like
model for example ranking by holidays
not that vertically but we have some
theoretical results on say kind of
correctness of recovery and things like
this
okay any more questions otherwise it's
