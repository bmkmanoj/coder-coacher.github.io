coordinate the studio 99 up artist
lectures today we have to make a feel
who is an artist and with an interesting
technology background who works on
augmented reality as well as other art
and technology interface projects and
that's we should be talking about today
so I think that's about it for me and
thank you to make a good to have you
here thanks for the invitation is the
mic on I guess it's only important for
the recording yeah let's presume it's on
yeah so thanks for the invitation and
because you are a computer company
actually could be douse the lights a
little bit we've got a lot at least the
ones that are on the screen here we're
getting a real wash out I've got a lot
of black things to show right so I
started out as a product designer and
work for hewlett-packard in Silicon
Valley and then got bored of that went
to MIT decided I wanted to become a
media artist but a friend of mine said
right when I graduated say I said I'm
starting this company can you come and
do the product design for the connection
machine and you might have heard of the
connection machine you might have heard
of Danny Hillis we were all 20 year olds
Danny and I are the same age for about
25 26 at that point and this was a
massively parallel supercomputer the
first commercial machine designed for
artificial intelligence as a
supercomputer and the big boys IBM and
Cray were all occurring like artificial
intelligence no one believes that that
stuff will ever work are you kidding me
so we were really the you know we were
the kids who were out there and you know
the company did go bankrupt for various
reasons like the end of the Cold War but
um but the machine did come out and had
64,000 one bit processors 16 to it ship
and it's when I gave this a full talk on
the machine at MIT it was
how the Machine got its blinking lights
which is one of the sterling
characteristics of the machine and you
see here that they're actually the
status lights which are usually
connected with each processor to say the
processor chips getting power I brought
out to the edge of the board and then
the doors are trance translucent so you
can see them you can see the Machine
thinking is the idea like a huge
electronic brain and the idea of behind
the package design was to show really
the structure of the machine and the
most important part of the structure was
the 12 dimensional boolean Ncube network
that are our friend and co-worker
Richard Feynman proposed as the internal
network to connect the processors
together so in this case in the case of
a boolean n cube then you have a one
dimensional network connecting two
processors you double that connect the
edges to get a 2d network you double
that connect the edges you get a 3d and
then the interesting thing is the fourth
dimension where you start running into
the fact that we're so limited by only
living in in three dimensions plus time
so the standard representation of a
hypercube is again you double the cube
you nest them inside of each other and
then connect the edges but I had to wire
this thing and I had to be able to wire
it up to 12 dimensions so when you start
doing that and messing them inside of
each other that didn't really tell me
much about how I could deal with this
topology so I played around with it and
said well you know if we if I put them
side by side and then connect the edges
then I can represent those fourth level
connections with sort of a meta line and
that makes it very easy to deal with
conceptually and also to go through this
fourth fifth sixth up to the 12th
dimensions by saying okay this is the
structure with the five dimensions but I
can reduce it down here where you can
start seeing again this repetition of
line
main square cube line square cube so six
dimensions it's kind of pretty here but
it's more comprehensible there and then
you go on up to the 12th dimension of
course the reality was not quite so
clean the the first couple dimensions
were on the chip and then there were
other ones on the board and then the
highest level dimensions had to span
across the machine and because we were
doing massively data parallel processing
we were not up against the speed of
light as cray was at this time Cray had
the these rats nest of wires on his
machines because the speed of light was
a real issue and all the lines had to be
short as possible so um so basically
this also became the t-shirt logo you
can buy the t-shirt from my website and
it became very popular in the 90s when
Apple used a picture of fine men wearing
what became known then as the Fineman
cm-1 t-shirt in the think different ads
so I like to say this is the only super
computer that's been designed after a
t-shirt logo because this cube of cubes
is basically exactly what then I took
for the final shape of this machine the
machine has its 30th anniversary this
year the fastest successor the CM 2 has
its 30th anniversary next year 2019 is
the 30th anniversary of the CM to
winning the Gordon Bell price as the
fastest supercomputer on earth and so
over the span of three years I'm doing a
project to give people well as a very
basic level you can print out the logo
the t-shirt logo lay it down in your
living room and through an AR app will
be able to see the machine in your
living room but I also want to look at
applications that the machine was
working on then and applications that
are being that are relevant today that
came out of the sort of AI research
which is really now of course driving
the world in a way that back 30 years
ago people never expected
so I was very very delighted that a
major or the major art and design Modern
Art and Design Museum has acquired one
from the collection I can't say more but
that will hopefully be publicized within
the next half year and I'm hoping to
have them I you know an app or some sort
of a our VR experiences that are
immersive in nature but we relate you
back to the Machine and to the sort of
content that came out of this
development in artificial intelligence
so jumping from that I finally after the
machine was done I was able to go on and
to my dream of becoming a media artist
and I got into one form of virtual
reality back in the mid-90s when almost
all of a sudden the technology was such
that interactive 3d virtual worlds which
before had only been running on a
hundred-thousand-dollar Silicon Graphics
machines were then able to run on on
simple desktop Windows computers with
Pentium processors Pentium 90 so I got
hired by this new company worlds
incorporated that had some of this early
technology to work with Steven Spielberg
who was then chairman of the Starbright
foundation to do to create a 3d online
multi-user interactive avatar world for
seriously ill children the Starbright
foundation had this idea that they could
use game technology to make to either
help inform kids about their illnesses
or give them distraction from their
illnesses and we're talking about you
know kids like this two-year-old cancer
patient and who grabbed the mouse and
was often running through the virtual
world cystic fibrosis also all sorts of
very very severe illnesses and you know
compared to the the current crop of
wonderful VR headsets which give you
this immersive stereo experience but all
so induce a lot of em of nausea in that
environment we said the kids have so
many drugs that cause nausea anyway
they're connected to machines anyway
whether they're on dialysis or whether
they're getting some other sort of
treatment so we said okay no stereo no
headsets and we don't want the isolating
experience we want the kids to be able
to sit together so the virtual world was
running on a on a PC on a Pentium 90 pc
in the playrooms that got the kids out
of their beds into the playrooms to talk
with each other they'd go online and
hope to c ET you know when we asked
Steven well what do you want for your
avatar II said well BTW of course it's
like oh sorry we asked of course we
should have known that so so that again
was a encouragement to the kids to get
out of their bed stop moping and just
forget their illness and come here in
these virtual worlds together to play
with each other and maybe was Steven and
one of the world's at the time the one
up there build your own zone also had
building blocks that they could move
around this is about a decade before a
second life brought this sort of
technology into people's living rooms
and that was actually a problem with
this project we were really ten years
ahead of our time so the platform wasn't
stable the internet connections at home
were still dial-up modems I if you you
know we're they were just too slow so
basically it only ran about two three
years as a pilot project and then was
replaced by a multimedia website but it
but it was really of higher ending
pioneering work in this sort of online
virtual worlds so i took this technology
and said I want to make virtual worlds
of my own with my own content and the
first piece I did together with a friend
Zara houshmand whoo Ronny an American
was this piece beyond Manzanar where we
were talking a comparing the experience
that the Japanese Americans went through
during World War two
they were interned for the crime of
being the face of the enemy for being
japanese-american when when America was
at war with Japan with a similar threat
to intern Iranians oops okay here in
this slide to intern Iranian Americans
back in the 79-80 Iranian hostage crisis
times when people were calling to in
turn an entire group on the basis of
their ethnicity even if they had done no
crime whatsoever this is of course is it
was a very resonant experience after
nine eleven when all of a sudden you
know irani as a Iranian Jews were being
investigated for the FBI for being
Islamic terrorists it's like wait a
minute guys you know not all people from
the Middle East have the same ideologies
and backgrounds but because of the
ethnicity okay you're all just being put
into the same internment camp that was
the fear and it was able to be averted
at some level also because of protests
from the japanese-americans who had gone
through this experience had had been
able to find out in the 80s that
actually the Justice Department lied
about the fact that the japanese
americans were not a threat whatever to
society the Justice Department said in
front of the Supreme Court every single
man woman children down to one sixteenth
drop of Japanese blood is a threat to
American security and should be interned
and ignored six different studies from
the government from the material
military saying this was absolutely not
true so somehow that knowledge was
around after 911 and prevented the
government from being able to proceed
with that you lied to us once are you
lying to us again always an interesting
question so so the next piece that I did
with this technology again no headsets
no 3d it's a single projector it has a
very simple joystick let's just forward
and back because
that is something that even people who
are who don't have full use of their
arms can do people in wheelchairs a
large projection screen and it's about
12 feet wide nine feet high and the
important thing it goes all the way down
to the bottom because if you see a
virtual world on the screen like this it
is a window it is an image if you see it
basically so that the image is life-size
and there's no barrier for you to walk
into that image your body perceives it
as a space even if you don't have stereo
even if it's only in one plane and not
surrounding you and this is a way that I
can take this technology these virtual
worlds to any country I showed it in
Colombo in Sri Lanka and they didn't
have a screen that was that large and
they didn't have a wall that was that
large so they took three pieces of cloth
sew them together and we just ignored
the fact that they were seams running
through the middle but you know I could
do that in a village in India and we did
talk about that but although it didn't
happen so other a completely different
content here taking an Occidental lyst
view imagining the West which is
actually a genre of Japanese art from
the 16th century up into the 19th
century because the Japanese were
prohibited on pain of death from leaving
the island or coming back to the island
once they had left so there were a whole
group of artists during that time during
those two hundred years who fantasized
the west and made these occidentalis
fantasies there is also the religion
that was the hidden Christians
Christianity was forbidden on pain of
death and they just like with with it
with his use under the Inquisition who
stayed but converted you know they were
checked every year to make sure that
they would trample across or whatever to
prove that they were not actively
practicing but what they did the ones
who wanted to stay Christians were they
took the condon a guanine
goddess of mercy the Asian Buddhist
goddess of mercy who's very much Maria
Madonna Maria figure and worshipped her
in secret as the mother Mary so so here
is also a technique of using a lot of
two and a half dean using images that I
put into a particle system so you have
all these angels and Bodhisattvas
swirling around you and in this is one
way of bringing then also art history
into these virtual worlds into a 3d
interactive space even if it's not fully
3d and stereo then the last large piece
I did in this technology was with the
Berlin Wall and there we had more
funding from the city of Berlin
city-state of Berlin and were able to
hire people to help through the research
do the do the 3d modeling and actually
have 3d characters I'm hoping to put a
little bit of this because it is all 3d
it would work with a stereo headset and
I'm hoping to put a little bit of that
available on online relatively soon so
how am i doing on time I'm ok so so the
next the next jump in my in my art
practice was doing artificial artificial
augmented reality instead of sort of a
virtual reality and this happened when a
friend of mine said hey we're going to
put augmented reality artworks in the
Museum of Modern Art we haven't told
them yet we haven't gotten their
permission that we can do this with the
Geo locative gps-based artificial
augmented reality technology send us
something so I sent them this piece that
I call the art critic face matrix a
bunch of screaming faces saying this is
not art and I wasn't able to attend but
they got together a big group of people
who were all then looking in there
on their mobiles in MoMA and of course a
little bit later I was able to go back
and make some screenshots of my own and
the piece is still there this is from
last year we're in the atrium where they
were setting up a and you exhibit
actually that is a new exhibit it's
supposed to it was supposed to look like
that just really quickly I then led
reformed an artist group and I led our
intervention into the venice biennial
and placed this work of my own on
Censorship in the arts in Quetta some
article these are artists let's say
these these two artists for instance
I've had artworks that were supposed to
be in past biennials that were censored
because of well you never find out why
so so she was going to put she was going
to replace the signs on the vaporetto
stops with rivers same signs but in
arabic and he was going to put a big
black cube in the middle of a casa san
marcos so presumably the city was
worried about you know either you know
anti-islamic or or pre-islamic violence
but i found out that one thing about
censorship is that you usually never are
told directly why it's being censored so
that was an interesting project also for
me to find out about censorship this
version of the piece another work in the
series was actually in the enclosed
godini where all the pavilions are for
the venice biennial and had just
dismembered heads because these were
artists who had been threatened with
arrest or physical violence like AI
weiwei who has had been disappeared at
that time in april april so spring 2011
so so this piece got a lot of nice
publicity and and has led to various
commissions I'm going to go a little bit
quickly here this one where we were
working
scientists using biosensors so a very
robust technology this is a little bit
old at this point 2013 robust technology
of heart rate sensors which you can use
to trigger a signal that says now plant
some wild growth here in Liverpool and
the idea was to sort of take back the
city overwhelm the city with wild growth
vegetation but not just any vegetation
you had to decide are you going to be an
indigenous planting native plants sort
of taking back the city or an exotic
ater planting exotic invasive invasive
plants that due to climate change are
now moving into the the Isles of the the
British Isles here you see the interface
this person is just paired their heart
sensor with it with the app and the
heart then starts beating and we use
this relax to win strategy so so you
can't just say okay I'll run through the
city and cover as much as territory as
possible it that makes your heart rate
get too high and then you don't plant
you and if it's too low if you're just
standing there it doesn't plan either
you have to find a tempo where you can
maintain a relaxed state of mind while
walking through the city with its ups
and downs its staircases its trucks
rushing by people on the streets and
only when you are in tune with the city
and its rhythms does it plant at then
10-second intervals so so we worked with
a World Museum they have a botanical
collection that was that was brought in
in the 1800s actually starting from then
exotic plants from America Africa South
Africa this is inside the museum we've
planted lots of those plants so the
plants are coming out of the archives
and and spreading out through the city
and here are native oaks defending the
Liverpool docks and of course this sort
of
versus invasive is used just normally
when dealing with plants and you want to
like help remove the invasive plants
from from the park that are taking over
but of course there's the subtext here
if you talk about humans with the same
terminology you get right into where we
are right now with refugee crises I live
in Germany we had on a couple weekends
we had 50 thousand refugees coming into
the city and at that point you know the
u.s. is going well maybe in the next
year we can take 10,000 refugees if we
really look at them carefully we were
getting $50,000 of refugees coming over
the border on just a weekend you know we
had Germany tooken 1.2 million refugees
last year at that level ten thousand
you're not even on our map I'm sorry
you're not part of the solution so we
took the project onto various other
cities the real contrast of course was
in dubai in the desert so here's some
native plants populating the desert and
of course in the desert you can only
live in oasis and dubai and these rich
our Gulf states are really about
terraforming creating new islands and
creating a new territory out of the
desert and we brought and then of course
the invasive British plants that used to
be a british protectorate so there's
also that aspect here are weary
colonizing them but you know what if you
have if you're if you're if you're rich
if you're wealthy if you're in control
of your own destiny then then you say oh
beautiful little exotic plants it's not
a threat as it would have been then for
instance a hundred years ago or
something so the the gentleman in the
textile super were rather delighted to
have their photographs taken then there
was the other aspect of course that
actually we were part of a festival and
most of the helpers that we had were
were actually women young women from
women's college and they're my you know
six foot
five six and a half foot male partner I
was saying I can't tell these girls that
they should put this thing on underneath
their clothes right up against their bra
it's like I can't do that you know so we
ran into other interesting cultural
issues when dealing with the body in in
in that context um another project I did
which is also I'd like to do a follow-on
was dealing with the shard and the
neighboring guys tower at King's College
London to work with a clinical
psychiatrist dr. Dominic Fitch whose
work is in PAL anoxia these are visual
disorders and one of them for instance
is Polly Polly opia wear something in
your visual field just becomes detached
from the actual object replicates across
your visual field and then you know
stays there until it decides to go away
or a really fascinating one losery
visual spread where the texture from one
object spreads across to another object
so we were trying to do a our
visualizations of these visual disorders
give people an idea of what it would be
like to have your have you have your
world transformed in this way out of
your control now these things the
version I did then was essentially
handmade i was using geo locative AR
because it turns out the i was hoping to
be able to use environmental mapping but
this The Shard is is hugely tall and it
you know the depth census just didn't
read up to there so I had to sort of
fake it with with geo locative AR and of
course the thing wanders around so this
is a project where it'd be really nice
if I could work with computer vision
people to see if it would be possible to
do a version that really does take
something out of your environment
then replicates it or takes the texture
out of your environment which might be a
little bit harder and then spreads it
around but in this project we want one
thing we found out as I was building
this experience I was talking with dr.
Fitch and saying well what happens is it
comes suddenly just fade in does it
leave suddenly does it fade out is it is
it around you or only in front of you
and he said I don't know no one's ever
looked at that it's very interesting we
found out that all of the questions that
had been asked for always very static
it's no questioning about the dynamic
process of how of how these episodes
came and left and and you know when you
walk around what happens to you so so he
was really amazed and said you know
we've never even thought of asking these
questions there's a whole new line of
research here that could be done that
only came out of our discussion of this
and there was a very interesting
interview at the opening party I didn't
talk to the guy and then I get the the
video recording afterwards and this is
scientists saying most artists are
parasites sucking knowledge out of
scientists for their own purposes and
this is a rare project where both sides
are profiting I thought it is a great
it's a great quote I wish I had talked
to the guy and I understand you know I
understand his feeling because they do
come from a technical background but um
but it was a little bit harsh wording
perhaps so um let's see ok I think we're
doing okay so now a couple of local
projects this was one time last year
with my mother who called me right when
the talk was supposed to start she's a
Japanese arts expert and master
calligrapher so we got an invitation at
the wing luke museum in Seattle to do an
installation in a room and pretty small
room and then mom who has been doing
this calligraphy on paper for decades
and winning prizes for it here in Japan
all of a sudden said you know I'd like
to I'd like to try doing it on mylar and
and spread spread it across several
sheets and
whole idea of doing this this this piece
was to try and bring calligraphy as an
abstract gestural art closer to a
Western audience because a lot of lot of
times Japanese or Chinese can't read the
characters either because they're so
abstracted or it's an old form of the
character so they appreciated as visual
art and of course you know anyone in the
world to be able to appreciate that too
so she had multiple sheets was
separating the characters in ways that
you do not do ordinarily so that when
you look from the side the character
does not fall together does not read
when you look straight at the front it
does but these multiple sheets and then
a breeze that from the ventilation and
the cast shadows meant that there were
these several layers of of the strokes
over and not not only on top of each
other but also moving with respect to
each other constantly and then we had an
iPad with my autumn ented layer on top
of that so if you you can swivel it
around and if you look through then you
see for instance other people then
basically enveloped with the with the
Augmented layer in the front and various
layers of the calligraphy and of the
shadows in back to create sort of a
total installation a total surround
installation beyond that beyond the
gallery installation we also did this as
a public art installation with geo
locative AR again and came up with
rather long list of 18 locations around
the city that were important to us as
part of our family history we have been
in the Fugit sand area for four
generations I'm half German half
Japanese so you know there's an
additional component there but but we
were looking for sites that were
important to us as a family and as
japanese-americans so I came up with
rather surprising things like the
Seattle Center I mean part part of it is
that my mother's an organizer at the
Cherry Blossom Festival this is the
cherry blossom logo and
the pavilion where they hold the cherry
blossom festivals right there but I also
found out in the course of the research
that the the person responsible for the
wasp waist design big Steinbrueck head
was also the reason our family was in
Seattle he was a friend of my father's
and invited him to come and teach at the
UW and that's the reason why we settled
there and then the International
fountain mom said oh yeah you know when
we were living in Japan right if we're
coming to Seattle a couple of graduate
students came by and and they had just
they were submitting a design for this
fountain and they were asking our advice
on it so hot so this is something that I
had never ever heard of I was five years
old at that time in Japan so I found out
that this you know this this site really
has a lot of connections we put up the
character for audio Roku 4 surprised
because when we came to the city the
whole Seattle Center was being built up
it was called century 21 you know they
were imagining the the the 20th first
century even though that was nineteen
sixty one another site that I discovered
was a site of family Japanese American
history the pike place market I hadn't
realized until I was doing this research
that until the internment in world war
two two-thirds of the stands were run by
Japanese Americans and my grandfather
and great-grandfather who were farming
down in five at the kind of in the south
of South Sound also said sold their
vegetables there this was way before the
war but that of course completely ceased
to exist the japanese americans were
given three days to pack everything get
rid of everything and then were put in
internment camps and that almost meant
the death of the pike place market so so
that incident in 41 really listens was
the beginning of the decline of the pike
place market as the actual farmers
market and then this is just a shot in
gum alley around the corner that that I
really like mukashi mukashi
talks about long long ago it's a
standard way that fairy tales start out
so thinking back on my
great-grandparents and and my
grandfather's generation and then and
then John very kindly invited us to do a
reprise of the piece will be showing it
in the the King Street Station will be
showing my Lars and then people will be
able to go out into the surrounding
neighborhoods and look at things like
this nyguy inside-outside Chinese skate
who's the insider who's the outsider
here especially as japanese americans in
the chinese-american district so um so
that'll be happening in in October
inside inside this beautiful old
historic building I'm not sure if I'll
be able to come but um but it sounds
like it's going to be a fascinating
festival and then I'll just go through
really quickly you're the first ones
getting getting a show of these images
this is what I'm here in in in town to
do a our installation again on global
warming for the olympic sculpture park
so I've mutated native plants so these
farewell to spring have developed little
antennas and if you look at them now
they're not feeding just off the visual
spectrum of light but of the
electromagnetic radiation smog from your
devices they'll expand words you try and
engulf you you might notice there's some
stuff floating in the sky those are the
bull would help that I'd always wondered
what those strange things were on the
beach as a kid and then I found out that
these beautiful and fantastically
beautiful bullet kelp will actually do
reasonably well with the warming waters
and so here there they've become mobile
drones so that they can come on land if
the water's get to be too soupy and
they're feeding off detritus not only in
the water but detritus that they find in
on the lands the here the signs from the
elliot avenue and and then a bit closer
to the water this is great they were
doing some sort of work on the sculpture
and there's this strange creature here
but i'll but then also my bullet drones
and then these things which are
alexandria macat anella which calls the
red tide and the red tide is poisonous
toxic algae which will do really well in
the warming waters thank you and so
there are blooms in the spring where the
water turns red yes more towards the
coast but it is it does come into the
sound and is projected to expand as the
waters get get warmer so these are
microscopic things but they've got these
spherical shapes they look really scary
and then in in my installation then then
they spit out these spores that sort of
spread out and swarm around so I invite
you to come actually on the 25th at 4pm
I'll be holding a tour there but it's
open throughout the summer until
September 30th and there there are going
to be kiosks with posters with
information on how you how you see them
in this also open guided tours on
Sundays 12 and 1pm an interesting little
point of a linked website to this I was
doing research talking with various UW
climate scientists and came across
interesting things in one one study that
I link talks about how essentially by
2050 at this point repeater pretty much
will have a 5 degree temperature rise
that puts us in a range of temperatures
that have never existed in the course of
human civilization human civilization
goes back maybe somewhere here humans
homo sapiens goes back here I think six
million is consider
the beginning of the hominoids we're
going into territory that we've never
encountered as the human race so one
final thing very different and
installation where I reread in your face
I work together with a composer who who
does a lot of improvisational
compositions using data collected from
various ways here we had a little a
little camera that that recognizes your
face projects it large there on the on
the screen and it transforms your face
scans your face and transforms it into
your own personal composition so instead
of doing you know where how big is your
mouth what's the distance between your
nose in your mouth and that sort of
biometric things I was taking actually
chiaroscuro blacknwhite data and feeding
that onto my composure friend and he was
transforming than that into into music
and the whole thing is being played out
on a metallic own so the projection
surface and the musical instrument is
this metallo phone like a xylophone that
sheets of metal each one tuned to a
certain frequency of the 12-tone the
scale with transducers that are that are
taped onto the back so this is a one in
the same time the the projection and the
source of the music itself I think
that's the end yeah I do have some
videos if people want to see a little
bit more things but that's sort of the
sweep of the work for the last three
years thank you I'm sorry that I like a
little bit so you explain what is the
difference between a friend of reality
and virtual reality yeah basically a
term virtual reality is being stretched
in many many ways so as it's at its core
though virtual reality means that you
are you are in a completely synthetic
virtual world
it's it's in stereo so so I mean the the
fantasy is is that you can't tell the
difference between the real and the
virtual world but the virtual world is
hopefully a lot more interesting it's
not it doesn't look like this you know
it looks more interesting so so stereo
and and right now the form we're getting
I just tried out the HTC vive which has
very good graphics but you you are
totally in a completely different world
you can walk around it hopefully you can
interact with it in some ways they have
controllers that you have in each of
your hand with a little bit of buzz
feedback if you touch another object or
something the problem with that is that
is that you most people get seasick very
quickly that's and that's the reason why
i was going to these mono scopic
projections large screen projections
without you know without this without
the stereo without the headset because
there you can my the three pieces that I
should that I showed are very much about
movement through space you can walk
along the Berlin Wall you can you know
walk through a fantastical Venice yeah
you can walk within the internment camp
and and and discover that you can't get
out that sort of movements through space
is unfortunately very difficult with the
with the with these stereo headsets
because they produce them unless you are
actually physically able to walk which
means that you know you're constrained
to a room-sized area or there's various
tricks where you can think that you're
walking in a straight line but you're
actually turning around so augmented
reality which is for instance what the
Microsoft group is doing with the hollow
lens is saying you're seeing the
environment but but you're placing
virtual objects on top of it that you
see in in in the most common case right
now in your mobile device over the live
camera or with the hololens it's being
projection projected onto the lenses
that you have in front of your face I
left out anything
yeah he received your presentation you
basically mostly assured static images
of the experiences for the experiences
themselves i presume are very dynamic
assess piano before anything but so when
you when you go and think about
designing something like that how what's
your thought process on on the fact you
can't the right people attention
necessarily you can prevent them from
going different places so how do you how
do you think about design in a space
where there's individual freedom around
it may be missed part of your artwork or
visualizations or right here said
because that element of movement it's
actually very important it's just a
brief clip of the Hoboken cherry
blossoms being a festival and then and
then I'll let this run in the background
here's the beyond Manson art piece yeah
and that's that's a really big issue
that people are struggling with now and
and the point is you have to be willing
to give up control and the classic when
I was starting to work on on things and
this is back in the mid-90s when I was
starting to work on designing virtual
worlds I was looking for information on
how I could create a dramatic experience
for my user without having without
having that control and actually the
friend I work together with on this
piece it's a theater director and she
said I wanted beginning I want to middle
with a climax and I want an end and I'm
going like well this is an installation
people can walk in and out at any given
time so I can't you know we can't do
that or I don't want to do that she was
saying can't you make it so you know it
restarts every time someone steps on a
plate or something it's like yeah but it
doesn't it's not it doesn't fit so so I
found I found information all the
information is basically focused on
people you
you have to find you have to have a
character who's really interesting and
then you have to have a character who's
really nasty and they have conflict and
so so everything is about creating drama
between people and I was wanting to
create drama between the viewer and the
environment and it turns out my father
spent his life working on this basically
looking at it from an architectural
urban planning you point to about
dramatic experiences in sequential
spaces and so I was taking that
information and saying well it's about
having variety in the spaces you can't
you can't force someone to walk through
a building or a park at a certain rate
but you you can you can draw their
attention by by putting interesting
things or what we did in this piece is
basically there's always only one way
out to another scene there's a this it's
usually a door or some sort of space you
have to enter and and you make it sort
of compulsory that's you know that's the
only way out so that this space is
actually this piece is actually if you
will a necklace of experiences and it
does have sort of a high point when
you're in the middle of a war and has a
low resting point which will which is
when you're sort of alone with a desert
but but you have to be able to willing
to let people walk around and use the
people as the trigger so lots of
proximity sensors here when you enter a
space that triggers something if you're
doing something with characters when you
walk up to the character that's when
something happens and then think of it
not in terms of one single art but say
it's it's episodic and and when they
talk about classical em classical drama
theater narrative structure they talk
about they talk about the difference
between of I'm blanking but let's just
say a dramatic structure or an episodic
structure in episodic saw something like
the the the the Iliad where you
lots of different adventures you might
think of it as you know a series of TV
shows is has an episodic structure the
sort of this overall arc of what's
happening to the to the people but each
episode has its own small dramatic
points so so it's a collection of all
the of these different strategies where
you're saying okay there will not be one
grand story but but I will provide each
I will provide various encounters that
are that have elements of surprise I
found this great book emotion and
meaning and music written in the 50s by
a musicologist where he talks about the
way you you create emotion is by
creating expectations I think this is
going to happen and then you surprised
those expectations or you put a twist on
it or you fulfill the expectations and
then you surprise them so you play
around with the with the with the users
with the viewers expectations to create
these these surprise moments positive
and negative and if you only do negative
the person is going to walk out if you
only do positive they're going to get
bored so you know it has to be a
variation on positive and negative
spaces it has to be a complete world
which is why I took five years for each
of these because it was just a lot of
work to create an experience that would
allow for a variety of experiences in no
matter what direction you go for
instance here if you you know if you go
to one of these islands and say okay
i'll just try jumping off then you drown
and then you are reborn and there's a
lot of places where you can die here
there's a couple hell's and stuff like
that so so each time you you die you're
reborn but the world changes every time
you wake up again so so you have to be
willing to create a different sort of
experience and I've taught I've taught
classes on this
got various papers talking about these
I'd be really happy to send you a link
if you're interested but it's also you
know it's it it's all strategies that
that that I've developed over the last
20 years or so working with this and
then the challenge with the ER glasses
is the fact that that the movement is
you know movement is problematic and I
tried with a with a vibe I was overhead
valve just last week and and and and
basically you could walk a little bit
but then for a little bit further they
would have you teleport that's a
disconnect all of a sudden you're not
sure where you are exactly even if you
chose the position yourself because it
looks different it'd be a lot better if
you could walk there and I want to see
okay if i say when i am when i am moving
through space i cannot turn my head does
that help for instance and you can only
turn turn your head when you're standing
still or when you're actually walking
around that's the sort of thing that I
need to play with because movement
through space is so important for me in
my past worlds or you have to stay in
one place and that the experience coming
to you are you working with with VR are
you building in VI yeah actually so many
attack you're here yeah it's just so
interesting benefits like what you talk
about fighting Frank you a narrative
right make sure that people get
different parts of not miss it versus
versus bunch of idiots yeah of
experiences yeah and so I don't even
within a single yet I mean I said notice
the most with your world especially in
that German camps actually you play this
nice contrast between things that are
important things are not important most
of the walls are kind of simple up there
yeah and then you know you have
images for any lot of pictures that
grants your eyes and national garage
that you better focus there but any I
think all of those are pretty
challenging to counterbalance yeah yeah
yeah and you have to you have to be very
clear about what your focus is on what
sort of experience you're trying to
convey at the end of the design do you
uh how do you focus primarily on the
artistic aspects of it or is the
educational come deeper message would so
like did you try to force a message and
make sure that people get the message
are you okay with them the message being
kind of suddenly there and they transfer
in Steve's I'm really okay I mean I
would it I think you know if I would
like to do more of things in line with
medical Hodel which is a very visual
experience the I hate to say educational
but maybe it's you know the educational
or the informative aspect always creeps
and I don't seem to be able to get away
from it so you know I thought Maddie
Kota was going to be purely fantasy but
it turns out that you know the whole Abu
Ghraib prison scandal came out during
that time and and you might have seen
one of the world's had the guy in the
you know the the the guy who's had a
black pointy cap over him and and was
told to stand on a box and if he stepped
down he would be electrocuted and the
little girl who was napalmed in Vietnam
they were in one of my hell's so and the
the whole Klu Klux Klan thing came out
as as you know the Abu Ghraib scandal
broke and and people you know people
were we were talking also there was a
lot of racial invective that was going
around so it always creeps in but for
and with this piece we got funding
essentially from kind of a historic
preservation
part of the city funding structure it
was the part of this city cultural
Senate that was memorizing the Berlin
Wall and what we decided to do was that
the the virtual world experience should
be it should be about presence it should
be about being there it should be about
being able to walk along the wall
measure it with your body experience it
you should be looking yourself and
trying to spot things and so we have
separate from that about eight posters
that summarizes the most important
information also a booklet that you can
buy four like around 15 bucks that has
that and more has a timeline and and
have that separate you can choose to
read it or not you can choose to read it
before or read it after and then go back
in but but we keep this experience about
engaging your visual senses and your
kinesthetic sentences that really are
invoked with with this sort of
projection even if it's not completely
immersive and we got we got we get be
from both sides specifically with this
project there was one you know one
review said well the pedagogy was too
heavy and then other ones have said they
didn't even put any signs on the
watchtowers telling what year it was
built and out of what material you know
so we basically for this species
especially get criticized from both
sides one side says we didn't do enough
the other one says he did too much and
you know that's that's also a decision
that you have to make but I don't I want
to have the artistic freedom for
instance with thee with the piece I'm
doing right now in the sculpture park
gardens of the Anthropocene this the
background is really important to me I
mean that realization that you know
we've we're now hitting temperatures
that human civilization has never
encountered that came out of one of the
studies that I read for this but
but I wanted to provide an emotional
experience when you're at the park and
that's why I decided to go to these
mutated plants that we're doing all
sorts of weird things and kind of kind
of attacking you oh and when you when
you go to to look at them so it has to
be your decision and then the question
is how do you provide that that other
information and for me it's it's usually
keeping it fairly separate I'd love to
see more talk more with you and see what
you guys are doing now are you thinking
on doing anything with you organized
with the whole is um if the yeah I mean
first off I have to get my hands on one
they're kind of expensive for for an
artist with no income I would love to
the the field of you is is is of course
a problem do you know do you know if
it's possible for them to at least make
the field of view why a wider vertically
because because i think that i think i
think again that the that the vertical
sweep is more important you used to
going like this but you're not used to
going like this alright boy speaks
russian girl ground I suppose this very
well yeah I mean I'd love to i do I took
it out a friend was able to borrow one
over weekend we took it and I said well
does it work in the garden because you
have a small enclosed garden had trouble
with the bushes but and and it was also
to light out out there but I you know I
would love to I would love to work with
that and really try and push it and and
I have a lot of experience working with
low polygon count and and creating
experiences that that are rich despite
the fact that you have a lot of
technological restrictions so you know
so are you are you part of the are you
part of the group I'd love to talk to
the the hololens group also you're going
to stay for love yeah so if you want to
join us for lunch we can the
hand up oh yeah that'd be great so no
one else will thank you because I was
amazing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
