you
we welcome everyone it's my pleasure to
introduce hola Swenson from EPFL ola
works in approximation algorithms and
odd years he keeps up coming with some
very nice algorithms and today he's
gonna tell us about one more thank you
good to be here yes I will talk about
the new approach for approximately a TSP
we see classical problem and then we'll
see some application to some special
case of metrics so you know I think most
of you know the problem but let me start
with a gentle introduction with some
nice yo gruffy so I suppose you want to
find the best ticket formula song where
I'm working to learn where I'm coming
from you know you can go to to what do
you do you go through web fill in the
appropriate details then you push like
the search button the needs are some
patients this is Miriam working in the
background then usually you find some
good ticket ok so maybe 200 euros would
be the price to check my homepage there
is a bank account number which yes it is
an easy problem because it's the
shortest path right shortest path will
pro from Los santalune but you could
spice it up so suppose you want to be
stole these cities now we ask yourself
what's the cheapest way to visit only 60
what's the shortest way that's one
possible solution and this of course
this is the TSP problem but we like a
lot than many books have been written
about it yeah so I would say you know
this one for classical benchmark problem
compute sides both from theory and the
heuristics it's been studied actually
from the 1800 pretty nice that's we get
the name Hamiltonian cycle phone from
Hamilton and you know even though all
this study I think it's still a Mayo
confirm what we can have she with the
fishing commutation and in many areas
both yer istics this they saw bigger
bigger instances but also for my
approximation I am so in
basically our two variants and we don't
have a good understanding what we can do
in these two variants and the two
variants that we have that's the most
simple variance we assume that you have
symmetric distances okay so you have a
if you go from you to be it's the same
distance come from VT you okay there you
have the famous case to feed us 1.5
approximation oh it's like a
forty-year-old algorithm and still the
best maybe so I don't know if the only
argue did but it's a good are going to
do so it's a 1.5 and it's still the best
and then you have a decimator case so
it's a more general because we don't
make an assumption that the distances
metric okay but you still have the
training and this is the more general
form will be the focus of this
presentation so maybe some people find
it you know hard to motivate a symmetric
this be like this more natural with the
symmetric distances maybe so let me
spend one funny slide on why you should
care about doesn't matter it is be 0 if
you don't feel it's naturally athletic
comment you should come and visit law
son it's extremely Haley so you can see
there's a big difference of going up our
filter downhill ok so now now you know
it's a nice problem so let's look at the
definition so input one way of defining
this as follows we have input on edge
wait the digraph and so here is our
input and we have length you should
think of this is one way streets and on
an edge we have the length of the street
so it's 131 now is a symmetric this
might be 5,000 and the goal is to find a
tour that this is each city at least
once so note that i'm allowing myself to
be hit easy too many times ok that's
necessary or its equivalent to assume a
triangle inequality otherwise the
problem is extremely hard cannot do
anything ok so we won't find a cheap
toilet visits each city at least once so
let me redefine this an equivalent way
using graph theoretical notions ok so
what do we want to find we want to find
a sub set of edges so that the graph is
connected because we want to find every
we want to visit each vertex and it
should be on lyrium so it should
correspond to a tour so
elyria means that in degree is equal to
the article and that's an equivalent
formulation so that's what one we won't
find a minimum weight connecting or
layer multigraph so I write multigraph
because I'm allowed to use the same
street many times so you can have the
same copies of of a user many copies of
the same edge so that's the problem we
going to work with it any questions he
good so we want the device audience
responds so there is like babe we know
one way and that is to formulate a nice
relaxation often referred to help
relaxation and if you have this point of
view it becomes quite natural so you
have a variable for each edge which you
think of in the integral in the intended
solution this variable should equal the
number of times you pass this edge or
you cross use the road so don't object
differentiation is just that you
minimize the total sum the weight of
purchase and the number of times used
edge and then you have to write down
that you want the graph to be connected
on a leering so Lyrian just means that
you have a constraint for every vertex
this means the sum over all the edges
going out from be should equal the sum
of a way some of the edges going entity
so that's illyrian and then you want to
have that is connected so you avoid any
sub to us if all the subsets of V you
have that this actually is one outgoing
edge okay so this is also called subtour
elimination constraint because you want
to avoid south tours yeah yes so that
that's the relaxation so now the name of
the game is to like we can find a
solution here how do you massage it into
an integral solution without losing too
much okay so i would like to argue that
okay so how do you do so I think there
are in fear at least they're too
available approaches of running is LP
and and they come by the intuition that
we have two sets of constraints so
suppose I completely drop the red
constraints I forget about them then
then what this del P del V says find me
an only ran graph that is cheap okay
that we can solve in polynomial time of
course here you could put everything to
0 but think about everybody that has
degree 1 then it's a mean cost cycle
so then we get a polynomial-time
solvable problem so if we draw one of
this the red set of constraints then you
won't find a mean cost or layering graph
in particular can find a psychic cover
that's not more expensive than a tour so
then you is easy to find another graph
if I don't have the connectivity on the
other hand if I drop the layer and
conditions then maybe I won't have a
connected graph that's all so easy right
you can find a spanning tree okay I mean
actually if you drop the red condition
isn't the solution x equals 0 yeah yeah
so I said okay so I'll keep that
everybody has at least one at incident
tram otherwise that's also an easy
problem so but it's even easier if you
drop the red constraints without adding
any other but yes keep the constraint
that every vertex has degree at least
one then it's also an easy problem
otherwise yes okay so either you
maintain a lunesta but then you drop
connectivity and you try to fix it or
you drop or learn st you get
connectivity and then you try to fix the
parity later on okay so let's see what
kind of arguments you get by looking at
it in that way so if you drop
connectivity well then you get this very
nice think easy to understand repeat the
sidecar value case we have our graph now
find a min cost cycle cover okay that
has cost the most opt it's not so hard
to see because of this one specific
cycle cover but the graph is not
connected so what you do is to find a
representative in each component find a
side cover costs at least at most again
at most opt repeat okay so here you had
total cost most free time soft okay so
you have basically a the approximation
guarantee you get this the number of
iterations you repeat okay so now if
you're really unlucky all your cycles
will always have length too so you'll
get like log base 2 an approximation
album so now you think like okay I could
not be really unlucky all the time right
so you should get some cycles of length
for a non that like in a significant
fraction of the time that turns out to
be really hard to prove so there was
this very nice initial paper fiscal be
at my fuel in the 80s that proved this
analyze this
cedure should show that it's a log base
2 an approximation now it like took 20
years for blessed to somehow ensure that
you all not always get cycles of length
2 if you gotta say open 99 log base 2
because you might yeah yeah accept it
yeah you might yeah okay it's not so
unlikely that it yeah it's good good you
at me there are examples weird the aria
my croissant where you're not careful of
selecting with psychos pic gives your
low base and not not crazy I mean if if
the distance is very widely they do it
very behavior it's in your interest to
find really really small cycles don't
connect the why why should I find sex
fonseca because they're cheaper cuz you
don't have to a big talk don't cross to
other places yeah but the all the edges
have the same length than the top of
course it's always um yeah sure oh yeah
but you see I mean their graphs they're
weighted graphs where yeah this ad was
willed living exactly don't do that okay
yeah so okay good he changed the stylist
likely but it's still amazing to me that
it's I mean I'm not saying that it is
really hard but it's kind of amazing I
think that it is hard to not do better
and always to him and the best here is
by mohit them oh if they get the 0.67 I
think right to third log base 2 an
approximation using these techniques so
by changing the psycho stupid okay so
that's the first first point of view now
we can also try okay so we tried here it
seems to be hard to do significant
better than log base 2 m so what we can
do is try the second point of view so
it's easy to find a connected so that's
the key stuff that's the same thing as
in case the fetus right if you'll know
in the symmetric case you find a
spanning tree then you correct parities
after finding the spanning tree but
that's the 1.5 by mr. fearless but now
just let me just illustrate that this is
also pretty hard for a TD okay so what I
want to say is that in case the feeders
you
can find a means for spanning tree right
and you can always correct it in a cheap
way by paying at most October to 480
speed is the situation is very different
as we will see here so let's look at
this example all the blue edges you
should think of us being for free the
red edges are really expensive so
basically we want to if we want to find
a cheap tour we only want to use one at
one red edge that's the best war okay so
let's let's try so around we need to
find our undirected spanning tree that
would be a spanning tree like that okay
for example that's a mean cost spanning
tree because the blue edges are cheaper
done done the red and now we have to
verify the correct the part of these two
guys because this is out to be one in
with zero this is in degree one out to
be 0 and if you think about it the
cheapest way of doing it this you only
need to use one word edge and the blue
edge so everything is great you got the
best tour okay but let's now start with
another Minko spanning tree it's a of
the same cost so so so beaufort Minko
spanning trees now let's look at the
guys that we need correct parrot off it
turns out to be these ok and now if you
think about for a while you can see that
you actually need to use all the red
edges to crack this which is a bad thing
so if you make this example bigger this
can show that even if you start you
cannot stop an orbital Minkel spanning
tree in a symmetric case you need to
have some further conditions and this is
a big in contrast to symmetric case is
what to do and then then there was a
very nice paper by as a two governments
or gran madre severely who formalized
what you actually need to get what what
so we want a spank trip to be cheap
right but this example shows that we
need another condition for this tree to
to be good for a TSP and the condition
as if a sufficient condition is
something called fin crease it's not
necessarily sufficient
okay so it's a it's a nice graph
theoretic problem which is actually
unweighted so suppose you're given a
kedge connected graph a classical
theorem says that if we were given a
catch connected graph then we can find
at least K over two disjoint spanning
trees in that graph okay so this is the
if I look at one cut in that graph then
they exist as panik reusing at most two
edges crossing this cut all right if I
fix one cut exist as bankley only using
two edges is it exactly kidding you
lovers so it can be the hitter more than
periods do all your passion to okay
fraction of that is it no no okay yeah
okay so let's fix a cup of size k then
their shit okay don't clearly there
exists a spanning tree of using two okay
otherwise if we freakin already cut is
to over K fracture perfect all right so
now what does the finn creak on a frame
three promises well find me for three
that is simultaneously good for all the
cuts so you don't fix the cut before
selecting the three now you select the
tree and it should always be good for
all the cuts and here alpha is the
parameter so clearly alpha has to be at
least two by adoring with we said the
form but for what can we do alpha okay
so we want to find a tree that is
simultaneously doesn't use much more
than alpha over k it shouldn't do use
more than alpha bouquet fraction of
touches and this turns out to be a
sufficient condition because then you
can use safa call Hoffman circulation
feel so without going to this adjuster
if you have a procedure that finds an
alpha country then it actually gives you
an alpha summation for a TSP so that
that is a sufficient condition to
approximate a tsp okay
but this this condition awesome turns
out to be a little bit hard to analyze
so in their very nice paper did Logan of
a log log on then then they show that if
I sample a random tree from that the
solution according to a good
distribution then I will have done I can
select alfa-2b logon / logan which is
basically up the upper shelf bound this
gives a login or log log and
approximation then for special case of
planar and bounded genus graphs they can
show that exist constant increase its
good and then it is a really nice result
by nima here and Cheyenne who is also
here other weeks of this week who showed
that actually the system is a poorly log
log and Findlay ok so there always
exists at the tree so this implies that
the integrality gap is at most poly log
log am so unfortunate so the proof at
the moment is not constructive it also
relies on some a generalization of the
proof of the calcium conduct which is
not constructive ok so at the moment it
looks like the red approach is much
better and blue approach so now so I i
will present the new approach that is
more similar to a blue approach so maybe
it's the comeback of the blue part we
will see so to summarize basically best
approximation i miss Logan over log log
on best upper bound on integral curve is
poly log dog on but the best low inbound
integral cup is too ok so and even more
encouraging disbelief everybody that is
I know that worked on this problem
believes to is maybe they're probably
the right answer like any s at least a
concept I believe in too but everybody I
must believe in a constant ok and and I
also say here so there is no better
guarantees for shortest path metrics
unweighted graph so suppose all edges in
the initial case at the same length then
we don't know any better guarantee stand
logon / logonwfc.html
done kiss defeatist okay so there was
this sequence of papers the last one by
seven billion gives 1.44 shortest path
matrix and it's not clear how to get
anything better with these approaches a
Freitas be because you know in this if
if I can convince you the main
difficulty inside cover approach was to
bound the number of iterations and in
the fintry approach we actually reduced
to the unweighted graph problem so it's
not clear how to use that you're a
shortest path not base if you manage to
use these approaches there you will
probably solve the unit problem okay
alright so what's our new approach okay
so so remember that how we presently we
have done LP with a blue set of
constraints and red set of constraints
and we got the two approaches by
dropping one of them okay so what we
will know now do is to keep the blue
constraints but also keep a subset of
the radical strength first for specific
subset s okay of all the cuts and why do
we do that so we still want this prong
to be easy to solve but by introducing
some cut constraints we can hope that we
can patch up the unconnected components
by not paying too much okay so if you
have some control on which cuts to
satisfy this can lead to less cost when
we patch things together it's less tidy
so did we somehow try so in the cyclic
cover approach it was trivial to find a
side cover but it was very expensive to
patch it up now we make each iteration a
little bit more difficult okay not as is
as fine as I car but the hope is that
this difficulty will help us patching it
up chief okay and under the knife like
the easy statement of state using this
at e is a so if you have a shortest path
mattress or node way to grass then
integral herb is at most 15 and we can
also get a polynomial time 27
approximation algorithm so what this
node weight that is a generalization of
shortest path metrics okay so here what
the mean is that the every vertex has a
node wait 15 to 1 and the length of an
just an old wet when it goes out the
length of this edge is to blend 50
search is 555 okay of course it's not a
complete graph because thanks very easy
problem so the length of any is not
present in the graph this is shortest
path so this generalizes the shortest
path metal unweighted graph that was
considered for symmetric tsp all right
yes in this case the value of the toy
stuff yes I had some some example you
know from intuition from Norway to
suppose you want to visit all these
cities then you have different weights
based on where you want to go more often
so this I I like Chicago and Buster but
so I visit them in January this year and
I'm from I'm from Sweden but I've never
seen something like that in my life
there was so much also there is a more
serious motivation may be so it's not
too far away from general matrix because
the metrics that we actually need to
solve for this problem has a if you use
the relaxation that we use has a very
special structure so the edges that
appear in our graph first of all you
will have a laminar set family with a
value for each laminar set so suppose
this status value one this as to this
for and is free and now the length of an
edge will basically be the sum of the
values of the sets it crosses okay so
are in our case basically what we have
taken is allowed my family will only
have a single thought if you would have
a generals lamina family though it would
be general matrix okay so this is the
situation for symmetric for a symmetric
there's two kind of sets if it's crosses
as going out or in but basically this is
the situation so general matrix have
also very nice structure if you use this
relaxation is forced by a duality all
right so what did we do yes or our
approach so remember the idea was to
find a smart c4 which we can solve this
problem so let me now define what kind
of sub set of constraints but we are
considering and what
the what the problems will be solved and
we call this problem local connectivity
this be so the input is an edge weighted
I mean the input is a TSP instance okay
the same as a tsp but now you also given
a partition of the vertices so here you
have a t-spin sense and a partition of
the vertices and now remember that we
always want to find a new layer and set
of edges but also satisfying some cut
constraints so code constraints we just
want to satisfy is that each cut the
feinberg partition should have at least
one edge crossing it that's the only
thing so so here one potential solution
will be this is an alluring subset of
edges and I cross each cut so that's the
kind of cut constraints we will satisfy
one final layer and set of edges across
it yet so if I have a single tons in my
partition then especially cyclic cover
but if I don't have a single tones then
it's different okay that looks like easy
problem right or at least for me it
looks pretty easy so the the the thing
that makes it not to is is that our
objective function is also a little bit
harder than than the 80s be objective
function so in a TSP you sum up the
weight of all that is right so here our
objective function says that each
component should be cheap okay so let me
define this in the unweighted son's
first so that it makes sense okay so we
say that an algorithm for this promise
alpha light with always output the
solution f so at each component
satisfies the number of edges over the
number of vertices most alpha so this
means that locally it looks like a good
tour okay so if we look at this
component here okay I visit two verses
and I use two edges that's a perfect
tours alpha is 1 if I look at these
verses here this compound here I use 6
edges and I visit fiber so it's like a
six over five approximate or and what
I'm saying is that it's an alpha light
album if each component locally is an
alpha proxima tour
so here's 1605 so yeah actually so yeah
so what I can note here any questions on
that definition so I want to find a
subset f that crosses each cut and each
component should be a good tour good
here alpha proxima tour so why why is
this easier than designing an alpha
approximation for a tsp so suppose you
see that suppose you have an alpha
approximation for a tsp what can you do
you run that you get the whole tour that
has alpha that is alpha proximate
clearly that is a component that's the
only component you have to worry about
so that's that's the solution ok ok you
can also generate this definition to
general weights but people tend to get
confused here so let me escape it then
remaining of the topless worry about on
weighted graphs ok ok again sorry just
the condition before this the condition
isn't it has to connect all these pieces
to the partitions it has to cross there
has to be you know it's cut defined by
this partition size why not have to go
up so each pitch cut where you put some
of the parts or monitor yes so it's very
similar to the login opposes accept that
then you become opportunity for the
carpet movie thick edges on it so yeah
yeah yeah if you learn to pick any edges
yes and then also you say ok I will want
to be one made out of this car but only
if you make all the edges and lotus in
your novel yes hello search the same as
sorry have anything so it is the same as
saying if you put a click on each part
of the partition then the resulting
graph is connected right yes it comes of
it
okay that's a live with Miss Lee so
right now we found a tour here right in
this I don't require you to find tour
that the graph is connected after
contract I don't require I just require
that they that each cut discovered yeah
so it's weaker so start color qualities
do you go about this picture is
misleading you would have have this one
pizza if you removed it yeah I kind of
remove this here this here will not do
it to be their wisdom eat no because
then the there's a card consisting of
the left half and the right huh yeah but
I'm not crossing that yeah I might want
to seem too cuz these taking one of them
was out today so the cuts I worry about
this discard oh he's got this person got
can see and I could have removed on
individual yeah I could have removed the
yeah and you carolien is coming out of
that or I mean since it's only are young
it's a second in no but you do people
ages inside as well yeah I pay for
largest constraint is just on the edge
yeah but you might because you didn't
say no you yeah yeah exactly so as I did
here I picked so much this insight night
and enduring it elyria Missa tee okay
good so yeah it's easier but actually I
main technical result is that if you can
solve this problem then then you can
solve the 80 speed problem okay see if
there is an alpha light olive logo
connectivities be done in Tagalog
apparatus be at most five alpha and 9
alpha proxima tour can be found in
polynomial time okay if your album for
local community that is be well informed
okay so this seems to give the power to
patch things together okay now the
problem okay so we have an easy free
light arguing for no Dwight the matrix
that's why we have a node with this you
could generalize the definition of local
cognitive day this be to general matrix
but the only place where we can solve it
right where we can solve the where we
can define an alpha light for constant
alpha is no way that matrix so that's
why we have we have a free light so this
gives you the fifteen and twenty seven
for know where the matrix
okay so let's now so this free light if
you like this is easy to at least
unweighted graph right like you find a
psychic cover that's one light now you
have to do some stuff when your general
partitions but it's kind of not too
amazing to think that there is not too
hard I'll going for that case so let me
not worry about let me skip that and let
me worry about how to prove this theorem
how to use this power to patch at all
and it's not too much too expensive okay
so what's the proof ID okay so the first
approach would be a lil bit with mijita
hinted at well we have something that
very much looks that the log n so we
start with a completely unconnected
graph we saw a local connectivity a tsb
with the partitions with single tone
says partitions then you get something
like that right you get some something
that cut that task every vertices out
degree at least one okay and these guys
achieve this cost you at most opt alpha
hoped with it was alpha light okay so
now we have connected that so now we can
run local connectivity is beyond this
partition so you find this set of edges
ok so again you pay our fault okay
because you but that's not good so here
we ok here it was good because you only
run two iterations but again but if you
do that then the total cost will be
number of iterations type of the times
off so it's even worse than we had
before so that's not great so so we have
to do something special here and I think
what the most special thing is our
initialization and the initialization is
also why we have these two different
results for polynomial time and not
polynomial time ok so let's what what is
our initialization so we do some
lexicographic in initialization so here
I have the graph I can draw it
so so now so of course we going to use
that we have alpha lifestyle being
flocculated acsp so what i will do in
the initialization is too so think about
i will select the bigger cycle in the
graph and this will be my starting point
so my first thing I select is h1 I
called hy store that's the Lord's
connected component asset to alpha light
tour of course if there is a 2 of a
light or in the whole graph this is the
whole graph and we solved the problem so
this is not that's why we have the non
pas la Malawi argument than a phenomena
okay so that's my first component why do
I do that so so let's look at F if
that's a bellerian subset of edges that
is alpha light then I claim that the
number of vertices the number of edges
in F is at most alpha times the size of
the number of vertices in h1 store why
is that so how might you know that the f
is alpha lighted number of vertices in F
number of vertices Nova versus is at
least F over alpha right because it's
alpha light so if F is greater than
alpha times VI one store that means that
F is alpha light and also contains more
vertices of late one store but that
contradicts our starting point we
started with the biggest component that
contained a 2 alpha light or so then F
should have been our h1 store instead
okay so that's what it buys us okay so
we know that everything that is alpha
light that intersects h1 store has cost
at most roughly be one store the seeds
already it just yeah it doesn't it's
okay good yes it doesn't even eat
insects yeah that's good okay that comes
in the next picture so now h 2 h 1 star
was the biggest guy then I remove it
take h 2 star to be the biggest guy in
the remaining graph now I say if F does
not intersect H
one then it has cost that most alpha
times V to the store by the same moment
because otherwise I could have replaced
vh2 store with off and I will get the
better lexicographic order okay okay and
I do this okay the last guys might might
be single tops okay that's my
initialization yep if you connected
component major component of the graph
yeah yeah yeah so so please so how can
the two intersecting like that I mean it
isn't connected and so so think of this
as a deceit tour these think of this as
a cycle of the longest line in the graph
when you should connected component
what's really it's connected but not an
opportunity it's a connected thing which
has this property largest such so the
whole graph cannot be Danny already
solve the problems if this is the
largest sub graph which is connected and
has this problem icic yeah yeah yeah
it's not the connected component yeah
yeah good it's that it's if I induce on
the vertices and be one store then it
has a tour of size 2 alpha so forget
about connecting I don't let me find
such a thing no that's what I'm saying
so so I'm claiming that of course if I
could find it then I will just change to
25 when I would be done so that's why I
have these two different factors three
and nine yes good good all right so now
we have done any more questions on
initialization okay so now we have our
initialization it costs us to alpha
times off because each component is to
alpha light we have a tour here using
two or more than be one so the purchase
so what would our wish list the of the
merchants that be well one thing would
be okay suppose we can connect the graph
but we only want to add alpha light
components okay so that we short vh1
store at most once okay so this guy he
insects d1 stores we know that he has
cost the most alpha v 1 star
by the previous augment this guy he
intersects the biggest guy in Texas h2
store so we know that this guy he has
cost at most Alphabeat to store this guy
he intersects the biggest gay sex is 8
free store so he costs utmost at most v
alpha v free store and so on ok this is
at most alpha beef so if we could do
that here I short h1 h2 h3 and h4 be 85
they should be 85 so it short everybody
at most once it done it then I would be
happy right because then then i will get
too well for plus another alpha for
because I short everybody at most once
okay so that that would be an ideal
situation where we could short everybody
at most once okay so that that's
unfortunately not completely true so let
me explain how we do it by looking at
two extreme cases after the
initialization okay so so first k
extreme cases that after initialization
all my starting components were exactly
the same size they say they were off
they were oh it should be opt / k it
should be off the l n over K because we
assume it should be not open yeah n over
K is everybody is of the same size yeah
why is it easy problem you see wait okay
what is this what is the size of any
Alpha light graph alpha light subset of
edges in a graph is at Mos Eisley one
stop right which is op de lo que and now
how many such guys we have to add to
connect the graph where we have to add
at most K minus 1 like in spanning tree
we have to find like a connected graph
with K components we have to add at most
K minus 1 guys and each guy has cost up
double K so we have to say here we add
these are alpha like guys and in total
we added here is 4 plus 6 so it totally
other k minus 1 guys but every
do you know that every that that is what
we proved before that everybody has
cited most be one store which is october
k we added k minus 1 money so so in this
case you actually get alpha to patch
things together plus the initialization
with two of so this is a very good case
where the initialization actually
resulted in even size component alright
so let's look at opposite case where you
have after initially says you got this
UT guy and now we have all these small
guys okay alright so now we solve local
connectivity this be as we know we can
do okay so now everybody gets to the big
guy right that that looks problematic
because now i can only say that this
guy's is a most be one store this must
be one store so i will get a horrible
approximation here okay
so the night here is the second claim
when we have such a thing then the claim
of the red edges is at most two alpha v
1 star okay and why is that okay think
about it so so the red edges they are
many more than v1 stores at least a red
guys they contain 2 v1 store vertices
because they are alpha light the red
guys are alpha likely contain 2 v1 store
edges vertices they cover 2 v1 store
purchases which more than h1 store so
let me do it here okay so so what we
will do is to consider graph H store
which the Union on h1 store and all the
red guys you graduate the owner h store
is the union of h 1 star and all the red
components okay so now we want to
calculate what's the number of vertices
of this guy well it's at least 2 v1
store versus lets it has all virtuous
let's say or is the number of vertices
in this red components let's least 2 v1
store okay because its alpha light and
it was it's a it was we are supposed two
words contradiction of this bigger than
12 ova 1 stores it has least two we were
so vs and now how many edges does this
graph have it has we know that h 1 star
was to alpha light so h1 store has two
alpha the one store adjusts the red guys
are alpha light so they have at most
alpha times or edges okay so we have it
has at most 2 alpha v 1 Star Plus alpha
or edges now if you divide this by or
well here you get the most alpha because
this guy is bigger than 2 v1 store so
here you get the most alpha here you /
ors you get alpha so this means that in
that case H store was to alpha light so
if we suppose that they that the sum of
this was bigger than 12 e1 store then H
store itself was to alpha light and
clearly it's bigger than h1 store so
this will also be a contradiction to the
initialization
credit that is a duchess so it's clear
that one of them is that must be one
store but what is nice is that all
actually the union of them is at most 2
v1 store and that's what we use here ok
so now now of course we are happy so
here it sits for up so okay so this was
two extreme cases and the final five
actually comes because you have to
somehow combine these in a clever way so
you get to alpha from the initialization
you pay alpha for the first case I'm to
over for the second case and then you
get five okay but I thought the merging
was I so I stopped or something the
whole marching because people found it
not so intuitive but the day it gets a
little yeah it's it's a kind of short
but it's a little bit you have to be
careful how in which order to add stuff
to obtain this okay some open problems
let me finish with this so actually so
we have presented a constant factor for
no wait at a tsp and I said for shortest
path metric for tsb there's better than
kiss the fetus but what about no way
that tsb symmetric tease be so that is
now the finest I have a way to each
vertex the distance of an edge is the
sum of its endpoints okay that's a
special kind of metric and here I've
been thinking I think some of people
will be thinking and here we don't know
how to do better in his fearless so this
is somewhere in between the general
metric in the shortest path matic found
weighted graphs I think it's a good open
problem but but yeah I would be very
interested in a solution and then
obviously there is this constant for a
teaspoon general matrix so either you ed
you can find a fin tree or you can solve
this local connective date it's been in
the general case but that's the two
approaches we know of course there can
be other ones ok so what do we do I
explained existing approaches then we
had a new approach to relax connectivity
and actually you can improve it a little
bit so so instead of having 50 you can
get 13 for node waited but I have no
idea like two seems to be the right
number and I don't know how to get there
and there's a nice open questions in
both cases okay thank you what happened
okay so you didn't see by clicking sound
or ladies where people you actually so
this this the I don't know where this
the main tactical theorem that's that's
what you're referring to right so
actually that is very generals the only
thing you need to do sorry where's this
here here here so here we had a number
of edges over the number of verses right
so the only thing of the change is the
weight of that jizz and then you have an
assignment of ways to the vertices so
this lb v prime is just I have an
assignment of weight the cost will be
paid for visiting this vertex and the
main theorem holds as long as this is a
non-negative function and its total sum
of weights your sign three birds is at
most i'll provide so you can assign it
as you want but the question is now one
you have a sinus weights can be sold o
conectate it is be but you're free to
assign them as you want so an old way to
be a steak it's natural to take that the
is the amount you pay for vertex is
simply the number of edges going out
from it because all that is there have
the same weight
