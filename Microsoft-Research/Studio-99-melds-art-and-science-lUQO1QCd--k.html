creative coder he's from New York City
he's been here with us at Microsoft
Research and he's also studio 99 s first
artists in residence the first week I
was here I really had no plan and I was
just meeting as many people as I could
so I met Charles loop and was excited to
see was working on a system that was a
way of capturing people in three
dimensions and I had a reaction to it
when I saw it so I wanted to work with
it to make a new piece so I took his
software and the the way he'd worked
with these cameras and I worked out the
engineering side of it to how it would
work at a larger scale then worked
directly with him to adapt his software
to scale it from a five-foot ring into a
20-foot ring to capture actually to two
individuals at once
one of the nice things about James
project is that he's after sort of the
aesthetic of the of the form and not so
much the full on realism which is what
we're after so the end result I think is
going to be pretty interesting they'll
be connects monitoring sort of the whole
perimeter and if somebody approaches it
it'll trigger the whole sequence to
unfold it's very short sequence of maybe
five seconds max of these people
following and then they'll be replaced
by the same people but in a different
pose so it's kind of like they're
contained within the call
