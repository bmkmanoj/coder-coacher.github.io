of the features we have implemented in
our copy aware of software prototypes
one feature we've prototyped allows a
user to produce a real-time
visualization of all the content
duplication operations originating from
a single file imagine an information
worker having recently begun a paper
writing or grant proposal process on the
graph produced from her current document
she can see the website she downloaded
the template from two distinct versions
she created and the collaborator she has
emailed so far by showing the copy/paste
relationships she can see the resources
she used to create the document and by
expanding to show individual edits she
can see that each collaborator received
a different version of the document with
the same name as another example imagine
a home user with a digital photo
collection because the copy
relationships are tracked and integrated
into the files metadata the standard
Explorer view can offer integrated
information about source files and other
copies and the user can use his standard
desktop search interface to quickly
locate files based on usage criteria
like which ones he uploaded to flickr or
sent to his friend jesse since the
system understands the file
relationships it can warn users when an
action they are taking may have
undesirable consequences for example a
user who thinks he's deleting an
unnecessary copy could be warned that
the file is actually the last of a
unique version that he may wish to
preserve within his archive these
prototypes have allowed us to prove the
technical feasibility of copy aware
computing systems and to explore their
potential benefits through formal
demonstrations and real-world
deployments with end users</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
