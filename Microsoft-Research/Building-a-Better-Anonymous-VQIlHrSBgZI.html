next one and I've been reminded many
times by biela to keep it to 12 minutes
did you close it you closed it so I'm
Joshua Corman I should make a few
disclaimers number one my comments and
analysis or my own and may not reflect
those of my employers I did Allah this
research on my spare time on my free
time I made it very clear to separate
this research from the kind of things
that I do for work but i am the security
community and one thing that we
different between the analysis that
biella has done and the analysis that
Queen has done is I deliberately kept
myself an outsider so I wanted to do
open source observable analysis from
what you would find if you weren't
joining the ircs if you weren't
participating in operations etc so
therefore mines likely to be less
accurate on purpose but I wanted to
experience anonymous in a way that I
thought the press should have but never
did at the time which was as a
technically informed you know part of
the security hacker community what does
this look like and how do you process
this and understand this so therefore
it'll be wrong at times we approach this
thing called building a better anonymous
as a way to cause dialectic with
anonymous and about anonymous at the
time we did this was his last with
summer of 2011 we started this process
we had wild inconsistent theories about
what anonymous was and wasn't and turned
out half of them were dead wrong so in
the spirit of Nietzsche we called the
panel at the hacker convention called
DEFCON DEFCON 19 we call it whoever
fights monsters because we're trying to
say to the hacker community it may be
tempting to take matters in your own
hands we
actually had a running theory that most
of anonymous was white hat hackers by
day working in the security industry
frustrated with no progress so therefore
what's the best way to catalyze better
security to demonstrate insecurity well
while that is true in some cases in and
on it is not universally true in this
dialectic help reveal that so I wasn't
going to do this but given all my
hallway conversations I'm going to do a
Pecha Kucha or potaka 20 by 20 primer
anonymous it's about a year old but it's
still pretty useful given the kind of
conversations we had so once i hit go i
cannot stop and i should say in advance
i am not now nor have I ever been a
member of anonymous alright the study's
cabal all right here we go so I wrote a
piece for a magazine called
understanding anonymous the rise of the
chaotic actor because I was sick of the
silence and I wanted to understand
anonymous and our silence for a long
period of time and our fear prevented us
from getting further and understanding
it so I turned that into a panel at Def
Con 19 which is the hacker we we shared
our theories and not screamed at by
active members of anonymous until we
were dead wrong so what I first take
away from that interaction and the scars
was that they're a bit of a Rorschach we
see in anonymous what we want to the
narrative up until that point said more
about us than it did about them and that
may still be the biggest takeaway is how
impressionable that iconography is in
the second big takeaway which we now
know a little better is that there is no
singular monolithic anonymous it is a
brand in a franchise borrowed by many
it's a composite there are many
different motivational structures and
levels of participation and some never
talk to the others and some don't ever
join an IRC they just associate and
identify with them so attributing a
single narrative is misguided now I had
some cognitive dissonance perhaps you
did are they good or are they evil I
love this custom artwork we had done I
looked at things like you know leaking
the collateral murder video is really
good which is the wikileaks thing and I
felt like that one important to come out
but I looked at things like posting the
home addresses for wives and children of
Arizona police department is a bad thing
so I did what any self-respecting geek
would do when I does
off my dungeons and dragons three by
three turn and there you go so what I
realized is it's not good versus evil
that's the wrong question its lawful
versus chaotic or trending towards order
and turning towards chaos so while
anonymous does in fact have Robin Hood
types working justly in principle ways
to do good outside of the system it also
included in the low sec precincts things
like the Joker who just want to see the
world burn a much nastier meaner and
less just streak and we wanted to
confront that so I think it's chaotic
actors was the appropriate term there's
a lot of sex a lot of anonymous sex and
I'm at SEC TSU dirty filthy people this
is an incestuous family tree of the
different sexes done by geico system i
love this it's not even a hundred
percent accurate but it shows all the
splinters and branches and remarriages
and plural marriages and but at the root
of that tree is 4chan and b and they
have lessened less in common with Martin
Luther King jr. a lot more with Cyndi
Lauper they just want to have fun right
this isn't civil rights activist even
though it has attracted some very
principled rights focused people so they
have much more in common and I believe
your film beautifully illustrates their
heritage now what they do share is
attack technologies so at this point
they have a high orbit ion cannon but
the lower of it ion cannon is a pretty
unimpressive rudimentary ineffective dee
da stool which gets a lot of them in
trouble because it didn't really
anonymize themselves but it did take the
form of some sort of digital picket sign
or protest now speaking of cannons these
folks ended up being cannon fodder they
use the tool in Operation Payback and
found themselves arrested because the
tool doesn't do a great job at
anonymizing its users and there were all
sorts of compensating controls and I've
met several of these folks now including
mercedes's in the film and they also
share cultural themes and in the
building a better anonymous series we
touch on some of the pop culture
zeitgeist items like Fight Club right
there was a common street when I would
meet some of these folks in person of
angst unspecified angst
life made them feel powerful this and
this made them feel powerful part of the
reason was the outlet but also like the
Fight Club zeitgeist you choose your own
level of involvement so it may start
that you live in San Francisco and you
participate not Bart and that's it
forever or it may be that you get
addicted and you start doing more privat
persistent in global campaigns maybe you
taste the freedom that comes with
helping oppressed people in Tunisia in
Egypt and you're hooked for life so
there's different levels of involvement
but there are also different levels of
escalation at the time of writing this
anonymous had threatened to erase the
New York Stock Exchange from the
internet and while it was unsuccessful
it scared the out of people and
government right it showed they were
becoming more emboldened and brazen now
one of the things we challenge them to
do at Def Con was pick more clearly
noble targets perhaps which makes me one
of the moral they hate but we
challenge them stop child pornography
out corruption and one group called
Operation anonymous analytics exposed to
corrupt bank in China using hacking
systems and understanding the nature
financial services my bigger fear was
never anonymous but those who take
anonymous's name as a false flag cover
in my day job i noticed tons of false
flags were people dawn the banner and
iconography hiding their nefarious
organized crime or state-sponsored
espionage activities they are heavily
infiltrated and postured I also fear
that powerful and uninformed people in
government make powerfully uninformed
knee-jerk reactions and I don't want to
see some form of cyber Neil McCarthyism
yes I just said cyber where I have to
declare that i am not now nor have I
ever been a number anonymous because I
you use a network sniffer but this is a
very real concern when people are afraid
and guess what things like anonymous
make people afraid so I I did at the
time field an anonymous pasty fork in
the road
if they were increasingly painted with
the broad brushstrokes of a domestic
terrorist organization then the moral
minority may flee and increasingly
contaminated brand on the other hand
there was a chance to perhaps if you
take a page out of philosophy Hobbes
Leviathan a Leviathan could rise some
sort of organized chaos some form of
social contract that may reduce the
aggressive nature but still maintain
some of the benefits and this has been
hotly debated and some people love this
idea in simple hate this way out of
selfish convenience and protection
perhaps there's a way forward so the
easy answer slide is blank bizarre
weren't any so instead I gave you some
pop culture zeitgeist e-type items which
I believe help people understand either
as source material or as analysis if I
there's a wonderful academic paper on
the laughing man and the ghost in the
shell is metaphors for this but there's
a lot to be learned now in 20 slides x
20 seconds we are not going to make
everyone experts but if you haven't
stared into the abyss if you haven't
looked at how much of your understanding
of anonymous came from what you put into
it now it might be the time with is this
cabal to start encouraging that kind of
dialogue so that was six minutes and 40
seconds on the nose but now I will pivot
slightly to what I was originally going
to talk about take a breath another
project i participated in his uh Michael
Gross it was just here this morning he
wrote a piece for called world war three
dot o the battle for the internet
between the forces of chaos and control
it's an excellent accessible article
that even my mother-in-law understood
but essentially I got an argument lunch
with commander x one of the more willing
to engage folks in and on he's also in
the movie my daughter thought he looked
like a pirate and we had this debate
where he basically said if I have to
choose between tyranny and control i
will choose tiering and my retort
instinctually was don't you realize that
one fuels the other and what you see at
least if you're watching with the policy
maker
the lawmakers are doing in reaction
partly due to technical illiteracy is
the act of rebelling against censorship
and surveillance seems to scare them
which makes them want to do for
censorship and surveillance I'm not
blaming the victim here I'm just
remarking on a dynamic where it's kind
of like a Chinese finger finger trap
right I mean we have this situation
where there's a very rapid escalation
between too much chaos and too much
control and one of the points to the
panelists and the people profile in that
article was really that the nap that we
were saying upcoming but in Dubai in
December the world telecommunications
union or the ITU the International
Telecommunications Union at the wicket
the world of Congress for information
technology was trying to take a free
open Internet governed loosely by this
idea of a multi-stakeholder model and
make it the domain of sovereign nation
states to tax to tariffs to surveil to
prevent things like tour and skype and
VPNs for lots of selfish and fearful
reasons it's an existential threat to
what an ons treasure about not about the
internet but not just an ons what I
treasure about the internet so while
many were dismissive of anonymous as
pranksters or script kiddies or whiny
children I've heard all sorts of insults
hurled their way I didn't learn about
threats to Internet freedom from my
congressman I learned about it from
passionate involved members of a non so
while I'm not for or against I look it
on now I'm sure my panelists may
disagree but the best way I explain this
to my neighbors was you should look at
anonymous that was my time we're 30 more
seconds you should look at anonymous as
perhaps one metaphor is the antibodies
of the internet and if you think about
anybody's anybody's attack blindly and
aggressively and they won't cure your
cancer now we could treat this
diagnostically and say the presence of
an elevated white blood cell count maybe
diagnostically valuable that something's
wrong so rather than judging what they
are I instead question what were the
drivers that led to this emergent
property
with so many psychologists and
sociologists and anthropologists in the
room it's my sincere hope that we could
focus less on what they are and more and
where they came from what's driving
their evolution and where it's going I
see this is the first wave and I'm
keenly interested that what we're seeing
is the erosion or the absence of a
social contract with post national use
and it may start reveal the dark side of
hyper-connectivity and the pendulum will
swing we will find balance but that
dialogue isn't happening in a
multidisciplinary way so my ask in hope
is that some of us could help start and
participate with some of you in that
research and discussion so thank you for
your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
