hello I'm Matt Smith and here are our
planetary predictions are predictions of
ecological and environmental phenomena
of course the entire surface of the
planet sometimes from soil carbon to
agricultural yield predictions to how r
or density is predicted to change in the
Amazon to predictions of ecosystem
structure and function and we're showing
them off here in this puffer fish 3d
interactive display where we've made up
the entire surface of the planet with
these different predictions that we're
making so let's look at one here are
predictions one of the things we're
really interested in is how agricultural
yields are going to change into the
future under climate change and these
are our predictions of how from a simple
model of wheat yield where we've
combined representations of how it grows
and how it responds to changes in
climate with data that's available using
advanced machine learning methods to
make a prediction about how will heat
yields be impacted as the world warms up
the red showing that under extreme
warming scenario yields of decrease for
by up to fifty percent and green showing
that yields will increase by up to fifty
percent here's another prediction how
soil carbon will be impacted by climate
change you know one big question in the
scientific community is how much carbon
dioxide will list soils of the world
release as they warm up if you release a
lot of carbon dioxide then we'll get
even more global warming so here we
again we've used machine learning
methods to combine stately our soil
carbon models with the global data
that's available to predict well under a
climate forcing scenario which is this
where we've driven the model with
climate model light boots how much
carbon will for example the Arctic
tundra lose as we go forward and lastly
this has never been seen before so I'm
very proud to show it are our
predictions of how ecosystem structure
and function will change into the future
or just simply how does it change across
the entire surface of the planet on the
sea and on the land by ecosystem
structure and function I mean things
like how many species are there
what treats do they have how many birds
are there how many carnivores I mean
ectotherms warm-blooded and cold-blooded
animals and here for the first time
we're showing predictions here of
carnivore abundance across the surface
of the planet and so looking forward
we're really excited about seeing what
having this information and further
analyzing this information and data
might mean for science for society for
software and for ourselves each year
