superstar here it's been as usual a
really great place for networking
I love this the setting in this
framework actually I guess your start
floating run in your head and
relationships start forming great one
you can have some sort of synergy
emerging between different fields and
new applications summit is a really
great place for this because typically
the conference's I go to will be
somewhat specialized and focused on my
particular field you know it's a
non-specialist conference only I'm going
to security conferences and i'm watching
security people speak interacting with
other collaborators or potential
collaborators actually learn about some
of the new directions i could take in my
own research part of my job is finding
partnerships for our research as an
island in faculty some it is a lot of
smart people coming together I think the
people I see here are basically the best
people from the community she it's it's
the whole group it's nice to talk to a
bunch of people that I wouldn't normally
get to talk to it's been great from the
the personal connection perspective I'm
getting to actually hear a lot about
these things that Microsoft is doing
from a research perspective that I was
really unaware of before meeting these
guys is fantastic and it's bringing my
research into their worlds as well the
faculty some of this in addition to
being like really informative and super
interesting also great way for me to you
know continue to meet my friends here
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
