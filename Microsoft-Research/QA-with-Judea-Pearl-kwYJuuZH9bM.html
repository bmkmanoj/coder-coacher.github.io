hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
and welcome back Chris Cashman here live
in Redmond Washington hopefully you
never left wherever you are I hope
you're enjoying the Microsoft Research
machine learning summit as much as I am
some fantastic information some
brilliant minds on display today in just
a minute we will be joined by Professor
Judea pearl who you just heard in his
keynote they're eager to take your
questions about machine learning and
cause-and-effect relationships there if
you have a question for professor pearl
you can submit that through that chat
room on the right side of your screen
it's right there and you can do that and
without further ado professor welcome
how are you today I'm doing great cuz
we're very happy to have you on our live
online broadcast we know you just did
some heavy lifting on stage so thanks
for carving out time with us here
backstage our viewers are eager to ask
you some follow-up questions based on
hearing your keynote but before we open
it up to our viewers I'd like to ask a
couple of questions of you if you don't
mind a lot of your work is concerned
with causality why do you see this is
such an important topic that's why we
talk that's the way babies then the
maneuver themself in the environment
that's the way scientists think and
communicate this is what science is all
about cause and effect and all the rest
are just surface phenomena well speaking
of which we have a question on the
surface regarding that and they say does
causality really exist isn't at all just
really correlation I never heard this
question before but it makes me think
it's all correlation yes one one can go
to that extent and say it is it could be
reducible to statistical relationship if
you have all the variables in the world
you can even be reduced to deterministic
relationship without correlation if you
have all the variables in the world
confounders the disturbances the all the
unobserved noise terms yes but this is
not helpful
the way to handle causality at least in
my experience is to capture it so what
it is there's a new phenomena that
demands its own algebra its own
mathematics and regardez is the source
for what we see in life we live with the
correlation which is a reflection or if
you want a reduction like a reduction
from a 3-dimensional world to two
dimensional the shadows into the things
that we can estimate and what we call
correlation but causality is the
cause-effect relationship are this
source of what you see and another
question for you from our online
audience viewer wrote us and says you've
written on the phenomenon of transfer
learning the idea that both in humans
and machines that the more one learns
the easier it learns this seems to be
completely natural to this viewer in
terms of how they as people learn but
why does it apply to machines as well
well the more machine loans even in the
classical machine learning the more
relationship it has with which to form
features and the atomic relationship
with which to which to combine to form
more complex relationship so this is an
explainable even in traditional machine
learning such as classification and so
on the paper that I wrote on transfer
learning has to do with the the
phenomena that by learning a certain
relationship so you get the ability to
generalize them to new environments
YouTube utilizing those relationships
that you learn
together with your model of what makes
two environments the same with what
makes them different the combination of
the two pieces of knowledge gives you a
ability that you don't have without it
maybe the ability to determine how to
transfer knowledge little environment to
another another question for you from
our online audience here
data mining and predictive analytics
have been around for many years now so
why do you think there has been a
renewed interest and a lot of hype in
this area over the last year I don't
really understand it I haven't followed
the development in data mining or
knowledge mining for me knowledge mining
means transfer inferring the
cause-effect relationship we're behind
the data which we call knowledge or
which we call understanding okay and I
haven't seen much work on causal
understanding in the data mining
community and therefore I do not
understand the state of advancement nor
do I understand the recent type if there
is one thank you for - Big Data yeah
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
