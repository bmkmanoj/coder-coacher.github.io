research lab in Beijing in China and my
name is Kip thunder at them from China
as well today we're showing a research
project showing the future what we
believe a voice communication and
unified communications this is our demo
called the translating telephone now you
may know an upcoming versions of
exchange you're going to be able to
transcribe your voicemails we're braver
we transcribe entire telephone calls and
even crazier we try to translate them so
let's see the system come into my office
here in sunny Australia and what I'm
going to do is I'm going to use office
communicator to make a telephone call to
my colleague Frank in Germany let's go
Frank hello hello now you'll see that
everything I'm saying here is being
automatically transcribed by speech
recognition and then pasted there live
into the communicator window so as a
result we have a live transcription of
everything i'm saying and that's saved
in my exchange inbox so I can come back
and search for it in the future now
that's already pretty cool but we can do
something even better Frank you've been
awfully quiet yeah I've i just kinda
english pleasure yes because i speak
more english but yet we can understand
you perfectly why is that my vienen de
la bastie maha canaan conn automatic was
at some convenient Alyssa because our
system speech recognition and automatic
translation combined she was that song
sustained by Tyga given everything i say
is recognized by a speech recognizer and
passed to the automatic translation
system and then we synthesize it here on
my computer using text to speech
synthesis we do have the same thing in
german we're not going to show you that
today now of course accuracy is a
problem Frank can you give some comments
about that yeah often system niche
perfect yes obviously the system isn't
perfect our makanda heights I know in to
highlight on time at fuel but you can
already do a conversation
we have actually developed part of the
system by having a full bilingual German
and English conversation now one of the
things we've done a lot of work is
getting very good speech recognition
results here if you look at the system
here accurately is pretty good because
we have built a personal model for me
and the same thing for Frank that's
totally automatic all I did was make
telephone calls and system automatically
learned my voice ok that's it for now
buy from me yeah shuffle husband easton
site i refresh dented far few dunk
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
