you haven't seen this image it's a store
that's going out of business patch out
of business store that's next to the
community 10 as street level retail
takes internet at a classic response to
this dilemma is that this is a cyclic
problem that the American consumer will
eventually find a credit card down the
back of the couch and go back expending
like a sailor on shore leave but I don't
think that's happening this time not
just because the stores that are closing
but because of the stores that are
stangl you walk out any commercial strip
in New York here's how it goes there's
back then this place to buy a cell phone
is frozen yogurt there's a shoe store
there's a drug store then there's
another Bank branch and another place to
get a cell phone it's like a
hanna-barbera cartoon with the same
scene at your bldg by over and over so I
don't think this is cyclic I think this
is structural I think this is another
episode of something that's only happens
twice you previously in the last hundred
years and Thomas about previous columns
the first one was the lofts in the 1950s
people who make glassware and belt
buckles in Manhattan real
to make belt bottles in that happen and
they left in the landlords and the city
said don't do a thing don't change
anything because you never know when the
belt buckle guys are kind of going to
come back now eventually lost got
converted the living spaces first or
artists end for everybody but he took 30
years then it happened again in the 70s
the oil shop in the containerization
meant that big ships stopped pulling
into brooklyn and the people are all the
piers and the city said whatever you do
don't change a thing because you never
know when the big ships are coming back
we knew when they were coming back
relationships were coming back the day
after the belt buckle guys and now it's
happening again the Internet has
evacuated whole categories of
street-level Commerce we've already done
books and movies we've already done
music and music and comments but now
there's people working on shoes and
kitchen appliances and furniture and
it's not a fifty percent of that stuff
needs to go online to change the
landscape because when five percent goes
on the store that's got the worst
margins tips from profit loss so what do
we do neck last time with the loss we
converted them to personal space that
will work because people don't want to
live at street level and with the peers
we converted them to parks but that
won't work we can't make these spaces
public because they're enclosed and
they're often small when you might never
be able to make from social because
that's what's going miss back in ye
olden times in 1997 if you wanted to buy
something that generally meant you had
to talk to some time and the internet is
taking that
transaction and interaction and we've
sliced in half when is removed the
interaction piece up into the ether
often a good effect i have to say
there's been a lot of time hanging out
in comic book stores when I was young
and I can tell you from firsthand
experience the comic book stores are
lousy places to buy comics their daddy
stock and their values them but they
were great places that right the
question is will people pay to get the
interaction we used to get as a side
effect of cops and the answer is yes at
least in certain circumstances we can
already see people doing this now if you
talk to anyone who goes into a hacker
space or a co-working studio or a writer
they always say three things they say I
wanted to get out of the house they say
I wanted to place their work they say I
wanted to be around other people they
always price in their desire to be in a
place with other people into their
rationalization this is more than just
the coffee shop overcharging you in
favor going to provide the hangout space
this is an affirmative choice in the
direction of social we're used to
thinking that the retail spaces are
going to fill back up with Rita but we
actually have an older model of this all
on the street that we can see our
streets run lofts street-front churches
move it these these are not commercial
they are not selling a product at least
not one you can buy on the open market
and they don't have a business what they
say is if you like it here we're going
to pass the Hat and that's it and they
pass the Hat and they manage to get
enough money to keep the place open in
both senses of being so what do we need
if we want more of that if we want more
of the social piece of street level what
do we need we need new ways for
cooperative groups of people to come
together to be able to sign leases
together to raise money just to lower
the transaction costs we made in some
cases
zoning changes but those things annoying
as they are relatively easy what we
really need is a cultural change it
doesn't take 30 years to convert lost
two living spaces it doesn't take 30
years to convert peers to cross the
reason those things took so long it took
that long for people to realize that
what seemed to be happening was actually
happy the question I'm asking myself is
this we've seen this movie twice before
we can see what's happening can we do
this in five years or do we really have
to wait</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
