hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
the experience buddy or or your
participants focus on is like you as a
researcher was it take to get to that
stage attention so let's start with like
a home you want of your deployment and
let's say you are interested in a couple
of devices and you already have from RS
through us so the first thing I think
you need to do here is you may or may
not have what we call essentially scuffs
or drivers for these devices if you
don't you will basically write a scout
the scope is a very simple thing that
goes and finds devices on the network
and the whole code is to actually do
automatic search on the networks or your
users don't have to configure the exact
details on how to communicate or contact
any voice ah the reason I've shown it in
queen is that you think of scouts as a
shared community resource that like if
somebody has written a stout already you
don't have to write one and there's only
one scout needed for every protocol type
so you need 140 for instance one for you
know sign-ups wireless for instance
which door jamb is based on so not for
device but kind of quad protocol that
the device beeps and we've written a few
ourselves so once supposed to get us out
that can discover those devices the next
thing you know the our drivers so
drivers are essential entities that
understand the functionality of the
devices so it's not just a protocol
level thing it understands you know
that's a camera that's a moisture sensor
and so forth and again this is green
because the TV think of like drivers as
essentially a shared community resource
if somebody else has written a driver
are you don't need to write on yourself
so in this case we've actually written
drivers for both of these devices that's
why they're here they're so now with
drivers essentially what drivers do in
home OS is they basically export the
functionality of the devices in very
simple terms that we call rose so think
of roses like you know if you're
familiar with web services or something
you know you've got essentially an inter
with some operations so in this case you
have a role like a sensor which
basically says on trigger alert me and
you have a roll camera that says get a
get current image this is what the
alerts application was doing or you
could say whenever a new image comes in
a node this is what the camera viewer
app was doing in our case so based on
these roads essentially what you develop
is your research application so this is
the prototype that you have to write
nobody else can write it for you but the
reason it's easy to write is because you
don't have to worry about the details of
the device or the protocol instead you
program against these roads so this is
basically kind of like a single comp you
mock what goes on the other thing that
you have to write is basically just a
user interface for your application
again this is something that nobody else
can write for you but we make it easy
because you can write it in html5 and
then you can get it on all the range of
devices you have this case like a
fabricated so so these are the yellow
pieces in there are basically what you
as a researcher need to develop and
green will somebody else with develop
and blue is what exists as part of the
platform so going now where does cloud
coming so basically I think of a more
sand cloud integrate in three different
in Ashley phone he weighs one is what we
call like the updater so this is a
service that is running in the cloud
through which by passing with it you can
actually update all aspects of your
experiment you can even change the
homeboys code you found a bug in your
application or driver you can change
that to in which case earnings would now
go fix not no damn driver or the app
whatever broken so you can basically not
control basically every single aspect
and we stole more than nicely in the
sense you don't accidentally shoot
yourself in the foot that we've
separated the update of the core
platform itself from the update of the
apps and the drivers and from the update
of the configuration itself and i think
there's documentation on that so this is
basically you done and only deployment
figured out things are not working or
you want to have features you'll
basically interact with the updated a
second is you built in what we call the
monitor
is essentially doing keeping tabs on how
your studies progressing so it basically
looks for things like is commerce
running a lot is your application
running an art or did it die if your
application is running how much how many
resources this is consuming you know
there could be like a while to loop in
there that God for their princess which
is your entire system user so it's doing
what essentially availability as well as
we saw some on and resource be the third
piece is data logger the inner pocket
are basically API that we let our
applications use and using these simple
API you can deposit any application
specific data to the cloud and you
basically call single stream open to
closed operations and your data
magically shows up in the clouds there a
hundred pieces relayer this is it's
mostly essentially either for you or for
your pretty see pants essentially the
same UI that you wrote that works in the
house magically works outside the house
as well without your users requiring any
kind of router reconfiguration and so
forth and and because this additional
five shows up in all devices and because
it built every layer you don't need you
know separate interfaces for in-home out
and whatnot so these are the pieces
after your as a researcher your
interface to the whole lab of things
would be something like this you know if
you want to update your configuration we
written sustain or in particular great
advert in this thing we call
configuration XTO runs you can take a
look at what configuration is running
right now or you can just do the same
you are you can update what's running if
you want a monitor basically this you
saw a snapshot of this like in ages demo
basically inventor management photo that
shows what what are on the hubs are that
a part of your study and essentially
what their status is what modules
drivers are apps are running what was
the last time it was shown online and so
forth there is a data logger which you
can explore through any number of azure
storage Explorer app this is just kind
of one of them and we believe this is
for life in exploration you know you did
deployment and you could be wanna chat
is the data coming from the house a lot
you use one of these like third-party
storages Lloris to see whether the data
is coming in the club or not but in the
end of course like you will write your
own analysis script that runs against
the data but the nice thing is you don't
have to fetch the data we fetch the data
for you you just write your analysis
scripts against azurite VIX so to speak
so that is again comment yellow there
and this is basically I think the system
so just to kind of sum up but in the
entire system essentially looks like
this the few pieces are pieces that are
part of the platform a third-party the
green we believe the community will
develop with us as Scouts and drivers
and you has somebody conducting studies
you'll have to write your own
application and interface for the
application if he needs it and conduct
your analysis on it and that desire
could have had of swordsmen and you have
your answer any questions any time thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
