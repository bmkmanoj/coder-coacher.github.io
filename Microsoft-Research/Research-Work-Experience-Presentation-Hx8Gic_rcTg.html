good morning everyone those who are in
the room and those who are attending the
top remotely today we have the pleasure
to have a lift area gurgi aunty she is a
PhD student in University of Patras in
Greece and got her master's degree in
electrical and computer engineering in
2007 so for the last six years she has
been a PhD student and had the
opportunity to visit a lot of places
being nine months in the Technic renews
the university of denmark then he
visited phillips research in Eindhoven
in the netherlands and spent some time
in university of oldenborg always doing
cardio research audio processing so
today she is going to talk about her
findings and her results without further
ado liftea you have the floor thank you
very much for the introduction so my
name is Alyssa riyal hadi i'm
pronouncing it also in a Greek way and
then I will give you an overview of my
recent experience during the last six
years of my work so the contents of this
presentation I will initially introduced
myself I although I got already good
introduction and then I will let you
know if my of a topic of my PhD thesis
and I will provide you an overview of it
and I will emphasize on four segments of
my PhD work related to the analysis of
statistical properties of Rome responses
and signals and I will present you a two
methods for the estimation of distance
between a source and a receiver from my
single channel and by neural signals a
method for valium for room
classification and a method a framework
for the middle for a method for the
estimation of acoustical parameters such
as they directed very andres your
clarity
and i will also refer to some side
projects which are not actually part of
my PhD work but i have spent some time
working in other topics while being in
phillips or while collaborating with
other colleagues in my laboratory at the
University of Patras related to
automatically version of an ambien
telephony system a subjective evaluation
of signal enhancement techniques and
finally some work related to
architectural room acoustics which we
have quite some experience in them in my
group and I will finish this
presentation with some ideas for the
future so my university is where I come
from is the University of Patras it's
you can see this red dot this is where
patrons is is like 250 kilometres from
Athens mi a group is the audio intake
acoustics technology group which is a
part of a bigger group called wire
communications laboratory and has all
these other groups you can see here we
are actually a small group I think for
in my opinion so they are my professor
leg the head of the group is a professor
John moods applause we are we have three
postdoc students and we're three PhD
students and there are there is a wide
variety of topics that we've been
working on but the the expertise of the
group is an audio signal processing room
correction signal has been techniques
but there are also some other topics
that they are not so signal processing
kaori let's say I'm for everything for
example a foetus was doing some man no
I'm working on sound reproduction or
novel sound reproduction devices or a
barbecue
working with acoustic energy harvesting
a concerning me a doctorate asif also i
told you about my background I've been
working on my PhD from 2007 and had the
chance to collaborate with other groups
as you can see here and I have spent
some nine months at the technical
university of denmark collaborating with
a dr. Finn Jacobson who unfortunately
passed away last week and they're
getting a good insight on physical
acoustics which this is something that I
didn't have so good background before
that then another nine months at philips
resets collaborating with dr. steven van
the power and tacky karma and since we
have started established a good
collaboration i spent another three
months at the university foldable where
a doctor steven from the bar a goatee
position a professor position hey last
year and i'm now in the final stage of
my pits degree degree i have actually
already finish up finish the writing and
presented in the first committee and i
still have to do the final presentation
in September and something else that
I've been also participating but this I
have also participated in is the
electoral group of alba which is a
grouping of various laboratories in
europe and also in the states and
everybody is working with binaural
techniques and methodologies and we try
to exchange no leads collaborate and to
further improve the understanding of the
mechanisms but also propose some novel
methodologies for signal processing so
we'll start with a basic concept of my
PhD work and pay every
that has to do with audio and acoustics
and of course this is a reverberation we
know very well that room acoustics
introduce reverberation and we can fully
describe this phenomenon with the room
woman's response which can be easily
determined following a standard
methodology with by driving a sweep
signal for example a specific excitation
signal in a room and we record with a
microphone we can divide it in the
frequency domain or Deacon volt the two
signals a time domain and we get the
expressions on valium impulse response
and the room doesn't found in the time
domain and they don't transfer function
in the frequency domain and of course
these are complete acoustical
descriptions containing all the
information we need for the acoustical
properties of the room and how the
acoustics affect the signals that they
reproduce reproduced in the rooms and of
course it's known that the room
responses will vary across different
positions in the room so for example
here you can see at position 1 we would
have a more flat response and less
deviations in the frequency domain than
in the case of position to which is a
further distance my pick the topic is
entitled modeling analysis and
processing of acoustical room responses
and signals and the river ground
conditions and bearing in mind all these
these things that I told you in the
previous slide that the room responses
contained all this important information
for the acoustic engineer my my task was
to try to determine attributes normally
it's easy to extract from responses
directly from signals so getting in the
room recording signals and then from the
signals try to estimate acoustical
parameters the distance between the
social receiver and so on the way we
have approached this problem was is
based on the
okay it is simply a relationship that
the in an acoustic anechoic signal when
it is reproduced in a room it's a we get
the reverberant signal which is a
compilation of their own impulse
response for the four days pair of
positions and the analog signal a in the
frequency domain we would have a
multiplication but we can also face this
expressions of the signal Danakil and
the vibrant signal and that room
transfer function as distributions a
statistical distributions and we try to
determine what are the statistical
relationships between these three
components and try to find whether some
statistical measures are related to
start testicle parameters for example a
directive every one ratio clarity and so
on and try to extract models for each of
these three components with emphasis on
the response part on the room transfer
function and a as a final aim try to
examine the potentials or a potential of
using this knowledge for for the
development of novel techniques signal
processing techniques and so we start
with a sum an overview of I am Alice of
statistical properties of responses and
signals I hope it's clear why I'm
motivated to to do this and I hope it
will get more clear as I further
containing a so as I have already
mentioned we have a convolution in the
time domain which is a multiplication
the frequency domain and then if we were
trying to determine the different
relationships between these three
expressions and I have already done some
work I just the first step was to do
something say to examine this
relationship just by observing things
just taking there is a ver esta grams
plotting them for the analog signal
their response and very vibrant signal
and try to see if they're related how
they change with distance with other
with another room with in other rooms
and so on so the they we emphasized on
the statistical measures of standard
deviation and there is a good reason to
do that as I will let you know in while
and the cute dosage which seems to work
quite well and we try to create some
models for the standard deviations
Iquitos of a room responses and try to
estimate the statistical measures of the
Sun deviation legatus is from the
reverberant signals so the idea was to
find a model for the room transfer
function and then use only the
reverberant signal in order to extract
information for the these statistical
measures of the anechoic signal signal
you mean like a special signal sleeper
give me like speech speeds it can be any
type of signal please analysis it can be
any type of signal the methods are will
refer to afterwards are developed for
speed signals yeah but it shouldn't be
of course sweep signal yeah they is not
to use these excitation signals and use
any component signals so I'm then
writing some my similar relationships we
can we have the convolution time domain
frequency domain a multiplication and
the additional in the DB domain denoting
then each of these three terms as you
can see here with I have also use
different colors we can assume assuming
that x and y are independent random
variables then we can find some
relationships for the standard deviation
this is spectral standard deviation so
we're in the frequency domain we look at
the mud me at the magnitude of the
frequency response and this is the
standard deviation of these three digit
a sigma set the first very vibrant
signal sigma x to the transfer function
and de la y to the signal and we can
find some relationships for days to
statistical measures four days three
yes yes please sorry sorry for Florence
maybe I don't know yeah it's a few that
these things should be positive in the
frequency domain or in general the
complex you mean by positive a positive
things about negative x loser yesterday
yeah so of course you can always say so
sweet sweet sweet sift the frequency
response whatever you want so it's
actually the relationship between the
spectral values that actually is of
interest for us so the actual absol
absolutely values the DB value see they
are positive or negative it's not a
concern at this point is it yes these
are magnitudes yeah and if it's been a
frequency to a frequency beam or you try
to do some general statistics yeah so
it's a for specific frequency bands the
analysis a you can use either one failed
octave fraction analysis or wider
frequency bands I have have done several
tests with in order to find what would
be the most appropriate a frequency and
bandwidth analysis depending on the
application but you want to end up so
the reason we have used some deviation
was that there is a well-known work of
Manfred's shredder in 1954 that he saw
that the specters of deviation when we
are in a distance a for businesses above
the critical distance the son of
deviation respects and deviation
converges to the takes the values that
it's close to 5.6 DB so when where they
diffuse sound field in the room and then
also yet JJ yes the 1979 he saw that the
standard deviation would increase so
when we are very close to the source we
have let's say microphone and the sound
source very close who will have smaller
speakers on division of course the
spectrum would be flattered there will
be more deviations so there is that the
more you increase the distance more
deviations will appear on the spectrum
and
can be captured with a spectral standard
deviation so we have an increase up to
the critical distance of a row which
depends on the evaporation time and the
volume of each of the rooms and
according to the latest theory about
this distance you would have a specific
standard deviation value which is 5.6
decibels so that's why we decided in
this first types of of my analysis tool
to use the metric of standard deviation
which is there was already some existing
let's say no let's about it so here you
can also see some results I using one
feed dog bun analysis or full but
analysis this is the standard deviation
of the spectrum of the room impulses
course across the frequency be exactly
yeah ok 0 means absolutely flat and for
the TV it's a more deviating so this is
the sound division of the response and
we were trying to see as I already show
you this and that we have found a
relationship between the standard
deviation of the of the reverberant the
response and the anechoic signal we were
trying to relate these three components
a and using also this model so they
let's say that then the this is actually
the base the the framework that my kids
the thesis has been I was based on it
and so as a further step we decided to
try to estimate distance from signal
channel signals and the idea is as you
can see here in the figure that is we
have a speaker which is situated the
specific distance from the microphone
and this can be also used in a for
example INEC open a conference call or
if you have multiple devices in a room
you might need to know the distance
between the speaker and the device so we
were trying to find some ways to do that
a one easy way was to okay take the
sound level sound pressure level of a
speaker and say okay
say if it gets closer it will get a
higher and so on but of course this is
not a good idea because it's one of us
would speak in a different way depending
on the weather it is a man or a woman
and so on so we try to use some
statistical features that depend on
distance and relate and employ pattern
recognition techniques machine learning
techniques in order to develop a method
for the distance estimation so as I have
already told you the first thing to do
was to try to observe what is happening
so here you can see remembrance signals
these are speed signals the frequency
spectrum of fare signals recorded at 0.5
meters 1 meter 2 meters and 3 meters and
you can see that the histogram a changes
and this changes could be captured
probably a with ketosis and skewness
kurtosis shows how far is the
distribution from the normal
distribution how picky gets or how flat
it is it changes say this and skewness
shows how a symmetric allottees so we
use these two features and here you can
see how they behave across time I across
a different time frames if the skewness
and kurtosis and it's a evidence of
their really distance dependent so the
idea was to use this to a attributes and
also some other ones related to the
residual of a linear predict a linear
prediction residual which is a which
works mainly for spits also announced
the detector which is this last line of
the of the code and the area using all
these parameters and employing pattern
recognition techniques ok we could we
could the developer a method for
distance estimation from single channel
signals a for this method we have
employed
mixer moldings and use the five feel
they have features i have already sold
to you and they filtered versions only
for 10 to 15 kilohertz so full bump but
also for a smaller frequency range and
we have evaluated the method and you can
see here that when the system is trained
with the same speakers that it's
evaluated the method got seventy-two
percent and then when the speaker is a
is a son known we got a horse and
performance we also conducted a
listening test when where we try to
reuse the same signals have there as the
signals that we tested the method and we
were we asked the test subjects to sort
the signals in terms of distance and say
what is fed very what sounds closer and
here you can see the results of these
same analysis which are a quite close to
them to their own speaker I'm situation
dissolve the same room yes we did the
testing two rooms testing the training
English yeah but so these results are
all the training if the testing is
always in the same room so you train the
same day in one room and you tested in
the same room and exactly so you have a
different of course this is one of the
biggest problems of distance estimation
techniques a right now to find a way to
to have them work in unknown room
environments it was hard yeah and maybe
about 20 minutes of recordings for for
the training and then another 10 minutes
for the testing of the method and it was
very just Jimmy yes awesome does not
yeah yeah okay so the second thing
another thing that I have been working
on was the trying test made distance
from by neural signals which is it would
sit be easier to do them from than in
the case of single channel signals where
you have only one input for this reason
we have I extended our I framework
analysis in this binaural case scenario
so here we can also write the
relationships as previously but in this
case for the two channels so convolution
for the left tunnel and the convolution
for the rights and multiplication
similarly the frequency domain and then
in the DB domain we can simply write the
same relationships and then we do the
trick and we just subtract it then they
write the right spectrum from the left
spectrum of the of the reverberant
signals so by doing this we can we could
get rid of this an occult signal factor
as you can see here and in this way with
a determine some a
it's for the standard deviation so this
the standard deviation of the difference
between the spectrum of the left and
right signals of the reverberant signals
would be related only link to the
standard deviation of the responses with
responses the by neural responses in
this case because we have the by neural
responses so the idea is that sets
afraid such a methodology could lead to
the denomination of the determination of
a novel distance estimation parameter so
as you can see here they we do the
simple thing of just subtracting the
left on the right a signal spectrum
reverberant signal spectrum and we
calculate the standard deviation which
is proved to be a under center a
specific circumstances to be related
only to the standard deviation of the by
neural responses as you can see here so
as I have already mentioned if this was
just balloon response we know very well
that the sun's deviation really depends
on the distance between the source and
the receiver it's highly business
dependent feature when we are below the
critical distance of a room but this is
not straightforward in the case of the
by neural responses at least to my
knowledge there there was known there
wasn't something let's say well
established so the idea was to take if
this feature is distance dependent and
interestingly and but probably expect it
was somehow expected from my side these
differential standard deviation really
depends on the beast and so here you can
see for an orchestral musical piece this
is a time domain this is the feature
that I have already mentioned and the
different colors correspond to the
different distant distances between the
source and the receiver and similarly
for a signal consisting of guitar you
can see that a
the feature seems to be highly business
dependent and seems to really behave in
a signal independent way so the idea was
to use this feature and Gaussian moves
through models which we had already the
framework from the first method I have
presented to you and using two frames of
two seconds to extract this feature and
in order to develop a method then
evaluate what is the performance so here
you can see for a room karoliina whole
late available online database the me
performance was seventy five point five
percent when the system is tested with
five different distance classes and then
we were trying to find some ways to
increase the performance and get some
better results and the idea was to
introduce him a binary feature
extraction framework so since we had the
available by neural signals who were
able to easily extract by neural cuse
interaural time difference in terrell
the level difference and the coherence
for several frequency bands and then
calculate several statistical attributes
of these features so this would lead in
the calculation 452 more additional
features and that could be used also
they in our classifier to in order to
obtain better results so this here I
should admit that this is really not a
it's an engineering approach so so we're
just trying to feed a more features into
our classifier and at this stage we were
not really let's say concerned a of Y so
these features these statistical
features of binaural cues should be
let's say distance a dependent or
something like that but this was the
first paper of the same head over the
balloon of the development of this work
so here you can see the results which
now
are much better the me performance
increased the about twenty percent and
we have used for only four additional
features out of these 430 that I saw you
before that they are and that we have a
try isolated using feature selection
algorithms and this is so now I can get
all to your question this is again a
performance in one room so we train the
system in one room and we test it in the
same room but it was a of interest to
examine what would happen when we go in
I other rooms so here for the easy task
of having only three rooms sorry three
distance classes you can see that the
method seems to work quite way I I can
find more information in a paper that
it's now in price and then I we have
analyzed in more detail all these things
that i'm referring to right now Oh
general you don't have a bank the slides
how you generate the corpus is this room
impulse response has been out all
aluminum post responses provided by the
database or amazing bed then by yourself
okay so a we have some by neural
responses from a database but we also
have some from my some rooms in May in
May at the University in a conference
center so I use all these responses I
convolve them with the anechoic signals
i have a database and then i use this
database for their training at the
testicles
using a dummy head so we go in the room
we get the we we take the damn head we
put a loudspeaker in another for a
different distances so 1 2 3 4 5 meters
and so on and we calculate and we
measure the responses by the convo link
they recorded signal with the anechoic
signal has been reproduced in the room
yes but there are of course a software
let me say software that does everything
easily so a for example there is an i
don't know if i should refer to okay but
there is a specific folder but of course
you can do it also with matlab by i have
the code but it's something that it's
kind of straightforward to do it's not a
difficult it's just the a deconvolution
of five of the input signal and the
output signal yeah and in this say can
fix me now to the introduction of a room
classification method so since we had
all these same interesting features
binaural features with yes please so it
seems like your distance estimation
treated like a classification problem
that you have these buckets 1 meter 2
meter mm-hmm so I don't know you know
not really connect with the literature
on this exact field in sub topic but do
it seemed like a regression right i mean
what if someone's at 1.5 meters or what
happens if the subjects yeah so thank
you meters hey that's right like a
regression specifications more
appropriate yeah so regression good work
so well so that's why we have used the
gmm and actually with a binaural
distance estimation technique we have
also used a support support vector
machines which is even more it seems
that it works it's they're much more
robust and they can work very well in
unknown and room environments so of
course i did some place with later
integration i would prefer it if it
could work with linear regression
because it's a it's a procedure that you
can fully understand somehow why why
some of the features are let's say not
not relevant for the task but first of
all if they unfortunately the results
were not so good so right now the
methods as they are developed they are
only oriented to work for specific
distance classes then you have to find
some tricks in order to do if you want
to find a distance clans class between
the two classes so it is actually one
yeah so in some cases it might go on the
other on the if it's a on 1.5 you would
have a almost fifty percent the
confusion so you might go on the air on
on either sides but in the case of when
you are one point one meter and then you
have the other class it's at two meters
then you would get it on the only one
meter class so it seems to be quite
robust in small distance say miss
mismatches yeah and that's why it works
also quite well lay my unknown rumor
diamonds so since we had all these say
by nurul say feature framework we were
trying to think of other ways to to
exploit this information so one idea was
when we could use such a framework for
day for the classification of rooms but
a good question here would be how can
one classified could classify rooms and
according to the reverberation time to
their volume or how big they are
according to the way to some acoustical
parameters and how they behave in the
rooms or is there another way to do it
what are like the ways that can tell me
that now I'm in a lecture room and I'm
not in a big auditorium went what makes
this room similar to another lecture
room in the same building and so on so
of course this is not an easy question
to answer but we found in the literature
a Saturday work of Floyd to he defines
three room categories but this is for
sound reproduction purposes only in
small medium large and he somehow
classifies them according their
vibration time so we have used them
again these databases with a binaural a
remembers responses and we have where
unseparated the rooms in small medium
and large we have created the
reverberant audio files and we have we
were trying to find a boo if these
statistical features binaural
statistical feature
are related to some of these room
properties so here you can see again
this the bynars a feature statistical
framework a and the rooms that we have
used for our analysis so with the blue
color you consider them so they were
used for the training and the black
color are the ones that they were used
for the testing of the method and here
it's the performance of the method using
Gaussian mixture models so we go to
let's say some inside that such a
framework could probably also assist
some other let's say scene analysis
technique for example this a room
classification which is really abstract
of course and subway if further work of
my name is related to the estimation of
acoustical parameters in this case we
were also trying to estimate parameters
but not from the responses from the
measured responses but from the signals
so I have done some work related to the
information of clarity of clarity Demi
fewer and where it's them it shows the
energy of a the ratio of the energy of
the early part of the 51st milliseconds
of the response over the late part of
the response bubble tea yes the furby 50
milliseconds and then over there
but over the rest of these bones so this
is a very typical you stay acoustical
parameter and it's same it sews whether
there is a good speech intelligibility
in a signal and it many times it's used
to tune a signal enhancement techniques
for example a deliberation and so on so
we have used them this database of
database features using 2 2nd frames for
the extraction and they we have
extracted the clarity of by neural
responses and made these are actually
the values that we have I calculated
from the responses and these values were
used for the training compliment the
other ones for the evaluation and in
this case we used the linear regression
technique and it was founded the
variance of the integral type time
different same were given the highest
weights so the other features were
somehow the factors they were multiplied
this linear regression equation they
were a very close to 0 so all these
other features were found to be in less
important and here you can see the
results of this analysis a on the
vertical axis you can see the error and
then on the horizontal axis azhar the
actual clarity vice so it works not so
way but it depends on what you want to
do and here you can also see the
predicted and the real clarity value say
as a function of function of the time
frame so this is another indication that
probably such a an analysis enter a
framework for the analysis of signals
could also assist the estimation of
other parameters such as for example in
the clarity or the director vibrant a
ratio which is another acoustical
parameter in this case instead of having
the 51st milliseconds it's calculated
only using the die
signal which is the main pic and then
maybe five more milliseconds after they
made big and it's another important and
I widely used parameter in audio and
acoustics and a at the same time there
was also some work that it's already
existing work that relates the standard
deviation of the responses with a
director to reverberant ratio so using
the same my framework as before a by
subtracting the left and the right
reverberant the signal spectrums but in
this case assuming again they status
cali independent we can find a
relationship for the sound deviation and
then it can be also proved that this
differential spectrum is related to the
direct to the vibram ratio yes so excuse
me your summation it'll depend to the
left and right signals yes which is not
correct always we do not collect on wit
ya line of business where is the sound
so you have this set up yet rated
transfer functions where you put the
sound source always in front yeah so for
the a for the binaural distance
estimation technique we have done tests
for all Andy's so it works well if you
click a train the system with various
angles and then you test it with various
angles it works quite well but yeah of
course we have also tried it with not
only 40 degrees because otherwise it
could not be published of course because
they reviewers who bear and it's a it's
it's normal it's it changes obtained the
signals change a lot and okay so yeah we
have concerning this article
independence here this is actually what
that it's a still in progress and yeah I
have found this actually I was trying
not to shoot this at this kind of
depends but these relationships become
much more complicated so I was trying to
see if we ask you
independent which could be true for high
frequencies and the others specific
secret circumstances and we end up in a
relationship that relates the standard
deviation of this differential spectrum
with the director veteran ratio and that
was a quite quite interesting in my
opinion and here you can see that we
have tested please same method for a
three different signals tell you music
guitar and the speed signal for five
different rooms and you can see on the
vertical axis is the standard deviation
error ok would be because you could also
estimate the Sun deviation but this is
the most important thing it's a director
vibrant the ratio error which in this
case we used only zero degrees for this
result the time presenting here and the
prediction error was a always less than
3 DB and it was found that they like the
Reverend ratio could be predicted from
by neural signals hey this somehow sums
up in a very fast way they work that
it's more let's say related to my PhD
thesis which is actually part of the
text but it's gonna be my PhD thesis but
there are also other things that I have
been I have done during my PhD studies
and so when I was a in Phillips for a
few months I would have worked I've been
working in for an ambient telephony
system and they were trying to estimate
the position of various devices situated
in the room so it's device would have a
microphone and speaker that would be
like four devices in this setup for
devices in one room another for device
in another room we were trying to find a
way to find where these devices are
situated in the room a
I can't say it's a ok so today they said
you have a speaker that he's moving
around in the invader and the it's like
a conference and open conference calls
hands-free let's say call you have
hands-free Cole and these devices are
used to render the sound too so if they
speaker is here close to this device
then these device would play the signal
louder and then the other devices would
play the signal and less strength and
the idea of course was also that this
could be also direct more directive to
have a beam of off of sound only the
specific position where is the speaker
and some but this was like for further
steps and then obviously pies
but my task was to this automatically
bracer which was to find where are these
devices situated so since there was a
mutual decision of those device exactly
yes exactly and they find also a way to
find which devices are in the one room
and which are devices are in the other
room and so on so since there was a
allowed speaking the microphone in each
device it was very easy to calculate the
impulse responses so they they was that
ok the user by the system he gets person
but when he gets a the system calibrated
and then he can start using it so I have
used these emails responses the input of
the signal was all the simplest ones
between all these points so we have full
matrix of the impulse responses between
yes the speakers in each of the Michael
exactly so the idea was to use the
multi-dimensional scaling technique
which takes us as input the distances
between points and then it just returns
the positions they actual XYZ depending
if you are two or three dimensions of
these same of these devices I hope it's
clear but I can further elaborate
another thing that they have also some
experiences say on the subjective
evaluation of signaling husband yes
please please see your other stuff than
estimated distance it is yeah so when
you have the impulse response it's easy
to calculate this is because you get
just that you calculate the delay
between there yeah and it's easy to
today this is because all devices go to
the same thing good exactly they're
synchronized and you know the delay of a
sound card and all these things are you
good
David us
so pretty much the problem is you have a
full matrix of the distances between
eight points in you have to find the
distribution exactly you'd say which is
something that I didn't do but it was
the multi-dimensional scaling that did
it for me but I had to find this method
that some wood and apart from this there
was also a thing of trying to find which
devices having the one room and then you
could probably see with responses had
similar and i will say reverberation
characteristics so this would mean that
they would be like these responses in
this room and these responses in the
other room or you could see that this
pair of responses would be not so good
there would be like obstacles in between
so you'd know that 7 is definitely in
another room from my device 3 and so
okay so this is more just to show you
that I have done some other things and
it's not so probably let's say exciting
as a research topic and okay so have
spent some time my collaborating with
other colleagues a hero has been mainly
working with a deliberation techniques
and I have helped sometimes for the
evaluation of the algorithms of
developed algorithms and many times we
have conducted conducted some listening
tests in order to see how their
listeners what the police nurse think of
the of the algorithms and there let's
say a perceptual artifacts of these
techniques so I'm here for this we were
I was mainly I have mainly worked with
deliberation algorithms and we were
trying to extend let's say the the
expertise that was in the group and they
in
the development of the elaboration
algorithm but for singly channel 41 a
single channel signals to the binaural
scenario in this case of course you have
several problems because you would have
if you be if you do different processing
in the right and bring the left here you
would destroy the binaural accuse there
I'll be the interaural time difference
is a level differences coherence and so
on this would also destroy the
localization cues of the listener so the
idea was to find a way to do this to
let's say extend the existing expertise
and framework for the single-channel
scenario to the binaural case and we
have proposed some ideas to to do the
same processing here and on the left and
on the right signal and end by proposing
some let's say a ideas from the on the
calculation of this a gain that you
would use but I don't know actually if
you are aware of the vibration
techniques one way is to use this
spectral subtraction where you decide
that you have to subtract some from some
frequency bins you subtract something
which is supposed to be reverberation so
this is done using the factor D again
again a factor which can be different
for its frequently and the idea was to
find a way to use the same gain factor
for the left and the right signal and
this can be for example taking the
minimum of these of these two signals
the maximum or the average so we need
several days and I hole yes I kind of
Miss the main party you have a dummy and
organ our recording can you try to do a
speech a husband
very very bearish on the two microphones
so then after this when you hit to the
head cause of the final user it to sound
less vulgar recently hair porn exactly
so he helped to channel speech against
any handsome three disclosure of the
speaker signal no to channel and so you
signal even one single device for the
now on economy and the problem is speech
enhancement in the morning session oh
yes big article exactly bearing in mind
that there was a we already had some
techniques that they were working in the
single-channel a case quite well and
robust with not so many artifacts and so
on but of course when you want to do it
binary it gets more complicated and the
reason of course I know this is an open
research issue right now and to my
knowledge hey so I have also spent some
time working with this although I was
not a part of the development of these
actual methods but mainly on the
evaluation of those in there yes let's
talk a little bit later please so you
mentioned that applying some suppression
techniques on the boat channels
independently can cause losing a
speciality you stop to mix them
differently president how are you a
belated this you asked lay the user
where was the source of the beginning
and when it is when it where is it after
the processing so you can have you
recently proven our recordings before
and after the sinking yes they where the
self social sciences this one way to the
spatial to use do it yes buddy hey sorry
just a but in this case it's this
processing we did was not destroying lay
by neural cues so we didn't have
actually to take whether they the
position would be destroyed because we
would use the same game on both signals
but yeah concerning the number would be
15 20 test subjects so usually we don't
have so many test subjects for all tests
every time for some people
objective site needs to create the
computational pops an algorithm which
does the same and okay of course we have
used these objective measures then they
calculate M paste and there are two
others that they are widely used their
single channel that's true and then yeah
of course so you have to evaluate them
separately for its channel to my
knowledge this is not a salty they are
not like ways to right now to evaluate
and say okay this by nurul the vibration
algorithm works great because it does
these two these metrics first of all the
metrics were are already problem even in
a single case a scenario although varies
there are already some years of work
topic popping the binaural canal
scenario gets even more complicated
because you have to also think of these
localization cubes and the other
attributes and the last thing that I
have also spent quite some time is
related to architectural room acoustics
hey there is a lot of experience in my
group so we mainly on the simulation of
the acoustics of our care and ancient
Greek theaters with because there are
many actually in Greece so in this say
the last years after we have simulated
all the theaters and we wanted to do
something more we have tried to me
simulate the day acoustic effect of
wearing a mask because in the past when
you the actors they would usually wear a
mask in the while playing tragedies and
so on so the masks they change the
acoustical characteristics of the actor
voice for the listener but also for the
spectators so we wanted we have
collaborated with a director so not an
engineer who it was someone he was
constructing actually the masks and he
wanted to somehow explain some these are
the audible effects that the octal
actors we would mention
the masks are fail to vibrate that the
originated on specific frequencies or
that the position of the mask would
change the acoustic effect or that they
get let's say distract the localization
skills are get a get distracted and so
on so we have a did some measurements
with a dummy head that's down here we
have and these are the masks so there
are various types with open ears closed
year say open mouth there are some
others with a closed mouth and we have
measured the response using a
loudspeaker and they n Vic in the team
are so if their microphones in the years
but also the loudspeaker on the opposite
side but also using as loudspeaker the
loudspeaker of the mouth so there are
days of partner of the person speaking
and then recording these responses say
years so this would get would lead to
the self perception effect and here you
can see some results which I don't know
so what's so interesting right now and
for various degrees this is the self
perception if effect these measures were
taken out open open outdoors since we
don't have an anechoic chamber in Greece
a fortunately it's very expensive to
have one and yeah it was found we have
extracted some conclusions that I don't
know if they're so interesting for you
right now and concerning the boost of
some frequencies are specific a
orientation language and that there is a
high frequency cut in the high frequency
range and so on it so for the future as
now I'm somehow let's say closing this
first part of my work a I have thought
of some ideas for future work and I
would be interested to see how one can
modify use by neural cues or the signals
themselves
to in to create a different distance
perception to the listener and I would
be interesting to see if my work could
be also enveloped in special audio
encoding encoding decoding techniques
where you many times you need some
information of the room environment in
order to encode it in very signal and I
would like to extend my statistical
analysis for the single channel scenario
service and deviation and all these
things I have referred to to the
binaural case and see more letting more
detail how the spectral standard
deviation changes for the binaural case
it is it like do we get higher values do
we get this five-point 66 DB value of
shredder and try also to apart from just
observe it also established a
theoretical framework police and of
course the the early reflections is
always an open topic actually still an
open topic and we cannot use statistical
models to my knowledge to model it but
it would be nice if we could do
something on this direction I the idea
also fame getting an acoustic perceptual
map so using let's say signals you have
a a by neural signals which is the
common thing for human listeners and
then you can say ok how far is the sound
source how many how many sound sources
are present all these issues related to
the computationally auditory scene
analysis which I hope that probably my
work could also assist in this direction
and they finally I exploit the such
information extracted from the signals
for signal and say hi enhancement
methods and see if we can improve
algorithms for hearing aids or other
similar applications so thank you very
much that would be glad to answer your
questions yes please isn't used 432
features for free yes so you receiver
this estimation enough features based on
inspection magnitude for some of them
are also based on the temporal a single
Thomas face both temporal and okay as
you would expect that you get a lot of
information exactly yes yes how
consistent is this estimate over
different placements in the same
absolute business different placements
inside the room is if you're standing in
a corner doesn't get worse yeah so for
the binary case that Lisa is that I
haven't tried it so haven't done tests
another let's say pair of positions will
be the same distance but for the
single-channel scenario it works well so
the good thing with these techniques
because for the binaural distance
estimation actually there are other
techniques in the literature it's not
like I'm not the first person that did
that but they are really sensitive to
small changes as you say for example if
you go to another pair of a position or
if you go to if you move a little bit
further than microphone it's one point
one meter instead of one meter they fail
because they are very accurate but they
are also very sensitive but this feature
seems to be more robust more they you
cannot get probably the best performance
the top performers a one hundred percent
performance but it seems that they work
quite well for these disagreement in so
change for for wonderfully then you
yes exactly so for the binaural a
distance says and I know I should admit
that I haven't tried it but I think that
it will work maybe not equally well but
similarly will yes okay you have your
dummy head pointing to the sound was at
zero degrees so can zoom in depth and
the dummy gate is actually quite
symmetric left on the right it's so
pretty much the room impulse response
from the loudspeaker two meters to the
left and the right here is ok pretty
much the seizing of the right part it's
symmetric and consuming the lake level
variation because he goes two years ago
for a winter's it's kind of the same
statistically why the difference between
those two signals which are kind of all
statistically Indian in the same matter
so much do you have any idea do you have
well they they the reason that i use
this the difference he'll think is
because you get rid of the signal so of
course if it's like having so if I let's
say we use only one signal with a
assumption is that we're less than the
right signal are almost the same so why
don't you use only one signal for
example but since we have two signals
and we subtract them and we get
something that it's say let's say signal
it takes out the signal so this is the
reason that I have used this subtraction
so according to this theoretical
analysis the term V anechoic signal gets
out and you only end up with a
statistical attribute of the response
otherwise you would have a signal inside
which would have of course all respect
on with a deviation which are a
difficult to model and a well then how
this works for different angles let's
say give your 90 degrees from me I can
help to take
attenuation of frequencies yeah so for
in this a direction i think that they
what makes this thing work is actually
the classifier that gets trained for
this specific angle and then it doesn't
work but there is definitely something
missing in this in the same work of mind
so I know that for this thing with the
standard deviation I know that ok for
the single channel case I know very well
how it behaves for different frequency
bands if it goes to this 5.6 degree and
always but when you are in the binaural
case you have another situation you have
the sound effect you have always and
let's say a frequency ranges that they
are a little bit more boosted in the
speeds frequency range and all these
differences when you compare a binaural
responds with a single time response so
i think one should analyze do the same
analysis also need binaural case but not
only 40 degrees because we very single
channel case you have only 0 degrees and
you're relaxed so one has to do this for
several angles and then you have to find
also a theoretical and let's say
framework to ya to better describe it
and then it might be more let's say
easier to say why does this thing work
so right now I think it works because of
a classifier for other angles
so you didn't talk at all about noise so
what happens if I mean have you tried
like now you know you train your
classifier and then at test time there
is no like
yeah refrigerators humming and computers
out of my kid is screaming and the
protectors on yeah I already tried to to
see how these methods work with a noise
at all I haven't even tried it and but i
suppose that one could use some noise
and enhancement techniques subtract the
noise somehow if if it's not too bad a
person they signal to noise ratio is
quite okay and then I i think that they
you could probably get some good results
with these methods but i haven't tried
it but I think that you need this first
stage of the noise before you can apply
these methods
more questions
