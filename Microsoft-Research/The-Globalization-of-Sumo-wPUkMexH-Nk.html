solo this is very simple I love you all
I want you to be happy and I want you to
bring sumo into your life and this means
first you have to get rid of what you
think you know about sumo sumo is one of
these sports that ends up being a
punchline to people you think you know
what it is you think it's fat guys in
diapers you think it's those sweaty
students that you rented you bang into
one another that is not so much this is
so
so I should this trip in before the
first thing she said was which guy won
the answer is love goal again because
the Mongolian always wins I would you
left and he won because there's two ways
you can win in sumo so always incredibly
so two guys get into a rink olive oil
they're called Rikishi they're wearing
this belt of washing they come into the
center when four-fifths end up down on
the ground the match starts you can
stand there for a while with one fist
down I'm trying to cite the other guy
out as soon as all four were down
straight out of each other matches you
rarely go more than 10 seconds that's
the matching us watch you can lose in
two ways any part of your body other
than the sole of your foot touches the
ground you lose you get thrown out you
lose in a case like that where two guys
get turned on the guy who is in control
which remember is the linoleum
that's it that's the entirety of it now
watching this Higgs frickin forever
because there's a giant ritual that
surrounds all of that and you actually
don't get that much of a chance to watch
it so before we get to know how we watch
it it's incredibly if there's actually
any different ways you can legally win a
match in this form and people care about
this look at matches and at the end of
it say that was an amazing the Walton
eigen you don't have to figure that out
you probably will over time and you'll
get six chance to year to do it because
the only people in the world produced
sumo professionally are the japanese
japan sumo association runs six
tournaments called fossils located
throughout Japan about yours 15 days
long so each guy fights once 15 days so
at the end of 15 days you have a one
loss record over the course of 15 you
win 15 matches your winning the
tournament or you're going from cloud
you win 10 matches you're really really
good if you win five matches you
probably should be doing something else
for a living every time these
tournaments come around what we all wait
for is sumo penance is something called
a bug-zooka and this is the ranking of
where everybody is in suma if you're at
the top of it you're a grand champion
Yokozuna if you're a little bit below
that your nose ecchi those guys actually
make real money that's like half a
million dollars a year plus button
sponsorship you get down to these guys
and you're kind of like a journey by the
Baseball or maybe even more like a
journey home hockey you might be making
a living at it
I will be doing something else with your
life here's the interesting thing that a
lot of talk here are the top 25 guys in
sumo today done my nationality and you
may notice takes a lot of Japanese flags
there that makes sense but at the very
top of the game the Japanese are just
not and this is a really interesting
phenomenon than probable because a
similar actually open and the best
people who are over competing in it you
would see very few Japanese on the top
of someone and in fact there have been a
lot of regulations deciding who can
compete and nothing is very heavily
regulated to try to deal with this
question of foreign wrestlers come into
play now this makes sense sumos ancient
comes out of the heat okay it's
something that summer I would do to make
extra money when they didn't have a
client so if you're a ronin samurai you
can either go out with your sword and
hope that someone will hire you in a
Kurosawa movie who are you find people
for money again stuff so this is a very
huge tradition goes back hundreds of
years and there are no not Japanese who
show up until the late 1970s and
suddenly these three guys come up on the
sea and then come on pretty slowly
because they walk really slowly because
one of the things you
about them is they're friggin yeah so
first I cover the sumo are these guys
from Hawaii and from the island and for
the most part there's 600 pounds of
which even her solo is freaking gigantic
you know most of the guys could hire
about 350 pounds and so people are kind
of cool with this lightly it's kind of
interesting to watch musashi barroom
fight but it doesn't really threaten the
integrity of the sport because these
guys are sort of course of nature
there's no way anyone could possibly
insisted the guy who freaks everybody
out is this guy this guy is yoga shoes
on he's an itty-bitty little Mongolian
guy he's a little bigger than I am which
is he's a little heavier little shorter
he is so good at sumo that he acquires
this nickname which is Geno dupatta
which is the department store carbon
store for different techniques to whoop
your ass threats the hell out and you'll
evil eyes 20 other tactics that he views
and rather than winning the sumo
championship he gets knocked down Cyril
vouchers because no knows how to do in
there so it's really tricky with a
mongolia show up on your doorstep
are not comfortable with a lot of
motivation but we should really talk
about why the models are so good at this
is the first answer gives one the legs
are awesome once we get beyond
that we should say that there's
basically three sports among there's
horseback riding there's archery and
there's wrestling and Mongolian
wrestling makes sumo look like a bunch
of hot gases because in Mongolian
wrestler you can only win one way which
is throwing the guy to the ground no
this whole force out of you're
on a giant grassy field and pretty much
you got the guy down with core not and
the only thing that's careful about this
he said well Japan is a comparatively
wealthy country Mongolia is not so there
are a lot of really hungry up-and-coming
Mongolian wrestlers who desperately want
to get to Japan and kick the butts of
these guys so they're making half a
million dollars a year and the guy who
really represents the collective
Mongolian revolution is this guy I'll so
sure you and anybody who would screw
solo this is the best sumo wrestler we
will ever see this guy was the sole
grand champion for about eight years he
won all six matches in a year which is
unprecedented it's completely unheard of
and people freaking hated you could just
read the Japanese press and we
week after week she's not dignified
enough he doesn't take it seriously we
saw him go drinking people say he has a
nice to gambling I shocked shocked the
completely hounded out of his 40 that
forced to retire after getting into a
bar fight that many people believe is
staged and this isn't just about
Mongolians this poor guy walkin elbow
managed to get thrown out of sumo she is
no section and he wanted to get thrown
out of sumo for one of the weirdest
doping scandals ever which is to say
that he was done with five grams of
marijuana and as you can see from the
cartoon soon was the only sport in the
world where marijuana might be Fabio are
not a lot of young people in Japan to
want to go with sumo and that's because
it really sucks to be a young sumo
trainer and it particularly sucks when
you're stable masters beat you up in
baseball bastards resume enormous
scandal so when people start talking
about this they often start talking in a
context of Japan facing i need to change
and have more immigration this is what
happens with an aging population logic
must come to come out of this is robot
sumo but rather the same without
thinking about a country having this
cultural confrontation it's worth
pointing out that this is an incredibly
deeply important
local culture and we actually need to
find a solution that's culturally
sensitive as well as dealing with
immigration and score brilliant cultural
theorists have looked at this question
of how you protect small cultures and
the worries really have small culture
and global culture comes in either
McDonald swallowed all you have a
violent counter reaction to it you blow
it up and say well none of it you come
up with a curry you find a way to bring
it to the best of blood cultures invest
another culture what you're just going
to say no that's not going to be walled
off and the folks you're studying this
pip Norris and this brilliant book says
the wallet office what happens most
often so what I'm trying to figure out
is what happens in sports when you were
a big country to people to aspire to
that people love that people want to
interact with you might be Australian I
had something like aussie rules football
coach is a beautiful and wonderful game
but really has no life outside of
australian people don't come into play
you might have a game completely
designed for the 21st century like mixed
martial arts which loses all control
context but it's just a purely global
sport that anyone that participated you
might have this more like baseball which
had deep roots in one culture but really
turns into everything depending on where
you end up being whether it's american
republic whether it's Japan my hope for
this in some ways is you end up with a
sport like football which has enormously
type geographic roots at the same time
as being intensely cosmopolitan is shown
by the legos Barcelona Football Club the
hope in the long run maybe is that too
much
or like global football if you're all
excited about this this is a great time
to start watching 10 days left in the
current batch oh those are the site from
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
