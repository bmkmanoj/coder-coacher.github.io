Messina actually already said made a lot
of the points I was going to make so
I'll try to enhance them in some way I
want to talk about something really
exciting i know it's after five o'clock
here i want to talk about lawyers and
accountants there's this concept in the
professions of fiduciary responsibility
and what it basically means is that when
you work with certain kinds of
professionals they are obligated to
represent your interests and I'm a
little bit concerned and a little bit
worried as I think about this world that
we're all talking about here today about
whose interests the bots are going to be
representing I'll try holding this lower
um so up you know we taught we use this
word agent to sometimes intelligent
agents is one of the historical terms
that bots have emerged from and an agent
is somebody who represents you I am an
author I have an agent he represents me
if he didn't i wouldn't pay him and i
wouldn't use him when we first imagined
bots a way back we had this concept of
the intelligent agent that would
represent the user go out onto the net
and do things for the user and what i'm
hearing and seeing much more today is a
vision of a world where I the user
remain a human being out on the internet
or you know in digital space and I am
surrounded by this world of bots who are
representing all these other larger
entities and I wonder if I'm trying to
get uh particularly if we were talking
about transactions and purchasing
something I'm spending money or maybe
I'm just sharing some information how I
as an individual can have my interests
represented in a transaction in an
informational relationship I don't hear
a lot of that
in in the conversation yet here and I
know that probably no one in this room
is interested in having this become
something that is in fact legally
regulated you know Congress right now is
having an argument about the fiduciary
responsibility of the people who sell
your retirement accounts um you don't
want to be in that position five years
from now after some scandal or some
story breaks about bots gone wild you
know kind of taking money from people
that they didn't intend to spend and so
you know to avoid that which i think is
a bad outcome for everyone I think we
need to think about now about what kind
of responsibility we have as the
creators of this environment to make
sure the users interests are represented
and Chris had some good ideas of ways of
starting down that road thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
