called bubbles provide the ability to
pan and zoom to inspect a particular
location a single panorama however does
not allow you to get an overview of a
complete street zooming in to look
further down the street exhibits severe
foreshortening and loss of resolution
jumping from Bubble to bubble moves you
down the street but still does not
provide context we present our system
which we dub Street slide as the viewer
zooms out beyond 90 degrees the views
seamlessly transforms from a bubble to a
multi perspective panorama view of the
street panning is transformed to
translating enabling efficient browsing
of building facades zooming back in at
any point puts the viewer back into the
nearest bubble for further panning and
zooming zooming back out once again and
turning on black edges between strips we
can see the dynamic construction of the
multi perspective panorama
we can see that as the view widens the
aspect ratio of the street side becomes
wider creating unused screen space at
the top and bottom we use this space to
add navigational and informational aids
the diamond-shaped turn signs provide
affordances for turning to see the other
side of the street we leverage the
bubble for this task by zooming into the
bubble panning 180 degrees and zooming
back out 90-degree turns are performed
in the same way at intersections
we also annotate the strip with street
names and building numbers at the top
clicking on a number takes you to that
address
finally storefront graphics or logos can
be displayed below the strip clicking on
these takes you to the corresponding
bubble and orientation containing that
store
in the lower right corner you see a
mini-map the center circle corresponds
to the current location mousing over the
map enlarges the size and scope of the
map
moving the center location on the map
moves the viewpoint accordingly
by combining 360-degree panoramic
panning and zooming with dynamically
adaptive multi-perspective panoramas
Street slide provides both an immersive
and informative experience for exploring
street sight imagery and geo-located
information
