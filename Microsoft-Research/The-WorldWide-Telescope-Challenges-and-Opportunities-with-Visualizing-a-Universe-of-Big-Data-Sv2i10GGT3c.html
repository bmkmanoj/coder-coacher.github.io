worldwide telescope and a little bit
about the history of world wide
telescope there soon
is that we're going to be talking about
the first wave a worldwide telescope was
about two years ago when we first
launched the world wide telescope at the
ted conference and then the second wave
happened about a year ago when we
started expanding beyond the first cloud
to bring in another cloud that being
nassos data cloud of over 100 terabytes
into worldwide telescope and also to
allow the addition of additional user
data user data from professors and other
scientists trying to do work within wewt
and so they're the third wave were going
at now that will be up sometime soon is
the integration of data and data
visualization interactive data
visualization and time within the world
wide telescope environment so this is a
slide that sort of talks about the
beginnings of worldwide telescope I
actually was in high school I get a
chance to work at the Griffith
Observatory in Los Angeles where I grew
up and and as high school student our
job there were two of us was to actually
take photographs using these plates of
potential flare stars and we'd be
running the telescope all night and
capture these images and maybe get like
two plates with of data and that's kind
of like the old days of small data and
it's kind of interesting for me to be
here you know 40 years later talking
about Big Data and astronomy but it's
actually the whole idea of astronomy and
astronomy education has been something
that has been interest to me for a long
long time back in two thousand Jim Gray
and and Gordon Bell would come by my
office regularly and one of the times
they came by started talking about the
work that Jim Gray was doing with Alex
la at Johns Hopkins on the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey and Jim was working with Alex
to help them sort of think about some of
the challenges of throughput with big
data and part of what they wanted to do
had so much data coming from the sloan
if you think about my little plate from
40 years earlier it was just a court
just a little bit of data well the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey if you're not
familiar with it is a multispectral
sensor that essentially has the
telescope point to a place in the sky
and essentially scans that start the
entire night so they're getting a
massive amount of data and so part of
the challenge with the sloan is how do
they sort of manage the data pipeline
and much less also how do they start to
make that data more accessible and to be
able to do science on it and so Jim and
Alex worked on our on a relatively
famous paper called there it's right
here it's called databases meet
astronomy and at the very last page of
that PowerPoint Jim said we need visit
and we know it and so I wanted to be one
of the first volunteer because I was
trying to find a way to kind of get back
to my roots and do this idea that I had
which is related to astronomy and
solutions where you can help us with the
website and so I have them designed the
dr to website but that was just kind of
the beginning but that did substantially
help the education efforts of the slow
and in terms of making that data more
accessible for students in the public
but my ID I pitch to Alex and Jim
there's this thing I called the universe
project I've been thinking about this
for like 30 years I mean students
especially somebody like myself that's
lived in a major metropolitan area and I
think seventy percent of students today
in the United States live in major
metropolitan areas I never saw the Milky
Way Intel's like 18 and so the
opportunity to be able to see the stars
is kind of a not a particularly common
thing and the other thing is that
students today are starting to see big
images from the Hubble and the Chandra
and Spitzer and these are beautiful
images but I'm betting 99% of them have
nor
be aware that object is in the sky and
what is going on with that object so for
me I was very interested in expanding
beyond data okay and I pitch to Jim I
said what's really a big opportunity is
data provides a foundation but above
that we need to create a larger context
for the imagery and the sky and then
within that environment or create a rich
simple annotation environment so
astronomers educators can tell stories
about the universe that can engage
people and then facilitate the process
of discovery and then connecting with
data underneath it so Jim was a huge fan
and it took me about three years before
I could finally get around to it but we
did we did build it I think one of the
first challenges was to put together the
sort of initial image base layer from
which the context in visible light where
all the other imagery would be and this
was the 3600 plates from the Palomar
Digital Sky Survey essentially they were
appears or red green blue blue light
images and those were 23 k by 23 k pixel
images and part of the challenges we
stitched it together but it still ended
up looking you know quite like a mosaic
actually looked more like a disco ball
that the place had all kinds of
interesting artifacts and and just
recently last number of months ago
Jonathan Fay and some great help from
Hughes hop puppy had developed some
image processing algorithms using dried
and on the cluster deliver the process
this into a new trillion pixel image
which is a quite beautiful you don't see
any of the artifacts before the some
details about that process so you know
putting the other lootera pixel sky was
kind of one challenge and another
challenge was just moving data around in
the early days when we wanted to move
10 terabytes of data and get it up into
the club I mean it would take forever if
we were just time to to push it through
no matter how fast the connection and we
were just moving you know terabyte this
around the country or fedex it was the
fastest way it was most paralyzer always
sort of we get the data across and so
there are a number of different
opportunities about the big data with a
light telescope but I'm going to just
jump into worldwide telescope and sort
of show it to you that way so just out
of curiosity how many people here have
seen worldwide telescope can I see right
show of hands oh good not too many okay
so this is this is world wide telescope
is there a way to lower those lights too
that's good okay so you're looking at
the Milky Way here and this is our tara
pixel image you can essentially go
anywhere and sort of scroll forward and
sort of seamlessly see galaxies and such
another important thing about this i
mentioned the idea of context so in the
sky this shows you here at the bottom
where the earth is in the celestial
sphere this yellow rectangle is the
field of view that we're looking at and
that's also reflected in this blue
rectangle here so as I scroll forward
you can see that blue rectangle shrink
and the sort of wedge in the sky
actually shrinks as well so this helps
you sort of get a sense of both the the
scale of the context of what you're
looking at as well now we have a number
of all sky views in worldwide telescope
and this was really important Australian
conveyed the kind of structures that are
visible in different wavelengths of
light so this is from the palomar
visible light this is from the w map
which is the cosmic background radiation
this is dust this is infrared this is
the hydrogen alpha you can go over to
the x-ray and I can actually select this
as a foreground layer and and have two
different wavelengths going now each of
these datasets are highly precision
registered so I can go and come
data structures between the heat
signature an x-ray of this supernova
remnant with the physical debris clouds
of the Cygnus loop right there so I'm
going to go back to visible light now I
mentioned the idea of guided tours so in
the guided tours and worldwide telescope
is really important that anybody be able
to create a tour these tours are
essentially created like PowerPoint but
they're just passed within this really
really rich digit visual environment so
if I click on the Milky Way is a spiral
galaxy but it's hard to see that because
we're inside here just borrow galaxy not
far from us about 12 million light-years
a wedding called m81 if we look at it in
optical light we suppose the stars
shining together
if we look at the heat from mad1 rather
than the light it looks like the frost
color orangey image you see here this
Spitzer Space Telescope image uses long
way of cameras that Casey fien just like
Twilight took the picture of his cat
galaxies are filled with tiny particles
best but
so I'm going to pause that a minute what
you're watching has the same feel like a
great sort of nature documentaries music
it's got narration it's got you know
graphics and animation but it's not a
video I mean the problem of videos video
is where this monolithic object you
can't sort of break into or out of it
but here the video is essentially what
feels like video is just the path in the
data environment so I'm looking at this
particular galaxy here and you could
look at that galaxy from sort of any
other any other telescopes these are
from the from the Spitzer if I wanted to
see an x-ray view with a supermassive
black hole in the center that galaxies
as you could see that if I wanted to get
more information about this galaxy I
just have to right click and to bring up
this little finder and the finder would
connect me with other information about
this particular object if I was a kid
doing schoolwork I might want to look in
Wikipedia and I'll go get a Wikipedia
entry if I was an astronomer and I
wanted to get access to one of the
papers they've been written about this
particular galaxy from the Smithsonian
Astrophysical database and they'll pull
up depending on how fast it is out of
2586 papers the most recent paper of the
last 200 now you said it's coming if I
wanted to get an original source image
there you can see it that what most
recent one was from October if I wanted
to get original source image I don't
have to necessarily know whether those
servers all I just say I want a DSS
image I want a sloan image and it just
goes and gets it for me so this idea of
story connected with context and
exploration coupled with access to data
I think is a very very
powerful model for how we might both
communicate as well as learn so down
here we were on this tour and we could
actually branch off to other tours that
relate to this particular galaxy so if
the particular thing you were watching
and you found something that was a
particular interest you could drill down
deep into something or I could just
bounces you're filled with tiny particle
pick up where I left off so I'm going to
pull up another tour that will talk a
little bit about bigger data if you will
in terms of how we represent that in
worldwide telescope so this is a tour
here and I'll start it so I just have
some text up here because you can do
that with anyone but this this is a view
of the coma galaxy in the slow in the
sky and the coma galaxy is you'll notice
that the galaxy in there look Lily a
little bit different each ones are the
ones that are different sort of size
different shape that's because the
million galaxies that are here that
we've rendered are they have the
metadata from them from a crowdsourcing
website called galaxies or and in Galaxy
Zoo the process of providing metadata
for million galaxies would take many
many years given the number of
astronomers that there are you know in
the world but the but this was able to
be done relatively quickly thanks to
that thanks to the site and then we were
able to integrate that metadata into the
representation so I'm going to jump
forward and here we're showing a large a
view of large-scale structure of the
universe about 24 years ago John hello
from Harvard CFA and Marvin
galler had 18 thousand galaxies and
that's when they first noticed some of
the larger structures and the bubbler
voids and Huckle was a big fan of world
wide telescope it's really kind of a
tragedy that had passed away last
weekend but I wanted to sort of dedicate
this talk to him so we'll sort of
seamlessly go down to the solar system
and we'll take a look at a little bit
more data that's being represented here
so we're zooming in on the half a
million near-earth objects objects that
are about a school bus size or larger so
let's go take a look at an Excel
spreadsheet so here I can get this is
stem data from USGS it just has time
that long magnitude and depth and
there's about 35 thousand rows of data
in here we can take this data and bring
it into the telescope and we can paste
this here you just call us 20 2010 and
bingo so that's all the data all the
earthquakes but I don't actually like
how that looks I'm actually going to
delete some of these other files in here
okay so we can look at these properties
related to this I want to change the
scale of the representation of those
quakes Oh a little bit smaller and
bubbly adjust the latency and have the
time be there and we'll have the hover
state tell us what the magnitude is so
here you can sort of see the quakes that
we all kind of know and use follows the
pattern of the San Andreas if you look
down here but you notice something
unusual because we have depth data the
quints actually follow the subduction
zones that from the Pacific plate going
into the North American plate if you go
over to here you can see the haiti
earthquake actually probably looks
better if we make that red so let's go
make that red and we'll look a bit more
dramatic and I think the hideous Blake
was particularly damaging because if you
look at it it was pretty close to the
surface given its magnitude we go over
here up above Puerto Rico there's a
whole swarm of earthquakes happening
here now I really like to kind of see if
there actually any temporal patterns
here so we can go and select time series
for that data and crank up the clock in
worldwide telescope so that will be
seeing essentially about you know a
year's worth of data in about 10 seconds
so now you're seeing some interesting
patterns that look like lightning bolts
even though that's a question appears a
time / kind of months let's go look
around some other places on the earth
and see what else we might be seeing
this area here at bab new zealand is
actually one of the fastest subduction
zones on the
on it in fact if we turn around and look
at it this way you can see that these
quakes are good at go down about five
hundred thousand five hundred kilometers
below the surface so let's do something
else let's let's take a pause here I'm
going to go get some other data and I've
got some earthquake data from 2000 which
has about 40 thousand rows and bring up
worldwide telescope and we'll paste it
into there too so this will be two
thousand
so now we have two different data sets
going on in here we've got the white
ones which are two thousand and we've
got red ones which are this past year
and once them take the 2010 and let that
thing go
well that's good
and what we can do now is we can start
to compare one period with another let's
take a look at Chile Chile is kind of
interesting because scientists have been
looking at this coast of Chile for quite
a while I think over a period of years
they've noticed there was really quiet
down here and you can sort of see how
that area just gets filled in I've
slowed down the clock a little bit right
there but this happens to be with Blake
data but maybe of what I want to do is I
want to expose it was something other
than stuff in the ground we wanted to
make that data in the air so we'll
switch that into altitude
and
so now to ensure the benchmark one sort
of data set over another from static
builder to a dynamic data is probably
going a little too fast anyway that's
just sort of an example of how we might
be able to start to make sense of some
of these large data sets in those
spreadsheets that we were looking at
there was no way you would get any sense
of what the kind of patterns that you
saw in Puerto Rico or either you know
down here and showing so I'm going to
stop that
so sort of a third potential application
I think for this is about how scientists
might start using worldwide telescope so
Alyssa Goodman who is an astronomer at
Harvard and I asked her to give me an
example of the kind of ways that she
uses worldwide telescope to communicate
with some of her colleagues about some
research that these shoes doing and the
usefulness of this is that they're the
the old way of doing this she'd have to
get a bunch of different images from a
bunch of different places sometimes
she'd have to load them all into
Photoshop or start doing this sort of
manual comparison where she said some
some astronomers actually would print
stuff out and use a ruler for things and
it was you know quite primitive but here
because a lot of these data sets are all
resident in worldwide telescope she can
bring she can create a path a negative
path where she can add text she can put
in a narration bring in her own data and
start to explain some of the problems in
what she's looking for and I'll play
this you can get a sense of it this is a
demonstration of the kind of information
I want to give my colleagues about
working threads of bubbles in the
interstellar medium might be in terms of
driving turbulence inside of molecular
clouds so I'm going to highlight two
regions Orion and a few goods and then
I'm going to zoom in on some information
including some research data about just
a few gifts and then the Torah shows you
what happens when you zoom out to the
whole galaxy and use the glimpse survey
from Spitzer to see where bubbles might
be distributed over
the GALEX this first orangey image that
you see is a map of the thermal emission
from dust in galaxies and i'm about to
highlight two molecular clouds that are
shown well in this image the two regions
are two of the closest molecular clouds
over land and Ophiuchus so they look
really big on the sky we're going to
focus on a few guests in the bar white
dotted bar shows you about 30 parsecs at
the hundred and twenty parsec distance
of both Lucas now we're just going to
zoom in from a 60 degree high view of a
Lucas to a 15 degree high view which
means it top to bottom scale be about 60
parsecs at the distance of a few days
now we're going to switch from this
schlegel Finkbeiner in davis view that
shows the ring outlined in white right
in the middle of the screen to a
multicolor view iris uses different far
infrared wavelengths to represent
different colors now we're just going to
zoom in a little more so it's about
eight parsecs from the top to the bottom
is greatly how we start getting to the
really tricky part of the ill theater
story the ring is outlined here in
yellow and that's probably blown by a
real star and growth that I'll show you
in a minute but the bottom of the screen
shows you a kind of blurry view but of a
young cluster of famous young cluster of
stars and better than the main part of
molecular cloud that's called real wolf
even though you can see that's about two
degrees away on the sky for reference we
can overlay a scuba 850 micron image and
see all the very young sources so now
that one of the scuba we have the iris
image again and if we
h alpha you can see the ionized gas
forming a nice kind of circular volume
around some star and if we fade out the
age alpha to a plane optical image it's
very clear that there's a star right in
the middle of the circle which happens
to be Rho of the most likely cause of
this so now we can see this also clearly
in the optical the question is whether
or not you can see anything in the
molecular gas is this really a wind or
just an ionized reach up
so we can jump forward you can sort of
get a sense of some of these other data
sets that she's using for comparative
purposes of the glympse survey which is
the infrared survey from the Spitzer
Space Telescope out the plane of the
galaxy and again here compared with
visible light view of the Milky Way you
know ending with sort of this question
so that so he gives you a sense of how
that kind of annotation might be doing
but actually you know astronomy is not
the only thing you can do with this
engine and it also applies to other
kinds of potential experiences earlier
there was some talk about digital
heritage and so in dumped on the junk
own Academy they're very interested in
providing some context for visitors in
terms of where the caves are in relation
to the visitor center that's going to be
there and so very quickly we put
together this guided tour which sort of
shows where the site is in China and
this is based on some imagery from a
visit or the group of us including some
of the people here in the audience we're
actually out in the field where the
visitors center was going to be so he
just gave me the actual plot plan that
they had from it and we just put that
here into worldwide telescope they had
other imagery from the building and so I
just dropped that in here other
elevation images I'm just jumping
forward here and so this sort of shows
you where the caves are so all this
imagery here is many hundreds of
terabytes of imagery from the Virtual
Earth servers underneath this that
allows you to look at the earth you know
from a variety of different ways either
mapping or straight imagery here's the
Mogao caves which is in this house oasis
in the desert inside of this kid is a
110-foot Buddha and so this is location
of cave 85 which is where the Getty
foundation is sponsoring some
restoration in that particular cave and
so they gave me these equirectangular
images that they had already created
about the interior of the cave then I
just got those here in towards a
telescope ken and the Getty conservation
Institute to conserve kv-85 a large tang
dynasty Greta the shrine was
commissioned in heat 62 buys iPhone the
powerful head of a family in the dung
quat region and completed some five
years later over the centuries however
cave 85 has been considerably damaged
like other caves at ground level it's
floor was flooded in the past when they
talk so like all the other tours you're
just in this another visual data
environment that you can decide to pause
and explore any other part of it that
you decide you want to you know we could
jump forward we can jump back jump to
another sort of view of the cave all of
these things are possible just because
of the simple infrastructure we have in
order to do this so I'm going to pop
back to my slides here and
and conclude this is the technical
architecture for worldwide telescope we
started with one cloud from a number of
surveys NASA as I said mentioned came in
with another cloud full of the super
high-res imagery from the Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter as well as the
the lunar Luna we orbited orbiter as
well and hopefully over time there'll be
more and more data sets that will people
will host in this sort of common format
the idea is that the the user has no
idea and should need to care about where
the data clouds are they're just Oliver
but within this simple rich environment
and they're available for sort of adding
your sort of metadata and passed within
it this is just about sort of future
telescopes that are coming in terms of
the larger sensors and of course the
corresponding amount of data so how do
we deal with that much data I mean
crowdsourcing is certainly an
opportunity given to things which
happened with Galaxy Zoo perhaps a
machine learning from training sets from
crowd-sourced data but I really also
think that compelling and natural user
interfaces like worldwide telescope and
providing data services that allow
really simple creation of metadata and a
combination of all these efforts is
really the way we can start to handle
big data going forward in the future
what I'd like to do is yep to be working
these are the three ideas that are
really important to us in worldwide
telescope the idea of which guy did pass
through data clouds in terms of being
able to to you know at any point
interact and explore the idea of
contextual visualization and the idea of
an intuitive user interface for for
broader public access to the data so
this is the URL it's the dot org and
what I'd like to do is I like to
introduce professor cui who's going to
talk about the applications of world
wide telescope here in China and some of
the exciting developments that he's been
working on dr. clean
thanks Curtis does no Curtis give us a
background on a summer powerful thermal
demonstration over to the world about
tesco my talk will focus the activities
in China are came from the national
astronomical observatory I'm use etude
seems very far from computer science
however we have clothes on the very well
collaboration with some with computer
scientists several years ago dr. Jim
Gray who already friendly name for the
average world Walter scope in
professional in professional astronomy
will have another name for this effort
almost the same meaning virtual
Observatory which web adultery is a
dirty intensively online astronomical
research under education environment
taking advantages of advanced imaging
technologies to achieve seamless global
access to Australia information we know
the power of the world wide web is
transparency it seems that almost all
the documents are ha see the UPC so what
your auditory have such achieve the same
transparency and to link together
warriors of resources for the
astronomers under for the public virtual
over Daughtry not only belongs to us for
me see are many virtual adulteries means
besides yourselves and their other
similar communities are currently there
are how being about a 20 what of the
editorial products worldwide undeserved
tennis where to auditory program is the
National real part of the in China
English ATT in 2002 at the same year dr.
Jim Gray who visited the National
Australian Hall of auditory under widda
today so tell me your product with was
his suggestion under recommendation we
donned the dancer from the international
water over territorial eyes at that year
during the during the last five years so
ten year program had established a very
good team including several core
partners are under some collaborators
meaning from the Chinese universities
under over territories honor we also
established good collaboration with some
external collaboration collaborators the
mix of research under Microsoft Research
Asia our keeper partners on education
and the popularization and we hope in
the future we have more collaboration on
astronomical research so what what has
both this package was released
officially main house 2008 the same day
to simply as a wind chime earthquaker
arriving from day for the Chinese our
collaboration with the makers of the
research started at the same time
in in the June issue of amateur
astronomer already popular magazine in
China we released our short notice for
the release of the water otoscope under
unit below issue of that machine are
good this paper astronomy in google sky
on a worldwide telescope area 27 an age
was ten years anniversary for their I'm
SRA two years anniversary collaborating
with the college's from Microsoft
Research we prepared our David tour to
tell a story to tell their chance one
chance story is chinese name is Neil on
Junichi Tazawa because our tour is a so
popular an interesting family we got a
bastard demonstration of odd episode
anniversary from that and from that
point working together we will save our
colleges from the emergence of the
research we do a service of electrons
under tutorials in different attorneys
cities for example beijing ohon and
Shanghai each each one will get very
positive feedback from the audience so
gr friedberg encourage us to add voltage
to prove i work for the word water scope
in China for the mall
during the last two years we establish
that the world Walt has to go a
community beijing and that we provide
Chinese interface for the public key on
the setup community Sarah on the results
narrow and curse the better and the data
of the developer team and we also
organize the few students on the
teachers to translate the English
tutorials and the documents in the
Chinese so that a knowledgeable can
getting information from the double from
the internet from the web search and we
also open us by the certain online forum
for the abductee community this one is a
Chinese version of the public key and
here is the website for the whe
community bejean here is an online forum
for the community I'm sure many of us
were not forget we're not forgot so
total solar eclipse in China last year
Microsoft Research Asia on a national
astronomical observatories together with
other partners in China we organize a
lot skill like both castor for the total
solar eclipse along the Yangtze River we
selected 11 opposition sighs along the
solar eclipse belt under symbol Baxter's
you nose towards central node and then
broadcast to the world to provide public
signals so a federal results ryu
exciting we got cute audience for
example theories and logos for our
clients of the live broadcast we got
City signed class
including 17 network putters turn TV
stations while mobile phone photos on
the to ipv6 potholes you're including
the senior nr8 under LP from America and
OBC from Japan an ephemeral some other
countries we originally we we can't
believe the results of the cliq butter
at you realize in the end so total click
of the website reached 200 a under 30
million it is low field well hi this
picture shows audience from Malcolm
being of adultery to watch the lower
broadcaster of the solar eclipse maybe
you're under here where is the developed
here yeah we in the lab at castle we use
TT as a backup in case our our adult
hours of the size can't get solar
eclipse signals because of a Budweiser
when you use whe to simulate the solar
eclipse on the broadcast to the world of
course we will notice the audience it
was not allow seniors but assimilated as
a developer team fortunately so whether
with an episode we watched three terms
total solar eclipse in changing etron an
Aloha to further our collaboration
between the above the trees on the
makers of the research under voltage the
TT a provision under you factor in China
in the year will organize the on
a guided tour desiring contest for
Chinese spoken areas we feel it is
important to the success of the contest
if we provide user friendly materials on
the back end information further for the
users so we you watch professional or
ceramic artists to design the website
under supposta and we also prepared a
trailer because of term I will not show
that will appear in additional to the
contest a provision to you know to to
you watch as much other students at more
students to click machine so a contest
in August we organized teacher training
for the developed e in beijing normal
university limited by the computer room
of the university CR about 30 the
teachers from different parts of the
trainer attended the training and we
also got very positive feedback from the
teachers so we desired next year we
organized the second the training for
the contest we take advantages from
where as a network media for example
academic photos public photos blogs and
Twitter a similar quarters while similar
better not to talk because Twitter is
blocked in China and we use video
Potter's on forums to other voltage so
for your contest here is the news
reports from the National stranica
Observatory on this one from Chinese of
them of scientist sina com q
yo calm anas overcame this very popular
network petals all of them follow the
contest and this use one is you youku a
radio total in china yep we also use the
blog for example this one is amazing
space for the contest I'm sorry to hear
that the arm essence base will be closed
well soon and this one is a sinner
sinner tutor at the website for the
Microsoft Research asia in there in the
following four minutes i will show for
tours selected tools from the contest to
show different area functions of the TT
that it's all from different of parts
we're taking this tour is to us an
introduction about the solar system
another universe you know traditional
not to give yourself first it will
interview other partial impression about
the universe the Milky Way and the to me
into the solar system very wet so also
will do as a page in the description of
other some well-known dips with
obnoxious this tour is repaired by a
small team one student in China and one
student in Singapore charger
to prepare a WR detour into desslok for
you to do our ppt slides under the
results is is like a short film so it
either way good tool for education and
therefore you in search results ok the
next one i will show you
this tool is a story in so tell story
about an author to watch to observe the
solar eclipse in last year so also the
center of the authors well he's a
location in China under he has simple
telescope and towards the solid clips
this user testicle of the author and a
few opportunity tell you clips
eating a huge digital simulation from
the developer team for that place under
in the 14 part of the tour so also we
will give a brief introduction about the
hole the size of the solar eclipse
yes the third one is prepared by staff
from building planetarium so she used to
use his radio telescope to introduce of
the visions in the building planetarium
here is a location of the Beijing
planetarium right near to the beijing
zoo most of us are especially Beijing us
know the Polish very well
this
yes the images are as the visions in the
Beijing planetarium under some from the
double of Chi and the z1 is an
attribution about the Mercury Mars and
Earth
the last one is another story about
environment protection yeah I'm sorry if
you can reach if you cannot read chinese
maybe you didn't know what the others to
say because to alter the name of the
author is I'm fine the name of the
author is on find cheap he's a doll from
mas under period of the door us under
how the tells us how does it isn't RS so
else will be fine in the future so if
only we take care of us our future is
right very beautiful countries however
because of the increase of our
temperature many island countries will
disappear in the next cell tens of years
and they also also care about a bath
because they don't know their future yes
they are looking for the our future our
doesn't stop here because of Tom you
know whether we learn from these tours
under the letter of curtis the WT is a
good result for the collaboration of our
computer scientists and astronomers
under the public under I also feel the
Babel dirty the world water scope is our
ideal is ideal platform for the concept
under the power of E signs on the date
inter cereal science on the citizen
science thank you Thanks one toilet get
some questions
there any questions that we can answer
while we're waiting I forgot to say a
couple of things I was showing the slow
and galaxies out there but I didn't take
the time that I could of course picked
any one of those million galaxies and
then right click and pulled up a page
from directly from Sloan with one click
which would pull up the image of the
galaxy the spectrum you can download the
actual data itself sort of closing that
loop alike what we talked about earlier
no other questions it's in a hand back
there I can't really see I guess not ok
guess that's it will give you the time
to thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
