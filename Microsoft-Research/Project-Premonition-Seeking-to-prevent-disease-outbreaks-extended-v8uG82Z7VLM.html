many people getting sick going to the
hospital the doctor evaluates them and
if they look suspicious reports it to an
agency like the whu-oh so an average it
takes about two weeks to detect that a
disease has moved into the human
population in the spreading project
premonition will predict diseases before
they occur in the human population by
going into the environment and sampling
in the environment analyzing before they
get to humans so this hasn't been done
before we chose Grenada because it's a
site where we can get an initial set of
data to help us understand what does it
look like if you can go into the
environment and collect information
about the microorganisms in the
environment in this way
what we want to do is to be able to
catch that mosquito efficiently at scale
and at low cost the overall goal of this
project is to monitor infectious agents
as they move across the planet so in the
endgame we would like to have a global
system available that detects new
infectious agents and then monitors
their movement as they emerge in this
way we can intervene before they become
an epidemic or before they become an
infectious problem for humans or
wildlife the top three challenges are
first
reinventing the devices that sit in the
environment to capture samples current
collection technologies are very limited
and present a lot of biases so part of
this project is creating a new trap
design a new collection design which is
always very exciting and will hopefully
catch a much broader spectrum of
mosquitoes than we normally collect the
second challenge is getting a autonomous
system like a drone to go in and out of
a complex environment it has to be safe
it has to be secure we're bringing
operating systems that we know are very
safe so that a drone can't be let's say
hacked or commandeered we're bringing
technologies that analyze the software
that's driving the drone to make sure
that there aren't failures in it before
we deploy it into the field we also have
deep expertise in machine learning and
computer vision that give the drone the
autonomy and decision-making it needs to
deal with these complex environments the
process to catch the skills in the field
with essentially current technologies is
pretty labor-intensive traps have to be
prepped before we get to the field all
the other necessary equipment gathered
and hiked out or travel out to travel
occasions and and hang the trap and
leave it for the night and then come
back the next day and take the trap down
essentially dismantle the process and
pulse everything back in so the third
challenge is understanding the data
we're going to use gene sequencing which
will produce gigabytes of data from
every sample on the algorithmic
challenges how do you process the
gigabytes of data to find the pathogens
that are in those sequences so right now
our ability to analyze these sequences
depends on computer power and our
computer power is reasonably limited
right now and so the amount of data we
can handle is fairly limited now
eventually in this project we're hoping
to expand
we're looking at to look at many
different sites across the planet and
this will involve thousands of pieces of
data then we are going to have to expand
our computational power and we're going
to have to have to develop new
algorithms that can process the data
much faster premonition requires a
complex set of technologies what we want
to apply to achieve a goal like this our
advanced operating systems analysis
tools to find bugs in software before
they're in the wild machine learning and
vision to add complex autonomy into
these drones so that they can make
decisions and then finally cloud
computing and genomics so that we can at
scale analyze the complex data we obtain
I believe in the next five years a
system like this is attainable
