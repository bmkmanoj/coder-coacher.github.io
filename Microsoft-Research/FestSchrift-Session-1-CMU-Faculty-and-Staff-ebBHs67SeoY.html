hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
let's get started so welcome so we're
here to celebrate Rick's 60th birthday
with a festschrift and you may well ask
what is a festschrift so strictly
speaking a fast trip to this is
something i know from wikipedia i'll
have to tell you I'm your life I'm
relying on Wikipedia so my understanding
from Wikipedia is that a fresh drift is
a book honoring a respected academic and
so in addition to the colloquium that we
have today we're also going to be
producing a volume that will collect
written contributions in some cases you
know that'll really be the same content
a written version of the content you're
hearing today a few people are you
actually contributing something pretty
different for the for the book in the
reflection today will be more personal
so there will be a book coming the book
will not be available for a few months
it takes a little time to produce the
book so this festschrift idea really
dates back to last summer I forget maybe
it was July or August or something
probably like July when a group of
Rick's friends and colleagues realized
gosh you know rick is gonna be turning
60 and and this was turning 60 in
September last year and you know we
really should do something special to
celebrate that and i think it was really
Peter actually suggested that do you
have a festschrift I hadn't even heard
of them but of course we realized it
organizing affect everyone's would
immediately thought that's a great idea
we should do a festschrift but
organizing it was going to take quite a
while we just didn't have the time to
get it all organized for September's so
but this time frame of March I think
it's working out pretty well for us and
my understanding is that this is often
the case with academics you know things
happen a little bit late and so we're
really just you know following in the
grand tradition of having our
festschrift you know a few months after
the actual birthday so one thing I want
to emphasize maybe a bit of a caveat is
that this festschrift is not meant to
anticipate Rick's retirement
we're celebrating his career and his
accomplishments to date but we're also
looking forward to you know a lot more
great things to come I think I remember
Rick saying once something about having
to pry his cold dead hands off the
keyboard so I take that to mean we're in
no imminent danger of losing Rick so so
so we're celebrating Rick 60th birthday
today and not his retirement I reason
I'm emphasizing this so much is actually
I've gotten some emails you know as I
sent out sent out the announcement I
actually i did get emails back from
people hey does this mean that Rick is
retiring and I wanted to squash all of
those rumors right up right up front so
a couple of logistical things before we
dive into the first talk so one thing I
would last the speakers to do I hope
you're willing is to sign a speaker
release form that we have out front
where you got your badges and the reason
for that is in the last week I've gotten
emails from some folks who are not able
to travel to be here in person they
would really like to be able to watch
the recording that we're making of the
festschrift and and so if you can sign
that release that would be really
helpful you know if you don't get around
to doing that we're gonna have to cut
your talk out of the out of the
recording that we make available to them
and that would be unfortunate so we are
recording this for later viewing and
also streaming it live so there's people
back in you know building 99 Microsoft
Research sure you know going to be able
to watch watch from there but I'm glad
to see the turnout that we have here
today so with that we don't have a lot
of time we're going to be pretty timely
with our transition so I'd like to ask
raj to come up and start you can take a
look at the agenda and if the
organization is pretty obvious you know
the morning is focused on people who
knew Rick from CMU and then the
afternoon is more focused on people who
knew Rick here at Microsoft or people
who are involved in getting microsoft
research started and then we finish up
with a session that sort of talks about
Rick's more eclectic interests
but Raj when you start you have your mic
on already I think so good am I good
good to go good to go okay good morning
so fast shift according to some people
in Germany that I heard from long ago 40
50 years ago is a festival of writing
whenever somebody gets to be about 60
you're supposed to all your colleagues
are supposed to get together everybody
writes a paper and publicly no presents
it and it becomes a book so it is a book
but it's actually festival was writing
so anyway so this morning we are here to
celebrate a remarkable scientific career
spanning an exciting period in the
history of computer science and
computing Rick came to CMU in 1979 32
years ago and I thought there's a good
chance he might continuously this thesis
research in vision and AI but as luck
would have it we just then got a big
grant for distributed sensor networks I
said Rick we need a distributed
operating system for this he said I've
been thinking about it I'm going to do
this okay that's how mark emerged out of
all of that and we had a spice group at
that time and he was a natural fit to
kind of lead some of the projects there
and so it turned out after 32 years he
has had major impact in many dimensions
on the field and today I think we are
here to celebrate his contributions
the reason I chose this topic is I
thought he needs one other big swan song
after all the things you've done and
this will keep him busy for another 32
years okay if you were to choose to get
it started at MSR John McCarthy once
said that to get to human level
artificial intelligence will need 1.7
Einstein's and to Maxwell's and five
Faraday's and point three Manhattan
Project okay I'm not sure which of the
three Rick will be called invitees be
Einstein of the AI groups are Maxwell or
saturday I think any one of them that
those Appalachians would be wonderful if
that could be accomplished so what is
human level a i and ii i guess forward
so basically today i want to kind of
quickly talk to you about various
attempts are defining thinking machines
and why the time now might be opportune
to proceed with this project and finally
what we might what roadmap or agenda we
can create to get there so the first one
we are not talking about creating
machines that have mind and
consciousness that's not the purpose
here now are we talking about creating
useful systems that act intelligently we
are talking about building systems that
exhibit the same level of intelligence
and competence that most people on the
planet have the definition here is most
even you think of more than a billion
people are illiterate you can't say a
computer must be able to prove theorems
are various other things
that comes afterwards first let us kind
of see we can build a basic level of
human intelligence that everybody on the
planet would have and not just educated
people so Turing onwards have made
number of proposals the Turing proposal
I don't know how many of you have read
that the the paper by Turing where he
proposes the imitation game but that
most people stop there but actually if
you read the second half of his paper he
says maybe the way to do this is to
create a child machine and educated okay
and it goes into substantial details one
of the things just the context of the
time he says maybe our child machine
doesn't have to have eyes and limbs you
know okay and I don't think we'll you
know need to put that restriction today
the the most comprehensive effort at
creating an architectural assistant for
general intelligence was by Newell the
sore project and what he was looking for
that has been his passion throughout his
life is to create a unified theory just
like unified theory of physics he was
trying to create a unified theory of
artificial intelligence or and and and
also general intelligence because he was
also trying to build models of human
intelligence and there were a number of
principles and procedures and things
that he has they have you know and I'm
you know pronounced or the period both
Simon and low I listed two or three of
them here I won't read them but but the
problem turns out to be this
architecture mainly is intended to be
problem-solving architecture for
cognitive tasks it and when I remember
challenging Alan and saying Alan this
won't do speech envision how can you
have production systems within speech
and vision he said we will come to that
in the second version that's something I
don't know what exactly you had in mind
but
so the my own view is I think I'm not
sure there is such a thing as a unified
theory then the next one there was a
paper by McCarthy called the
well-designed child and where he says
let us not worry about what the human
child might have if we are going to have
a well-designed child machine let us
give it everything we can give it and
then see what how quickly it can learn
or will do whatever it needs to do and
I'll come back to this in a while and
kurt's while I don't know if any of you
have read his book in son singularity
and basically he says we are almost
there another 30 years we'll have
superhuman AI and this proposal was to
reverse-engineer the human brain using
nanotechnologies and make it run a
thousand times faster and there's a
fundamental that I have whether just by
reengineering the bits you know whether
this system will exhibit intelligence he
seems to think so it's like to me it's
like taking a bunch of chips that go
into making a PC and throw it on the
table and say compute it doesn't it
doesn't you have to connect it in a
particular way and everything has to be
synchronized and so there's a whole
bunch of issues on architecture that may
or may not work Nell's nelson in this in
a paper and book kind of proposes saying
let's build a child machine but let's
kind of educate it but my requirement is
it must be able to do all the tasks that
human beings do for jobs I think that's
too much at this point and Minsky
proposal comes closest to what i think
is the right thing in the long run it is
not one unified theory it's in a year
both in his Society of mines book and
his emotion machines he kind of says
there may be many methods of
representing knowledge there may be many
ways to make inference there may be many
ways to learn
innovated statistical learning or you
know other kinds of in a case-based
learning or whatever analogical learning
and let's use all of them we may have to
use all of them because human beings may
be using the same thing and so you kind
of goes on to give its own proposal how
that might be done the main problem I
find with all these proposals here is
they have a blind spot they think this
thinking machine should have capability
similar to their own and in our tutoring
things it will be as good as men in all
purely intellectual fields McCarthy
thinks the well-designed child should
have handled non-monotonic reasoning and
introspection Newland Simon thinks they
should be able to prove theorems and
play chess okay so I think all of them
are reasonable objectives ultimately but
we don't have to impose all of them
right at the beginning I would settle
for a four-year-old child equivalent for
a child that's what I'm going to propose
it later on and so here we are you know
so the question is why now and I propose
we have had a number of very important
advances in the last 10 years in AI
which give me a lot of hope at this
point that we can you know if with a
sustained effort we may be able to be on
the Underground the brink of getting
there so those of you know you know it
started with deep blue between Kasparov
and then we had drivers driverless
vehicles though Stanley winning the
off-road navigation of 132 miles without
a driver and the CMU system a boss
winning the urban challenge and if these
things don't happen overnight these are
results of like 25 years of DARPA
funding in fact when Rick was still at
CMU we would have seen these Tara Gator
vehicles it would they would take one
step and think for 20 minutes and take
another step you know and so these these
things take time but ultimately they do
happen and so now we when we look at
to what happened in information
retrieval and search google bing yahoo
and so on again if you look at the
historical precedents and a google came
out of the NSF funding of the digital
libraries at stanford and the you know
the other the first search engine like
horse was built at Stanford and at CMU
by fuzzy Malden that was the first
full-text indexing texting as a search
engine and machine translation is a very
dramatic story ten years ago if you told
me you can produce respectable
translation by any pair of 60 languages
I would not have believed it today
google google translate does that and it
is very impressive it's all purely
statistical unfortunately and there are
now people trying to do hybrid systems
hopefully we'll get to the next stage in
this so then the most recent to that
happened in the last year is the watson
question answering system amazing
amazing in a result and I would not have
believed it if I hadn't seen it there
are all kinds of things they have to do
you know to answer a question in three
seconds and they have to maybe confident
they have to have the clue selection
analysis the betting strategy all kinds
of things had to go into that it's not
just a question of retrieving a bunch of
things like a search engine would do to
me that is the next challenge I call it
the village Google there are a billion
people that are illiterate they can't
use Google or Bing or any Yahoo however
they can ask a question and they want
answers to that question in speech in
any language and I think it can be done
we have beginnings of it it may take us
10 years 20 years or something but I
think useful
can be built that will be answering
questions rather than just giving your
list of things for you to read and
synthesize your own answer there are
more problem solving systems rather than
just information retrieval systems the
other dramatic thing that happened is
the iphone app city again if anybody has
said ten years ago that you'll be able
to ask a question to an open population
I would have said impossible we don't
know how to do that and there are at
least four companies that have
equivalent technology in speech then a
Microsoft IBM google and nuance which is
being licensed by Apple and they're all
i think about the same equally good but
there are a lot of limitations for
example one of my two complaints to all
the recognition systems is they don't
they choose not to recognize nonverbal
songs if somebody shuts the door
somebody is walking or some toilet
flushing and other things or
disfluencies you know where you cough in
the middle of your speech and these
things we recognize and semantically
understand what they mean and then we
reject it as being unnecessary for the
understanding of the speech but most of
the current system simply do the
following they just say they're all
garbage words they don't they choose not
to recognize they built a garbage model
and that's not i think that right there
are lots of shortcuts of that kind that
they've taken both in acoustics you know
you build an acoustic learning model
with multiple gaussians i don't think
that's the right thing in the long run
so there are lots of interesting issues
that have to be solved but I think
they'll all get solved and the problem
what we are seeing is the systems have
become so big and that in order to make
progress we are to get there faster so
anyway the big the lessons from these
things
our unlimited data unlimited access to
computation and memory and bandwidth and
and use of statistics that was not
anticipated that all of this you know
basically almost all these systems use
terabytes multiple terabytes or hundreds
of terabytes of data and processing all
that takes in a cloud computing of you
know of the kind the thing that
surprised me was city essentially
doesn't do any computation on board it
digitized the waveform doesn't even do
the mel capsule coefficient and then
ships it and then somewhere you know
offline the recognition is done and then
sent back and if you have fast enough
computers and and lots of them millions
of them you can handle you know any
number of speakers we can simultaneously
and so but all these systems are still
fragile so if you take Siri what happens
when it doesn't understand it usually
one of the things in the dialogue
systems we did in 90s that they are
using now is what we call case frame
parsing and they do the same thing
except instead of doing travel task
which is all we did they have 20 case
frames for different kinds of task where
is the nearest restaurant where is
nearest gas station the common things
people seem to ask for each one they
have one and they build all of these
simultaneously and which all one has the
best score gets answered if they can't
answer any of them are all of them are
kind of pretty poor then they simply
apparently send all the data to a search
engine like Ming Google and whatever
comes they kind of quickly summarize and
show a few options so that the the user
can so it looks intelligent from from
the perspective of a user that it
understood what they said and doing the
best it can and so the question then is
what do we want to do how do we get
there basically I already gave you an
indication of four-year-old child
machine and given I only have three
minutes I'll try to kind of quickly go
through it basically lets agree
that all we want to do is create to
create a machine that has the same level
of capabilities that most human beings
most human beings if you have some other
handicapped you may not be able to do
this have the same cognitive
capabilities but what I want you to
remember is 5,000 years ago almost
everybody was illiterate but they were
bright enough to me and see the need to
invent writing they invented this they
discovered agriculture they did a lot of
things in so it doesn't mean just
because you're illiterate you're stupid
or you don't do problem solving you
solve problems based on whatever
knowledge you have at that point in time
so anyway so I think we know how we can
begin to create an architecture for the
child machine I have you know in the
paper multiple levels and descriptions
of what they might do but the key thing
I want you to remember out of this these
child machines is that they should be
only educated they cannot there is no
program there's some architecture you
start with then you feed it all the
sensitive data that a child is exposed
to including touch and temperatures and
everything and at the end of six months
when the child machine sees the image of
the mother it should smile at they at
the end of ten months it should start
speaking ha and ma right and there are
theories in different brain science of
how this might happen and the most
important thing there is unlike
conventional systems and commercial
programs these are self self scheduling
systems and they you know in the old
days we used to call it goal-directed
architectures they use a lot of a lot of
they learn from experience they use a
lot of memory lot of knowledge they
tolerate error and
beauty and the exhibit goal-directed
behavior and all of them can be built in
and so one of the you know curious
things is what is a child born with at
the 80 and there are a lot of one of the
great things about this particular area
is the developmental psychologists have
been studying it they'll give you as
much detail as you can swallow about
what a child seems to know at the end of
the first semester trimester already
they claim they know lots of things and
so given that I think we have a good
chance of getting there so my thesis
here in conclusion is that we should try
to do this and not only that it should
be done here started at microsoft
research because this is the only place
in the world which has enough critical
mass of computer science researchers
that can undertake such an undertaking
and i'm not saying you everybody should
drop whatever they're doing and do this
if you take a thousand PhDs and say ten
percent of them are going to study this
problem that may be a good thing to do
with that i'll stop thank you very much
all right thank you guys so I realized
that I forgot to introduce Raj
appropriately so I'm Lee just do that
now believes as I did take the trouble
to do a little research on Raj garage is
the University professor of computer
science and robotics at Carnegie Mellon
University obviously is a pioneer in the
field of artificial intelligence and
among many other accolades he received
the Turing award in 1994 and now we have
Saatchi and Saatchi let's get you miked
up here alright so Satya is the Carnegie
group professor of computer science at
Carnegie Mellon University Sachi has an
experimental computer scientist done a
lot of great systems work particularly
known for his work in the areas of
mobile and pervasive computing
on a personal note I still think of AFS
the Andrew file system as the best
distribute file system that I've ever
used thank you I wish I could be using
it here all right thank you very much is
this thing working yeah okay great so
thank you for turning 60 Rick so that we
could celebrate it's such a great thing
for you to do in I want to thank rich
and everyone else who organized this for
bringing us together because I've met
people here I haven't seen in 20 plus
years maybe even longer so what I want
to do today is to share my thoughts on a
piece of work that I think is the most
significant technical contribution that
people associate with with Rick's career
yes of course after they came to
Microsoft researched on many other
things but the mark operating system is
what is certainly a very major part of
his career so anyone who is not working
oh it does finally anyone who talked to
Rick in the in the mid 80s when he was
thinking up mock he had he had been
working on I think accent was the
predecessor and and he was working and
thinking about Mark the excitement he
shared in my mind when I talked to him
always focused on two central ideas one
that operating systems had grown bloated
and two large that was true then it's
even more true today and there was a
need to shrink to simplify to be minimal
and the second idea by the mid 80s you
could run das you could run the
Macintosh operating system you could run
unix but you'd have a different machine
for each and so Rick said why should i
do this it should be as easy as moving a
mouse from one window to the other to be
able to use the right tool for the right
job so the concept of multiple operating
systems or the industry buzz word at
that time was multi
personalities on the same hardware at
the same time was another big idea and
so what I want to Center this talk on
are these two ideas and follow them
through the last roughly 30 years so
let's look at simplifying shrink the
first public description of this idea is
from this paper of 1986 which I have a
cut and paste any typos you see are in
the original and it basically is the
microkernel manifesto it makes the point
that I made earlier about shrinking and
simplifying and that that's the only way
to get it right when articulated and
implemented in the earliest mark
implementations this became widely
recognized as an important idea in fact
within a few years I would say within
five years everybody who did anything
with operating systems believed in micro
kernels that was a industry consortium
call OSF one the entire workshops and
conferences the mock usenix symposia
there were papers in SOS be the premier
operating systems forum there were
companies which like chorus which used
the idea but not the implementation and
there were others like the IBM
microkernel which actually did build on
the actual code so this was hot
unfortunately by the end of the 90s
things didn't look so good and in fact
there was a lot of talk and
retrospection that micro kernels were a
dead idea in fact here's an example of a
typical blog you can find this notice
the date 2006 talking about unraveling
the microkernel myth and then talking
about what caused this spectacular
failure notice it's not just failure its
spectacular failure ok this is usual web
hype the good news is that reports of
the death of the microkernel vision
a grossly exaggerated a different group
of researchers who were inspired by
ricks vision this is jochen lead key at
GMD and then at IBM Watson and then call
through University and his colleagues
and associates granot Heiser was now in
Australia and Kevin elephant stone built
a series of micro kernels l3 l4 and
their descendants which have continued
to this day to embody exactly the
principle of simplicity and small size
and in fact just a few years ago the elf
for Colonel formal verification won the
best paper award at SOS be so certainly
in academia the idea is well and alive
and this is a slide for garner from
Ghana heiser there are commercial very
substantial commercial commercial use of
the office concept that in the field of
embedded systems micro kernels are doing
very well okay so that's that's the
simplifying shrink vision what about the
idea of supporting simultaneously
multiple operating systems on the same
hardware not with the reboot in between
but concurrently so this is the earliest
reference that I could find it's from
1989 there are second hot topics in
operating systems workshop and it
basically expresses the point that is
the essence of this idea which is the
colonel becomes a kind of universal
socket into which more than one
operating system environment can be
plugged insulating it from the hardware
itself greatly simplifying the design
and implementation great idea there were
real implementations of this idea
outside Carnegie Mellon so this is a cut
and paste from a digital equipment paper
white paper Cheryl wieszczyk and her
team implemented mock VMs which ran
concurrently with UNIX on the
microkernel platform
and the biggest bet of all was placed by
IBM which from 1991 to roughly 1996 had
an enormous effort in the IBM workplace
operating system so at one point believe
it or not there were over 2,000
developers engaged in the task now how
over 2,000 people engaged in a task and
do anything useful is beyond me but it's
an indication of the amount of
investment of resources that they were
able to to to to make on this and it was
the case that by the fall of nineteen
ninety-two at Comdex is one of these
monster events I don't know if it still
takes place IBM demonstrated dos and
os/2 and UNIX all of these on the IBM
microkernel platform unfortunately
through a variety of factors mostly
dealing with the engineering challenges
of getting the details right of dotting
the is crossing the t's getting the
performance right the problem was far
harder than the engineers realized and
in terms of getting out a product that
they could sell competitively relative
to the other hardware and operating
systems monolithic operating systems it
didn't make it so the project was
cancelled and the the last version of
the IBM market microkernel was released
in version 2 was released in 1996 so if
you had asked 10 years ago is this
vision of multiple personalities on a
common base you know is this like an old
idea this is likely to have any any
relevance today the answer would have
been its history you know it was a great
idea they tried it out it didn't work
forget it but today look at any cloud
what you have is exactly the vision that
Rick described multiple operating
systems running on the same hardware
the thin layer of software now the name
is different they don't call it a
microkernel they call it a virtual
machine okay the division is the same in
fact there has been a raging debate in
the operating systems community in the
in the last few years so Steve hand one
of the guys who worked on the Xen
hypervisor had this paper in the Hutus
proceedings on virtual machine monitors
are really micro kernels done right if
only these guys back in the 90s had
understood this is how you had to do it
we're going to had all this trouble and
there was a rebuttal from Garneau Heiser
the guy who leads the l4 effort saying
nonsense micro kernels or micro kernels
and you know virtual machines we don't
need them for this purpose you can go
read the original debate virtual
machines are an amazing concept because
you know they're on all the older idea
than even micro kernels they date back
to the 60s when hardware was scarce and
people needed to replicate the hardware
in order to get access to it but the
emergence of personal computing and
personal Hardware meant you know why do
you need virtual machines when you can
have physical ones and if you had asked
people in the 1990s is there a future
for virtual machines so this stuff is
old stuff who needs them and yet in 2012
the idea is very vibrant very alive in
the basis of cloud computing and it's
worth spending one moment asking why so
this picture shows you essentially how
the multiple operating systems on a
common base works and in fact to be
honest this picture on the left of the
arrow wasted hourglass figure is true of
any interface that separates a producer
at the bottom from consumers at the top
in the case of the marker kernels the
narrow waist line is the very slender
API of the microkernel the interface of
the microkernel in the case of the
virtual machine interface it's the
instruction set
now the two properties that are critical
for success here one is that the
waistline be as narrow as possible
because narrow interfaces give you the
widest possible range of opportunities
on both sides of the interface it's easy
to build a system that matches a narrow
interface then one that has to match
perfectly across a wide wide range of n
of interface calls so that's one and the
other is it has to be stable if you have
an unstable interface it's very
difficult to make it last a long time so
you can create narrow interfaces and
software in fact that's what micro
kernels aspire to do the problem with
interfaces is that it's just like waste
lines in real life they have a tendency
to expand and the reason is very simple
if you own the interface it's extremely
difficult to resist the temptation to
add just the slight extension to the API
that makes your application do superbly
an application that he hadn't thought of
and so bit by bit this elegant swelled
API becomes one of those bloated
interfaces that Rick railed against who
any first thought of the microkernel
vision so software is inherently to
malleable and the reason virtual
machines have succeeded I believe we're
micro kernels had a harder time in this
particular application is because you
don't own the interface the hardware
interface is typically built by a vendor
and is even Intel discovered when you
change the interface and do something
like itanium rather than x86 marketplace
penalizes you heavily so for better or
worse stability
even if ultimate narrowness of of
interface is not there the stability is
there with the virtual machine so in a
little in a little ways it's useful to
look at this this from a different angle
think of an abstraction like process
migration is that zayas here so Ed's
ious did a PhD thesis on process
migration in mock and so he was the
second or third person to do a process
migration thesis the earliest one that I
know is on the on the demo system way
back the early 80s 83 I think but
roughly every five years almost like a
clockwork yet another University
somewhere in the world produces a PhD
thesis on process migration okay and
probably one is do about now yet to the
best of my knowledge I'm not aware of
any product implementation whether in an
open source system or a close source
system of process migration virtual
machine migration on the other hand is
widely used is implemented it's used in
all the cloud computing platforms
because different names vMotion live
migration etc but the idea is there so
this is an example of where the
stability of the interface makes it
possible to widely deploy and simplify
the administration so in a way the
choice to use a hardware interface for
this purpose it's a little bit like the
story of Ulysses who wanted to listen to
the beautiful music of the sirens but of
course they lured the sailors onto the
rocks so you had the sailors years
filled with wax and he had himself tied
to the mast so that he could listen to
the music but he couldn't control the
sailors to do anything bad and he
listened to the music in they sail to
safety so to to wrap up
at the heart of the many many
contributions that mock made and there
are many and I've just sort of distilled
these down to use two simple ideas was
the idea of simplicity and smallness
brevity which is very powerful the
concept of the microkernel and the
notion that you should not have to do
her killian things like rebooting to
switch back and forth between worlds
that are best fits for what you're
trying to do that it should be as simple
as going from one window to the other
and while the mock operating system in
its original form may not be widely used
today the idea is that were at its heart
are very well in a life thank you right
Thank You Sachi so next up Alfred thank
you
so Alfred come on up now I think you're
you're up next
sure familiar with these so let me
introduce Alfred Alfred Spector is vice
president of research and special
initiatives at Google previously he was
an executive at IBM where he led their
software research before that he found
in trans arc startup spun out of
Carnegie Mellon to productize some
distribute filesystem and transaction
processing technology alfred was also my
first adviser it seemed you right hi
microphone is on I trust mm-hmm good his
raaz back yet ok good a good ed left
unfortunately to go find you but that
was i well i'll tell EDD the story later
so i'm going to do three things first i
want to comment on something Raj said
because I think you'll find it
interesting and it's not too widely
known and too I want to of course
comment on Rick who is of course the
object of most everything that we will
be saying today and or at least maybe
the indirect object i'm not sure which
someone in parsing will have to tell me
and then finally i want to comment a
little bit on Satya's discussion because
i was thinking about that in the shower
this morning in fact without having read
it but it's i really was it was a i was
able to intuit what he was going to say
so first Raj you talked about
translation saying you couldn't
anticipate how rapidly statistical
machine translation would make progress
but I want you to know you were the
catalyst of this more than you know
approximately ten years ago you may
remember that you visited IBM Watson I
was your host and at the time I was
leading the IBM software and services
research team globally and you said that
translation needed a metric like word
error rate in speech recognition that
would drive the researchers towards
near-term concrete goals and where they
would continue to try to outdo
themselves to improve quality I think
you may know this I'm not sure everyone
else does but within a year the IBM
Watson team produced the blue metric or
the brewer metric perhaps in French and
excuse my pronunciation and and that
metric
actually has been enormously successful
despite what I would say are huge flaws
that are inherent in it but it's still
been enormously successful and I can
tell you within the Google world that
metric has driven the team that did
translation to work you know incredibly
hard using every possible idea that they
could come up with to try to achieve
best-of-breed translation across the
language pairs that we do so he was very
important raj that was a really good
idea i don't know whether your idea of
building a child that is you know a
computer that does a child will be as
influential or not it would think it
would be more souks it's a broader idea
you need metrics for it so any case so
that was that was one comment the second
one is I do think actually parsing plays
a role in translation level so I suspect
that's true broadly across the world it
is certainly true a ghoul so these
systems are now beginning to apply what
I refer to as the combination hypothesis
that every good idea in AI must be
combined to generate systems which are
intelligent and that whether it's Newell
or whether or whether it's feiven bomb
or yourself or the statistical people
the machine learning people all this is
going all the ideas are going to prove
to be good and they're going to be
combined with a multiplicative reduction
in error rates to generate systems that
are reliable and we are beginning to
show that i'm sure i know because i was
involved in the early days of the watson
work at IBM the IBM Watson system is
based on that same concept of using
using enormous numbers of different
mechanisms of extraction to generate
increasingly reliable results so now
that's one comment so let me now turn to
Rick Rick so you were at CMU about two
years before I got there and ice in a
sort of silly way thought I might be
working with someone else when I got to
CMU but since this is being recorded I
shall say no more and in fact it turned
out that we were going to be working
together very heavily now I was very
interested in communications when I got
there I had worked wrote a thesis on
high performance remote procedure call
but you were doing that already you were
already you know inter messages and
you know ports and capability
architectures for message passing so
actually you very much influenced my
entire career because I had to move up
the stack because of you but that was
actually a good partnership for the most
part Rick and the way I always thought
of the world is Rick worked on the
operating system level abstractions and
moving into distributed systems of
course as well and I tried to work on
top of that and build other abstraction
say around transactions or other file
systems notions of replication that were
built on top and that was really a very
nice partnership however despite the
fact that it was great there was one
disadvantage in that partnership is as
computer scientists when we pitched our
work to funding agencies or outside
visitors we did things bottom up so Rick
would get up on stage for 45 minutes and
talk about ports in interposing
processes with ports and copy-on-write
and message passing you know I can give
your talk better than you can probably
still if you have any idea how many
times I heard Rick give the accent and
then the mock talk you would be you
would have pity on me so I listened to
this over and then of course I would
then give a talk on you know weighted
voting in replication or how you could
make our PC transactional or this or
that or the other things eventually some
wide area file systems things but Rick
would leave at the beginning of my talk
because he had class to teach or
students who advised and plus he had
heard it before so he didn't need to
stay so actually you were even more
influential Rick because I left CMU
because of this
it was widely thought that really widely
thought at CMU that you had to leave
when you got tenure right for example
when I got to CMU bill wolf left he's
tenured and Anita Jones was tenured she
left remember when Bentley left just
after he got tenure there was a whole
raft of people that got tenure at CMU
that left and that was perhaps we've
been maybe how you position your leaving
Rick I don't actually know but that's
how I presented was actually listening
to the microkernel talk despite its
beauty it's just proof by repetition has
limits so any case so that's one story
the second one is actually more serious
the thing that I and I wrote something
where you'll see this written down is
your optimism is I think such a
remarkable and powerful part of your
leadership and the benefits you've had
on our field on the organizations that
you've let Rick as all of you that have
worked with them is just an optimistic
glass 98.7 percent full kind of person
and I think that's just a tremendous
benefit in the field of computer science
because anything we can conceive of we
actually can do that's the nice thing
about this field is that we can actually
do the things if that we can conceive of
as long as we're optimistic about it and
we execute that I think was Jim Gray's
great skill as well that was dangerous
on a sailboat I regret to say so it's
not such a good thing in sailing
conservatism is probably better and
sailing but in computer science it's a
great skill so I think many of you I
don't know if you still do this but Rick
could say bigger better faster cheaper
more rapidly and more fluidly with this
wonderful combination of legato and
music musical quality than anyone else
that can you do it for us now
please could you stand up and say bigger
better faster cheaper please okay would
you please make sure he gets high
alcohol content beverages tonight so
that we can hear Rick to a rendition an
e-flat major of bigger better faster
cheaper that being said Rick also had
focus and Rick definitely stayed focused
on a number of things you can't do
everything he may have had interests in
virtually everything but he did stay
focused and that was another very
important lesson to learn um last story
is in 1991 well I recall I don't know if
I've ever told you this recently Rick
but I recall exactly where I was and
where I was looking when I got a call
from you in about somewhere between
seven and ten o'clock at night I was at
trans arc in a 20th floor corner office
overlooking three rivers and Rick called
and said that you had gotten an offer to
start a research group at microsoft and
should you take it and I remember
strongly advising you to do that because
I was having a blast at trans arc and I
was finding myself in an with an
opportunity to really diversify the
kinds of interest that I had was not
that CMU was in any way not great but I
had a much broader set of
responsibilities and I actually thought
that you also had that breath and that
you would love it and that micro kernels
were a good thing but there was more to
life than micro kernels so I remember
strongly encouraging you I had in fact
considered a job offer very seriously
about two and a half years before at
this great company and and I turned it
down so I had experience and I almost
did it so it was really great to say you
should go do this and they should pay
you a lot etc and and I guess it all
worked out well so I do observe that to
some degree some small degree perhaps
epsilon you folks at Microsoft that have
had Rick as your fearless leader oh that
to a degree to the research leader at
Google which is sort of an interesting
thing so last comment I want to just
make briefly because I'd probably used
up too much time or will soon use up too
much time this this comment that that
sod you brought up sort of looking bad
critically at a very important
collection of research in the modular
construction of operating systems which
is I would say the overall framework for
this is it's a really interesting thing
to look back in fact at this and many
other aspects of systems and try to draw
engineering conclusions about what's
white right and what's wrong and why
thing and also why things happened as
they did I was reading micro it turns
out i was reading vm papers on the
airplane yesterday coming over here over
the last few years from made published
in the last decade and was thinking
about this on the airplane as well as
why did one thing actually take off more
than the other why why did these things
happen um there are lots of other areas
where we actually haven't reached broad
conclusions as a systems community as to
what happened why and what the
implications are in my own field the
notion of distributed transaction seem
to be very promising at one point to
lots of people to be frank we use them
much less than then we would have
predicted we do use them there are
places we don't use them as a
fundamental system structuring technique
in most places why is that what happened
so I think the kind of analysis sought
you just did is a really interesting one
it would be good if those of us in the
systems community could ever reach
definitive conclusions on all these
ideas that we pursued and actually write
them down and say this is actually
better for this reason or that reason or
the hard winter face is better for these
reasons or it actually isn't better it's
only because we were undisciplined
towards some feature creep or something
and if that's really the reason but I
don't actually know and I'm not sure
it's been studied so i would call so if
Raj is asking for four year old I'm
asking that just that we analyze all of
these probes that we've dumb as sort of
mature adults and actually try to reach
enough conclusions that we could tell
the next generation actually how to do
things anyway Rick happy birthday
congratulations keep up the good work
alright thank you hey Thank You Alfred I
think we'll hear one or more after lunch
microsoft research next up we have
Sandro that's already turned on so
Alessandro foreign is a principal
researcher at Microsoft Research he's
actually been very busy this past week
at tech fest I know his voice is a
little hoarse Vizsla those you have tech
fest will understand that so thanks for
joining us and row Sandro joined MSR in
1994 from Carnegie Mellon where he was a
research scientist working on my project
Thank You Vic I wasn't really sure what
this special trick was I thought maybe
was it kind of a roasting the price
precedent kind of thing so I started
with a list and I realized that maybe
that's not what we want to do but there
are wanted to make sure the first time I
met him it was an embarrassing encounter
for me at least in those days we used to
active print code and there was a
printing room in which you go they wear
laser printers already stranger enough
you go if we pick up your call and look
at it and find your bags and print it
again and so I go and fetch my coat and
civic looking at it oh my god it was it
was one of the three gods of operating
systems it was Rick a keratin and was
his name is pride guy oosterhout and so
one of them was working in my code oops
lucky enough he didn't dislike it
I guess since then we actually went to
work together I could it was a while
since i saw a color Rick's code and it
was it was a difficult task was doing
the time he was actually working on the
IBM PC was trying to get X 11 to work
and that was a double jeopardy first
because the vga interface was well you
all know what it is it was worse than
and second because he was using a
compiler that today we all think is a
good compiler GCC back then it was the
first time ever that it was used for
something that it wasn't competition to
a better compiler it was in fact the
only unit compiler work on the pc and
let's just say that he was fighting
through different problems at the same
time another another another the first
work meet i think that we had together i
was at the time like they sure are
looking there's this serve two masters i
was working for busy on you're about to
be Gianni and I met we went to Rick's
office trying to convince him to get one
of those IP is the Satya rightly said
the shin being in the open system
inflicted on wanting a brain system and
that was the yield API so if you follow
the story that's something that didn't
go away quite as easily as that meet
suggested needless to say that Rick
didn't one of that and so the the fing
didn't work very well the there was
another meeting later on with with eric
cooper at the time and Eric Eric was the
author of the secret library something
they built on this yield idea meaning
have a user mode context switching back
and forth easily and bright more
efficient share memory based parallel
applications Eric
didn't didn't have a way to handle
signals basically or exceptions and I
was doing something in parallel was
trying to build the ellipse Eli by based
on message passing and that was maybe
the idea in which we would bring up in a
programming environment on top of a pure
kernel which is what we were trying to
build with Mac with what became Mac 30
in the meeting was also a V and needless
to say I with you like signals at all so
the idea of having anything even
remotely related to signals was not in
the meeting so Eric was ripe this out of
meeting he didn't get to talk of
anything that he wanted to talk when we
talk instead was this funky idea that
both of them came up with it was why
don't you when you take an exception why
didn't you send us a signal him a
message somewhere and use that to build
the multiple personalities that Satya
talked about so that really was to me
that was that there was meeting with the
idea of Mexico was born how exactly
would you go about heavy compatibility
between multiple environments and you
will you would be based on low-level
mechanism traps sixes and call etc but
they would become micro kernels you want
to call it you didn't call it micro
kernel or somebody else we went to the
world microkernel and had multiple
programming environment if you call burn
call coexist the outcome of that work
was a presentation that we'd made a Rick
make a UNIX and I was in the back of the
room when he was showing the system
first to get the talk blah blah blah
blah blah be buddy was asleep and then
and then he made the demo and people
started to wake up first because his
nick is using unix and there was a you
know kind of well let's say not acrimony
but competition between berkeley say and
in unix NN and CMU so they weren't quite
convinced a unix that we could do what
we were talking about
or they would be anywhere close to
functional or or even remotely fast by
any definition so when we brought he
build up your Nixon show a little demo
there everybody was a would actually
works and it was a guy knickknacks me
said wow that's impressive but hey if
they brought up the mac OS then I would
be impressed guess what was the next day
moved up and that was that was pretty
much a thing what led to to the big
success the audience there I was in the
back so I saw everybody was jumping up
and down and say whoo but we didn't stop
there and so there was also a funny
aspect to the mac days and enlarged
mulund remember up so he had the idea of
getting getting das to work on top of
mark and I believe that was a very
important event for DARPA because the
first time they ever paid for games in
their budget I don't know if it was a
consequence of that that seemed you got
an audit and Alfred had to pick up an
accent system that be frozen and power
back up to show that it was alive and
that was the money the DARPA given us
the so on my honor on a different aspect
i forgot to see Rick can cook so where's
the time the first time they came over
here and Washington I went to his house
and was here I remember he was jumping
all up and down secures the same age as
my daughter so I had a great time that
night and i miss my dog very much but so
that was also the first time that i ate
mac and cheese and being Italian that
was there was a big thing to swallow as
for the quality let's say I never had
mac and cheese arrogant
nonetheless i hope that shed light on
some aspects of Eric's personality fix
every birthday Jonathan engineer Oracle
currently figure you my own mech is off
sorry about that so I'd like to
introduce Jonathan shoe now John is an
engineer at Oracle currently previously
he was with sun microsystems but back in
the old days John worked as a staff
programmer at CMU on the mock project
and so we'll get to hear his thoughts on
that thanks rich so my name is Jonathan
chew and i worked from for rich or a
rick a long time ago but i'm going to
talk about how i came to work for mocks
fearless leader so just a little bit
about me i worked on mock with her for
rick from 1986 to about 1991 and before
that I'd gone to Berkeley I didn't know
what to study until I stumble across CS
as a prerequisite for business and never
imagined that I would you know where I
would end up working and so my first job
out of college was it perk systems or
three rivers computer and I I ended up
going to pittsburgh because my OS
professor was John osterhout and and I i
really loved my operating systems class
i thought it was one of the best
teachers i ever had and he had gone to
CMU so i asked his advice about going to
pittsburgh my other job choice was to
work for GT sprint doing cobol
programming
and I grew up in you know near berkeley
i grew up in oakland and so it was a
little scary to go to Pittsburgh because
the furthest I'd been it you know
outside of California was Nevada but
anyway my first job was at perk and I
got to work on the accent operating
system which was the predecessor to mock
and then perk eventually went out of
business but I had a great time there
because it was at Berkeley we basically
had terminals and shared vaxors and PDP
Elevens with hundreds of other students
and a perk I got to use a real work
station or the mouse and windows and
everything like that and and I'd only
seen you know like screenshots of those
things before so it was a lot of fun but
anyway eventually perk went out of
business and but a lot of the people at
perk had cut either you know worked or
come from CMU and so they had
connections and basically I got to go
work at the cs department and i started
doing speech recognition to start with
and once i got to CMU I just thought was
a the greatest place me knows it was so
much fun it was just amazing everything
from you know one-legged hop hopping
robots to autonomous land vehicles
everything was just amazing so I don't
know if most of the people know here but
rocky and bullwinkle were our unofficial
mascots for mock and we named some of
our machines after the characters from
the show and I was thinking about how
how would I go about you know describing
Rick you know what do I think of when I
think of Rick and it's it turns out I
think of some of the characters from the
show and and I I decided that I wanted
to you know maybe use that as a way to
you know tell you what what what I think
about work and how I feel about it so i
wasn't sure all of you would know what
rocky and bullwinkle are because you
know it's a show from the arid on you
know network television in the u.s. from
the 60s to early 70s
but so I thought I'd better have
pictures that's why I did slides hey
anyway so that's that's Bullwinkle J
moose and rocket J or rocky J squirrel
and then the these are a few other
characters which were basically Boris
badenov Natasha fatale and the fearless
leader and boris and Natasha were you
know basically rocky and bullwinkle's
adversaries and and then fearless leader
was their boss and I didn't I I was very
disappointed when Bob Baron told me it's
like you can't be the fearless leader
he's that's a bad guy but okay so I i
did did some research and you know
Wikipedia at least explain some of this
to me so I could try to figure out it
doesn't make sense or not right so
fearless leader it was a dictator of
pottsylvania and yeah basically and
knock at OG is the boss for the the bad
guys right but this coincidentally we
were in Pennsylvania which to me sounds
pretty similar to pottsylvania and then
well but then Rick was really was our
fearless leader right he stuck up for
our project and us and then you know I
just figured I don't know how it
happened but you know he must have been
a really good salesman because basically
the cs department and a basic our
facilities group you know even though
the name sounds like it might be the
janitorial crew or something like that
was actually are our group that
basically provided the computing
environment and the infrastructure for
the department the department and
basically the facility group basically
you know agreed to basically have mock
run on armed systems and i thought that
was great because you know for for us we
started out with you know bsd and
basically we start changing out
subsystems from within it to be you know
ours so you know the IPC was in there
first and then they worked on the
virtual memory system and obvi did tasks
and threads in the summer
and you know there's just but the
greatest thing is that you know we were
switching out all these things out from
underneath everybody and with without
having having to know which which was
really great and then nothing tues I I
just figure great you know that Rick
must be a great spokesperson because we
had so many visitors and you know got to
work with you know all these interesting
people and companies you know every you
know I met Bill Gates I got to meet
Steve Jobs you know all these different
companies came to work with us and it
was a fun time so anyway mmm so maybe
you guys can help me figure out you know
which character isn't most like so the
next character was mr. big and you can
sort of see him there he's a the little
guy who's being you know there's a
flashlight on who can see his shadow so
you can see his silhouette so you can't
you can't really tell whether that's
Rick or not and as far as I know Rick
doesn't wear hats so mr. big is the boss
of the fearless leader and Rick was
definitely are mr. big four mok what
everybody who worked on moc work for
Rick right yeah I listed some of the
guys just and you know I I probably miss
some people too because I think Sandra
mentioned Rob but I just want to at
least get get some of the names down
there because you know we had a lot of
really good people to work with who were
really smart and really nice but you
could argue that the head of the cs
department or Howard rockler who is our
Vice Provost of research computing maybe
they were mr. big right so anyway you
couldn't tell from that little picture
before what mr. big looks like so I you
know googled for images of mr. big and
this is my god but anyway Rick looks
more like this mr. big then Howard does
or you know or the head of the
department did at the time then the last
character that you know sort of reminds
me of rick is mr. peabody and he's the
he's a and well this is a picture mr.
Peabody and his boy Sherman who was a
young enthusiastic you know naive boy
who basically followed mr. Peabody going
through their way back machine for time
travel and so anyway mr. Peabody well
anyway so Rick Rick Rick is a genius he
wears glasses and he and he definitely
had students were bright and young and
naive and enthusiastic like Sherman and
he even had staff people who are like
that because because I was a staff
person working for me and then but
anyway so so the interesting thing is he
didn't have a time machine but but we
had this thing with Rick that we called
ration time and from what I remember I I
believe where it came from is we were in
a bunch of us were in Rick's office one
day and we're talking about some
technical tasks it had to be done right
and so Rick gave us an estimate you know
this oh it's easy guys is sort of like
you know what Alfred said is you know
Rick is is is very optimistic but the
other thing too is he's very fast I mean
he talks fast he walks fast everything
goes fast right I mean he could be very
patient and slow down and talked to you
but but mostly you know he moved quickly
and so anyway his estimate for for this
you know how long this thing would take
was I forget one week or something and I
think Mike young at the time said oh but
that's ration time it's like to
translate that to you know you know
normal time for human beings is is you
know you basically you know double it
and then go up to the next unit of time
so one week in Rick's you know might be
something that Rick could do but for us
normal humans that would be you know you
know two months or something right so
anyway that that's you know at least
where i could see there's some time
distortion you know almost like a time
machine so just to conclude so mr. big
and fierce leader were
bad guys and you know Rick Rick is a
good guy right so yeah so I'm not sure
about them but I know at least in the at
least a name he's like that and he
definitely was our mr. big and our
fearless leader and then maybe he was
most like you know mr. Peabody but
anyway the bottom line is I consider
Rick to be you know a great leader a
teacher and a friend to me let me use
very nice he's very smart he was
productive effective fast all those
things and always very calm and patient
with us so anyway I always think of
ration time whenever I think that
something is hard or will take a long
time just to balance my perspective to
be maybe more a little more realistic
anyway thank you and Lady birthday Rick
alright thanks John that was great
listening to you and talk about ration
time reminds me of another related
factor which is the ration reality
distortion field which I'm sure some of
you have heard of before and so that was
a related concept that would you know
play out in Rick's office things would
appear different somehow in Rick's
office or work better in Rick's office
so now we've got bill belofsky so bill
very recently moved to a new job at
Microsoft he's now technical assistant
to the president of Microsoft server and
tools business but bill previously was a
principal researcher MSR having started
in 1992 so one of the old-timers bill
was a staff programmer on the mock
project as an undergrad at CMU and after
after which she went on to the
university of rochester for his PhD
which is where Rick of course did his
PhD so you have your mic on bill I'm
scrubbing you when he's okay and you're
using pc for
it should be beginning there it goes all
right bill
now you have to turn on the power switch
yes well I've come for hardware so I'm
going to talk about the tiger project
which is something that happened a good
bit later in Rick's career than
everything we've been hearing from from
CMU but before I do that I'm going to
add some personal reminiscences so rick
has had more to do with my career in
getting me to where I am than anybody
with a possible exception of my father I
was an undergrad at CMU and roundabouts
December of 1985 I went in to figure out
what my schedule should be for my last
semester as an undergrad and you know
when I thought okay is my last semester
I should make sure that i actually get
all the set of classes that it takes to
graduate so I went and talked to my
academic advisor and we determined that
it was the empty set and so I I was left
with a choice of taking a bunch of
electives are trying to find a job and
so I went and knocked on Rick's door and
told him this story and he was
sufficiently intrigued that he thought
well I'll take a chance on this guy and
hiren because who comes up with a story
like that then I usually find out that
you don't have enough credits to
graduate when you think you did instead
of graduating by accident so so he hired
me and he started me working on moc we
didn't have a real formal interview
process there and so he neglected to ask
me questions like do you know see answer
no oh you know have you ever written
kernel-mode code for anything no but so
I started off I bought a copy of
kernighan and Richie and learned how to
program in c and started started working
on mock and so he gave me the IBM RTP
see it said port mock to run on this
it's a portable operating system it
shouldn't be shouldn't be hard so
probably most of you aren't familiar
with the RT but
so the time mach ran on the backs there
is almost no 32 bit machine that's more
unlike the vax than an RT their axes
little-endian the RT is big endian the
the vax has what everybody I think it
was a normal page table the RT had this
bizarre inverted page table thing that
was a weird hash table that had the
beautiful property that if you got it
wrong it didn't the Machine didn't tell
you what happened it just displayed 88
and the little little numeric thing and
then you had to pull the power plug out
together start again so it was exciting
then I went ahead and and ported ported
mock to the machine and I had a bug that
was due to it was due to the virtual
memory system working working
differently and the bug took a while to
find and you know mock didn't work right
on the machines well this bug was going
on I eventually I found the bug and you
know Rick came into my office and asked
me what what the bug was and whether I
had found it or somebody else and I told
him well I explained the bug and told
him that I had found it and then the
switch clicked and he decided that I was
ok and that that's probably the most
important bug I've ever found in my life
so time goes on I go off to grad school
at Rochester which is not entirely
coincidental that that's where Rick went
and I'm getting towards the end up doing
my PhD and I'm on a plane go on a trip
to do some random thing and I happened
to be on a plane from Pittsburgh to
seattle in the summer of nineteen ninety
one and sitting in first class is Rick
now it didn't occur to me that Rick
would never pay for first ticket on his
own that something must be up I just
thought okay he's going to UW to give a
talk or something so this is a picture
of the two of us from that from seatac
from july or august of 1991 of course
what Rick was doing was coming out here
to interview for a job but you know I
didn't know that mostly note that both
of us had much better hair them and we
do now
although mine was a little Messier so
shortly after that I I decided to you
know there was a time to graduate and I
should go to find a job so I printed up
my CV and mailed it out to a bunch of
places including mailing it to Rick at
MSR and you know I didn't really hear
anything back and then I get some email
from Rick that says well would you like
to come and work at this new research
lab which you know then was 15 or 20
people I said well yeah that's why I
sent you my c/v and he said well I never
saw that it got you know picked off
before it got to me here's a here's a
fax number affects your fax your CV to
that so I did that I came out and I
interviewed and then I went back home to
Rochester when I got home I found an
envelope waiting for me for Microsoft
that said we see no interest match with
you thanks for a pie so once again it's
only because of Ric that I got this job
and by the way the thing was dated
before the time of my interview was
clearly responds to the mailed in some
someone found it anyway on to the actual
topic that I wanted to talk about this
is a joke that several of you will think
is very funny and nobody else will get
so but Rick will probably read it so in
early nineteen ninety-three we're all at
lunch and Rick data to me and Bob
Fitzgerald and Joe and you know
everybody and and Rick says to us what
would it take to build a video server
out of PCs and you know we didn't really
know so we started thinking about the
problem and you have to understand the
context of the time the machines we were
working with were 60 megahertz you know
486 Azure the branded first Pentiums
that came out they had a few megabytes
of memory and we thought that a 10
megabit a second ethernet was a pretty
good pretty good network and I remember
getting two gigabyte disk drives and
being in heaven okay so so these were
very uncapable machines and and so the
question was how can you take video and
to get decent TV quality video requires
a certain amount of bandwidth regardless
of all good your machine is because you
know people's visual systems are what
they are and it requires a couple
megabits a second at least to do that
and so we SAT around and thought about
the problem and by we I mean mostly
this gerald and he came up with a
solution so that the issue that you get
is you could take a computer and it
could source some number of video
streams but the the curve of popularity
of videos you look at movies it's the
sort of zip vian curve that just has a
love a lot of weight in the front but
then a very long tail so the problem
with this is if you if you would take a
movie and you put on a machine you'd
have one popular movie and you've run
out of bandwidth on that machine all the
rest of the machines would would sit
idle because you need a certain amount
of capacity and remember two gigabyte
disk drives doesn't store a whole lot of
movies so the brilliant idea that fits
had was well let's take the movies cut
them up into small chunks say a second
and stripe them across a whole set of
machines so now you can well that's I
just knew that was going to happen so no
I do not want to reboot you know I gave
a talk at CMU one time at PowerPoint
crashed in the middle of my ties the
only time I've ever seen it crash it
just so this anyway so we get the
brilliant idea the pits got the
brilliant idea of striping across a
bunch of machines so that you can you
can divorce the bandwidth from of the
qigong machine from the storage and I'm
not going to go into the technical
details but it worked really well we
were to take able to take these very
bleeding edge very low capacity things
and network components we bought from
from for systems that really barely work
honestly they did work at build a video
server that did things like playing this
natalie merchant video that you see this
was the one piece of test content that
we had its 10,000 maniacs and we
listened to this thing over and over and
over again so I well anyway so we said
we built this this video server and we
started doing demos and we showed it to
people and one of the demos that he
remembers when Bill Gates came in to see
it and it looked it was nice sort of
high quality full screen video which we
which we got on the clients by having a
piece of hardware that did the MPEG
decodes the machines were too slow to do
that and the thing I really remember is
that bill looked at that and said wow I
had no idea that computers could do
that look like that so this gives you
some concept of how far out in front we
were great Bill Gates had never this the
first time Bill Gates ever saw full
screen video was in our lab so we put
this thing together and we did a we did
a road show for it we did it a big
rollout thing in downtown seattle and we
had some we had some a lot of press that
came from that you can see glasses were
all so different then than they are now
but we were able to put this up in
display and display you know dozens and
dozens of TVs running off of these these
really cheap PCs and we got a lot more
actually more press came out of this I
think than any project that I that I've
worked on it was really fun and I get to
play with a flying PowerPoint stuff to
show you all all the press that we had
but the end the end of the I'm running
out of time so I'm going to wrap this up
but what we as i told you it goes on and
on what we got out of this project was
the ability to serve high quality video
to people in you know 1996 or 1997 and
Microsoft turned this into a product no
one bought the product we released the
version blew up the group and decided
that video and computers was was not
going to work and the reason that this
happened actually is because the network
there was not enough network bandwidth
to get the video out to where it was
going we had you know we had solved the
server problem and if you think about it
giving up on video in 1998 which was one
which is only did that was just a
horrible decision if you think about
what Netflix the streaming half of
Netflix does or YouTube we could have
owned those businesses if we hit stuck
with this if we'd been willing to to
ride out waiting for the network to get
better because we knew it was going to
get better but you know how but we knew
it was going to happen and MSR put us
way ahead largely because of Ric and
it's a shame that we didn't that we
didn't stick with it but at least we can
feel good about ourselves for having
been there first anyway Rick thank you
very much thanks again for my career I
really literally would not be here
without you
alright thanks Bill so now we're going
to take a short break and will resume in
about 20 minutes at ten minutes to
eleven so we'll start back at ten
minutes to eleven thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
