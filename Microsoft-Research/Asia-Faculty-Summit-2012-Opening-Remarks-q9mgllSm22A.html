title the chief Research Officer you
know that we kind of made that one up we
decided we were going to be shifting
around our titles I've always run
microsoft research so I came to
Microsoft 21 years ago and so I've had
the same job the entire time they just
keep changing my title but what that
means so I'm the Microsoft executive
who's been doing the same job for the
longest time right which either means
that I'm really good at what I do or I
don't know how to do anything else so
you can decide which one of those is you
know Lola mentioned that I came out of a
university I came out of Carnegie Mellon
University and when I came to Microsoft
you know my goal was to build an
academic style basic research
organization in the context of a company
in this case in the context of Microsoft
and I knew for the very beginning that
we would not be successful unless we had
very strong relationships with the
academic community and and work closely
with the academic community very early
in the history of Microsoft Research we
began to create the fellowship programs
that Lola mentioned we created our
internship programs and today Microsoft
runs the largest PhD internship program
in the world we have over a thousand PhD
interns working at Microsoft during
during any given year and that's just a
tremendous asset to us but it's also a
way for us to to communicate back to you
to communicate back to the academic
community because those students come
back and forth and they share ideas and
they take ideas back with them and they
act as kind of a glue in the process I
remember now forgetting exactly which
year but pretty early on in the history
of Microsoft Research we decided to
start a great a faculty summit event in
the United States and I remember being
very nervous as to whether we would get
anybody to show
I think the first year we had about 80
faculty and it was a great event it I
think it it beat everybody's
expectations and then that event grew it
became you know something like three or
four hundred people and today it's
really capped by the size of the
auditorium that we use each year and we
learned a lot from that event we learned
in particular that that there was
enormous amounts of value in getting
faculty members together from from
different universities from from
different parts of the of the field and
from related fields in computer science
and giving them a chance to really talk
together and interact together and talk
with us and interact with us it was
extremely valuable for everybody
concerned and so we've over the years
replicated that model the Asian faculty
summit being being a good example of
that today we run faculty summit events
in Asia in the United States in Latin
America in India and in Europe so we
pretty much covered the world and and
these events have grown to become very
important you know for the institutions
that are part of it so I really want to
thank you for being here I think this
should be a great event the agenda look
really really a lot of like a lot of fun
and and I also want to thank you for the
for the relationships that you have with
microsoft research and the friendship
that you've shown us as an organization
over the years thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
