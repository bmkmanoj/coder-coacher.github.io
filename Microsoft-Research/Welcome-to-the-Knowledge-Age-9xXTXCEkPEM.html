hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
all right so let's see here it wasn't
too long ago that every device that we
owned was plugged into a wall and
whenever we wanted to do something
whenever we had some intent that
required a computers help we had to go
to the computer to get that help well of
course that's not the case anymore we've
got computers in our pockets we've got
computers in fact literally I have one
in my pocket I have this little thing
called a Fitbit
all right Trax my running so now instead
of okay I thought my intent is I want to
get I want to become a runner in the
past I would have to go to my computer
sit down and break that into little
tasks let's see I'm gonna need some
shoes and I'm gonna need some gear
because I'm from Seattle and you can't
run unless you got the right gear have a
neat decent gear and then I have to find
some trails or something to run on pass
to run so I don't get bored and then
maybe when I get a little bit better
I'll sign up for a 5k and then when I
get even better I might do a half
marathon etc etc etc and then of course
six months later I'm gonna need new
shoes I need right I'm gonna need all
this stuff now the way it works really
is that if you buy shoes running shoes
for the next six weeks you're gonna get
ads for running shoes running shoes
running shoes running shoes you want
running to you don't you what I just
bought the running shoes so it's
different now because now our intense
are things that occur within our devices
right my phones there when I decide to
do something I don't have to go anywhere
and now these little machines can track
me they know when I'm ready for a 5k and
knows when I'm ready for a half marathon
and it bitches at me when I'm lazy it
has not been happy with
this whole UK visit at all apparently
that black stuff you serve for breakfast
what is it called
black pudding it's a wonderful cure for
hangover it really my little Fitbit
don't know what that stuff's made up but
this does not like it I don't want to
know okay man tell you why it's secure
for real ale that's for sure
so so we have these devices now they
they are with us and they can last
through these intents and we have these
apps there with us now the apps are apps
I'm not so sure I like apps I was with a
friend and went to the movies the other
day I'm with a friend she's sitting
sitting there she's she pulls out her
phone and she's looking at her phone I'm
thinking yeah pretty good movie you know
what do you look at your phone for you
something better to do
better company then she starts counting
down she's like oh oh 30 seconds and
clueless right and this is counted five
four three two one be right back and she
takes off right until the movie and so
I'm watching couple minutes later she
comes back and sits down now ordinarily
when somebody does that what's the first
thing they say what did I miss
right she didn't say anything she just
sat there and started watching again and
I said proactively you didn't miss
anything
she said I know she has an app that
tells her when she could pee at the
movies
right it even has like it has the the
biggest section somebody's curated all
this they've watched the movies they've
gone through that's boring boring boring
and the the biggest gap they call the
prostate gap right I mean they got all
this stuff figured out I don't have that
app why is it that why is it that these
services are things that I still have to
go after all right I'm still going to my
devices and saying I need help with this
and I'm still going thinking I need that
but I don't have it and now I've got to
install it I've got to do all this stuff
alright we've been snookered by this
whole web thing we are slaves to it oh I
need to know something go to lab I need
to know something go to the app Oh apps
are better not really you still got to
go search for them you got to discover
them I didn't know I'm still peeing all
by myself in the movie I didn't have
that app we can do better we can do
better we can do better because you know
what and this is very much I tried to
make it random I tried to pick an
ecosystem that didn't begin with the
letter A that's what I did and that's
what I could come up with we've been
searching the web for a decade and a
half and when you search the web for a
decade and a half you find a bunch you
just do that's the nature of being good
at search you find stuff right and when
you find stuff you change your behavior
you lose your car keys
all right you lose them once it's a
search problem you lose them spice maybe
it's a search by time you've lost them
for the 11th time it's no longer a
search problem it's a yeah I tend to
leave them there they're their problem
and it's different right you lose your
dog and you change the way you behave
right your dog runs off at the park next
time you go to the park to keep him on
the leash are you don't want to search
for the dog anymore so we found a bunch
of stuff not only have we found a bunch
of stuff we keep finding stuff right we
have all these speeds we have
entertainment these right now there's
data centers on behalf of Google
on behalf of being just ingesting all
this stuff right we we know who Brad
Pitt's sleeping with now we know right
everything that's happening we just know
it entertainment feeds sports feeds news
feeds all these feeds just constantly
being sucked into these data centers and
some of the best machine learning on the
planet is happening on these feeds
there's people curating this stuff by
hand to make it even better right we
know things now the stuff we found these
are entities we know who Brad Pitt is we
know who will I am is we know who James
Whittaker is these are things we found
right these are entities we know about
them we know about sports figures we
know about politicians we know about
royalty what you all know about Roy is
that we have no clue about royalties
guys Memphis mornings at Royal Bank of
Scotland like what made your bank so
damn special right what about all the
other Scottish banks like with the plebe
Bank of Scotland I don't know right we
know these things we know these things
it's stuff that we know and we know how
it's connected right we know every
actress that Brad Pitt starred with we
know every director he worked under
right we know these how these things are
connected we know all these pieces we
know answers we don't have to guess
anymore I mean go to a website and you
count how many goals pelé scored in 1970
or ask an answer index that has it all
right there's no searching it's just an
answer who are the members of Coldplay
ask it it'll give them to you what's the
name in the band the drummer in Neil
Young's band it's an answer we know it
we found it someone else has asked that
question before and we remembered it
we're creating search problems we're
search problems don't really exist we're
telling people to go to the web for
answers simply because they're used and
they're doing it because they're used to
going to the web for answers right
there's more that we can do here
we have personal data by the way we can
make this experience better for you
based on the things we know about you
and oh do we know some stuff about you
now I know this whole personal data
thing seems a little scary and it should
right because you're going to websites
and there's these exchanges like hey man
that guy's logged in will pay more for
the fur tell us something about him well
will what will we do we will oh we'll
give him news that's more you know like
there no you won't you give us ads won't
you are you just going to try to sell us
stuff that's why you're paying for it
but but I don't think it's right there
there's a there's a better way to do
this right there's there's NSA creepy
and then there's Santa Claus creepy
right I mean they're both creepy let's
face it I mean this guy's watching you
when you sleeping it doesn't get any
creepier than that but with Santa worst
case lump of coal that's not so bad
right free stuff lump of coal alright I
can I can handle that
alright I think we can continue to nudge
the industry toward the the Santa Claus
piece of this as well and then of course
just curated content and of course we
can watch all this stuff happening in
real time and and and try to get better
with it so this is the world that we
live in now we live in the world of
these always on carry along devices that
know what you're doing they understand
your context they know where you are
right now they know what you're trying
to do they understand your goals we have
these services that sit in the cloud and
just spit stuff out hey I've got I know
how to do this I know there's another
service and those how to do this and we
have at least two indices of the world's
information and our disposal googles and
things what can we do with this it's
better than the way we're doing it now
can we get to the point where we're not
telling people oh you want to know
something browser web that's what you
need or if we're better at monetizing
apps oh you want to know something
there's an app store find the app
install it you're gonna love it
right there's got to be another way this
is 2013 and I'm still going to the
to figure stuff out that has already
been figured out my browser doesn't
often remember what I figured out two
days ago so how can we do this it's a
little bit better
so first thing I want this whole
internet of things I don't care if my
toaster isn't ready for me in the
morning
I really even the coffeepot I'm fine
flicking it on and fumbling about if my
temperature and my thermometer in my
house doesn't reset itself when I walk
out I got more pressing things to worry
about here's what I'd like I like my
damn phone in my damn tablet and the PC
that I've got on my desk and my
television to just get along that's what
I'd like I'd like an Internet of my
things I'd like my TV to say hey man
James shows coming on you know the one
he likes phone where's James I know
you're together and tell me these little
things right I get a I get a bill on my
phone you know whoever sent somebody
sends me a bill I'm not gonna pay the
bill on the phone you know squeeze and
make it bigger how much is it Oh 200 200
I want to see the invoice oh I'm not
gonna do that I want my phone did you
say you know what I'm not good at this
get your tablets good at this so flick
over to the tablet right I want my phone
to know what it's good at I want my
tablet to know what it's good at I want
my desktop to know what it's good at I
want my TV to know what it's good at and
I want them to just work together right
when my phone wakes me up in the morning
I set my alarm my phone wakes up I want
it just to be joyous
James is awake James is awake tablet get
his knees ready get his news ready TV
that show then he wants to watch are you
ready let's get let's let's take this
guy's context and let's figure out what
he needs to make
is life easy don't make him go out for
don't make him figure it out
don't make him find the news app it's
every damn morning
it's Flipboard it's The Economist it's
the same thing be ready for me I want an
Internet of my things that's my first
wish so there's my things there's me in
the middle I want it to work properly so
scenarios like hey Game of Thrones is
coming on do you all watch this this is
so good when I first saw Lord of the
Rings I thought that's it pinnacle of
all graphics on television Lord Lord of
the Rings gets blown away by this show
it's exquisite I don't want to miss a
single episode I want to watch it live
and if I forget I want my TV telling my
phone about it and then when I'm there
that's my context I'm watching Game of
Thrones my tablet should figure it out
hey he's watching him Thrones because TV
just told me he's watching Game of
Thrones there's the second screen
experience for Game of Thrones I'm gonna
find it and it's gonna be ready for him
and my phone might say you know what he
may want to buy one of those books or he
may want to look at pictures of the
actors and the actresses that are there
he may want to read their wikipedia page
he may want to read the gossip columns
about I'm just gonna be there right it's
just gonna be ready for James I want to
be the center of the universe of my
devices that's what I want and I want
the services to be part of this - I want
my services to get along and understand
hey this guy's got context if I'm on the
phone with my mom is this kind of I was
gonna say when I'm talking to my mom but
it doesn't really work that way we have
like a 10,000 to forward ratio between
us
she's like oh it was so good catching up
with you know only one of us got caught
up and wasn't you Rhett's but if I'm
walking say I'm getting my car it's
illegal to talk on the phone in Seattle
in your car and so I wanted to figure it
out all right my car's got a Sat Nav
it's got a screen come on guys
you know I'm gonna do it every single
time I do it do it for me take the call
drive home talking to my mom well again
listening to my mom the whole way home
and then I get out of the car back to
the phone it's real simple and then I
walk into the house and my xbox wakes up
and says I can take that Skype call in
1080p baby and I can connect you with
your brother connect me with my sister
something she can make her shot ah I
love my mom listening to her not so much
so the device is working together the
devices and the service is collaborating
to make the experience is more magical
and then finally I don't want to have to
run after all day all the time
I don't want to say you know what I want
to get fit
okay there's shoes and then there's this
and then there's that is it and there's
this and there's that I don't want to
have to do all that that's what I did
last decade I've been chasing my devices
around I've been chasing those webpages
around been chasing all those apps
around I'm sick of it I'm absolutely
sick of it how about you take all that
stuff and bring it to me
I don't care where I am you figure it
out because I spend a lot of time in
certain apps apps I call super apps
there are apps that I look at on a
regular basis email calendar social
networks things like that and when I'm
looking at those apps intent occurs
somebody sends me an email James go
let's go bar-hopping in Cambridge go
ahead 70 that email
let's go bar-hopping in Cambridge
there's a bunch of great pubs in
Cambridge
to drink that ah now I've got to work
don't I I've got to go out and figure
out all those bars I don't want to do
that why is it that I why what makes my
email clients so damn dumb that it
doesn't know about the web Hey the web's
been around for a long time my email
clients like really and it never said hi
it didn't here's an actual email I got
from my daughter the funny thing is
that's not actually my daughter right
there and that's not actually my
daughter's name
Microsoft legal said it was a really bad
idea
and when a lawyer tells you it's a
really bad idea generally good to listen
to use her name but it got me in trouble
he says working on this deck and she she
leans over and kisses me on the cheek
and she looks and she said dad who's
Jennifer Whitaker
and if she gives me one of these do you
have something to tell us
sorry maybe it's not a good idea to
listen to lawyers but she sends me this
email right and she said dad this bans
coming to town of Monsters and Men she's
a teenage girl right I'm in my forty's
she basic and so that's kind of cool
right my teenager wants to hang out with
me she wants go listen to some music
she's a teenager I mean what's the
probability of her having decent taste
in music I'm thinking it's pretty smut
yeah just one of those damn boy bands
right somebody named Justin I don't want
to hear that I can't stand it right I
couldn't go to a Justin Bieber concert
of Jessica Alba sat next to me during it
and then Paramount Theater I don't know
Seattle right ever since we legalized
marijuana they turn on the red lights on
what is it about those two things I
thought it just made you hungry there
are places in downtown Seattle I ain't
goin with my teenage daughter no I got
work to do don't I I got to figure out
this band somethin I can tolerate so
what's that off to the web YouTube made
iTunes let some of those music maybe buy
a little bit listen I got work to do
I don't want have to do this work I've
gotta I gotta figure out where the
Paramount Theater is whether it's in one
of those places and I've got to figure
out parking she's a teenager she's gonna
want to eat right this is a lot of work
that I have to do here walking all over
the place I don't want to do it so it
turns out that that band and that venue
in maps to park those are things that
have been found
let's stop searching for the stuff that
we found so I click on this little
button down here savino's click on it
and being says yeah sure enough I know
something about this remember what spell
check and grammar check first came out
and it just underlined the word for you
didn't do it he didn't it didn't you
know it's not your
face he's just like hey man you're an
idiot and I can help and in it can help
alright so we click on monsters of the
band and any monsters and then what kind
of dumbass name with a band is that I'm
from Seattle we name our bands are vana
and Pearl Jam right cool stuff of
monsters in man sounds like a book I had
read in high school but it turns out
this band is from Iceland I mean that's
kind of cool who the hell is from
Iceland I mean I know I'm a GL I am an
american kind of geography challenge but
seriously i thought the only elves live
there right la Florian's the capital
Rivendell is No
all right so I'm thinking Iceland
probably no Justin's there then I read
here that they that this is the stuff I
would have found out on the web right
the stuff we know why is it that
browsers have a monopoly on the
knowledge that's on the web why because
we've allowed it and so here it is it's
all there
I can even listen to their music listen
to this woman's voice there's even a guy
singing with her who can't sing and it
still sounds good
and I listen to this and in this this
pride just washes over me my teenage
daughter that's gonna taste in music can
you believe this and I go through it you
all know about this band this band ever
comes anywhere near you go see them they
want a thousand fan competition called
the European battle they are stunning
and my daughter wants to take me to them
well technically she wants to pay for it
all but come on who's counting so now I
want to go see this now I've got to
worry about the venue is Paramount
Theatre in one of those places so here
is everything that being is found about
Paramount Theater and its magazine
quality right you page to it you don't
click through it
it's Flipboard type stuff here right
it's a beautiful interface I can buy
tickets I can look at what's plain I
could do everything from here the
weather let me do all this stuff
now my email clients gonna let me do all
this stuff and any other super app I
spend a lot of time in is gonna let me
do all this stuff so I buy the tickets I
take my daughter and by the way this all
goes to your calendar I don't know if
you the rest of the world just like
Microsoft or not but Microsoft people
tell go where their calendar is alright
if my top calendar tells me to go
somewhere I am gonna go there my talent
er doesn't tell me to be there I'm not
gonna be there and so it all gets copied
to your calendar you get to check
traffic you get to confirm your dinner
dinner reservation you get a map you
know where you're gonna park
everything's right there
right so here's an intent that started
an email and ordinarily would have gone
to the web or gone to the App Store and
then back to email to reply to my
daughter and say yes we can go it stayed
an email the whole time right this is an
idea of a super app intent occurs and
intent is resolved in place and we did
go to this concert there's a picture of
me and my real daughter with our tickets
there's a picture of us standing outside
the Paramount Theater waiting a buster's
of men is the first one and there's a
picture of the band so so this is that
that angel somehow Janis Joplin and
Chrissie Hynde vocal cords have been
merged into this wonderful human being
and there is actually a real live elf
right there that is called a trumpet
what a woeful instrument then this
trumpet is like a thousand-year-old
instrument or something like that right
people have been blowing woeful awful
sounds through that the trumpet was
invented for her only for her she should
be the only person allowed to play it
because when she plays it amazing things
happen
this band is just stunning okay I want
to drive this point home a little bit
more meet users where they are where
intent occurs this is my friend Adam
Sheldon's calendar I took all the other
stuff off his girlfriend wife I don't
know what she is this is what she does
to him all of a sudden something pops on
his calendar
it basically says you're taking me out
right that's it where you're taking me
out and now he has to figure it out Oh
I got to go off I got a you know
research restaurants I got a what can I
do to do theirs off to the web off to
the App Store just like we've trained
users for a decade to do go off and do
it not anymore
so now Adam knows as she likes live
music so he wrote an outlook plug-in to
find live music it's playing now
right so he lives in San Francisco and
this is the interface here's everything
is playing tonight or on that night
right that night during the time that
his wife said he she wants to go out and
there's maps to it now his wife also
often invites other people so there's
other people involved in this as well
and they're on the on the schedule Plus
as well so you can page through here and
say alright this is all the stuff now
this is not this is better than the web
because it turns out that live music is
one of those genres the people just
don't even bother with the web anymore I
follow a live music I support a lot of
local bands I'd have a sticker on my
laptop is's I love local music my son's
a musician and most of them just have
Facebook pages they don't even bother
with the web the only reason I have
facebook account is to follow bands
because they're not on the web and
they're not anywhere else they're in
Twitter they're in facebook so this is
all those feats everything that we can
get about live music
we are ingesting being knows it and we
deliver it where you want it and in this
case where you want it is in Outlook so
he can page through this page through
this and even if he gets to Thursday if
he doesn't like anything on the
Wednesday night when she wants to go out
he can still select something on
Thursday and it just uses Outlook to
change the date and the email everybody
and it emails and this is the band this
is a link to the show this is the map to
get there everything you need so all you
have to do is pull your phone out and go
right why in the hell are we carrying
these devices around if we have to keep
using them to go to the web all the time
if every time we look at a map it
forgets we looked at the map and we have
to look at it again no more amnesia
no more monopoly of knowledge to the web
we're going to democratize knowledge
we're going to make it come
us now one more example because this
will make it all come home and also
explain some I think some of the most
futuristic parts of this now what if you
have an intent that multiple people
might be interested in what if say you
want to go out to dinner if you want to
go out to dinner there may be multiple
restaurants that want you I was in I was
in I just quit Google and went back to
Microsoft and of course I get a Windows
funk is not a total company man and a
friend of mine who also quit and came
back with me totally unrelated
you know clung to his Android phone he
and I are walking in downtown Bellevue I
don't know if you've ever been to
downtown Bellevue or not it's four gates
Ballmer right all the Microsoft
executives Amazon executives Boeing
executives it reeks affluence and wealth
and we heard about this really great
hamburger place and we wanted to try it
they had a burger called the dork now
working for Microsoft beside I was
attracted to this burger it's a mixture
of duck and pork and and we just wanted
it right so we searched for burgers
Bellevue whatever I search for it and
and of course I'm being it cuz I'm on my
Windows Phone and I look at it it says
the first link guess what the first link
was guess
Burger King oh yeah right like oh and
Bellevue people are gonna even tolerate
a Burger King and it was like four miles
away of course that's probably you know
any closer and they would have been
destroyed you know the people who who
cut the lawns in Bellevue don't go to
Burger King
we ain't goin to Burger King so of
course he's laughing that Android laugh
right
pulls out his Android phone which of
course has Google it's just answers the
exact same search term guess what his
first response was first link PageRank
right no not McDonald's that would have
been really funny it was a really good
burger place
in New York City so of course then I get
to laugh my windows laugh at him totally
useless what the hell's going on here
here we are two over employed Microsoft
employees willing to pay top dollar for
a burger and a map to get there with
them really lousy experience what should
have happened what should have happened
is my phone should have said hey Lu
burger makers in Bellevue James is
hungry and he's got money in his pocket
who wants him I call this a spot market
there's value wanting to be consumed and
there's value providers out there
wanting to connect with these people
the problem is Microsoft and Google
aren't particularly incented to connect
the two no offense Microsoft not really
incentive who really isn't scented maybe
the Bellevue Chamber of Commerce maybe
the business burg burger burgers
association of burger makers of Bellevue
Ryan who might maybe do a little bit
better of a job with this you know if I
if it's 11:30 and there's a bunch of
empty burger restaurants wouldn't those
proprietors say you know what I want to
be top on that list I want to be able to
serve a burger to this guy I call this a
spot market it's a value auction brings
together the people who want to consume
value and the people who want to provide
that value together in a single market
let me show you how how it might work so
let's say you have one of these intents
that's really complex I need a vacation
this is a complex intent I've got to go
out to the web now and find flights and
cars and hotels and activities serious
pain in the ass right remember the days
we usually just call somebody who's
really good at and says hey I want to go
to Hawaii and they just did it
those days are gone you got to do it
yourself now
now I maintain that the first place
you're going to go for this is going to
be your calendar when am I going to take
this said vacation right that's the
first thing you do the calendar is a
super app in this scenario I need to go
when can I go
maybe my spouse's calendar my kids
school counter soccer calendars might
also be consulted here and let's say we
decide okay the best week and all that
all your calendars are is May 12th and
maybe this might be manual this might be
automatic I don't care I don't really
think this is the magical part of this
trying to figure out when a family of
four can do something thorough
that's not something you wake up saying
oh god how am I gonna figure this out
I just booking all this stuff so let's
do it all right that week is good so
clear my calendar that's the first thing
that's easy to have to do there's an API
for that and then on Sunday find those
flights for me now ordinarily you get
flights in this big textual list here's
one it's got three stops and it's eight
hours long here's one it's got to stop
and sometimes you book one think it's
that's a nice cheap one and then you get
all the way through you
oh yeah it's cheap because it's got to
be long layover so don't want that when
you take the right set of data and match
it with the right super app stuff like
this happens the right thing happens
right you don't you don't mistake the
nonstop flights for the multiple layover
it's look at the layover
they're red they're obvious there's a
long one there's a short one there's two
of them don't want that flight here's a
red-eye I mean none of us have ever
booked an 11 p.m. flight thinking it was
an 11 a.m. like none of us have ever
done that but we know people who have
don't we right though that's obvious in
this case so now we pick one and we just
click it and that's it
normally you booked a flight and then
you have to go back to your calendar and
enter in all the details and the
confirmation numbers and the times and
everything so you remember where it is
why why are you leaving the calendar why
is the calendar so ignorant of the web
that it can't do this the web can do
everything we just did right there and
I'm what I'm saying is that the web that
the browser doesn't have to be the only
app we can do it in we could do it
anywhere we want
there it is now consider this spot
market idea this is not some bozo in
North Dakota thinking John what are what
Hawaii's like this time of the year and
searching for stuff because those
merchants down Hawaii are paying for
that dork to search they don't know they
don't know he's not really coming they
buy an ad oh yeah
search for this here show them our stuff
we'll pay for that
this is a pretty strong signal this is a
family of four coming they are coming
who wants them who wants a piece in this
family of four from Seattle to where are
we going here Kahului the island of Maui
beautiful place so let's have a spot
market all the hotels that are
interested in having this family of four
stay bid on it and the highest bidder
which means biggest discount to the user
gets to be first so it's a value market
and a spot it's a value auction in a
spot market it's only going on for the
short duration of time and it's based on
value one that provides the most value
to the user gets on top of course Susan
page I'm sorry it is right most
certainly is in fact I'm gonna I'm gonna
I introduced personalization when I get
to the activities but this could easily
be I'm the same way I hate big hotels so
it could easily be Santa Claus styled
personalization and so we can page
through this we can grab one and we can
book it and now here's another strong
signal not only is this family of four
coming to your Island they're staying
for a week
they're gonna need food they're gonna
need supplies they're gonna need
activities they're gonna need marriage
counseling right it's all there so who
wants them how about some local
attractions that match your interest
right so we can pull in personalization
stuff too this much as we want and they
can page through this right some
magazine they can flip through they can
flip through and it's all one touch and
it's done
all right we can do this now we can book
restaurant tables we can book flights we
can book cars but we're only doing it
through a browser why why have we seeded
the world's knowledge to a browser I
don't get it we're freeing this now this
isn't gonna happen anymore so you can
see how this goes all right
you just keep filling out your calendar
and the thing about a super app is
that's where the intent started that's
where the intent ultimately leads so
stay there don't go anywhere else
now you've got a guy I mean we could
even ingest the hotel's activities
calendar right on top of yours you ever
been ever done that I ever been in like
with your with your little kids and
you're walking across the pool deck at
some cool hotel and there's this
activity and every kid at the hotel is
doing it except yours because you forgot
to look at that paper calendar that they
were we can we can solve all of this
this is not hard
everything I'm asking is being done on
the web now it's just being done through
a browser what makes the browser so
special why not where the intent
occurred well how much intent occurs in
a browser compared to a calendar
compared to email compared to your
social network and I think there's two
canvases that are particularly important
and the calendar is one of them because
any sort of temporal intent anything
that has to do with time has a natural
home painted on a canvas a map is
another important canvas anything that
has spatial intent anything that has to
do with where has a perfect home painted
on them on a map so I think in the
future our lives are going to be built
around these super apps of course
there's gonna be a big battle for the
big software companies to make super
apps some super apps are gonna be very
temporal temporal temporary
they're gonna pop up they're gonna be
really popular like games and then
they're gonna die out quick
there's gonna be other super app scible
at last a certain amount of time and
then they'll die out there's gonna be
other apps I mean email how long how
many years have we been predicting the
demise of email is a super app oh yeah
socials gonna kill it everything's gonna
kill the instant message he didn't kill
social hasn't killed it it's a super
rabbit probably will always be a super
RAM our kids grow up not using it in a
minute they go to college they start
using it like crazy so so some some
super apps are gonna live and die
there's going to be a lot of competition
around it and then the other competition
here is to be those data providers they
do you have data that's valuable this is
a spot market for that data is much more
interesting so a data owner is going to
do the following here is our data these
are the source of intents that we want
to be able to bid on so whenever any of
these super apps detect one of these
intents we want to know about it we want
to be part of that spot market we want
to be able to bid on that on connecting
with that with that person all right so
my hamburger scenario I would have loved
to have had a spot market and had all
those companies competing for my
business at 11:30 they may have been a
little bit interested a dollar off or
you know whatever and at 12 o'clock
they're probably like you know what
we're we're full we don't want to be in
this spot market at all so wherever we
end up we don't care at 2:30 in the
afternoon
traffic's then maybe I'll bid more I'm
very interested in people with my and so
is a 20% off for buy one get one free so
there's all sorts of flexibility in this
and then of course once we walk into
that burger joint we check in and now we
have a direct relationship with the
value provider consumer to provider with
no middleman middleman have a harder
time in this new world I'm trying to
paint
we have indexed the world's information
we have found stuff and we're still
pretending like we haven't we're still
searching for the same things we
searched for yesterday in the day before
and we're still doing it in a browser
find is better than search where you are
the app you're in where your intent
occurred is better than a browser that's
my point
so
this is the way I want the world to work
there is no technological barrier at all
to the future that I've just painted
it's easy we're doing all of it now we
already have auctions we already have
the world's information indexed we
already have the answers indexed we have
the knowledge graphs let's start
surfacing surfacing though that
knowledge where the user actually is
instead of the browser where we've
gotten used to sending them so please
read my blog on MSDN please follow me on
twitter and if you'd like to email me an
offer to buy me a beer
I would probably email you back my name
is James Whittaker I work for Microsoft
