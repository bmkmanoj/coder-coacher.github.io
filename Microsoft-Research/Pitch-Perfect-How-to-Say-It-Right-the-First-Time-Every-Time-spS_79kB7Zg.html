hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
my name is Amy Draves
and I'm pleased to welcome Bill McGowan
to the Microsoft Research visiting
speaker series bill is here to discuss
his book pitch perfect how to say it
right the first time and every time and
I have to say I'm more nervous than
usual and giving Mis introduction the
title of the book so he is an
emmy-winning correspondent he has
conducted hundreds of interviews and
coached several individuals using this
experience he has learned and will share
how to craft and deliver the right
message in the best way to get a point
across effectively please join me in
giving him a very warm welcome thank you
very much Amy you did great
you're just you're pitch perfect if I
must say so I want to thank everybody
for forgoing this brilliant sunshine to
hear the talk today I promise you I'll
do everything I can to make it
absolutely worth your while I don't know
how many of you have noticed but every
year some magazine does a survey of the
things in life that scares to death and
every year the results are pretty
consistent our sense of our own
mortality often is at the top of the
list and getting on an airplane winds up
being number three and I probably don't
have to tell you what year in and year
out occupies the number two slot and
it's that churn in our stomach we feel
an hour before we've got to get up and
present it's the sleepless night the
night before
it's the asking yourself why did I agree
to do this I'm always a wreck before I
have to do it today I'd like to give you
some ticks tips and techniques on how to
get over that because I find if you're
able to move out of this left side of
the spectrum where a lot of people find
themselves and you can get to a stage of
being okay with it then you can move on
and actually get to the point where you
feel a little bit of buzz and enjoyment
from standing up and being able to
communicate and being persuasive to an
audience this is one of these things
that feeds on itself the more you enjoy
it the more you'll volunteer to do it
the more you do it the better you'll get
at it it's one of those things that you
just need reps over and over again to
develop certain skills to really perfect
how you're coming across the one thing
that I really want to have you steer
clear of more than anything and this is
a theme throughout the book is this
notion of winging it
this sense that well I know this subject
backwards and forwards nobody can stump
me with a question I know everything
there is under the Sun that's actually a
liability in many respects you should
never go into something hoping that
magic fairy dust sprinkles down on you
in the moment and you're going to be
articulate and eloquent and
knowledgeable you have to go in with a
game plan and it doesn't matter whether
it's your moderating a panel an industry
panel whether you are a participant on a
panel whether you're just going to a
meeting to address people on your team
if you can communicate concisely and get
to the point and illustrate your point
effectively chances are that 45 minutes
scheduled meeting can get done in 3035
minutes
and there's no greater gift that you
give somebody these days than time back
in their day wouldn't it be great if you
can get out of that meeting 10 minutes
early just because everybody was
efficient in communicating some of the
things I want to talk about today
definitely fall under that category the
better you get at this the more likely
you are to shortchange the prep it's
just inevitable and I want to warn you
not to do that I have clients come to us
for one-on-one training they're
effective executives they've done it a
million times and we're doing a little
roleplay and I'll tell them you know I
think you got to bump up your enthusiasm
level
and ultimately they'll say you know
don't worry when when it comes time to
doing it for real I'll turn it on it'll
all be fine and I've never really had a
good argument against that until the
first presidential debate in the last
election and the president obliged me
with giving the ultimate evidence that
you cannot shortchange the prep his camp
set up a practice campus in Las Vegas
and next thing you know he's running off
to Hoover Dam to do a photo-op and shake
hands he's not watching the videotapes
of Mitt Romney's primary debates he's
not putting in any of the legwork and
David Axelrod his senior adviser pulled
him aside and said you know mr.
president we're a little concerned you
don't seem to engage you don't seem like
you're putting your back into this and
his line to Axelrod was you know don't
worry I got this and so my message to
you is if that guy can't turn it on
instantly and flip the switch and be
great there's no hope for the rest of us
so preparation is one of the keys to
overcoming nerves how many of you I've
spoken to a bunch of you before we got
started how many of you feel like nerves
are actually impediment to doing well in
this situation okay pretty typical the
more you know your content the less
anxiety you're going to feel it's a it's
a solid ratio you'll probably be most
nervous in the first two minutes of
whatever you have to do whether it's get
up in a meeting get up in front of a
room if you know those first two minutes
cold backwards and forwards you'll get
out of the gate cleanly you'll build
your confidence through the rest of the
presentation if you stumble out of the
gate it's really hard to recover so
after two or three minutes I think we
all feel that sense of getting into a
groove and a rhythm and your nerves
settle down and everything winds up
being easier after that but what also
happens is when we get nervous we start
taking short shallow breaths
almost like mini hyperventilating and
that's what happens when our pulse runs
away with us and what it's doing is it's
depleting your lungs of air you need to
be able to get up and speak so if you
find that's the case and you suffer from
that little tremble that little quiver
in your voice when you're nervous and it
happens to a lot of people that's a lack
of wind what I want you to do is five
minutes before you have to get up to
speak good deep yoga breaths long inhale
through your nose hold it long slow
steady exhale through your mouth it's
gonna slow your pulse it's going to
replenish your lungs with air and it's
going to bring stability dip back to
your voice you don't want that shaky
voice being a dead giveaway that you're
nervous even if you're not nervous
though we get a shot of adrenaline from
the fact that we are now in the
spotlight and everybody's watching us
and that does a few things to us it
makes us speak faster than we normally
would so in those first two three
minutes come out with a nice controlled
pace people who speak fast ultimately
don't seem confident you also will
probably not land on anybody in the
audience the more nervous you are so
right now it's just natural for me to
make good sustained eye contact with
different people in the audience but
when you're nervous you're probably
going to do what I'm doing right now and
that's just sort of scanning the room
not really landing on anybody just sort
of drifting over the tops of people's
heads that may be helpful to you because
you're looking into abstraction and it's
giving you the privacy to think but it's
not a good technique to connect with
your audience see if you can look in
someone's direction land on them at
least for part of a thought and then
move off to somebody else it's a lot
about finding friendly faces in the
audience you want to see those people
who smile who give you that nod of
encouragement and remind you yes I am
NOT bombing up here it's going okay this
is not a complete and utter meltdown and
I bet you can find one person in each
quadrant of the room who gives you that
so if you have trouble speaking
large groups just have a conversation
with four people one two three four okay
no one's gonna know you're playing to
the same poor people you don't want to
catch the person who reaches in their
pocket and starts like checking their
email that's a cop that's a confidence
killer the other thing that adrenaline
does it makes it very hard for us to
stand still in fact I call this the
stationary March I'm actually not moving
anywhere but I'm also not standing still
I'm rocking I'm swaying moving around
but it's not a movement with purpose I'm
gonna show you a clip right now what I
mean by that two quick good stories and
one bad story lots of people have been
telling me about Breaking Bad the
Netflix algorithms have been
recommending Breaking Bad to me but you
know there's a lot of recommendations
and algorithms do and I've just never
gotten around to watching Breaking Bad I
think in those 30 seconds Reed Hastings
feat actually never stopped moving right
so but the fact of the matter is we have
this built-up physical energy in our
bodies from the adrenaline and we'd like
to get rid of it and typically it likes
to get out through our feet so to avoid
that rocking and swaying and sort of
lying lying in the zoo cage
back-and-forth pacing what I'd like you
to do is stand with your weight a little
bit forward on the balls of your feet
you'll feel a little bit of pressure in
your toes that's going to keep you from
being back on your heels where this kind
of weight shifts way and fidgeting this
comes from all the nagging we got as
children was probably some of the best
communication coaching on the planet I
would strongly advise that you don't
stay up till 3 o'clock in the morning
working on a PowerPoint that you have to
present at 9 a.m.
it'd be better to go to bed at 9 get up
at 4 finish the thing you don't want to
be groggy and you don't want to have an
empty stomach it's been met
we proven that the synapses in your
brain do not fire efficiently if you
don't have food in your stomach do not
skip breakfast
we just talked a little bit about
standing up straight getting your core
into it
I contact if you find it's difficult for
you to concentrate looking at somebody
else looking at you you know you could
look at the stem of my glasses or you
could look at a woman's earring if
you're addressing them in a meeting it's
better than looking at the ceiling
looking down at the floor looking
somewhere else you're going to have a
lot more conviction behind the point
you're trying to make if you're making
good sustained meaningful eye contact
and I was talking to somebody before we
got started on this whole notion of you
got to fake it till you make it and you
may be in that dread part of the
spectrum but it's really important to
relax your audience to make it seem like
you're having a good time being up there
and speaking the only time an audience
gets uptight for you is if you seem
tense
so in the beginning until you can
actually get to a point of tolerating
and liking it see if you can just bring
a brightness to your expression look
like there's no place I'd rather be even
if you can't wait to get off the stage
okay and a few things your mother did
not tell you no yogurt no milk the
morning of a presentation it actually
creates a frog in your throat and you
will have to clear your throat maybe
repeatedly which you don't want to be
doing get inside a room like this walk
around get a sense of how deep it is how
much you're going to have to project to
reach the back row you don't want to
stand at a podium or a stage for the
first time when you're doing it for real
you don't want anything feeling strange
or unusual make sure that if you bring
your laptop that a PowerPoint works on
that I have a pair of cufflinks that my
my assistant gave me they're the
greatest thing in the world they're
actually a USB Drive it's a big square
coupling and it comes apart and I always
put my presentation on my cuff link in
case it gets like corrupted somehow you
know at the location and I've actually
had to pull that thing out a couple of
times
and I learned this one the hard way I
was presenting at a client one time it
was the second time I was there so of
course the first time I went I got on
their wireless network and without me
knowing it it just connected me the
second time and I'm narrowly clicking
through my slides I think I'm on the
third or fourth slide and suddenly all
my email notifications from the night
before start bogging up in the corner of
the screen
and it took every ounce of self-control
not to lunge at the computer and pull
the pull the cord out make sure
everything is turned off so before
everyone filed in I don't do this as a
strategic way I like meeting people but
there's a benefit to saying hello to
people before you have to get up and
speak and one of them is they may tell
you something in this little
conversation before you get up to speak
that's helpful to you maybe they've told
you what they ultimately want to come to
here and you can just do a little bit of
tweak or incorporate a story somebody
tells you into your presentation to give
it a feeling of spontaneity and to pull
the room up with you be a good listener
in these little conversations you have
before you get started it also helps you
understand this is a tough crowd is it
an easy crowd how hard am I gonna have
to work how convincing am I going to
have to be and also again like if you
and I have had a talk before we get
started I guarantee you you probably
won't pull your phone out on me you know
you're going to feel more invested in
being that attentive listener so it's a
great way to create that energy in the
audience and warm up athletes do it
musicians do it in your or in your
kitchen that morning making coffee say
the first two to three minutes of your
presentation out loud
hear how it sounds rolling off your
tongue it's a totally different dynamic
than silently imagining what you're
going to say in your head that doesn't
do that doesn't accomplish the same goal
so how do you begin well I probably
coach about
ten people a week on presentations and I
will tell you that eight or nine of them
all start out exactly the same and
that's not what we're really going for
one thing people do is they presume that
the audience isn't going to be
interested in what they're going to say
so I could have gotten up here and I
could have said so listen I know you all
probably want to be outside today
because it's a beautiful day but I'm
just gonna very quickly walk you through
a few things that absolutely not never
ever project in the mind of your
audience that somehow you're not gonna
be scintillating okay I've heard apology
for every single speaking timeslot in
the day nine o'clock you're apologizing
cuz everybody's tired and they just got
up at eleven o'clock you're apologizing
that everybody's hungry and can't wait
to get to lunch at two o'clock you're
apologizing because everybody's groggy
from lunch and at 5:30 you're the only
thing standing between them the cocktail
hour
I have heard an apology for every single
speaking slot in an agenda so no apology
and I know that this the prevalent idea
of tellement you're going to tell them
tell them and tell them what you told
them is well embraced and has been for
years I think it's a dated dusty
approach that everybody does and because
everybody's doing it you shouldn't be
doing it you should be doing something
much more original and figuring out how
the first thing coming out of my mouth
is going to hook you not the
agenda-setting start which is hi I'm
Bill McGowan I'm the CEO clarity Media
Group I wanna take a little time today
to talk about public speaking and then I
want to give you some examples of some
people I think do it well and some
people don't do it well but before we do
that let me just hit rewind for a minute
and take a few steps back and quickly
walk you through does that sound
familiar just about everybody does the
table of contents open absolutely not
I'll show you an example of what I think
is the perfect
perfect beginning the agenda-setting
start has a very fitting acronym by the
way I'm a little nervous because my wife
Yvonne said to me she said Jeffrey you
watched the TED talks I said yes honey I
loved TED talks she said you know
they're like really smart talented guys
I know I know she said they don't want
like the angry black man so I said no
one would be good honey I'm gonna be
good I am but I am angry and the last
time I looked why I'm excited but I'm
angry this year they're gonna be
millions of our children that we're
going to needlessly lose so the reason I
think this is the perfect open is
because he's not telling a joke don't
don't start with a joke ever if the joke
bombs you will be thrown and rattled and
you'll never recover and you're
expecting that laugh and you don't get
it it really is debilitating what he
does is he starts with a story that has
funny elements to it right but it's not
a story that's just a funny story for
funny storytelling sake the punchline of
the story the fact that he's angry is
the core theme of what he's there to
talk about
there's connective tissue between the
story and the point of his talk and that
ultimately is what makes it work and
also you feel like you have a little
access to him you're overhearing your
fly in the wall of this conversation
he's had with his wife it's in my mind
like the perfect start and I realized
it's a TED talk you're not gonna go in a
conference room and necessarily do that
but think how from my first declarative
concise statement in this meeting
can I get people's attention and make
them kind of want to know how I'm going
to go on to explain this trying to not
start like everybody else does that that
Ford's own that you think you're in is a
conformity zone and it's really not a
great way to grab people's attention and
then how we articulate ourselves really
matters just about every brilliant
person throughout history has subscribed
to this notion of simplicity don't use a
25 cent word when a five cent word is
perfectly functional and suffices but I
this is something I hear in just about
every company I go to work for these
words like planful and choice 'fl and I
don't know where these words come from
they're not in the dictionary they you
know if they they're on your computer
and you've written them and there's a
red line underneath it that means it's
not a word that means you shouldn't be
this word should not be crossing your
lips and I hear them all the time and
ironically a woman who I've known a long
time who's read the book and I asked her
to come to this function in New York we
were talking about Gwyneth Paltrow and
the misstep she had last week and she
said yeah she didn't sound very planful
in what she was doing there and thinking
have you read the book have you and just
be careful of jargon when you are
speaking outside the company
I realize that jargon is a verbal
shortcut for us when we're speaking with
each other in a meeting but it's very
important to realize that when you're
speaking to an external audience it's
really good to stay away from from these
verbal shortcuts and everybody falls
victim to them or just Bala props in
general sometimes you
misunderestimated me they could refute
e8 what it is that this group is saying
this is the this is the jargon one I
love what are you guys doing we're I da
ting I do what i da ting
what's that coming up with new ideas why
don't you just call it that this is
different we need to rethink the way we
do things
structure process we need to innovate we
haven't ideated that yet that was a that
was an IBM spot from about literally 12
years ago and the reason it's so funny
is is because it's so close to the truth
it's barely an exaggeration so really
watch the jargon if you can so the
reason I did this book was because I
found that a lot of the principles that
I was working with people on on how to
be better communicators more efficient
more effective more persuasive didn't
apply to just being on panels and giving
speeches and giving media interviews I
found that they really pervade all high
stakes communication situations in our
lives whether we are coaching our nephew
for the big job interview or whether we
are faced with having that difficult
conversation with an aging parent that
they shouldn't be driving anymore you
know there are all these things that
happen day to day where the way we frame
something and the words we use to put
our point forward really matter they
often determine the difference between
success and failure and so there are
these various principles in the book one
of them that I think is really important
speaks to the notion of brevity and I
call it the pasta sauce principle
because if any of you are avid cooks you
know that if you put a pot of sauce on
the stove and you cook it down for an
hour two hours on a Sunday that
reduction is going to have a lot more
flavor and just a dynamic
to it then if you keep pouring more
water into that thing the verbal
equivalent is figuring out a way to say
it concisely and directly being verbose
and buying into this notion that more is
more is like putting water in the sauce
see if you can avoid circular logic
redundancy it's not helping you want to
make it as lean and mean as you possibly
can and I find that the majority of
people if you think about this as like
your thought you have a beginning a
middle and an end to this thought that
you're trying to convey I find a lot of
people are pretty good getting out of
the gate and maybe getting to the crux
of what it is they want to say but then
wrapping it up tends to be a real
challenge
there's a lot of ad-libbing there's a
lot of excess that's not helping us and
so to avoid that what I'd like you to
think about is let me do enough
preparation and reflection ahead of time
to know what my content is and let me
develop the discipline that by the time
I open my mouth to start talking to
convey this thought I have a general
idea where I'm ending up what the finish
line looks like not in a scripted
verbatim way I don't want you to be feel
like you're rigidly controlled but I do
want you to know okay what's the point
I'm trying to make here and how can I
back up that point do I have a story I
can tell do I have an example I can give
do I have a data point that helps
illustrate the main point those are
basically the two components of what
makes persuasive discussion and
conversation a point and a way to bring
it to life and if you can't conceptually
see what the full arc of your answer
contains when you open your mouth to
start you're talking too long that's a
good barometer it's not about talking
for 35 seconds or 45 seconds it's about
how much control do I have over what I
know is going to come out of
my mouth over the next 20 seconds again
if you can remove as much winging it and
saying the first thing that pops into
your head that is never a good strategy
and in fact you know the news every week
is filled with people who say the first
thing that pops into their head and then
they spend a week apologizing for it or
restating it or explaining it it's
usually not good one of the other key
principles in the book ask you to think
about your brain and your mouth as two
cars on the road okay and your brain is
always the lead car it's always about a
millisecond ahead of your mouth and it
is basically figuring out what
conversational road you're gonna go down
and what words you're going to use to
express that thought and we'd like to
think that when your brain gets to that
intersection it makes the decisions very
efficiently and that's not always the
case sometimes we come up to a juncture
and we're just not sure about what it is
we're supposed to be saying or how we
should be saying it if you buy into this
notion that you need to have a steady
stream of sound coming out of your mouth
that's the equivalent of your mouth
tailgating your brain and if your brain
isn't making that decision efficiently
your mouth has to do something while
it's waiting for instructions and
typically that's where comes as you nose
kind of sort of x' likes come in the
garbage filler that strips us of our
conviction and also our executive
presence so two things to try to get rid
of filler which I have clients every
week say I just would love to rid myself
of this one is being aware of it two is
adopting this discipline of the less
certain I am about the next thing coming
out of my mouth the slower I should be
talking
the more pausing I should be building in
that's going to keep you from having a
lot of filler and sound coming out of
your mouth instead of crisp content so I
like to this is usually people love this
part for some reason I don't know why
maybe it's it's the question I get asked
the most okay who wants to take a crack
at one of the six pardon its pockets
very good that's one very good that
actually is going to be the seventh one
if your hands rise above shoulder level
nothing good is happening you know
you're either tugging at your gear
scratching your nose playing with your
hair all fidgety personal grooming stuff
that is out no no no okay so good thank
you for giving me number seven so we
have pockets fold it across the chest
never here okay yeah this is this reeks
of I don't really deserve your attention
but I'm gonna be up here talking anyway
it's too apologetic and too passive okay
so we have folded across the chest
behind the back in the pocket so else
yes Bigley very good this is also not a
position and also praying this is too
high
okay so fold it across the check on your
hips is another one anybody else any
other positions
yes very good we haven't talked about
that but this is what I call podium
push-ups you know which you actually
will see people doing occasionally this
I understand
provides a lot of security to hang on to
this thing for dear life not not a good
idea in fact I didn't even you know like
to be if I had my druthers actually I
would be sort of walking down the aisle
a little bit but I don't want to be
doing the bird thing right I don't want
to be in the light of the projector and
I also don't want
the cameras but this is a barrier
between you and the audience it'd be
better to get out from in front of it
from behind it and if you have to stand
behind it because the mic is there and
you're not wirelessly mic you know stand
physically independent of the podium
okay all right so the last few are
draped by your sides so I've never seen
anybody look comfortable standing in
front of a room like this so what I'd
like you to do is from this position I
want you to create a right angle between
your upper arm and your forearm and I
want your hands to come together right
around your belt buckle if you've got a
clicker it's easy because you can sort
of hold the clicker with both hands
right around your belt buckle and it
gives you something to hold on to but
suppose you don't have a clicker now
this is a little bit more difficult but
it and it may feel a little strange in
the beginning but but it looks right and
the reason I like it is because I want
to talk with my hands but I don't want
them to have to travel a long distance
to be able to gesticulate and down here
they do and now I'm done with them and
they got a long way to fall to get into
a resting position here it's easy in and
easy out you know I can talk with them
periodically and not have to overthink
it the palms your hands are basically
facing in the backs of your hands are
basically facing out they are not
rigidly clenched to show any tension and
they're not shaped so that anybody in
the audience is thinking let's do this
hands over there
you know you wanted to just be like
you're holding something very delicate
between your fingers okay and I would
say that the piece of advice that rises
above all else is see if you can
generate genuine enthusiasm for the
value of the information you're sharing
with your audience do not go into this
thinking that your definition of success
is to get through it technically clean
without any hiccups
or stumbles or stutters that's not what
it's about it's about conveying to
everybody in the audience that this is
important to know this could be very
helpful in what we're doing and I think
you should know this and I'm looking
forward to being able to communicate it
to you enthusiasm for the value of the
information you're sharing most
important thing and until you can
actually do that in a genuine organic
way see if you can just bring a little
of that flavor to your delivery until
you feel it for real I'd be happy to
take any questions you have little tip
if you do open up an event you have to
QA come with your own first question and
so and what I mean by that is typically
nobody likes to go first in QA so the
most Awkward part of a presentation is
where okay so any questions b-b-b and
you're thinking oh my god nobody has any
questions that's where you want to step
in and say you know typically when I
give talks like this what I find people
are most curious about is X Y &amp;amp; Z you
know jump start your own Q&amp;amp;A with
something that you feel is a typical
question because that is an awkward
moment and you don't want to have that
sort of referendum that now you weren't
really interesting enough to ask any
questions so everybody yes
I think you have to pick zones so let's
say bright lights got one right here
you know think near right far right far
left near left break the room into those
quadrants you're not gonna find that
good listener but think about speaking
to that that that zone the other thing
that's important is if you're on a stage
and there are confidence monitors or a
teleprompter I don't know if you have
that realize that if they're on the
floor where they usually are the closer
you are to the foot of the stage the
more disparity in the eye line between
the monitor and the audience it's going
to look more like you're reading the
prompter whereas if you back up mid
stage this gets mitigated okay and how
many of you have to be in an in an event
where you're reading a prompter or
there's some kind of so the only other
thing you want to avoid there is
sometimes they have one this side of the
stage and that side of the stage try
never to read the one you're walking
away from which I see a lot you know
people sort of sneak a peek over their
shoulder that immediately looks like
you're reading okay yeah if the slide is
really dense I think what can be
effective is saying okay so we have ten
years of performance here here's what I
really want to bring your attention to
like don't go through every single thing
on the chart that's probably one thing
on each slide you want the person in the
audience or in the room focusing on and
you have to actually dictate what it is
that they're gonna Zone in on with their
eyes when you throw up a slide there's a
lot of information in that a lot of bars
a lot of numbers a lot of words you are
relinquishing control their eyes can go
anywhere they want and what you're
saying is almost insignificant so you
almost have to dictate where their eyes
should go on the slide okay so the blue
line is what I really want to point out
here and here's what it shows okay yeah
previous slide you were talking about
we're not to put your hands and I
assumed that that was reflecting when
people are standing yes I can't quite
visualize how you're gonna beat your
hips when you're standing how you're
gonna what reach all the way down to
your hips you mean like this oh just you
know Me's hand like you know your hands
on your hips walk it's a little bit of
kind of a cocky you know stance if
you're seated you want to avoid if
you're sitting in a conference room or
at a table try not to have hands below
the table back all the way against the
back of the chair I sort of call this
the the electric chair pose you know
feet flat on the floor I find what
really works to develop an engaged
attentive kind of physical presence is
think about sitting on at least the
front half of the cushion so my back now
is completely separated from the back of
the chair cross your legs at the ankle
and tuck it underneath the chair
forearms on the conference table or
whatever it is and feel an arch in the
smaller back I am sitting up straight
right now from the base of my spine if I
let go of that this is how I look which
is a very different kind of vibe you're
giving off so I want you to think about
sitting forward but sitting up and
there's something about your feet in
this position that almost kind of lifts
you off your chair a little bit this is
what's going to it's those nonverbal
communicating little items that make it
seem like you have more conviction in
what you're saying as opposed to yeah I
think we should do this you know that
you're not really putting your back into
that yeah you anticipate I mean is there
any what I'm sorry authenticity in the
authentic who you really are I mean if
you're natural in expressing move your
hands mmm the stage then you don't move
your hands and in poor communities yes
all right you perceive
artificial and then use the connection I
think you should take what makes you
feel comfortable in your own skin and
just round off those edges that wind up
being techniques that distract from what
you're saying so let's say let's take
hands for instance you know let's say
you're very expressive and now my hands
tend to move constantly and they they
never actually rest right that can be a
little manic and distracting so if the
person came to me and said I just love
to talk with my hands I say fine but
realize to have them in constant motion
doesn't help you want to think that I
want to move my hands when I really want
to punctuate something but then when I'm
on information that's of secondary
importance I don't want to be doing this
I don't want to be seeming like I'm
trying to artificially pump everything
up and and that's one of the one of the
points about presenting don't try to
dial it up to 11:00 on everything
because then nothing stands out pick
your spots to really put emphasis and
conviction behind it you can slow down
your speaking pace over your big points
you can use your hands and in that way
you create this sort of vocal bolding
and underlining yeah
oh so I was joking around with Amy
before she got up that this woman went
to introduce me at an event a few months
back and she had a piece of paper very
much like this and she was nervous and
not only could you see the paper shaking
but you could hear it so and I really
felt bad for her so what I typically
like are these big index cards I think
they're five by eights and if you're a
guy and you happen to be wearing a
jacket they fit inside your inner breast
pocket and sometimes I'll just keep
those as a backup in case technically
everything fails and I could just sort
of you know pull them out of my pocket
and use them as a guide and you want to
avoid having a sheet of paper like this
like you're gonna be reading it think
about these cards actually anchor your
hands that give you something to do with
your hands but I'm sort of holding them
against my torso right now and now when
I need them I can just look down at it
and then return them to their spot you
don't want to create the impression that
I need this thing at the ready because I
have no idea where I'm going yeah what
is the right balance between as a
speaker speaking to a set of slides
versus being able to speak so I've seen
speakers we were very engaging and just
have one visual on the screen and they
actually have you riveted whatever
they're on the stage seen people who go
well death by PowerPoint vision yeah
where they keep talking and the slide is
so busy and like you just can't even
keep your eyes open so as a speaker what
is sort of the in-between what is a
preferable way to be more effective in
communicating what you're saying and
what is the
think of you and the PowerPoint like
you're a broadcast team for a sporting
event the PowerPoint is the play-by-play
guy you're the color commentator so that
means don't read your slides don't don't
be the verbal equivalent of what's on
the slide you want to give context and
color and so see if you could find an
alternate way of saying what's on the
slide also if you have a presentation
you need to give that's really dense and
information see if you can build that
deck out and if you need to distribute
it ahead of time or at the meeting
that's what you give but then take that
one and scale it way back and make it as
visually sparse as possible and that's
the one you show the thing you're trying
to avoid is battling with yourself and
giving them a gazillion things to look
at and try to listen to you at the same
time so but I realized that a really
scaled back PowerPoint is a problem
because then the people in the audience
say well listen I need this information
you're leaving all this stuff out make
that a deck that you provide to them in
some way yeah yeah maybe
opt for making it more visually driven
in terms of the content on the slides
see if you can opt for images which by
the way are six thousand times more
memorable than words so you're doing
yourself a huge favor by trying to be as
much of a visual storyteller as possible
and you know I agree with you I think
that your vocal pace can have a big
impact on something like this if you
feel like you are about to say a term or
a word that may not be immediately
recognizable to the audience maybe just
go a little bit slower over
that word you don't want to be
condescending where you're saying it
really loud and slow the way some people
do you obviously want to stay away from
doing that but careful of idiomatic
expressions which often people from
another culture will not be familiar
with or any kind of terminology that may
not be in the grasp of somebody who has
an okay understanding of the language
yeah not for presentation skills but
well I'm in a team that we have a bunch
of other teams that rely on what we do
and we need to communicate those ideas
clearly and concisely and the tendency
at Microsoft is to right along email and
you feel like you put bread written
along email that describes everything
then you're done and I also see the same
thing happen with verbal communication
where people are essentially writing the
email when they're talking to someone
point is not this communication where
you're assessing whether the first thing
you said was actually understood and
then moving on to your second point and
illustration and a lot of times we fall
into point point point point point yeah
and the person is still trying to
process the first one so I don't know if
you have anything to say about that
dynamic and sometimes communicating is
is like feeding a little child you know
you have to here's a spoonful okay chew
and swallow okay you ready for the next
one you know you want to get a sense for
is your audience ready to move on have
they digested what I've just told them
I'm not this is where empathy comes into
play in communication it's not just
about you touching bases a B C and D and
getting out of the conference room as
early as possible it's about do I get
the sense the this the people around the
table have gotten this and do I need to
illustrate these points through real or
hypothetical examples to really drive at
home and it's also I think
to say you know is that clear should we
is everybody okay to move on you know I
think there's a little bit of a
reluctance to gauge the audience in a
meeting even you don't have to say
everything at once that's right
even though we have this half hour now
it doesn't mean I have to tell you
absolutely everything in that half hour
right we could have another one after yo
there's this idea of leaving people
wanting more right or you know thinking
all right well we're closing this
meeting what do I want everybody from
this meeting doing in the aftermath this
meeting so maybe you button the meeting
not with all right so let's review
everything we covered you know that's
not necessarily bum suggesting but what
if you were to give the presentation say
okay so if nothing else happens out of
this meeting here's what I'd like
everybody to ponder or here's what I
would like everybody to come up with a
solution for you know the this idea of
call to action or not marching orders
but in almost like inspiring them to do
something out of the meeting you know
yes I think there's a certain value in
acknowledging and validating what the
skepticism in the room is and just
getting it out there by saying now I
know full well this idea has its
limitations and some people in the
audience they see it as this then the
other thing let me explain to you why we
believe there's bigger upside to this
regardless of where you come down on
that you know I think sometimes the
naysayers just one you to verbalize and
acknowledge the doubts they have and to
not just come out
from a combative I'm gonna cut you off
and I'm right and you're wrong
you know to be able to acknowledge and
validate has has importance yes I'm
sorry
I give them something that I call a
message grid and that is you're going
into a meeting or you're going to be
peppered with questions try to figure
out what the topics of conversation are
going to be in this meeting so they're
going to ask you what are the potential
pitfalls of this plan what kind of
revenue is going to be driven from it
what are competitors doing you know
there's certain predictable topics that
can come up and on this grid in these
columns I want you to think what's my
basic point here and what's my point of
illustration do I have a data point do I
have an example I can give how do i
bolster my main point and just putting
bullet point reminders to yourself it's
like a road map
here's topic deed that's gonna come up
with a meeting this is my point this is
my illustration I know it
I'm not scripting it out verbatim but I
am creating a navigational guide as to
what I'm gonna talk about when these
different topics in the meeting come up
yeah see if you can stay away from the
empty platitudes which are oh I think
it's going great
you know everybody seems really engaged
and you know see if you can stay away
from the empty stuff see if you can give
them something concrete and say you know
I wasn't sure until yesterday and then
we had this meeting yesterday in which
you know three quarters of the team had
great input into how to finalize the
plan and I'm feeling really confident
about it see if you can that even that
little bit of storytelling to give it
often too
city rather than just sort of saying
what he or she thinks you want them to
hear you know stay away from the
generalities see if you can and and to
that end I would heartily recommend that
you all get one of these are you
probably a lot a lot of you have it
there are things that happen day to day
week to week that represent great
anecdotal material something somebody
says to you in a meeting or you're out
having a conference with a client and
they say something they tell you how
some challenge they're having you've
helped them overcome with some
innovation you've provided them shot
that stuff down put it in a book
somewhere because these stories are the
lifeblood of your participation on
panels your speeches your presentations
it's really hard the night before a
presentation to suddenly think okay I
need to come up with some stories yeah
start archiving them it'll be a great
thing to be able to you have any
recommendations I I breathed right I
would have you ever seen yourself on
video okay so why not do this why not
grab your phone and prop it up and
videotape yourself practicing write your
next speech or whatever it is and then
when you're done check the clock so
let's say you do the first two pages and
it's a minute 43 right now try to do it
in more than two minutes okay see if you
can see what it takes for you to stretch
that thing by 17 seconds
and and deliberately force yourself to
try to chew up more time but for you I
think what would be really critical is
don't try to uniformly slow yourself
down take the really key take away ideas
your big points and think alright these
are gonna be the selected moments where
I downshift and I slow down and I draw
it out a little bit more emphatically I
think that's gonna work better for you
than feeling like I've got to take
everything down a certain speed think
about what your punch lines are what
your big ideas are slow down over those
because it is the variation of your
speaking pace that makes your voice
interesting to listen to somebody who's
uniformly brisk and talking mile a
minute all the time it's very easy to
lose the engagement of your audience as
is somebody who's very slow and plodding
and never steps on the gas you want both
brisk and slow yes is this a DC meeting
or a phone like Commerce Hall right
you're probably sitting at a conference
table right so I would definitely adopt
that kind of forearms on the table okay
let's get right to it you know I think
see if you can take charge with
conviction and you know the thing that
makes those calls so difficult is
everybody stepping over each other cuz
there's a little delay if you start
talking and you hear somebody starting
to chime in two seconds later don't stop
keep going the worst thing that can
happen on those calls is where everybody
starts like being really plen oh you go
no you started done you know that makes
a 20-minute call forty minute call but
see if you can you know the other thing
that works for phone calls is not
sitting down is having some notes and
maybe even have a headset walk around
the room
I find that I'm a lot more animated in
how I deliver information and I have a
lot more conviction in my voice if I'm
moving the last place you want to do one
of these is sitting behind her desk
because when this meeting starts to get
sluggish and you start to get bored
you'll check your inbox you will or
you'll see something on your desk saying
oh man I'm supposed to do that yesterday
shoot
you know million-in-one distractions
behind your desk worst place to do a
call yeah we're practicing of the
opening to get into the flow will you
apply the same to the closing or would
you rather have it in a natural flow and
kind of absolutely I think you should
know what's my crisp close to this
absolutely it should get every bit as
much planning and attention as your open
yes you mean questions that are
difficult that you might not be able to
handle I think there's nothing wrong
with saying to somebody in an audience
you know I would love to double check
that piece of information before I give
you an exact number so maybe you could
follow up the after after the meeting
and I'll we can do it one-on-one you
know it's not the end of the world to
say I don't know but there are ways to
do that where you don't make it seem
like you know I'm knowledgeable if
you're asked something very narrow in
focus in Q&amp;amp;A in the audience and you
don't know that specific thing see if
you can broaden the scope of the
question so you can speak more generally
to the topic they've raised you know in
a QA nobody's going to fire or follow-up
pin you down type of type of question to
it
yes any particular pointers for giving
presentations to your management team
executives prayer nope
yeah I've known people to become fixated
on the most powerful person in the room
to the exclusion of maybe other semi
powerful people in the room right and as
a result some people can feel little
dissed so I would be diligent about
spreading my attention around to the
various people on the other side of the
table so that you know nobody feels
slighted but maybe on the really big
points the stuff that really really
matters that's when you Zone in on the
number one decision maker okay
because you know I've seen situations
where even somebody's executive
assistant is sitting next to the CEO in
a meeting and that people pitching them
have completely ignored that person
right and then what happens they leave
the meeting and the CEO turns to his or
her executive assistant says what you
think of those guys and the assistant
feels completely dish because I don't
know I thought they were kind of jerks
you know you cannot afford to slight
anybody on the other side of the table
regardless of what their title is okay
so thank you very much for coming today
I hope that was helpful and whatever you
wind up having to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
