next to me is you Shang who's gonna talk
to us about geo life which is more than
just a GPS tracker for your phone what
is geo life yeah Joe life is a
location-based social networking service
a Microsoft which was it enable users to
share life experience and the puter
connection among each other using human
location history using a gps basically
my phone is going to alert the world
where I am at all times yes using yes
using a gps enabled device you can
recall your location history such as
travel experience with some GPS
trajectories like this then by upload
the data to GPS data and associated
madhumita content like photos to the
website of geo life UK interact with
your GPS trajectory like playing video
first you can enjoy and memorize the
past experience on map second she'll eat
with your friends for example to see the
space my space you can share it with
your friends so your friends can see
what you saw no well have where you have
been and understand the whole journey
within a few seconds it's much more
convenient and intuitive within writing
an iridium Prague so this feature can
stimulate the users passion in
contributing their data to the Geo life
so now we have data for multiple users
so this here is sort of tracking
everywhere you went and then you can
just choose to upload photos whenever
you find something interesting yes yes
it's up to you so basically user can
control the old data and then make a
decision whether I shoot this share this
demo its trajectory with my friend or
not okay so as we have data from
multiple users so we can man this user's
location history
for example this is a map of Beijing
when people come to Beijing for the
first time they would desire to know
which locations are the most interesting
place in this city by mining multiple
uses a location history geo life can
automatically discover the interesting
location the top interesting location
and classic travel sequence in your city
your interesting location stands for
some culturally important place like
tiananmen square in beijing and
frequently frequently the public area
like shopping more and the restaurant
these are places that have been uploaded
and sort of tagged by your friends or
everyone within the geo life community I
will run into geo like a mirror yes and
we can man this location automatically
from their location histories so people
can see the photo taken in this region
and make it their own decision whether
this place deserve my waist or not right
so this application scenario would be
more valuable for mobile users given the
recommendation of interesting location
and a classic travel sequence around
them mobile users are more likely to
enjoy high-quality trial experience
whilst they will not of them for
location founding and the trip learning
right and also is my major of another
domain of this website where you can
manager and upload your own data you can
control our data so it would be like
only for sharing with my friends you can
control a this you can share it with
everybody or share it with your friends
or just keep it secret it depends on you
yeah very private yeah we can we can
show you later huh so as a user's travel
Norwich originally flick them but you
are familiar with shadow but you might
only know about Beijing I'm a trauma
expert of Beijing but I have no idea
about New York so when you change the
region but for example you select a
region to mean you can see the rank of
this expert has been changed okay look
in my gel life with no messenger account
geo life will recommend you a group of
users we call potential friends who
share similar location history with you
without your life you might not know
these guys even if you miss issues with
us with you met with each other in the
real life so many times so moreover
what's interesting is that from their
local history you are more likely to
find out some locations that interest
you well you have not found by yourself
it's all a controlled right here from
your phone and it's called geo life
right is there a website is just to your
life com yes you said I'm going to join
because I have a lot of travel expertise
that need to know about all right thank
you very much took geo life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
