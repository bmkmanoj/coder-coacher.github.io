thank you all for coming to our
Wednesday colloquium it is my pleasure
to introduce my good friend and I guess
collaborator or near mirror collaborator
um we ran at least it will be in at
least one edited collection together so
that comes close enough um Lisa serve on
whoa lisa is visiting us from the from

so coming soon to an airport Barnes &amp;amp;
Noble Kendall near you I hope um and uh
anything I was going to say something
else but I can't remember well anyway um
anyway I'm so glad that Lisa is here and
I I'm sure you all get a tremendous
amount of interesting stuff from her
talk Thank you Thank You Lana thank you
everyone for being here I had originally
planned on submitting the book before I
did this week here and the deadline got
moved and I thought it was you know my
son actually said like are you sure
that's a good decision to go winning
he's 11 and I wasn't sure it was a good
decision but it's turned out to be great
because as you all know from being here
it's a lovely environment in which to
work and I'm staying at a hotel so I
don't even have to do dishes or walk my
dog or read bedtime stories so I've been
able to really focus for the last few
days before I actually turn this whole
happy in so what I'm going to talk today
about is this financial inclusion debate
you may have heard the terms banked and
unbanked and underbanked which are
bandied about policy circles and and I'm
going to kind of get inside those terms
in that debate and actually question
whether it's the right way to talk about
the problem that we talked about but I
first want to show you a couple of
pictures and in some ways the first two
pictures i show you can sum up a lot of
what i have to say the first one is of a
bank on the left that looks a lot like
the bank i went to as a kid I grew up in
the was born in the mid-60s grew up in
the 60s and early 70s and even though
that's not me in that teller line that
picture really epitomizes a lot of my
experience going to Pulaski Savings and
Loan in my polish immigrant town in
central New Jersey and I remember going
there when I was a kid with my dad as
part of his Saturday afternoon errand
rituals we would go to the post office
we'd go to Mike the butcher and get meat
for the week my dad get his hair cut at
Mike the barber and then we'd go to the
bank Mike the butcher and the barber
yeah they were both mics so not the same
guy though so you know it was this not a
fancy building but we'd walk across the
lobby it up to that teller window and
the teller always knew my father and
everybody else in the bank there would
be a bowl of lollipops on the counter
she would ask how I was they would talk
about whatever how the local football
team was doing and it felt like this
community space like all of those places
felt and then when I got my first
savings account when I was about seven
years old I got this past book I know
some of you are too young for passbooks
how many of you remember getting this
you know mine was green with gold
letters and when I got allowance money
or babysitting money or gifts money from
my grandparents we'd go to the bank and
they'd put it in one of those machines
that kind of like typed in the balance
and I could see it grow and I could see
a little bit of interest and it just
felt almost like this rite of passage so
fast forward to today these are my
children and this is a lot of what is
this one
step farther in the process of what
banking looks like now for most of us we
don't even use the ATM very often we use
except to get cash but that's what my
parent by that's what my kids think of
as a bank is the machine that you go to
and press a few buttons and it spits
cash out at you I don't think they've
ever been to a teller window because I
go so rarely that when I do go the
teller doesn't know my name I never
recognize the teller in fact one of the
most recent times that I had to go for a
money order there was a well-dressed
bank employee who would approach the
people in the teller line and say can I
show you how you need to how to do what
you want to do on the ATM you know
trying to get us out of the line so that
the transaction would cost less to the
bank never mind that what I needed to do
I could do on an ATM so in the meantime
while we well the sort of face of
banking has changed a lot of other
things have changed too and one of them
has been the way that we think about
banking and who has bank accounts and
who doesn't so back in 2009 the FDIC
began measuring who has a bank account
and who doesn't and creating these terms
by which they describe all of us which
are banked which means those are the
people in gray sixty-seven percent of us
which means you use a bank account and
nothing else or credit union so i'm
going to use banks and credit unions
kind of interchangeably for a lot of
this or your unbanked about eight
percent of the population or you're
under banked unbanked means you don't
have a bank account at all under banked
means you have a bank account but you
also use other kinds of services like
maybe payday loans or check cashers and
policymakers really think of this as a
problem they think that it's a problem
if you don't have a bank account that
you're missing something really
important and so they've been really
focused in terms of this financial
inclusion debate on getting everybody
who's not banked or who's not completely
using a bag to use a bank account now
just briefly it's kind of critical to
look at how these statistics differ by
race so you'll see that if you buy into
these categories the picture looks much
worse
if you're black or Latino in terms of
being unbanked and to take a little bit
of a detour I just want to show you
since I'm going to be talking a lot
about what I call alternative financial
services what alternative financial
services consist of so I'm going to be
talking mostly about payday loans and
check cashing which constitute the
biggest part of this whole industry but
it's important to say that there's a lot
of overlap so a lot of most payday
lenders do check cashing some of the
payday lenders also do auto title loans
prepaid cards you can get at a payday
lender or check casher does everyone
here know what a payday lender is if
they're legal anybody not know okay so
payday loans are very small loans
usually up to about five hundred dollars
that are due on your next payday so it's
a short-term loan uncle atter alized so
it's two weeks or four weeks and they
cost a lot so the place that I worked
which I'll tell you about in a little
while charge fifteen dollars per hundred
borrowed so if you took out honey you
know a hundred dollar loan you'd
actually get $85 back and that whole
hundred dollars is due on your next
payday so there's a lot of controversy
as you can imagine about whether those
loans are helpful or harmful so jumping
back to the way that policy makers and
consumer advocates tend to frame these
debates this is a very simplistic
diagram but it communicates a lot
policymakers think banks and credit
unions are good and that everything else
is bad but I began to wonder why if
alternative financial services are so
bad why are so many people using them
and I began to ask this question maybe
about six years ago I was teaching a
course called gender development and
finance and I'd invited a woman who was
a who who ran a credit union in the
South Bronx to come to my class she
asked if she could bring a friend who
turned out to be a check casher the guy
named Joe Coleman who ran a chain of
twelve check cashers in the South Bronx
in Harlem and my students had already
stuff about predatory sleazy alternative
financial services providers and we were
really ready to go to
on this guy and he came to the class and
actually made a very compelling case for
why he thought his businesses were
providing a necessary service in
lower-income communities the communities
where he worked so that got me really
thinking and I started looking at the
data on these lenders and i found that
beginning in the 1990s the business is
really picked up in terms of how much
business that they were doing and how
much people were were using them and
even switching from banks and i began to
question the kind of received wisdom
that the policy makers were putting out
there because it seemed like if these
services were so bad for people yet so
many people were using them the
implication even though it was never
stated such was that people must be
ignorant or stupid if they were making
that choice and I had done a lot of
research had been researching low-income
communities for 20 years and that didn't
make sense to me it seemed to me from my
own experience that low-income people
knew where every dime went and we're
very good about managing it even though
they often didn't have very good choices
so so then what are these weather what
are the other theories that are out
there well one of them is access right
well poor people don't go to bags
because the banks don't locate in
low-income communities and to some
extent there's validity to that argument
I'm just looking at where I did the
beginning of my research there's one bag
for every 3,000 people in Manhattan and
one for every 20,000 people in the south
in the South Bronx where I did the
beginning of my fieldwork so right there
you know that access is an issue however
if you start walking around and paying
attention to these things you'll find
that that's not the only issue this is a
block in downtown Brooklyn near where I
go to the movies with my kids and you'll
see that on the Left there's a check
cashing store and there's a chase on the
far right on the very same block and
indeed where I worked as a check casher
there was a chase bank about three
blocks away and when I went and worked
in Oakland as a payday lender there were
two other banks on the same to block
commercial strip where I worked and
those businesses did not were not
suffering for business yes
oh sure I can do that right now so check
cashers well they do everything that
payday lenders do so if I were to draw a
Venn diagram let's see so here are check
cashers and here are payday lenders I
think this works so payday lenders
actually it would be more like this
almost all of them do check cashing but
check cashers only do payday loans if
they're allowed to so to make it a
little more simple there are 12 states
in which payday loan lending is illegal
I don't do you know if Massachusetts is
one of them it probably is they tend to
be on the northeast and the reason
they're illegal is that the loans are
too expensive they exceed the usery
rates check cashers take government or
paychecks some sometimes take personal
checks too but they charge an awful lot
for those and they actually charge you
two to cash your check they also do
other things like sending money using
western union or another service to send
money either abroad or within the United
States they say sell prepaid debit cards
where I worked in the South Bronx we
sold metrocards stamps lottery tickets
so they do a lot of things like that it
varies by state this is one of the
really interesting things about this
whole industry is that there's almost no
federal regulation so where I worked in
the South Bronx it was New York State
it's one point nine seven percent of the
face value of the check it can be up to
eight percent for a personal check in
some places and in the West you'll see
that they're more expensive than they
are in the east I were getting paid say
two thousand dollars a month and it was
eight percent if I were going to this
place I would be paying hundred and
sixty dollars a month to cash it where
if I would be going to displace like the
chase just around the corner would be
paying much less like you play pay
nothing if you had a bank account right
I mean I guess bank account do you have
like some Commission's oh so you can see
why the policymaker would say you should
go there instead of there I was like do
it I'm gonna get there it's gonna get
good question you did you have another
question and I'm totally fine with these
kind of clarifying questions if you want
right so location is not the whole part
of the story now so if you do a
literature review and you look at what
people say about these things you'll
find that the academic literature says
they're high cost unscrupulous often
fraudulent that AFS is means alternative
financial services are part of the
poverty industry they there are some
some issues that I would totally take
with them they don't offer savings
accounts they're regulated as something
called money serving businesses and not
banks so there they can't take savings
although interestingly as a side note
the place that I worked in the South
Bronx actually partnered with the credit
union I mentioned before that the woman
who brought this check casher in would
ran a credit union and so you could open
a savings account at the credit union
and deposit money seamlessly into that
account from the check casher which I
thought was quite unique and most people
won't go anywhere near most reputable
businesses don't want to go anywhere
near a check casher or a payday lender
because they fear the reputational risk
of of consorting with those evil people
to deposit into their credit union
correct aid the one point nine seven
percent they're cashing a check but they
could if they're cashing it but they
could simply deposit it if they wanted
to do that transaction fee for that yes
so and the reason be why the credit
union would want a partner is that the
check casher had a lot more outlets so
it made it more convenient so they felt
like it was a win-win for their
customers so so what else they also
talked about the literature also talks
about how use of alternative financial
services results from poor management of
bank accounts so there's a lot of kind
of behavioral sort of talk about the
customers who use these and their voices
are often not really lifted up in the
research as I mentioned before one of
the things that drew me to this topic
was that the you
of alternative financial services is
large and growing and you really see it
happening around the early 90s check
cashing transactions have grown from 45
billion in 1992 58 billion in 2010 and
payday lending transactions have grown
from 10 billion in 2002 30 billion in
2010 even though payday lending stores
are payday lending is illegal in 12 or
13 states there are more payday lending
stores than there are starbucks and
mcdonald's you've heard that I'm John
Oliver maybe if you saw that particular
episode and and so that's pretty
interesting to think about how pervasive
so I found like even though I had done
this literature review i looked at the
fdic reports I couldn't really figure
out the answer to your question is so
why are so many people using these and
what I did about three years after this
man Joe Coleman had come to my class was
I called him and I asked if he'd hire me
as a teller because it seemed like that
was the only way I could get really
close to the problem so I donned a polo
shirt with the logo this is actually the
job I took in Oakland so I worked for
four months once a week so 11 eight-hour
shift a week for four months in the
South Bronx as a teller at a check
casher and then later went to check
center in oakland california where i
worked for two weeks full-time as a as a
lender basically working the same job as
a teller making payday loans and then
worked for a week as a debt collector in
their back office so calling people who
were delinquent on their loans and
really trying to understand why what was
going on for them you know it should
look just it so the work that I'm
presenting today is the culmination of a
whole lot of projects that add up to my
book and just to give you not going to
go deep into all of these but I'm happy
to field questions afterwards perhaps I
call the kind of work that I did
embedded ethnography because it was not
undercover the people were where I
worked knew what I was doing I did a
hundred twenty interviews more than that
with alternative financial services
consumers in both of the places where I
worked after I was done with the job
after those months certain weeks were
over I kind of went to the other side of
the counter and then did one-on-one
interviews with people I did focus
groups with groups of millennial
because they were kind of a specific
group that's experiencing certain kinds
of debt I did an analysis of subprime a
subprime borrowers eight abase so you
may know that most of us get our credit
scores from transunion or experience or
one of these big three credit bureaus
but there's also a set of subprime
credit bureaus that work specifically
with these lenders to help them get a
sense of who their customers were and
that data set has about 50 million
people in it so we did a analysis of the
administrative data we did a survey and
then a set of interviews with borrowers
payday borrowers which give me it gave
me a different perspective not just
behind the counter for the people who
are taking out the loans but the people
who'd taken out a lot of loans I also
know if I put this up here I worked for
about a month as a volunteer on a
hotline called the predatory loan help
hotline which was run by the Virginia
Poverty Law Center and we helped people
who had had trouble paying back their
loans to figure out how to get right on
them and then when I realized that a lot
of the people that I was encountering
and doing these interviews with we're
also doing a lot of things informally
informal loans not just loan sharks but
lending circles I went back to the South
Bronx and spent a few months talking
about those informal financial services
so that's basically the the sum of the
research and what I concluded at the end
of all this is that the consumer
financial services industry is broken
and that consumers are misunderstood so
that's kind of the bottom line but now
I'll tell you a little bit more about
how I got there so in contrast to that
first diagram I showed you with the two
circles what I realized is that the
consumer financial services industry
really consists of these three
intersecting circles mainstream banks
and credit unions the good guys
according to policy makers alternative
which includes kind of good guys and bad
guys payday lenders check cashers pawn
shops etc and then on the informal side
loan sharks money guards roscas are
rotating savings and credit associations
and bail bonds so these were pleat
places that people were keeping or
moving their money that are pretty much
off the radar for policy makers and
invisible to most of us
so money guard is is someone who
informally holds your money for you so
for example I when I did the informal
financial services work in the South
Bronx I met a woman named Blanca who
runs two rotating savings and credit
associations I bet not all of you know
what those are right okay so these are
prolific particularly in immigrant
neighborhoods but I've also noticed them
a lot more recently in work places where
people are not necessarily from the same
ethnic or or immigrant group and so what
it is it's a let's say 10 of us get
together somebody leads the group and we
say that everybody's going to put in a
hundred dollars a week and on each week
in turn a different person gets the pot
so let's say I'm running the group and I
what I get one of the perks i get for
running the group is that I get the
first number so and I might have a small
business like Blanca my informant did
she had an informal gold jewelry
business and so when she got that money
first it was like a loan right because
she's paid enough out a hundred dollars
and she's getting a thousand back so
then Lana's number two in line and
Caroline's number three in line and
you're effectively paying back the loan
every time that you give in to the group
and the last person in line sometimes
those people like to be the last person
because it forces them to save and not
only does it give them some discipline
and saving but sometimes particularly in
low-income neighborhoods and networks
there's a lot of pressure on people not
to coat not to save money because once
you build up a nest egg there's a lot of
pressure from your friends and relatives
to get access to that and if you've put
it in this rasca then it's kind of it's
insulated and it's safe there are
actually two hundred names for these
organizations worldwide tandas consorcio
associados k's and there they're all
over the place in asia africa and latin
america and all of those different
groups have brought them to the US and
now they're spreading and becoming more
mainstream so that's super interesting
so Blanca the woman who ran the risk is
that I looked at also operated as a
money guard so sometimes people would
say like I got my money but I don't want
to have it yet because I'm worried you
know my husband Gamble's and he'll fine
didn't take it or somebody else will
spend it or ask it if I don't have it so
Blanca even though a lot of those people
are unbanked Blanca had accounts at two
bank accounts and so sometimes people
would even deposit money for that for
the rosca into one of her bank accounts
in order to save informally so it was
this really interesting if you think
about you know what I'm especially
interested in are these intersecting
parts of the circles right so you know I
have some drawings I can show you later
if we have time that show how Blanca
somebody in Blanco circle is using the
mainstream as consumer financial
services component in order to save
informally which is kind of bizarre but
really interesting Carolyn just like
bringing it to our house most
convenience or Oh an account well part
of it is that it forces them to save and
believe it or not I mean one of the
reasons that people don't go to bags is
that they don't trust the banks they
trust even though there's a risk of
Blanca taking their money and we found
people participating these groups where
that it happened they're not getting
interest they're not building a credit
score but they still trust the people
that they know better right so that it's
a huge huge issue so I also found that
there were four things that the people
who came to my teller window really
valued and those are the things I'll
walk through right now the first was
lower cost and greater liquidity so when
you hear criticisms of the alternative
financial services industry the thing
that you'll hear most is that they're
expensive right everybody like raised
their eyebrows when I said it was
fifteen dollars per hundred to borrow or
even almost two percent to cash your
check so I was really surprised myself
when people told me I don't go to the
bank because it's expensive here are a
couple of quotes from my interviews the
guy named Zeke who said I'd like to go
back to the bank but I can't afford the
monthly charges he had been a a chef at
JFK Airport working in food services
lost his job and during that interim
period between when he lost that job and
got another job as a janitor he couldn't
keep up with the monthly charges of the
bank account his balance was so low that
there was no buffer Maria
a home health aide said it was like I
just kept paying more and more and in
fact what you'll see if you look at the
growth in fees you don't have to
actually even see the small print on
these except mostly the direction of the
trend lines is that in that period from
the mid to late 90s to the present bank
fees have gone up and up ATM fees have
gone up monthly service charges have
gone up overdraft fees have gone way up
you've bailed the availability of free
checking accounts has gone way down 75%
of non-interest bearing checking
accounts were free in 2009 and only two
years later in 2011 only forty percent
of those accounts were free so that's a
huge drop and a huge change in the
product that we think of as being pretty
standard the other thing that I found
was that it was not only cost but
liquidity so when you see somebody
paying two percent of the value of their
check to pay to get the cash a lot of
what they're paying for is the fact that
they can get that money immediately if
they deposit that if they had a bank
account and they deposited into their
account it would take three or four days
to clear and in the meantime the bills
are due they need to buy food and
there's no money to kind of float them
during that time so those three or four
days are critical and I'll tell you a
couple of stories that really illustrate
that there was a guy who came to my
window he actually came in pretty often
and that's one of the things you see at
check cashers and payday lenders is that
unlike banks where we rarely go to the
teller window people come in weekly
sometimes more so you really get to know
your customers and you see what their
patterns of usage are Carlos was a small
contractor you could tell because he
would come in and his work clothes and
his like painted up coveralls and things
and one day he came in and he he pushed
a five-thousand-dollar check under my
window I cashed it and I gave him four
thousand nine hundred and three dollars
or something like that and there was it
was like a 97 dollar fee he took the
money past a ten-dollar bill back
through my window which was my tip which
is not uncommon and
after he left you know this was one of
the one of the ways in which I really
realized that even though I was coming
in and putting myself in this position I
didn't always understand why people were
doing what they were doing so I turned
to the teller who had trained me and I
said he's gotta have a bank account
right i mean this guy is running a small
business she's not among the on bang in
here and leaving a hundred dollars on
the table and with my kind of
middle-class assumptions i thought could
have taken his wife out to dinner he
could have put it in a college account
for his kids you know he could have
invested in his business and christina
turned to me and she said like well Lisa
today is Thursday which means tomorrow
is Friday probably his workers around
documented because most of the you know
day laborers in New York City are and he
needs to pay his guys on Friday so if he
puts that five thousand dollars into his
bank it's not going to clear before
payday or maybe he just got a job and
this was the down payment on the job and
he only reason he got the job is that he
can start tomorrow and he needs to buy
supplies so he could go right to the
lumber yard with that money and get the
job started so these are really rational
reasons why someone would go to the
check casher and yet it's not without
understanding these stories that you can
really see it another story that
illustrates this liquidity issue was a
woman who who came with her EBT card we
have these electronic benefits transfer
cards and that's one of the things you
can do is add a check casher as you can
swipe the card and you can take money
out so I did that all the time and then
you know usually it was $63 or 120
dollars or whatever and it was a two
dollar fee no matter how much you were
taking out and the day that a woman came
in and had ten dollars in her account I
once again raised my eyebrows and
thought why is she paying two dollars
which is twenty percent of what's on her
card to get that eight dollars and again
I asked one of my co-workers who said we
can't get eight dollars out of an ATM
you can't get thirteen dollars or twenty
seven dollars or any autumn mound and
she needed every dollar she could get as
soon as she could get it so she was
willing to pay a very high price so
these are not hidden fees they're very
obvious in order to get every dollar but
she had access to you right then yeah is
it correlated to thank consolidation yes
and I'll get to that it definitely is so
there it is why is banking there you're
uh she's a plant in the audience so why
is banking becomes so much more
expensive and there's a lot of reasons
right one is bad consolidation and so
you'll see that during this period
especially of the 70s and the 80s bigger
banks were buying up smaller bags in a
kind of game of pac-man and so a lot of
the people I talked to said like I used
to really like my bank but it's changed
names four or five times and I don't
even know anybody who who belongs there
anymore the other thing that starts
happening and this is also related to
deregulation these three bullets are
kind of overlapping they're not mutually
exclusive is that with deregulation that
begins in the 70s and goes through the
80s banks are able to do more so so
glass-steagall which you've probably
heard about it if you don't know much
about it you still heard about it
invoked during the Democratic debates a
lot of people are saying Bernie Sanders
included we need to put put back
glass-steagall well that was a law that
was passed in the wake of the depression
that separated investment in commercial
banking so really limited what banks
could do and so for this long period
between really a depression in the 70s
banking was pretty boring bankers were
not ultra rich in fact it was called it
was telling Alanna that's earlier the
363 era of banking which meant that you
got three percent interest on your
savings accounts you were charged six
percent interest on loans and beggars
could get to the golf course by three
o'clock in the afternoon so that doesn't
really happen anymore so with
deregulation and gramm-leach-bliley and
the repeal of glass-steagall they were
able then to kind of participate in
these risky investments that they hadn't
been able to do since the pre depression
time so suddenly this commercial banking
and customer service looked a lot was a
lot less profitable compared to the
other things that they could do and the
attitude with deregulation changes as
well so that whereas before and if you
looked at Louis Brandeis Supreme Court
justice Woodrow Wilson Thomas jeffer
and they all really felt like banking
was a part of the public infrastructure
almost like the railroads and that it
needed there needed to be a system for
the economy to run and that bankers had
a kind of a responsibility to serve
people equally well that changes so that
note the nature of that government bank
relationship changes from being one
where bankers are really supposed to
serve people to one where its
profitability and efficiency that are
that are valued more I had people when I
was doing a lot of interviews with
people in Washington so one of the
things that happens during this pot this
time is that's when fee income in the
80s starts to really grow part of it is
because if interest rates being really
volatile and to some extent the
government is saying like you guys need
to figure out a more stable way to make
money well bankers then discovered
things like overdraft which they used to
hate to do they felt like it was an
inconvenience but then they suddenly
realized that they could make a lot of
money out of it and in fact I think the
last year they made 38 billion dollars
in overdraft fees most of it from lower
income customers so people told there's
a there's a an organization called
Haberfeld which is a consulting
organization which basically went around
to the banks and said here's what you
need to do to maximize the money that
you're getting from fees people called
it the goldmine of checking somebody
else that banker said it's like a drug
once you get this it's like a drug it's
like it's addictive so Bangz kind of
discovered it and then even the
community banks that didn't want to do
it felt pressured because that became
the business model for banks so this
graph which is pretty simple just shows
the rise in the number of payday lending
stores over the same period really which
is the blue line and the downward slope
this is bad consolidation is the number
of bags that have less than a hundred
million dollars in assets that's a small
bank the next slide shows the change in
the number of banks with more than 10
billion dollars in assets so right now
the top four banks hold about half of
the assets in the country right so
there's been a huge change in terms of
the consolidation of wealth and power in
the largest bags and that's a big reason
why we have the situation that we're in
I think I covered this already that Bank
government social contract changes the
bank business model also changes so you
get non banks entering the picture like
mutual funds and things people started
moving their money out of banks in the
70s and 80s to save in different ways I
talked about the greater reliance on fee
income and pernicious practices which I
didn't necessarily talk about but I'll
talk about briefly right now so banks do
a couple of different things that that
are not necessarily in consumers best
interest one is something called hi lo
debe tree sequencing which means that
let's say you have a hundred dollars in
your bank account and three different
things hit your bag on the same day what
a bill for $75 one for 50 and one for
125 dollars so what the banks will do
they have a software program that
reorders those those transactions that
are hitting your account so that rather
than having the 50 or the $75 one hit
first which would create two overdraft
fees right they have $125 one hit first
which gives them three overdraft fees
right so there are programs that do that
to maximize how much money they're
making from you they also take money out
of your account seven days a week but
they only put money in five days a week
so there are these little things that
happen on a routine basis that were not
common practices 50 years ago but now
they are and so when Joe Coleman who was
that my boss the head of the check
casher in the South Bronx talked to me
he he made it very clear what the
difference in the business model is he
said banks want one customer with a
million dollars right they don't really
care about having lots of people are
acquiring new customers check cashers
want a million customers with one dollar
so the very nature in which they make
money is very different right the bank's
really want people coming people that
put their money there and leave it and
not bother them very much where the
check cashers want you coming in over
and over again and they're making a
small amount of money on every
transaction I'm confused by the bank's
wanting one customer with the mill
in dollars that customer would never
have any overdraft fees well that's
right so but but in general that that
the overdraft fees are kind of the the
way that they make money off of people
who wouldn't they wouldn't make money on
anyway right so they're really making a
lot of their money over wealthier
customers who don't bother them very
much right but it's sort of like if I'm
going to serve you relatively poor
person the only way I'm going to do that
is if i charge you through the nose
right so and they actually you know they
don't do check cashing services they
don't do all these other things because
they actually really don't want those
people they don't feel like they make
very much Mary my pleasure may wonder if
do you have something that that shows a
break in terms of how much money they're
making off the wealthy patron or wealthy
customer compared to the money they're
made I don't but I wonder if I could get
that data it would be really good data
to get I mean you see that each of the
all of the big banks have these like
chased private climate client citigold
right they have special services for if
you get say fifty thousand dollars or
more you get a lot of free stuff then
but but this middle group and the lower
income group doesn't so let me move on
to the next thing the second thing that
people valued a lot and that was
transparency so one of the things that
you may or may not realize when you get
a checking account is that you get
something called the disclosure
agreement you get I mean there's like
these documents that you click agree on
all the time on your computer without
ever reading them has anybody who ever
be it rad their bank check checking
account disclosure agreement you have
congratulations I no longer have a bank
I should talk to you after right leaving
bank of america are you ready okay big
fight with them about some fees but it
sounds like a good story ok normal
regulator so yeah i'm not a bank i have
financial yeah yeah yeahs bank account
yeah um so anybody have any idea how
large how long these are how many pages
excited just tiny group 44 pages long on
average they used it just about five
years ago they were 110 pages but
they've gotten a little simpler so you
know nobody
going to read that right so transparency
is a big issue and you know a lot of
times regulators say that the answer to
transparency is disclosure but if
disclosure means a 44-page agreement
it's not that transparent the other
thing that's really interesting is to
just think about the experience of
walking into a bank and imagining that
you did not go there as a child like I
did with my parents you know I I can
walk into this place and recognize it
because I was going there since I could
walk and yet if you look at it through
the eyes of a newbie or maybe an
immigrant you'll see that there is
absolutely nothing there that tells you
what's for sale what the comparison
between products is I mean I like to
think of the analogy to say a store what
if you walked into a clothing store and
said like I need a pair of black pants
you know what they're going to bring you
a pair out of the back and you have to
you know there's no ability to really
and if you didn't have the the knowledge
of what to expect you wouldn't even know
what questions to ask so even a
relatively friendly architectural space
can be very intimidating the contrast is
the place where I worked in the South
Bronx right check where it almost looks
like a fast-food restaurant with the
with the menus you know spanning the
teller windows and it tells you in big
print that it costs a dollar fifty to
send it to pay a bill eighty-nine cents
for a money order which is less than the
post office charges one point nine seven
percent to cash a check so you know
right there what you're paying for every
transaction and it's very clear and that
clarity and transparency gives customers
a lot of comfort that they know how much
they're spending it's the money's not
going to come out of some account on a
day that they don't expect and there's
nothing tricky about it and I saw a lot
of people come in with their checks cash
the checks have that pile of money and
then they would lay their bills out in
front of them and apportion the money to
the different bills not always paying
every bill in full either so they would
have that money and they would say like
okay how much do I have to pay my
electric company to keep my electricity
from getting turned off or how much do I
have to pay the phone company to not
have them bother me and I better pay my
rent in full otherwise I'll get evicted
so there was this kind of managing of
the money and whatever was left was how
much they had until they got paid again
and that was a very kind of
visual and easy way for people to manage
their money and the check casher really
helped that the third thing was better
service and you know this photo which is
a kind of a stock photo from one of the
training manuals that I got when I was
doing the work that I did kind of
illustrates the way that the teller was
supposed to approach the customer she's
got an open and friendly posture her
workspace is clean she's smiling and I
went to some customer trainings where I
was taught all of these things so
another page out of my training manual I
went to an all day training at the check
of the payday lender this was called the
hamburger model of customer service and
we were supposed to kind of the bun you
know bracket the transaction with the
bun of personal information and one of
the things I noticed immediately when I
walked into both both businesses on my
first days was that the tellers need the
customers by name and in fact we were
instructed and the payday lender to use
the customers name three times during
every transaction so it was very
specific in fact the tellers who I
worked with at the check casher had both
been there for 10 years so they were
familiar faces people knew them people
trusted them and there was a much
greater effort I think to make sure that
that customer service was in place
because you know in in general they're
offering pretty standardized services so
the service is the differentiator and
they put a high premium on that it's
professor experience it seems like
pencil for war service but do you know
that they don't have similar training
and they done I don't know that they
don't have similar training but I can
tell you that you know was all I can say
is that when people talk to me about
their service they definitely said that
they felt like they were treated a
certain way here and that they were
treated poorly at the bank and I don't
know if that's just I don't I suspect
that it's not just lower income people
although i think my theory is that there
was a premium on that kind of treatment
in lower-income neighborhoods and that's
partly because you know i mean think
about the way that you all walk through
the world i'm sure you're treated with a
fair amount of respect right you work in
this nice building they give you free
drinks and a nice office you know Here I
am being taken out to dinner I'm staying
in a nice hotel just
because I'm out the hotel they're very
you know nice to me right whereas the
people who are coming they to the check
casher have to take the subway which
mayor and it may not always run very
well there there you know in the New
York City Public Housing Authority which
is a bear to kind of deal with so
they're not necess they're probably
working low end jobs where they don't
get a whole lot of respect so if you
have a place in your life where you're
treated as a valued and respected
customer it means more to you I think
then you know I I would say that most
people that I know of my sort of status
feel like they kind of put up with the
poor service they get at their bank
because what are you gonna do right but
it doesn't have the same kind of premium
that it would I suspect you're right in
knee in the effect i think it would be
really fascinating to find out whether
like a traditional bank the teller
training has any discussion about
customer service because I wonder if it
even is there's a different notion of
customer service that's supposed to be
me I don't intrude on your personal yeah
there's another angry right right I
don't you know I simply make the
transaction clean and simple say hello I
sick of our and there's no like that
that the other version would actually be
seen as intrusive intrusive different
audience perhaps yeah that's a really
interesting question um but I'll tell
you one way in which it one story about
which how it played out at the check
casher so there's a woman who came in
one day who's a Puerto Rican woman in
her 50s who had a government check to
deposit and I looked her up on my screen
we had like records for everybody and
this message popped up that I hadn't
seen before that said that she needed to
pay us twenty dollars every time she
came in and I'd never seen that
particular message so I asked for help
and the woman next to me said like Oh
Marta last time she came in her
check was bad so what would have
happened if she'd gone to a bank they
would have sent back the check and
probably charged her for that they would
have charged whoever she tried to use
the check with if she had tried to write
a check from it and maybe even kind of
you know you get Lee's black ticks when
you do things like that at a bank that
can put you into the system called check
systems that boots you out of the whole
banking system for about seven years
we're about a million low-income people
now who can't get a bank account if they
want to in the United States because of
these systems so what do we did with
Margit so Martha then says
her name she said I can't actually pay
you the twenty dollars today because so
they had made this arrangement rather
than kind of booting her out that she
could just pay twenty dollars a week
every time she came in and that would
and then until the check was made up
without charging her anything extra and
she said I can't do it today I've had
this unexpected expense so the other
teller just pressed a few buttons cashed
her check for the whole amount minus the
fee and let her go right so there was
this flexibility also with working with
a person's individual situation instead
of kind of just saying these are the
rules I can't do anything I can't help
you and so Martha's going to leave the
bag and she's gonna check casher and
she's going to say wow this place is
great they worked with me to help me out
you know how many of you have ever left
your bank and just like come back to
work raving about the service you got
right not it doesn't happen very often
how much flexibility what keshia's get
22 I mean because I can imagine working
at bank they've got a lot of rules about
what I couldn't do maybe I'm connex
different when he told oh right I you
know I think so the woman who was able
to do that had been there for a long
time and she was so I think the farther
up you go and the more experience you
had you'd be empowered to do some things
like that I couldn't have done it
because I was new and I wouldn't have
known the consequences but there's a
level of trust like most senior
employees at places you know you've all
run into those people at the airlines
are in stores who could take back
something that you return 32 days passed
even though the policy says 30 it is
right so there's usually a way around
the rules but but you don't always have
find it in financial services is it I at
some point when we talked I feeling it
was part of your argument here that that
these check cashers and haiti letters
were often kind of more like
medium-sized chain businesses rather
than like too big to fail and controlled
in banks and that there was more
institutional flexibility right right i
think that happens right so they're
still there there's been consolidation
in these industries but nothing like
what happens in banks and the fact that
they're still making their money off of
all these transactions means that that
kind of service is really important
so how did customers show their
appreciation loyalty that was the most
important thing probably you'd see the
same people coming out back over and
over again probably i would say loan
repayment at the at the payday lender
right i mean you're the theoretically
you're more likely to pay somebody back
when you have a relationship with them
when i know you by name and know where
you work and when you go on vacation and
also these tips i mentioned the tip i
got from that contractor $10 was a lot
just to say but some of the tellers i
worked with could make forty or fifty
dollars a day in tips people brought us
would know how we took our coffee and
bring coffee and for us in the morning
the woman who trained me was very
pregnant when I came on board and after
she had her baby people would just drop
off baby gifts and asked how she was so
these kinds of things were happening
that made it a certain kind of community
space that I wouldn't say I've ever seen
happening at a bank how long that have
been a practice how standard and just
have established that was is of the
tipping particularly but oh they said I
mean certainly since the tellers that I
had worked with were there which was ten
years you know so it was just really I
think I mean the first time it happened
to me I didn't know what was happening
and I was like pushing I was pushing the
money back and then they were pushing
into me and I thought no no it's
your--it's I counted right so and I got
fewer tips because I was new I was also
the neighborhood I was working in into
South Bronx was mostly Spanish speaking
and I don't look not Latino in Spanish
speaks Spanish but it's not my first
language so I think people would look at
me and go like I don't sure if I should
trust her or if she'll speak my language
but but once people kind of got to know
me then they trusted me too so I think
it was it was really people saw it as
like you gave me good service I'm going
to give you a little something back but
it was a pretty standard practice not
everybody it there were certainly no I
don't think people feel felt obligated
to do it the way you might in a
restaurant but a lot of people did to
some people that I interviewed use the
language of family it's like we're
family we know all of them know we know
all the tellers and people would tell me
stories about what that meant to them so
the last thing that that is important is
the availability of fast credit
obviously this is at the payday lender
at the check casher and there have been
changes in credit markets that have
happened at the same time and since
these other changes of deregulation and
bank fees going up etc so over the
course of this period definitions of
what's good and bad debt have shifted it
used to be that good debt was only kind
of debt that you use to make investments
whether it's for to pay for college or
graduate school or buy a house or
something like that and over time it's
been except much more acceptable to use
credit cards and things to pay for
everyday goods and services and so
there's been a bleeding of what good and
bad credit is and credit worthiness has
also shifted so that we see a lot more
people who at least before about 19
before the financial crisis who were
qualifying for credit than used to so
the people who could get a credit card
that pool became much broader in the
1970s and 80s a lot of states repealed
their interest caps which made payday
lending possible which meant that these
lenders could come in and charge a whole
lot and then the availability of used in
credit expands and then it contracts
post-crisis so you had this huge
expansion at the same time that you also
see other things happening which I'll
talk about in a second like declining
wages and income volatility and then
suddenly the credit gets pulled back and
people are really stuck so this is the
drop in in the supply of consumer credit
between just between 2007 and 2010 so
before and after the crisis you see all
this credit pulled off the market and
for that's one of the reasons why you
see this huge shift to people using
payday loans because they need the
credit and they can't get in anywhere
else so here is you know and and one of
the things that people when people think
about overdraft fees they think about it
as kind of a fee but not alone when in
fact a lot of the time people are using
overdraft as a kind of a short-term loan
right so during the same period you see
both spending on payday loans and
overdraft fees going up a lot compared
these two credit card fees because
credit cards are also former borrowing
right that's right and their fees are
horrendous yeah they are it depends on
that it depends on the fee you know it
obviously
depends on the card and there any
interest rates yeah I mean there's some
it would have to be a little bit of
apples to oranges just because you can
keep a balance on a credit card so you
mean but but yeah you could do that
comparison I haven't done it one to one
but if you just look even at payday
loans and overdraft so the payday
lenders are required to post their apr's
Daniel percentage rates and they're you
know people get crazy because they're
about four hundred percent but if you
looked if you turned an overdraft into a
short-term loan it would be about five
thousand percent yeah what is the rate
at which people don't pay back their
payday loans just could you offer this
service at a much lower rate well that's
a really good question I mean uh it
depends on the lender the data is not
like universally available I think at
least two-thirds to three-quarters of
the people that I at the play the chain
that I worked out which was another
small chain I don't know if I mentioned
that about 13 stores in California paid
back their loans on time but what
happens is that a lot of the people a
lot of the people take out a loan and
they don't pay it back so definitions
even if repayment or a little shifty
because at this particular place for
example let's say you took out a two
hundred and fifty dollar loan you had to
pay back that loan before you could take
out another one but people would often
pay it back and take another one out
right away so it would look like an
on-time paid loan but in effect it's an
extension of a loan in other places you
can actually roll it over meaning i'm
not going to pay it back but I then and
when you take it out again you pay a
whole nother set of fees right so it's
the same loan really for longer but
you're taking out your another set of
fees fifteen dollars per hundred if
didn't notice but it's basically just to
break even if there is no interested is
that all you need at least eighty five
percent of the people to pay it back
right right right but the thing is it's
not so much it's nice it's not just the
paying back that makes them the money
it's the fees so you actually it's the
people who are rolling over those loans
a lot who were subsidizing the people
who are paying at
right away right so payday lenders will
say that that's not their business model
right that they it's and and this is
what consumer advocates get bent out of
shape about as they say you're you're
actually selling a product that's
designed to be a two-week loan that
people are keeping out for three months
or six months right and so that's where
a lot of the controversy comes in the
problem is that there's not really an
alternative for many of those people
right and yeah so I just have thought
about like a fifth explanation for why
people are doing this and this is
Michael an area of research some x rays
this but like concerns over surveillance
so people on tana for example like they
avoid having a bank account because
they're worried about getting rendered
ineligible for sure that's right set
limits for people child support or
getting liens on their income so they
don't do direct deposit or like people
involved in the criminal justice system
they have legal financial applications
and stuff you know eighty percent of
people process through there right have
LFOs and then if you have fifty percent
of black men being arrested by the agent
right three maybe that like concern over
surveillance and disproportionate
involvement in those kind of like
systems contributes to some of the rink
that's some of it am i okay i know i'ma
like going over on timeout am i okay cuz
i'm taking questions and stuff are you
guys fine yeah some people may I don't
have that much left to do but if I'm
gonna I mean I don't mind taping
questions so i'll tell you one just one
quick story after Carlos the contractor
came in and I was like scratching my
head about why he brought in this 500
$5,000 check we had a leak in our roof
at home and our contractor came over and
I you know he's got like a pretty big
business and trucks with his logo on
them and all this kind of stuff and I
said Tom like can you help me understand
why this guy would take out we have a
check out I was like you don't use check
cashers and he goes like I have
accounted three of them he says nobody
does their business totally aboveboard
in New York you can't do it with the
with the insurance &amp;amp; worker's comp and
everything you know and he said the only
that what changes is the contractors
appetite for risk so you will everyone
is hiding some of their income and it's
the thing is it's easier to hide that
income when you're at a check casher
than it is going to a bag it's just
harder to dig it up and make sense of it
so so a lot of people are doing
that's so that's another reason even
though they have bank accounts too so
there's this kind of obfuscation like
recently surveilling looks you know like
now that check cashers take photo yeah
yeah we took photos of everybody but
yeah so at the same time this is kind of
a last piece this is important to
understand is that while all these
changes have been going on in financial
services the context in which people
make financial decisions is also
changing and those changes have resulted
in a much broader group of people who
are using these services so when I went
into this research I was looking at low
income people in poor neighborhoods and
I quickly realized that it wasn't just
low income people in poor neighborhoods
who were using these services and who
were living in kind of economically
financially precarious situations whoops
so this underserved demographic is
expanding its because of declining real
wages income volatility doubled it's
much harder to predict from month to
month or even from week to week how much
money is coming into your household
there's been this kind of what Jacob
pepper hacker calls the great risk shift
whereas a lot of risk used to be taken
on by the private and public sectors and
it's been shifted to individuals we all
know the student debt problem and what I
found actually in some research i did
with big data from a subprime borrower
is that among payday borrowers the
fastest growing group is what I would
call the new non-prime groups of people
whose credit credit scores had dropped
quite recently in the last year from
prime to subprime twenty percent of them
made over fifty thousand dollars a year
net one-third were homeowners and
forty-three percent had a college degree
so these are not the kind of people that
you think of when you think about doing
research in the South Bronx it's a very
different population which makes this
research I think and the findings more
important on a broader level a couple of
quotes just from people that I
interviewed that are illustrative of
some of the mood out there this is a
woman who was a master's level student
in nonprofit management who had been in
the army and she was a graduate student
she had owned her home and she said I
actually managed to make my mortgage
even when I was unemployed because I had
renters in my house and I was managing
to come up with the extra
my credit score was the last thing I let
go of I lost everything else but I had a
780 that was the very last thing I let
go of then when I like of that I was
like I don't have kids I never plan on
getting married I never want to buy
another house I'm buying my next car
with cash so yeah my parents had the
American dream good for them never going
to be for me and I don't want it anymore
so it's a stratum of these shifting
expectations for younger people about
what's possible even with an education
you also saw a dramatic increase in the
subprime population before and after the
crisis 17 million people dropped from
prime to subprime during that period so
then that means they're getting less
access to credit and paying more for the
credit that they can access another man
who is a 57-year old grandfather in
Dallas who had had a job as a computer
technician for the government lost it
and then only 15 years later did he make
enough money to get to the same level
he'd been at before he took it ended up
taking out a lot of payday loans and had
medical debt too he said so many things
happen but there's just very limited
options I had to do it because of
situations that came up the problem is
if you have to go through non-standard
ways of getting that money you pay such
an exorbitant amount and you've probably
made it more difficult for yourself to
get caught back up so what does this all
mean I think there's a few things one is
reframing the debate I think this kind
of bank to unbanked underbanked
framework is lived its useful life and
it's not that helpful anymore it also
stigmatizes people and I think we need
to shift from that debate to thinking
about financial health and financial
justice what does it take to get allow a
much broader people range of people to
achieve financial health terms of things
that can happen transparency is in
really easy fix there's a lot of
innovation out there but smart
regulation is needed to bring that
innovation to market and the other
pieces that we really need to address
those macro problems about income
stability about the safety net so many
people that I interviewed that were
payday borrowers had medical debt and
that's why they were taking out their
loans for example so those things will
be really critical as we move forward
and finally
next January you'll be able to buy the
book and maybe I'll come back but thank
you so much for your really good
questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
