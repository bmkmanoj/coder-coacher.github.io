smarter child and active buddy and sort
of what's changed what hasn't if you are
creating today what would you do
differently um we talked about how the
main change is in server and computing
power that's not really challenge
anymore in terms of scaling the chat bot
and we said what's the one thing you
would do if you were building today and
that answer was pretty interesting it
was I would hire as many writers as I
could and so really stressing how chat
bots are an editorial content problem
rather than a technical problem so I
guess he had 11 writer at the time who's
really good and crafted a compelling
personality but he'd really hire a ton
of different writers we also talked
about why hasn't there been a bot yet
today that's as viral or popular smarter
child and we sort of theorized that it
was a lack of blue ocean so he sort of
reinforced from his talk how do you find
a blue ocean where they're less BOTS and
sort of go viral from there am I missing
anything Barney we talked about the
litter raiders of the lost ark and where
Microsoft hides acquired technology that
was really awesome many years ago that's
about oh yeah we talked about sex box um
Monica those like better for the
monetization conversation probably but
yeah I mean our data is the same we see
sixty percent of people trying to have
sex with the bottom n czyli it's like
fundamental part of human nature so
there you go oh that was interesting to
everyone said seems like there aren't
any killer use cases yet and the
communities really focused on generating
platforms everyone wants to build a
platform and tools and this was sort of
called may be a lazy approach and
instead he urged everyone to focus on
building BOTS find the companies that
need BOTS where it's going to disrupt
their business or create that company
that needs a bot but build a bot build
the content stop focusing so much on the
tools there's 50 platforms here you know
what's a successful platform company</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
