you
buenos dias buenos dias a todos Y
bienvenidos a esta primera session del
dia con nuestra tercera presentation
planaria del Falco tisa met es un gran
placer para me Day present era dr. Anand
an el director de Microsoft Research
India the auras Moreau permiten we are
continually English and continue in
English thank you it's a great pleasure
for me to introduce and undone with the
managing director of Microsoft Research
India Anand on was awarded the title of
distinguished scientist in 2010 and the
title of distinguished scientist is
awarded to very few at Microsoft he got
that title in recognition of his
contributions to Microsoft and the
broader community and undone on the
research side Anand on beat one of the
world's strongest research teams in
computer vision and video processing he
did that actually while in redmond
prayer to go into india by doing some
pioneering research in video motion
analysis he was recognized for
fundamental contributions in the areas
of optical flow motion estimation video
mazikeen and 3d scene analysis really
avant-garde a lap time but not only that
not only not only did he do great
research he also served at that time as
microsoft research university relations
program director in india as part of
that role he built strong relationships
between indian universities and
microsoft he also worked with government
and was part for example of the 12th
Planning Commission to make
recommendations on India's higher
education policy so it's a great
pleasure to have Anand and talk to us
today about transforming education
through technology please let's welcome
an undone
thanks Evelyn you know so the when I
first came here this morning there were
not many people I thought we should give
them some incentives I assume you all
know what you're getting at the end of
the talk or something like that and as
listening to the music it's like lounge
music in an upscale hotel so now bring
out your martinis and relax the talk
should be fun okay so I'm going to talk
about transforming education through
technology you know in the last 20 years
50 years maybe even hundred years
technology has changed every aspect of
how we live our we communicate with
people how we travel how we do shopping
but one area that until now has resisted
this kind of change is actually
education we still go to classrooms like
we used to 50 years ago or 100 years ago
sit in lecture theatres with 100
students I know maybe more sometimes and
we have you know people talking for one
hour on to us right they talk to us they
show slides these days maybe they use
PowerPoint but basically it's the same
as it was 100 years ago I mean of course
we do laboratory what we always did but
you know we are coming to a point where
children are able to get what they want
not from the classrooms but from the
resources that are online I asked my
children they're both in college now
what did they learn in high school they
said no they learned everything on the
internet so you know that's telling now
some things are changing right this is
you know as the technology climate is
changing but there are more important
factors that are actually involved which
are going to fundamentally transform the
way education is going to be conducted
in the future I heard you know the
minister speak yesterday about education
as a priority for Chile and you know
increasing the quantity and the quality
of education so that you know people can
be more productive for the industry and
that's not really true of Chile it's
from everywhere in the world if you look
at developing developed countries for
example the us take an example the cost
of education has dramatically gone up so
the curve one in you know like blew up
is the cost of education
over the last 30 years and the one in
dark blue is the cost of housing and I
mean you know 20 30 years ago education
didn't cost that much you could offer to
buy a house or you can send your kid to
college and now you can afford to buy a
house you can have offered to buy two
houses but you can't afford to send your
kid to college and these numbers are you
know much more real when you look at it
then amount of students you know
students in the u.s. especially take
loans in many countries of course you
know the government subsidizes education
it's not so true in the US and the
amount the students loan loans
outstanding is 914 billion dollars more
than the credit card let debt that's
outstanding in the country i mean this
is you know this is the future so
basically all these kids when they grow
up when they graduate they have to spend
the rest of their life paying back for
the education that they got and
government is not subsidizing education
as much as I used to again this is us
developed country and you can see the
percentage change in government subsidy
for education according to different
states in the US and much more is below
the line then above the line so you
don't even have to see this very
detailed now that's okay but now let's
take a country like d I'm sure most of
you know what country this is there
anyone here who doesn't know which
country anyway so if you take country
like India which is probably somewhat
similar to Chile in its state of
economic development what you see is
that we have humongous number of
students four million engineering
students that are in colleges at any
given time now four million may not be
the number in Chile I'm the population
of Chile is probably of you know 17 or
18 million which is less than Bombay
heading as far as I know but four
million out of which this is you know
say 1 million graduate every year with
engineering degrees and we have about
5,000 colleges 50,000 faculty that's 80
students per faculty this is impossible
you know there's no way we can produce
give the kind of quality education for
students and there's no way we can
afford to do that in the economic
pressures that the country faces but
clearly the industry is demanding this
much you know talent and and so you know
something we have to do now the other
part is that people aren't so sure
anymore whether education is actually
worth it if you ask you know people who
provide education
obviously they think well because it's
their business if you are a teacher
you're going to say it's important but
if you log talk to the employers not
meant not many of them agree that you
know college education is actually
giving the value that it needs to from
an industry point of view and clearly
youth the students are not so convinced
anymore and this is pretty dangerous
because you know we are going into a
mode or a generation where people are
not valuing learning like they used to
now again if I go to India when we go to
the IT industry and ask how is
employability only seventeen percent of
those 1,000,000 students that graduate
or considered employable by the IT
industry and I think we have had numbers
like another twenty percent could be
trained within one or two years that
still leaves more than 50 person who the
industry considers are not employable
after four years of college education
specializing in the subject now these
are pretty dramatic times right now the
solution is been at our doorstep all
this time we didn't have to look very
far if we are capable of leveraging
technology for every other aspect of
life why not education and the kind of
factors I mean everybody is connected
you know internet however flaky you are
you know internet connectivity maybe it
still is there and pretty much anyone
can access any type of content anywhere
as long as it's open and it's not
protected now you know people people
like our kids I mean many of you here
look like hair kids they know how to use
these devices anytime devices anywhere
devices they know them much more than
how we know how to use them and they
know how to use them much more than they
know how to read a book and they're much
more comfortable and they're much more
capable of doing things with it now even
in a place like India right I mean you
know we have 1 billion people not all of
them are computers very few of them do
but the value of technology and
computers as a part of education and
learning are already known to children
to others so this we have access we have
access we have access to content we have
you know people with that you know basic
skills needed to use them they don't
need to be they are all computer
literate much more so than their parents
are now how do we do the transformation
so this is a very good condition you
know we have a need in terms of what is
needed in terms of
quality and quantity of education we
have the pressure economic pressure that
we cannot actually educate people at the
rate at which they need to be educated
and we have technology that perhaps can
help so how can it help now here's one
one thing to think about you know if you
go beyond before the Industrial
Revolution 300-400 years back education
was not done in large schools they were
not large schools there were skills and
you know taught by you know people
through apprentices that went to work
with them and an in-depth knowledge
right so education was very tailored to
the individual students had very
specific mentorship and a curriculum
that suited for their pace their need
now come Industrial Revolution we have
to educate a lot more people so we
create these big schools send them
everyone to one place all of a sudden
learning is not about the person who's
learning it's about the place where
learning occurs namely classroom so the
last you know 200-plus years education
has been classroom centric but now we
have an opportunity right to change it
because we can take content to every
student and work in the pace in which
that they can we have potentially a way
in which learning can be enhanced to
tailor to the students need at the pace
with which the student can go and give
the special courses or whatever that
they need and not something very
generally yet this is not yet happen I'm
not suggesting that this is already
happening but this is the threshold
where we are right and if given the
excitement if we don't do this in the
next five to ten years we would have
missed a tremendous opportunity and lost
a lot of people to you know to train so
technology can invent new pedagogies
right it can be about what's called
flipped classroom you don't have to use
the classroom to listen to boring one
hour long lectures you do that at home
and then you come to the classroom to
actually have a rigorous discussion
debate understand things in depth by
asking the teacher right we study at
home listen to lectures in school well
we turn it around we listen to lectures
at home and study at school we can have
interactive content content where you
can browse through and learn in detail
we don't have to have this passive
lectures where a person is talking for
an hour and you just sit there and most
of that time you fall asleep in fact my
lecture should be an interactive lecture
so you have to stay
I'm just kidding but but you'll just
woke up so you're not going to go to
sleep on me right and any of these
things you can you can use technology to
comment on things to share notes to have
discussions and this is you know
beginning to happen these capabilities
are beginning to happen but the
transformation in the teaching and
pedagogy has not yet happened so that's
the setup in the rest of my talk what
I'm going to do is to say a little bit
about some research level projects that
are happening in Microsoft there's many
things that are happening we have a
number of groups number of people
individuals in within Microsoft Research
that are working on interesting projects
related to education technology I will
not go through all of this list because
it'll be too tiring and boring certainly
there are a number of people here and
there are other sessions you know
they'll give you an opportunity to learn
more about some of these things and i
invite you to ask the questions and
learn more about but this is just a
simple in a very very skim sampler
without any specific judgment double
quality just to give you a flavor of the
kind of innovative things that we are
thinking about now before i say this i
should also mention that no today office
365 and powerpoint has become a routine
thing to use in lectures many of you
probably do it in your own classes and
OneNote gives you the ability to take
notes so those things are yesterday's
technology which I think are getting
used but let's look about looking
forward what may be things that we can
do in the future now many of you are
professors and researchers and you know
one of the challenges is actually to set
exam questions right and you know we
recycle our exam problems that we did
three years ago five years ago
variations on those you have to do them
right otherwise the students will
plagiarize I mean students have every
incentive or a need to you know to get
the good grade so that they can get the
job so they're going to go plagiarize
and do whatever they have to do so can
we think of a way of generating a lot of
problems that are the right kind of
problems but one that would prevent
students from being able to copy so so
much Galvani was one of the researchers
in our MSR Redmond laboratory has been
working on an approach where it looks
like it looks at a problem and it
learned some of the key aspects of the
problem and creates new problems that
are variations of this problem so but it
has the same
probably a more easier example for you
is that you all know many of you might
have studied trigonometry and have done
some identities you know sine squared
plus cos squared equals 1 but you can
actually take one problem and create
many other identities as challenges that
are similar to but not the same so there
are ways in which automatically you can
I can learn from a problem what was so
he has been doing this and it's been
testing it out that's you know I'm again
I'm not sure we have demos of this buddy
and I will explore you to find out this
is I'm going to switch out to something
somewhat different we've been working on
a platform or a tool called chromosome
which is less about of course problem
and testing but much more about
intensive deep learning about history
and being able to go to you know time
scales and timelines that are very big
or very short and we will get you know
detailed idea of what you want to learn
so let me show a demo if I know how good
this is a video I'm going to let it
my main interest in climate is that I
study snow and the water that comes from
snow I'm interested in snow i'm
interested in glaciers I'm interested in
how they behaved over time
so the struggle we have in communicating
science is how to present information
based on data chromosome is indeed
revolutionary in the way that they have
figured out how to show information at
different time scales to what kept
periods all the way from the Big Bang
two periods of a few years and to do
that with the same tool zoom in very
rapidly from one time scale to another
to move through history at whatever
speed you want to move so we can explain
the variability that occurred in Earth's
climate over periods of tends to
millions of years in the last century
climate change is driven really by human
activities there's been rising
concentrations of greenhouse gases in
the atmosphere and there's also been
human aerosols so we understand the
processes that drive climate change at
various time scales and so in kronos ohm
being able to sort of show the present
in the context of the pass is really
used again to try to help people
understand what goes on at time scales
that they individually cannot observe
the fact that chrono suit runs in the
cloud makes it really easy to use you
don't need any sort of client-side
application except a browser the only
thing that really shows up on your own
computer are the results much of what I
study is not very easily accessible as
you have to hike and ski to get to some
of the places where I work the things I
can do with kronos 0 is I to not only
show data over many years I can also
show images and diagrams and graphs and
time-lapse movies in kronos ohm you can
create books stories that that you can
drive yourself you can explore a story I
have to tell at any speed you want you
can skip over some details or you can
dive into some of those details
I hope other people will use Chronos ohm
to tell their interesting story by
uploading their own information both
data and images and texts the most
exciting part of my job as a professor
is turning on lights in people's heads
to suddenly see in people's faces that
yeah I get it this is an explanation of
climate change now that I really
understand that is just exciting
yeah so you know this you can learn more
about this again talking to the people
you know that are here from microsoft
research connections and it's a open
source free software so anybody can get
get it and I know as a teacher for you
to be able to tell stories that are much
more engaging to the student is
something that I'm sure you know u haul
desired so you should take this
opportunity now I'm going to talk about
a slightly different tool many of you
might have heard of Khan Academy have
you heard of Khan Academy yes so now
Connor Academy is just one example of
various online lecture content many of
these lectures are short because people
have began to believe learning
scientists that short lectures less than
15 minutes are likely to be better in
terms of capturing students attention
than long ones and then some interaction
but one a classical dilemma that
lecturers and teachers are faced is do I
do handwritten lectures where I go to a
board and write or do I use slides or
power point where the font is nice now
I'm going to take a quick poll how many
people in this room as teachers many of
you have been teachers are teachers
prefer to give handwritten lectures
where you don't use slides or PowerPoint
and how many of you use you know slides
are PowerPoint pre-prepared slides quite
regularly yeah like we expected so there
are more of a tendency towards using
these you know technology simply because
it gives you a better time to prepare
ahead of time and so forth but you know
never don't worry we'll show you
something about it but that can also be
made much more rich and interactive but
one of the problems with handwritten
lectures is that the handwriting of the
lecturer and need not be very good and
in fact often is not good Khan is
particularly bad I think he probably
should have had a career as a doctor
writing prescriptions but I don't know
why he got into this business and but
wouldn't it be nice to actually
afterwards at least for the purposes of
archival to have things in the same that
are in a much better legible font so
we're thinking about this so we created
a tool which is actually a crowdsourcing
tool where people can listen to these
Khan Academy lecture
and while they are listening to it they
can stop and annotate it using the
proper words and so that it will show up
later you know in the font in the right
form so it doesn't take a lot anyone
who's listens to the lecture can
actually annotate it other people can
correct those annotations but you still
preserve the original video in the form
that it was so that you get the flow of
calm I'll show an example of that in a
second now once you have this annotation
what you can do is actually this is just
the interface of the play of so you know
you want to go much more into that what
we can do is you can actually use
automatic translators and other devices
to translate the same lecture with in a
words in the appropriate foreign
language you this could be Spanish I
mean this is as some of you might have
recognized as the Indian language Hindi
and it was done automatically so once
you get this in that form in the rich
lecture can extend to much more people
but during the lecture you still want to
preserve the experience that can't
wanted to have is when a wanted students
to have namely the sense of following
the lecturer as these developing the
lecture show I'll give you an example of
that this is a very very short video
sorry to pay attention just to qu there
will be something up on top on the right
hand side where Khan will be writing and
the bottom is the version after the
annotation so you kind of get to see the
flow of both okay so just pay attention
to that needs to sell the 441 US dollar
and once again he cares about dollars
because he has to pay his own mortgage
in dollars all that how would he gains
be paid in dollars maybe the shippers he
used so so you know the idea here is you
know from a user satisfaction point of
view it's nice to have the flow as
chondrites because you follow his hand
but then you know a second or two later
it comes up with the font so that you
can in archive and read it's a very
simple idea but then one that's very
powerful can be used for many purposes
now I said I'm not going to show you
many other technologies and I want but
there's something that's very important
to talk about because I think it's
getting released today or some sometime
in the very near future again as
lecturers I'm sure many of you are
wished it was easy for you to actually
talk in front of a
camera record your lecture but then add
content that's interactive you put your
slides and then if you click on
something other slides the student goes
to some interesting interactive web page
and so forth but there hasn't been a
good way to do all of that in one place
and it's also you want to deliver the
lecture so when the student is playing
the lecture they don't have to set up
something very complicated and actually
still be able to get the experience of
interactivity so much soft is creating a
half-caste create and add on to
powerpoint it's called office mix and I
think it's going to be released either
today or sometime in the very near
future right as far as and I think yeah
so you will hear more about it in one of
the booths later and you can see a demo
of that and this is this should allow
you as the teacher to create a no
combination of audio video ink and
interactive content into your lectures
share it you know directly out to the
world again through office cloud and you
know also be able to measure and get
feedback because you know you have
interactive ways in which you can
actually see how students are going
through one of the benefits of having
technology assisted learning is that you
can actually monitor the progress of the
students i'm sure you know you're
familiar with that idea so that's that's
just a little sampler of some of the
technology that we are doing now I'm
going to move to another topic which has
been very very popular and I'm us I'm
sure all of you have heard of the word
MOOCs is anyone here was not heard of
MOOCs okay so yeah so this has become a
big phenomenon in the last two to three
years started you know sort of the
pioneered by a couple of people at
Stanford although people are doing
online lectures before but the movement
really took off as a result of Udacity
and corset r &amp;amp; F and now EDX at MIT and
mm ID has had OpenCourseWare their
content has been online for a long time
but they just now trying to promote it
through this platform and making it more
available so it's become very very
popular many many students are doing it
one out of eight courses this is I think
about a year or so all this information
and many universities many students it's
been you know going strong however it's
not without its challenges so for
example you know if you look at the
students
you know most of them are at the higher
education level but what you find is
that not everyone finishes off finishes
the you know courses forty-four percent
did not finish the course what we found
and I think many people have found is
that the people who actually take it all
the way to completion and get
certification is something like one to
five percent of the people that are
taking it so it's a very attractive idea
you know but at the end of the day
there's just not enough people who see
it through so you have to ask the
question what's missing with so it's
very nice it's broad lecture from great
lecturers in the world to your home be
able to learn it yet only about one to
five percent of the students finish it
now the next part I'm going to talk
about I'm not going to talk about MOOCs
here because that's a whole another
topic let me move on to talk about some
other work that we are doing in
Microsoft Research India in the context
of Indian education system perhaps that
would be relevant to some of the efforts
that are going on at Chile we found as I
solely told you earlier scale problem is
a huge problem in India lots of colleges
lots of students not enough teachers and
so clearly you know we want some
solution that would be technology
centric and MOOCs have certainly been
something that people have talked about
again this is what I said but one thing
I guess I forgot to mention is that in
the context of detail the way Indian
higher education engineering education
is structured is that every state these
are States has University which has many
colleges affiliated with them the
colleges are not autonomous but
semi-autonomous and so for instance in
Tamil Nadu the university has 540
colleges in andhra pradesh at a 850 and
the numbers vary and that colleges have
to take the same exam that is you know
set up and conducted by the university
in order for them to get the degree that
is university-based but the college's
teach their courses their curriculum is
also centralized the university decides
what curriculum should be taught by
every College in every one of those 540
colleges and there are only very few
high quality colleges may be out of 4700
maybe there are 50 or something there
are really good quality colleges and the
rest you know are really
not that good and they don't have enough
teachers and if the number is so small
50,000 you can imagine how many of them
are actually good teachers it's less
than ten percent so now so there is a
great desire to use MOOCs but what we
found is that the kind of people
students who use MOOCs are actually the
top students the you might have heard of
the IITs our Indian Institutes of
Technology which are the elite
engineering universities in india it's
those students who end up using the
MOOCs and they actually don't need to
because they're getting good education
anyway but they are the ones who
understand and have the sort of
entrepreneurial sort of wish to go take
advantage of these technologies that are
available why syllabus is not the same
as what's specified in the college and
you all know every student studies
something not because they want to learn
but because they ever take an exam so if
it's not going to be relevant for the
exam they're not going to take it and
you know this is not going to help them
get the job and at the end other day
right besides that there's actually not
enough awareness I mean we are talking
about a large country with a lot of
people not everyone is aware and
accessibility in terms of bandwidth and
so on are also quite severe so this is a
great idea one would think that it would
reach massively out to especially
countries like India but it's you know
significantly falling short of what
needs to be done so we've actually been
doing a different project in our
laboratory called massively empowered
classroom and you will see I think
there's going to be a demonstration of
that in one of the later sessions today
so you learn more about it the basic
idea when we started doing that is to
say look let's not try to go directly
from the teacher to the students but
mediated through the college system
through the classroom through the
lecturer through the University by doing
so we get the students and not only the
students but all the teachers to be on
our side we give value to the teachers
because they are not you know they know
that they cannot meet the capacity needs
so we're giving them additional help to
increase their teaching capacity then
has the quality of their own teaching
and the way to do that it is not to give
you know high class lectures from some
professor at MIT to a professor in a
college in India but rather use those
lectures has one portion of the content
and allow the teacher to add their own
content so that they can customize it
for their students and they can also a
sense of participation
so the platform that we are going to
show you later today has some of these
capabilities and of course you know you
have student analytics because it's all
online and you know what the students
are doing and how they're progressing
and that information can be given to the
teachers or the university professors to
help you know capetti called customize
the program the pace of learning and
things like that ok we also have made
available offline content so that you
know you don't have to have the high
bandwidth then you can sort of cash it
download it you know when you are in a
good connectivity and then go to your
room and study it you know in privacy
and things like that so this is
something that we are experimenting with
just to give a little bit more context
to this is as a part of our efforts to
enhance the Indian higher education
ecosystem we've been working with a
government committee called quality of
quality enhancement in engineering
education this is a committee of top
educationists that are brought together
by the ministry of human resource
development the Education Ministry to
look at ways in which we can increase
the quality of education they are
looking at various methods i won't go
into all of them but one of them in
experiments that being done through that
process is actually make platform as a
way of you know doing this so so i'm not
you know i don't have so much more say
probably going to finish my talk early
which is fine because i'm sure you all
did come here all the way to listen to
my talk but let's look at the future
right they said you know it's not simply
about giving great lectures from the top
lecturers in the world there is a myth
that there you know there are like 100
public and everyone else should
learn from them really teaching is much
more personal much more local much more
about the one-on-one communication so we
want to empower every faculty and that's
going to happen and we don't have to
worry about broadcast we have content
that can be selected global local and as
I said mix and other things that are
coming up it allows you to do much more
powerful authoring of content and
sharing it and analytics I mean one of
the great you know opportunities that
exist today is the fact that everything
is data and the data can inform us up in
many ways about how to improve what we
are doing you know
our for our customers namely the
students and of course collaboration
already students are doing this through
skype facebook link and now we can build
it in as a part of the learning process
itself so they don't have to go outside
and everything is personalized for the
students so you know if we are really
all we have to do I mean literally I'm
saying all we have to do is to be
willing to step outside of our comfort
zone of standing up in front of 100
students and giving a lecture and
feeling that high first three days it's
good after the fourth day in the
semester you probably don't want to come
to school but think about it as how you
can you can sort of tailor it to the
student every student in your class can
be an a student because now you're
paying attention to that student in a
manner that makes that makes it easy
because the tools will allow you to do
that I think that's where the future of
education is technology is here and it
will get better as we you start using it
it always does right technology starts
somewhere but after we start using it it
gets better and customized for our use I
think you know if that's a part of the
journey that we all want to do we have
all been teachers we are all teachers
and we are also researchers so I hope
you'll join us in this thang
thank you and undone so we have time for
questions and I think wait for the mic
please
do you foresee a role for video games in
the future of the classroom in high
schools and universities that video
games games can be useful in teaching
certain concepts I'm sure they will be
used but ultimately it's the creativity
of the teacher right in terms of what
methods to engage the students some
things can be in that form but I'm not
sure that it's generic way after to do
that so question over there yeah thank
you for your talk I was wondering how to
improve the capabilities that have these
students to get a job you were saying
that some of the issues that the online
learning facilities have is that
students can show how capable they are
to get a job or maybe the companies are
not really willing to hire people that
got their degrees with an online system
so i was wondering if there is something
that Microsoft is doing to to improve
that relationship and and get more
people getting jobs when they are
studying a row nine courses so let me
give a partial answer to this because I
may not know everything that Microsoft
is doing so we are not in the business
of actually working with companies in
terms of how to improve education say we
build tools and technologies that the
education community and the industry can
use in order to you know do those kind
of things so you know as technology
providers what we are looking for how
can we improve what they want to do
namely to maybe do a better assessment
maybe have better connection but through
social media and things like that those
are the kind of things that we would do
but I don't believe you have a specific
program to talk to employers to you know
solve this problem but that said it's a
big company and there may be things that
I don't even know but
question thank you for talking a long
time ago the game induce has some
problem that they spend a lot of money
to make the end of their games and
usually like five to ten percent of the
gamers reach that point and pay everyone
pays for that end and it looks to me
that the mocks problem is quite similar
you spend a lot of resources and do a
lot a very big classroom and very big
discipline but usually the students drop
in the beginning what's in the problem
that we can try to solve using
technology why do you still need to have
the professor and the full curriculum is
acting the same way can we drop or do
something different in this way also
using technology yeah I think the answer
is yes I think there are you know
factors that you have to consider this
is an experimental time right every
professor every University every college
can experiment every community can
experiment in whatever methods of
pedagogy that seems to work better than
what we are doing right so we have
technology and tools available so it's
for the education community say you know
I don't like this particular pedagogical
method like you said you know which has
all these issues let me try something
new what that something new is not for
us to decide as technologies in fact as
educators you're in a better position to
decide that now that said I'll give you
my personal opinion my personal opinion
is learning has to be centered around
the individual who's learning not around
the teacher who's teaching not around
the classroom you know where the
lectures are being done so how do we
take this I think these technologies
allow you to have the students go at the
right pace for them the right content
you know one student may be finding one
one particular topic easy so skip over
the topic whereas another student may
find that topic hard so spend more time
so a teacher can help the student put
their time into places where they need
more help and the content is there so
that they can spend more time so I would
think of the stitches role not as a
lecturer but as a teacher you know
literally one who teaches how you learn
how you prioritize what you learn and
that's what teaching is about not giving
I think the opportunity exists but it's
for us as educators to take that
opportunity any other question
thank you this is definitely going to
disrupt the way we work in the
universities colleges and how do you see
that the future of the universities as
institutions but will be the wrong thing
if I if I could predict the future I
would be doing something else but that
said okay I'll give you my opinions
again first of all I think the idea that
that is a campus to which everybody
comes and goes to classes has actually
two or three reasons behind it one is of
course bring everybody to the classroom
so you can give the lecture I think
that's not a good reason the second is
to have resources such as laboratories
and other infrastructure which are hard
to have duplicate everywhere you kind
kind of have to bring people to the
place where such things exist I don't
think it's easy I mean we can do a lot
of virtual labs and do many things but
at the end of the day I think that
process is physical at least in my
opinion and the third reason equally
important is the socio-cultural reason
right which is in the college you are
with other people who are at the same
age group that are learning and are
exploring and that part you know while
you can use social media to get
somewhere probably I am one of those
old-fashioned people where I think you
still need to be with the people that
are learning in ordered essence of
community and I think the age group that
exists in cuz these things are important
social factors that are not going to go
away so I think what will happen in the
college's will be places where you come
to learn and mix mix with other people
and get the learning experience but the
learning itself may not happen in
classrooms classrooms will be places
where there is discussion debate
collaborate to work right what we do now
at home can be done in the classroom so
I don't know that's probably where
things will go but you know I wouldn't
put my money on that prediction
question there oh no you had a question
yeah i think for education to change we
need to change the teachers so how do
you see the role that you can't
technology in educating the educators
the teachers to give so we expect them
to go through the old way of learning
how to teach and then come to this new
world of technology and use completely
different tools to deliver on that
process but look good technology does
should not require a lot of training ok
but that's an ideal thing to say but
still it's true on the other hand you
know the barrier is not so much the
ability to learn the skills to use the
technology but just a psychological
barrier of wanting to and that's a
transformation will happen socially over
time as technologists I don't think we
should be afraid of that but once people
start doing it we will come back and
learn about fifty percent or more other
things that we did were probably wrong
and not tailored to the user and we'll
just make the changes that are needed to
do okay last question for this session
well I see that most of these systems
are thinking that students always they
want to learn but sometimes we face that
not not all the students won't really
learn they just want to finish and
sometimes they want to learn just what
is enough to get enough grades in there
in the courses so do you think this
system should be changed in some way to
controller a little bit more that
students are really controlled in the
process and they are not doing some
stuff act like sometimes we see in the
classroom that they are not or they are
copying the work of some students they
just want to finish the how we can
control this in the process with these
technologies because not always is so
easy in the beginning the practice now I
understand the question so when I was
raising children and the children were
young there was this method of learning
piano I think that Kurt Suzuki method or
something like that which is a very
rigorous method now we did not ask our
children to do that because we hadn't we
didn't have the discipline to do it
ourselves so we thought at the end of
the day it's a very complex on a
technology related thing at all first of
all right students willingness to learn
is proportional to incentives rewards
and the kind of fun factor that there is
right i mean we are all not bond with
the desire to go and learn a lot we just
learned what we need to i think all that
technology can do is to make it
available readily in the forum and tuned
to your sort of abilities preparedness
it can't change the way you are it can't
change people to become more interested
in learning than they are i think we can
just make it easier for them when they
are interested in learning to learn
better but social processes such as
schools teachers parents that exist to
do all those things anyway and they'll
continue to exist right with that let's
think of course I do it Mike you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
