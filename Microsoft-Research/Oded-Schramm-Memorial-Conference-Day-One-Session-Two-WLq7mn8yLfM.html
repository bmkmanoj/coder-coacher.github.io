three talks in this session the first
will be by Ken Stephenson on the
rigidity of circle packings it's
certainly a privilege to speak here and
I want to thank the organizers it's uh
it's going to be wonderful to hear the
stories each of us has our modes of
interaction with Oded I was not a direct
co-author but talked with him many times
and I'm looking forward to seeing those
various gems that were used to seeing
come out of his work and conversations
with him and one of those is what I'll
be talking about today I'm talking about
circle packings and I think that circle
packings if you look at the record heba
a solid claim on Oded affections early
in his career and we talk about beauty
in mathematics in various ways this is
maybe a superficial one but I can't get
over the lovely pictures you see in
circle packing add oil spiral
this is one of odd square grid packings
a couple different versions of of the
error function early stages of
developing a an error function
discreetly this is a conformal welding
using circle packings another connection
with Odin's work is the squared
rectangle on the left and the circle
packing version on the right same
combinatorics and more or less the same
wreck rectangle and just in general the
number of ways in which circle packings
appear in the study of conformal
structures and that sort of the
underlying theme here and with Odin's
work on circle packing was the
connection with conformal geometry and
so I'm going to give just a little
background because I know that not
everyone knows about circle packing or
knows the basis of it or potentially
what it contains and so just the basic
definition a circle packing is a
configuration of circles with a
specified pattern of tangency zeeeee and
as with everything that owed it worked
on their variation we might be working
in a penciler metric we might be working
with overlapping circle packings I'm
going to stick with tangency patterns
and so the idea is that someone comes up
and gives you a combinatorial purely
combinatorics like a triangulation and
then there's this theorem and we'll
quote a couple theorems on the existence
of circle packings having those
combinatory so i'll start with the
sphere which we're going to work on
mostly today so here i've used a random
point process to put points on a
randomly on a sphere and I've taken the
delon a triangulation of those points so
this is what I would call a random
triangulation of the sphere
now every triangulation of the sphere
has associated a circle packing the
color coding is just about the degree so
there's nothing special about that it's
a little prettier sometimes but the
point is that with every vertex in the
triangulation there's associated a
circle and if two vertices are connected
by an edge those circles are required to
be tangent to one another and so what
happens is an arbitrary combinatorics
situation is given a geometry by being
required to fit together with these
circles and so the circle set change the
geometry but respect the combinatorial
of the original pattern and so we're
going to talk about the basic existence
and uniqueness results just to get
started so the first result is the curb
Andre of thurston theorem as Bill
Thurston told me one time and you'll
have to check with him whether he still
says this he improved this in the
morning found a proof in the afternoon
that from ondrea's work but then it was
several years later that it was found to
have been proven by turbo back in
nineteen the 1930s so that says that
given any triangulation of a topological
sphere there exists a universe oh you
know valence simply means that the
circles don't overlap there's a univille
encircle packing of the Riemann sphere
having the combinatorial that
triangulation and what we're going to
talk about is rigidity which is a sort
of uniqueness version of things so
moreover this packing is unique up to
Mobius transformations and inversions
and we're going to cut out inversions
we're going to think of oriented objects
so given the triangulation there's a
rigidity here and they get a circle
packing associated with it and its
unique up to Mobius transformations
now that's been extended considerably so
the more general theorem is given a
triangulation of any topological surface
there exists conformal structure on that
surface making it a Riemann surface and
there's a universe univ eylandt circle
packing in the intrinsic metric the
constant curvature metric for that
riemann surface that fills so that's a
little technical thing and the disc you
don't want to be shrunk down so you want
to be sort of a maximal packing in that
riemann surface so given any
triangulation the surface might be
compact open the triangulation might be
finite certainly in the compact case or
infinite with boundary without boundary
etc given any triangulation of an
oriented surface you can put a structure
on it and a circle packing compatible
with that structure in the surface and
again there's a uniqueness statement the
conformal structure is uniquely
determined by the combinatorial and the
circle packing is unique up to conform a
lot of morphisms of the surface so these
are the uniqueness type of results the
rigidity I want to talk about and the
upshot for me is that circle packings
come along and they take a purely
combinatorial situation and endow it
with a geometry and the important thing
to understand is that this is not just
any geometry it has the local rigidity
which is the sort of localized version
of the rigidity globally we're going to
talk about and if we loud ourselves to
move off the sphere and put some
boundary in or allow some branch points
we have a global flexibility and in my
mind is this interaction of the
flexibility globally and the local
rigidity which puts it sort of in the
category of analytic function theory
which is where I came from so we all
like to recast things in our own
favorite way but to me this is where
conformal geometry comes in and so this
is a particularly familiar geometry that
we get
and I call it discreet conformal
geometry and that's where ota's work
started improving the uniqueness and
existence of these packings and studying
the relations between the discrete
geometry and classical conformal
geometry the next speaker jamesu head
will be speaking more about this and so
what I wanted to do was to talk about
how this came up excuse me talk about
how this came up and and actually do a
proof so the setting that was this bill
Thurston suggested that if you take a
region Omega and you fill it with a
circle packing and then using curb its
theorem you repack that in the unit disk
that from this the mapping between these
two regions so you put the circle
packing in here now this has the same
coming at orix so this is a circle
packing with the same neighbor
relationships and we have now a map
between the unit disk and our original
region Omega and Thurston suggested that
this was a discreet conformal map or I
think he called it finite Ramon map and
so the theory developed around studying
the the conjecture which was that under
refinement that is if you fill the
region with smaller and smaller circles
and increase the complexity and do these
maps and appropriately normalize they
will converge in the limit to the
classical conformal map of the discount
to Omega now this was proven shortly
after the conjecture is made by Rodin
and Sullivan and it's been vastly
extended to other situations other
combinatorics in particular and a lot of
that work in fact as odets work on more
general common rhetoric for example but
sort of a catch phrase is that under
refinement objects in the discrete world
a circle packing
invariably it seems converge to their
classical counterparts so if you build
something discreetly that looks like a
classical object and you refine it and
keep it looking like that classical
object it will actually converge to it
so it's somehow capturing the same
geometry but what I want to look at in
particular their huge number of papers
I'll list some at the end that of
aspects of this that Oh dad worked on
but I want to talking about a particular
result and so it's the k80 theorem here
the curve Andre of thurston theorem but
it generalizes beyond that case but I'll
prove that so the claim here is that if
i have a circle packing of the sphere
like the one pictured call it p that any
other circle packing of the sphere with
the same combinatory same number of
circles same neighbor relationships as
this one will in fact be a Mobius image
of it so that's uniqueness and the
crucial tool in this is a very deep
result which is why I'm presenting this
because some people may not realize this
that two and two circles can intersect
it at most two points so will exploit
that deep property so we can actually
pretty much proved this whole thing here
so the set up part one at least so we
have our packing p I'm going to identify
a mutually tangent triple there and I'm
going to take my competitor my other
packing I can't draw it because of
course it's just p but we have a
presumed competitor packing and identify
combinatorially the same triple and with
the Mobius transformation I can get that
triple of circles to be the exact same
triple of circles as in p so I've
normalized things and that's where the
Mobius transformation ultimately is
going to come in I have to show the rest
of the circles on the
right are the same as the circles here
and I'm going to presume that the very
next one that fails to be the case so
here's one sort of extending that triple
a neighboring circle and in the
competing packing that neighboring
circle is a different size this doesn't
happen they have to be the same so so
that's first part of my setup now I just
put the Infinity inside that inter sis
and I project both these packings down
to the plane and I get juxtaposed
configurations now I've drawn the
circles for one of them but the other
circles are in there as well for the
other packing so everything's now inside
this inter sis with the two circles that
differed the red and blue there as shown
one more small adjustment I'm going to
take the packing with the blue circle
and I'm going to scale it away from a
just a little and so we end up in the
situation on the right there so I have
these two packings with the same com
notorious in that situation and it's
that collection of circles that I'm
going to study a little more so let's
focus in on a small patch of this
packing and I'm going to identify what I
call the elements for lack of a better
name the elements of the packing are
well the circles so every circle is an
element of this packing and the
interstitial so every interest this is
an element throw those together i have e
the collection of elements of this
packing now there's another packing
around which in this region looks like
this you can see sort of which circles
are identified in the combinatorics but
they're shifted from one another and so
we have a collection of elements for
this other packing eep rhyme
and in particular we're going to look at
the triangular elements i'll call them
these are the inner sis elements and the
interstate elements in the two competing
packings here are shown corresponding
elements and the dots represent the
tangency points of the circles and those
are identified from the blue to the red
you know which of those dots corresponds
to the other in the other packing so
what were you going to do now is compare
these elements and somehow I don't know
exactly how did did this when he first
saw this he had a sort of hands-on
approach as I think his common he did
not look over the literature and try to
find something that did his work for him
just doggie and he knew it was true and
he figured out direct method of showing
it so he came up with the notion of
compatibility it's not the same as here
but it's that was the genesis we're
going to use a fixed point index so I'm
going to assume that I have two simple
curves the red and the blue gamma and
Sigma and I'm going to define a
homeomorphism between this these are
these two curves i'm going to set up
this little terminology so this is a
fixed point free homeomorphism
orientation preserving between these two
curves and i'm going to define the index
and i think it would be appropriate
maybe to just explain what this index is
so i actually have blue and red here
this is a very simple case and so of
course the interactions could be more
complicated but I have these two curves
and I'm going to take a function which
maps each point on this curve to some
point on the other curve in the picture
I start with these points of
intersection and let me describe this
index in a very simple way suppose that
you are what your friend is walking
around gamma and you are walking around
Sigma and you have an elastic string
between you as you walk around the only
requirement is that you not both be at
one of these intersection points at the
same time that's the fixed point free
the other requirement is as your friend
walks in the positive direction you move
in the positive direction and the
winding number is at the end of the day
whether that string winds around you
when you get back to your initial points
so your friend walks around one curve
you walk around the other and what's the
purpose of the function well the
function says that I on my curve get to
choose how to walk around that curve and
try to control that winding so given the
curve gamma I might be able to specify a
function which tells me how to walk
around the curve Sigma so that the
winding has a certain property and
that's what we're going to use is that
winding number so compatibility results
if you have two circles as your curves
because they can only intersect twice
it's not difficult to show that every
fixed point free homeomorphism has an
index that's greater than equal to 0
okay so there's no way that you can fail
no matter how you choose to walk around
your path compared to the
a friend on the other path the index is
always greater than or equal to zero a
little more complicated on these
interests elements but the basic idea is
that in addition to the conditions on
the map being a fixed point free
homeomorphism we're also going to
require that when your friend is at a
you're at a prime when your friend is it
be you're at B Prime and when your
friend is at sea you're at C prime so
that compatibility and then the theorem
is that given these two topological
triangles there exists a fixed point
free homeomorphism with index greater
than or equal to 0 and that's actually
fun to figure out because it's a very
straightforward is simple arguments to
get this done you can teach this in a
honors undergraduate course it's a lot
of fun so here's the proof for every
interest this element that's the
triangular ones we choose a map between
the element MP and the corresponding
element in P Prime and by the previous
slide on the right hand side we're able
to choose that by by force they have
index greater than or equal to 0 now on
the circle elements it turns out that
your map is already defined because
every circle the boundary is covered by
inter sis's by edges of interest Issus
and for each of those interstates is
you've already defined a map to the
corresponding edge of the inner sis and
the other packing and so this already
defines a map on the circles and so you
have maps on all the elements now and by
the way this in our overall
configuration there are some interest
as's around the boundary and so this
defines a map on those the outer
boundary there because those edges are
not shared by any other inter sis's so
they're sort of leftover and there's a
I'm induced homeomorphism fixed-point
free on the outer boundaries of the
configurations so now we throw together
this sum and take about a count of
cancellations because when you're doing
a winding number it's a change an
argument and if you're on an edge of an
inter sis that's shared with a circle to
change our arguments when you're
thinking of it as a triangular element
is canceled by the change in argument
because of orientation when you think of
it as part of the neighboring circle
element so everything inside gets
canceled this is a familiar argument to
to most of us but the result is that
this index induced on the boundary is
greater than or equal to 0 but there's
the boundary all the edges of inter
sis's and the circles and the elements
inside have been taken care of and we
have this homeomorphism on the boundary
and if you just isotope that it's this
configuration and it's very quick to see
that the index is negative 1 just go
around here a has to go to a prime B has
to go to be Prime see us to go to c
prime and d has to go to d prime so it's
a negative winding and we're done
competing a competing packing fails and
we have uniqueness so to me personally
this is the prettiest proof I know
pretty much in mathematics now it's all
very elementary and it shows you an
amazing result it applies further than
just triangulations of the sphere it
shows for example that circle packings
that fill the plane are unique and
that's where the proof of Rodin and
Sullivan depended on to get this whole
topic going so
that's the proof and I want to say a
little more though about where this
leads so let's put a book into the
conjecture that started this topic for a
lot of us Thurston's conjecture about
these conformal maps because Odin and
Jing Zhu have proven by further study of
the distortion of these circle packings
the local rigidity that the curb Andre
of Thurston theorem on circle packings
of the sphere actually implies the
Riemann mapping theorem for plane
regions so there's no higher accolade in
for a complex analysts than to say you
have a new proof of the Riemann mapping
theorem and a final word about other
topics there are too many I didn't want
to rush through them but here's another
example of something that that Oded saw
which I really still can't quite believe
although I've studied the proof and it's
true so here is one of my favorite
packings it's a heptagonal packing every
circle as seven neighbors there are
infinitely many generations of circles
here all in the unit disk all actually
the same hyperbolic radius so i'll take
this just as an example packing a
infinite hyperbolic packing and I can
sort of repack that in the square so
that's the same combinatorics but of
course I'm lying to either not infinity
circles either either place and I
actually don't know if that packing if I
can construct that packing in reality
but I've gotten close enough for
government work but they have a theorem
SRAM inhale again have a theorem that
given any short on domain there exists a
universal packing with these common
notorious which fills that region so not
just a square but any simply take your
most horrible
it on curve you can fill the inside with
a packing of these common detroit's
where every circle has seven neighbors I
just can't imagine that and in fact I
can't construct them it's not a
constructive proof but it would be
appropriate maybe by the way there's
another unique uniqueness result here be
appropriate in the circumstances however
to be able to pack a simply connected
region like this theorem allows so
there's one that I suggest I'd like to
see a packing of that with a every
circle having seven neighbors okay
here's some of the papers to indicate
ordered early work on this topic it's
just gorgeous stuff as so it said
earlier you just enjoy reading these and
often I think you if you're lucky you
see the idea and the extra stuff that
has to be imposed later doesn't bother
you those ideas are really in there so
thanks to you and thanks to Oded
all right stuff one request whatever
other comment s wendelin already said
you know that we just settle for one
group but you produce several you and
this is the most important theorem
honest about circle begging and so
quality actually produced like the Bible
rules and the one you tease presented
that's probably the most important
because as you said if it applies to
also
packings very beautiful but one probe I
actually found that I wasn't aware of
account only very reasonably when I
prepared that over the article and it's
not published i think and i found it
actually on wikipedia so we don't know
but that was a very indie really was a
very note you love to contribute to the
wikipedia and he contributed also a lot
to the circle packing on video year and
the proof that is on there is so short
and so beautiful so now again that you
wouldn't believe it i thought it must be
false no really it is it's very very
sore neck maybe all but um then I wasn't
quite so it definitely had with its hand
writing all over it because he was there
was no credit no nothing so more and
then I went to the you know when you see
the history file contribute of course
there were a lot of entries and I wasn't
so sure i know i just put in my article
I believe that this group is due to a
debt and then I got some comments and
with done more so we actually chased
down we look at every day but I think
this is its if it's an incredibly short
elegant like 5 line of three line proof
of the rigidity
I'm sandy anyway sorry well can I keep
this is my favorite anyway have to see
it I could if I could say one more thing
my last correspondence with Oded was
about a lot a year ago and I'm working
on some random triangulation stuff and I
have I suggested something about
convergence sort of random convergence
to conformal structure and the reply was
certainly seems like it could be true
but it looks very hard to prove and so
needless to say i've moved on top good
thing because if his inside didn't
really convince him and he said it was
hard to prove i yeah i think i'll take
his word on that any other let's take
the speed for you
quick break of about three minutes the
second talk in this series of three
unser Capac nging given by Zhang Shu her
he'll speak about disc packings and
conformal maps thank you so it was a
really a hard choice for me there were
so many things to choose up to choose to
talk about when I was invited to talk
here anyway finally I came down to to
talk about just one proof see so
basically this is built on what the ken
has already described so the
relationship between circle packings so
I want we want to call it disk packing
for simplicity of definitions this
packing and the conformal maps so
basically how disk packings can
approximate conformal maps so here was
the original theorem actually Thurston's
conjecture what that was proved by Rodin
Sullivan so basically we have two discs
packings one in any domain and the other
one you know get unit disk so basically
the theorem says what the theorem says
is that the one-to-one correspondence
between disqus one you want back in two
disks in another packing approximates a
conformal mapping so basically we have a
few are anyway this is the full the full
statement
so are so we have two parents one in an
arbitrary demand the other one in the
unit disk and we have some conditions
those are basically on some trivial
conditions that are see on so on the
boundary disks basically we want the
disk packing to feel the whole domains
and also the third condition is a
normalization condition so that the
limit packing will not our push to what
the boundary so under those conditions a
subsequence are for f sub n which is
basically the correspondence map at that
so a subsequence of F sub n should
converge locally uniformity to a real my
map so just so there are a few problems
so the first one is to show the limit
map is a conformal map and this was
achieved by first ship by rodin in the
Sullivan and they proved the rigidity
theorem this is by itself very
interesting theorem rigidity theorem of
infinite hexagonal hexagonal packing so
so basically if you have another packing
if you have any infinite disk packing in
the plane that is comfy notoriety
equivalent to the infinite hexagonal
disk packing then all disks of the
packing must have identical radius so so
this is a very beautiful rigidity result
so the argument goes so if you have any
if you have a disk packing as in the
picture here so you can take limit here
and the limit packing as n goes to
infinity must be a regular hexagonal
packing so
circles in the limit should have the
same radii so as a consequence the limit
Maggie must become formal so this is
basically a consequence of the rigidity
theorem of infinite packing now so the
argument it was only good for c0
convergence and and that uses actually
Kwazii conformal maps convergence of
quasi control maps and also you need
bound bounded valence as to be able to
take limit so actually I want to do a
small digression here so the just reach
this rigidity theorem for hexagonal
infinite hexagonal packing was actually
generalized for all locally finite
infinite dis packing in the plane with
triangular interspaces this was young
when Odetta was a PhD student and then
later this was generalized or four disc
patterns when when the disks not only a
tangent they may intersect in an angle
so this is a too much as for dispatch
packings but also for disc patterns with
overlapping ok so and there are some
further methods by other mathematicians
as well can who has spoke here earlier
and others anyway the they worked under
strict restriction that the radii of all
packings are bounded between are
basically from below Anna from above so
and also only c0 convergence was proved
so this was in late 80s and I first
became interested in
the packing when I was a pcs PhD student
with under professor Friedman and I
think in my thesis I proved the c1
convergence and this can be generalized
to prove see to convergence as well so
that's how I became interested in circle
packings now the problems for ours was
after all this work was to generalize to
arbitrary patterns so this isn't a acta
de picture made by Oded so what happens
with with arbitrary patterns there's no
restriction at all on the combinatorial
there's no bound on the valence so a
circle can be tangent to many as many
other surfers as you like so some
circles can be really small so and what
about the convergence of derivatives in
such case so this was the open problem
in the early 90s so first first of all
how do we define your roof curves in in
this case because in the regular pattern
you can do like numerical analysis so
what happens if you have a general
pattern well we can use the Mobius
transformations so the idea is for any
to triplets of mutually tangent disk
there's a unique fractional linear
transformation that sends the first
triplet to the second so basically you
take the tangency points to the tangency
points and the street engine three
points determine the fractional linear
transformations okay so and and in
particular the map the fractional linear
transformation is can be defined on the
interstates so triangular interest is
this is the shady basically that's the
shaded area those are triangular this is
the union of triangular interspaces so
so we can define a map from the support
of P sub n that's the packing in the
first domain to the support or Q sub and
the packing in the second Adam and so
this is P sub n that's Q sub n here and
so that the map is a is conformal on
every triangular interspace so because
if it is conformal so we can define the
first order and a second order
derivatives for for the map from the
support of one pack into the support of
the other but you cannot define on the
disks you can define it you can define
it on the in the union of interspecies
so that's the derivatives who are
talking about and what the question for
you would be what it what about the
third order deliver so we'll talk about
that a little too what the end so this
is the main theorem so we have a pair of
demands here so half circle and that's I
don't know hope to call that anyway it's
like a comb to make so we have a packing
in the first term a piece a pen and
another packing q-see pen that's coming
out roll equivalent the same number of
circles and the same tangency
relationships
so we have a map eps up and from the
support of the first pack into the
support of the second of packing so that
maps as before the maps triangular
interest interest hisses two triangular
interspaces and it maps the disks on to
the disqus of Q sub n so f sub a is only
conformal in the interstices so it's not
come for more in the disks guys so it's
just a continuous map now those are
generic assumptions basically thats that
spherical diameters of the disks are
small and also the boundary disks are
very close to the boundary of the domain
and finally a normalization condition
that the map will not converge to the to
the boundary basically so there's a
compact subset so a fixed point acute Q
naught will be mapped to that subset so
not everything will kill to what the
boundary so the condition is that a
subsequence of F sub n will converge
locally uniformly to our come for more
homey more vision okay so so this is the
c0 convergence so this does not depend
on the combinatorial pattern at all and
furthermore we have convergence of the
first order and the second order
derivatives so again those relationships
are only restricted to the units to the
triangular interstices because because
those are not defined in the disks there
are only continuous functions but they
are defined they are actually fractional
linear transformations in their set of
triangular interspecies
okay so a corollary would be that the
absolute value of the derivative of the
ream I'm app or of the conformal map may
be approximated by the ratio of radii of
the corresponding disks it does not
matter if the disk is small or big so
this has really nice control on the on
the size of the disks okay so the main
points first actually those are breaking
out into three points so first of all to
show that the limit map of the
subsequence is a conformal map and again
the difficulty is that there's no limit
disk packing because the combinatorics
are is rather arbitrary and the uniform
convergence of the derivatives first
order in the second order group chips
okay so actually those the first two
points can be proved by some idea you
might be HD faces mainly I mean some
idea there and applying actually that's
after I learned the concept of
transparent boundary extremal extreme
lengths from Odette I mean he taught me
about the extremal length concept
actually he got it from Jim cannon some
paper or maybe he got it before that but
eventually there he eventually found
that concept was also in team cannons
paper so he taught me that and I used
that idea to take care of some technical
difficulty and then I was able to and
then I I was unable to prove numbers ray
and then I talked to Odette about it
initially he didn't believe that I had
approved he he thought my method
wouldn't work then he then he said let
me think about
and then a few days later he came up
with his own proof so and then we wrote
a paper together on this so I he say to
me I was saved from writing my
cumbersome sprue hero the whole paper
basically improved my name was really
nice for him to put my name on there
anyway uh so so the the argument was
really simple and can be understood by
any college student with some training
in complex analysis it's really a very
simple idea and so well i left the
colleges already so anyway this so just
this argument starts with this circle
fixed point of lemma which actually can
talk about earlier and this circle fixed
point of lemma actually was used
extensively in a in the proof of Kirby
conjecture for countably connected
domains this is another one another one
of our journal papers and this is a very
powerful tool and actually I learned
this fixed point of lemma from Odette he
was working under on the rigidity of
infinite dis packings and he was able to
come up with a proof or but that proof
or was it we were able to use it for so
called a circle domains as well ah so
that's another story so I don't have
time to talk about that here so the
fixed point index demo is actually
presented earlier by on by can and so I
would rephrase it this way here so we
have two circles see wanna see tier in
the plane that are positively oriented
and we have
1f to orientation preserving
homomorphisms so basically those are two
cloves f1 f2 are basically two curves
that have images that are circles and
assume that F 1 F F 2 is never zero on C
so basically there's no fixed point this
this sorry there's nope no points for no
0.4 the difference then the winding
number of the curve f1 minus f2 around
at zero is non-negative so this is
basically the same lemma ken was talking
about earlier and I like to mention the
proofs because it's really are relevant
to what we're going to do next so we
have four cases they bound this journey
interiors or one is inside the other and
so the case to you in a case three that
winding number is one because you can
shrink a point in the smaller circle to
a point and the case for is a little bit
more interesting and it takes a little
bit more work so when the two circles
overlap into two points anyway so so
there are two observations so c1 and c2
really do not need to be circles they
can be any Jordan curves as far as the
intersecting at most two points and
that's by I mean a simple homotopy
argument and the second is this is not
needed but so the lemma is still valid
you for F sub K so f1 f2 are locally non
decreasing functions they don't have to
be homeomorphisms they actually they can
be of different a topological degrees
they don't even have to have the same
decrease okay so Anna here is a basic
topological Emma actually that's implied
in
henceforth so this is a basically I
thinking any complex analysis book
textbook so we have a bigger curve right
here okay this is a bigger curve and
this is a like close Jordan domain by
bounded by the bigger curve Jay and we
have j 1 j 2 g sub a and B Jordan curves
inside the domain which bond mutual ed
stone interiors so those are actually
boundary of disks in our applications
and so they bound this journey interiors
and a either close the subset contained
obtained from be by removing the
interiors of those little curves okay
those basically those little disks so in
our application a is a union of closely
triangular interspaces ok so just they
are not disks are and all curves are
positively oriented so now G is a
complex valued continuous function that
is never zero in a so a is like the set
the union of interest Issus the disks
are removed then the winding number of
the curve g around zero of the bigger
curve J around it 0 equals is equal to
the sum of whiny numbers of the smaller
curves around 0 that's because it's no
zero in a ok and this is a like a
homolog homology dimension one so now
what if G has some isolated zero zeros
in the interior of a then you have to
add up I mean the some right here you
have to add up the degree of zeros of G
in those isolated zeros so that's the
what I call adjusted topological Emma so
the whining number around zero is equal
to the sum of running numbers of the
curves plus the sum of degrees of zeros
in the interiors of a
and in our application G is going to be
holomorphic so so the degree of zero is
always positive at least a one and also
those curves have those curves are going
to be circles and energy is going to be
in difference of two like maps as in
lemma 1 so this is so those deep those
the winding number is always known
always non-negative in our application
because we take G to be the difference
of two maps so we're going to see that
later now so so I'm going to do a quick
proof of of the main theorem so
basically we have F sub n which is a
from support of pizza pan to support of
Q sub N and the maps triangular
interstate is conformally onto the to to
the to the ones of Q sub n so so apps
are pair as before it's a holo motor
function in the interior of the
triangular intercessors and so those are
continues so the first step of the proof
is to show that F sub ends are uniformly
by lipschutz in the interior of the
domain and this is I using our so called
the choise p Clemmie for mappings of
these pageants I think the first it
first appeared in a paper by Bearden and
Stevenson and the idea is that if you if
f contracts that this have a bigger
dispatch ii into a smaller one then the
derivative must be bounded by one the
absolute value so so basically if the
disk packing is contracted from a bigger
one to a smaller one
so this shows that the derivative you
absolute value is bounded between on
those numbers when the domains of
bounded domains and the general case may
be may be reduced to that case okay so
that's basically step one on now step
two is to show that the second
derivative is also uniformly bounded in
the interior of a d so remember the
second order derivative is actually
defined by the fractional linear
transformations that send interest
hisses to insurgencies so basically we
have to show we have to show that we
have to show that the fractional linear
linear transformations is uniformly
bounded the second derivative of the
fractional linear transformations
uniformly bounded so we take such a
fractional linear transformation so so
what we do is we're going to take some
Jordan curve in closing Z naught so and
then we change the Jordan curve a little
bit so we take it you're done curve that
contains Z naught and then we are we
change it a little bit so that it is
still contain is contained in the union
of interspecies so and then the
boundedness of the second derivative
follows from the following facts first
of all the boundedness of of the zeros
derivative if you like that's because f
sub n converges by step one okay and
then the the boundedness of the first
order derivative so that's because F sub
n is up by lipschutz so we have
boundedness of the first order to
and then this following lemma so so so
remember that f sub n is a fractional
linear transformation so it only has
three degrees of freedom so those two
conditions one at T already placed two
conditions so you just need one more
condition to to imply the boundedness of
the secondary rupture and the basically
the third third condition is less it's a
topological condition right here so the
set the image of the geodon curve by
absorb and intersects the bounded Jordan
curve of F sub n of Japan remember F sub
n because it's by Lipsius that converges
so so this is bounded so that means that
actually places a strong condition on
the fractional linear transformation f
sub n so so lemma three is the key on
now how do we prove that that's just by
the fixed point fixed point index idea
so so basically we assume those are
disjoined so both are simple loops in
the Riemann sphere so so suppose they're
disjoint but they share a common point
so so this is a common point because the
they are identical in that interest is
that means are the images sharepoint
actually they share many points but the
boundaries are disjoint so one must be
containing another so as a consequence
the union is actually the bigger set so
basically one is a subset of another
that means there's a point which is
outside of the union and we can map that
point to the point at infinity by a
fractional linear transformation so we
can replace the packing
image packing by l q sub n so the image
by the linear fractional transformation
so basically what we can assume those
two sets are bounded set their
containing in the plane too because they
miss the point at infinity so so now
those so this is a technical step so
basically the DSS in the plane now those
two maps are is a complex valued map and
we know the image of the Jordan curb by
one is in the interior or the other ones
in the interior so the fixed point index
of the difference must be one on that
Jordan curve but but on the other hand
those two maps agree in that interest is
so they completed agree in that interest
and the and lemma for says that if
that's the case then the winding number
around 0 is at least three so we got a
contradiction so the contradiction shows
that the two sets must intersect each
other oh so now the dilemma for
basically says that the winding number
of the difference is at least three the
assumption is that the two maps I agree
in that interest is okay so that's the
only assumption the key assumption the
because they agree in the interest is so
how are we going to talk about the
difference the difference is actually 0
in that interest but the idea of getting
the winding number is just give this map
a perturbation so basically we're going
to we're going to talk about the
following map so so we probe absorb and
by a fractional linear transformation so
that this is fixed point of 3 in the on
the boundary and also at
gives three fixed points right so this
is the summons going to skip this part
basically the idea is that the two maps
I agree in the completely I agree in the
interest is so you can always give a
perturbation on one of the map f.supp
and by fractional linear transformation
so you'll get three fixed points ok so G
this new g vanishes at three points and
that little G sub M vanishes in the
interspace so you can do a perturbation
so so after the perturbation because the
map has three fixed points so the fixed
point I index must be at least three so
that's basically the idea here ok so now
so so basically at this at this time are
so we have so which we have shown the
boundedness of the secondary photo to
rupture now because of that we can take
limits and also we can take limits of
the first order derivative and it use
and use some kind of path integral idea
and tag limits we can show that F is
differentiable and it's derivative
actually it's the limit of F sub n so
this is some elementary step now the
final step actually this is going to be
the key and it's very simple shows that
actually the second order derivatives
also converges so this is at well just
this uses the same lemma lemma for here
the winding number idea so the proof bit
goes as follows so basically we have
okay as I'll finish in two minutes so
basically we have T sub and that's a
triangular interest is that contains
some sequence of points and the f sub n
other fractional linear transformation
so we have to show that the second
derivative converges to the limit the
second derivative of the lumen so we're
going to again we're going to use the
are the fixed point index okay so
basically we're going to use the
difference so f minus M so we take a
little curve and we show that this this
oriented curve has Bonnie whiny number
around zero at minimum three and this
curve j the reason is because the reason
is because F and M they agree in some
interest is inside so the whiny number
has be at least straight by lemma for
and and F minus M you take j to be so
small that this this has no other 0 so
that implies that the second order
derivatives must must be the same at p
ok ok so finally I just want to comment
a little bit on the convergence of
higher-order derivatives so first of all
we don't know how to defines us for
arbitrary combinatorial pattern but but
you can but you can still do it for the
company for the regular packing for the
hexagonal pattern because you can define
using numerical analysis basically ideas
to define the second order third order
derivatives and this was actually proved
to be convergent but we don't know how
to do this for all
for higher orders finally I just want to
recall my last last telephone call to
all debt and that was almost six years
ago and I was leaving for China and he
asked me why would I go to China he said
I wasn't was it due to 911 or something
I said no I said maybe there's a lot of
mystery pause in the u.s. about events
in China actually China is changing a
lot so on and he told me that he wished
to do some photo work with me and maybe
have some more collaboration and he was
looking forward to that unfortunately
that didn't realize and I was really but
I felt really at a loss when I heard
about old dad's passing away last year
because we lost one of my best
collaborators actually beste to the
other one was myit a PhD advisor he
anyway I feel really sorry and I was
really grateful for the invitation of
the organisation or organizing committee
to give me a chance to talk here and
share my experience okay appreciate it
sorry for the both of you
Michael he recall a little bit from
those early days when it was the NSF
postdoctoral San Diego and shot and was
there
here Doyle was there these three guys
were talked about interspecies all right
I knew there was a lot of interesting
stuff there I always stayed out of those
collaborations because I didn't want to
have to try to say that work during ever
I think it's a better word to be found
so linguistically challenged people I
was always impressed by the heads
beautiful fixed point is reliance on
elementary a logical are 20 you know he
didn't want to know if the city once
squares were degree map for the circle
that's where he wanted to live and you
realize that there was a lot of
mathematics that would come out of you
know understand
circle that we didn't have to get fancy
few hundred years so you know I I saw
this amazing simplicity I've been at the
time but you know I was also amazingly
impressed by John qez analytic work you
know that same period effect are so
interested by I remember I told Peter
gone once that I was thinking that I was
going to study analysis seriously and he
said quick you know John's phone number
that's all thing else that you levitate
so I stuck apology never less are there
other questions or comments thought
let's thank the super gay
take a quick break here of three minutes
and then start up again so 18 ft ok I'd
like to introduce our third speaker Igor
POC will speak on caged eggs and the
rigidity of convex polyhedra evil thank
thank you thank you no yes good um so
high so i'm actually deeply honored to
be asked to speak here today it's it's
really great honor so thank you
organizer for having me i'm going to
talk about something i'm going to follow
the same theme of circle packings but
i'm gonna talk a little bit more
actually mostly i'm going to talk about
collateral aspects of one particular one
particular paper which i find the
extremely beautiful so
so this is so this is a result and and
like probably many of you I'm use the
result for for many many years but I
never actually until a few years ago I
never actually opened it like like a
normal person read the proof and there
are several reasons for that but
basically I you know to be honest I
didn't think there was a convert Oryx in
it I thought there was something else
and turns out that this particular paper
is a wonderful King material result and
I'm going to talk a little bit about
that about what's inside the paper so so
this is meant to show that here is this
here and there is a convex polytope with
which I'm going to forget about pull it
up and think of just the cage which
holds this fear so I'm going to say that
the Apple atop isma scribed around the
sphere if actually all these edges are
tangent to this here okay you with me no
this is just a cage here and that's how
it all started you know people actually
looked at the cage the kinetics bodies
particular case spheres but this is this
is very strong property which is hard to
draw
Oh anyway so what a death proved is that
is this remarkable statement saying that
for every convex polyhedron there exists
another one can be utter equivalent
which which means scribes the sphere
known for every yes so for every
strictly convex body k there is a convex
polyhedron which makes scribe that
connects body so this is a much more
general result than for the sphere and
and there are there are lots of stories
behind this result so I'm going to start
with a history and we'll see how this
goes so so here is sort of a basic
motivation before many many years ago
Steinitz observed that if you if you
asked for inscribed he inscribed or
circumscribed polyhedra that doesn't
work so so a real very famous tiny
theorem says that if you have a second
acted planar graph there is this the
convex polyhedron with that draft okay
so this is saying that you cannot make
an additional requirement of all
vertices being or flying on the unit's
here that doesn't work okay and having
having everything neat scribe so having
all edges mid scribe is sort of another
way of make making stronger this
classical steines theorem and it's sort
of a miracle that works at all if you
just look at these pictures there is no
reason why this should work so here is
another less well-known motivation
geometry but actually quite and all the
questions that people ask suppose
suppose you look at all possible cages
which
called the unisphere what what would be
the total length of the talk some of
edge lengths that you need and so fair
stored busy Kovich eggleston and other
people looked at various aspects of that
so if you if you want to so in
particular if you want to say that
unisphere since completely inside the
pollito that's known and that's has a
beautiful answer that's exactly cube
whatever it is for a cube but in this
case they conjectured that it's actually
going to be a triangular prism and it
doesn't work there are better about the
polyhedron in fact answer to this
question is still open maybe no one
thought about it for 20 years but still
that's your chance the answer is still
yes so so forceful for the open one yeah
and yes yeah so and the real motivation
kind of comes from the circle packing
and it's sort of Newerth perhaps not
immediate this is the only picture with
label to draw so what you do is you take
a mid stride polyhedron and instead of
cut cut it cut your sphere along along
the fastest what you get is you get you
get a whole bunch of circles which lie
which lie on the sphere and the circles
form a circle packing and then we get
exactly into those pictures that you've
seen in two previous talks lots and lots
of sorts of packing you can obtain that
way and so so in fact in a particular
case when you're convex bodies here
that's exactly a circle packing theorem
now here is what it doesn't work it's
sort of a strange thing to put in a
slide but you'll see it in a second
so 11 sort of normal way to prove the
main results let me show you the main
result again would be to take one of the
standard proofs for the circle packing
serum take the oldest one the ones that
people first came up with the most
natural one and generalize it to general
kinetics bodies and as sort of it's a
natural way to do that and I think it
still might work so i'm not sure why it
doesn't work actually in a sense that
you you just you know Oh they've tried I
guess and it didn't work for him so so
natural way would be to say well let's
take let's say you're let's say your
polyhedron simply show so all faces are
triangles now consider all possible
position of vertices and for every edge
for every you know let's look at the
distance between that age and the
convicts body may square of the distance
if you if you want to be and and then
and then you do the usual things the way
the way people let's say you you're
generalizing cool endeavor deer or some
other variational proof of the circle
packing silver what you do is you prove
some results about this particular
functional and and you done so you prove
this convex and it attains the minimum
exactly on what you want so somehow my
you know my way of making history is
that I believe or they thought about it
and didn't work but he did figure out
that he need to generalize that to work
with a non simple polyhedra okay so she
defines the following configuration he
said well let's let's look at all
possible you know let's have not just
your thesis positioned in the space but
those vertices and fascist okay so we
have bunch of points
bunch of planes and the right functional
should have taken to account both the
edges being tangent to your convex body
and the vertices lying on the plane okay
that would be the right idea and you
need you would need to take some kind of
sum of squares of the distances oh
whatever unclear what was exactly would
work so since it does since this
approach doesn't work were hint not to
work I believe what SRAM did is he came
up it was a huge you know I just heard
about the existence of five six other
proofs so I'm not an expert on all other
proofs but he had she said in the paper
well I looked at some other proofs and
here is something so he came up with the
proof that was motivated that was
motivated by by another proof he didn't
previous paper but mid I looked at the
other paper and the motivation sort of
far-fetched you cannot see how one proof
for was from Nazareth it's not a
derivative so what what is what you said
is basically the following the most
important part of the theorem is to
proofread ooty result I'm going to and
I'm going to illustrate the duty for for
this polyhedron so let's say it's going
to be engaging a sphere and what I'm
going to fix this triangular face ok now
now what is now what SRAM says is that
there is a you know there's only one way
to position all the remaining vertices
so that this polyhedron cages sphere so
that all ages are tangent if you look at
it from a combatant oral point of view
you're amazed there is no reason for
that why would why would these vertices
in the corner somehow depends on the
Strand on the beginning that sounds
strange on the other hand if you take
the picture that we just did with
circles you remember these are the same
server this is corresponding to the two
three circles that
of them can head in his door it's
exactly the same picture so if there was
a rigidity for circle packing the has
the ability to hear so so so so now what
what she does is basically is a four-way
he proves he proves their duty result
but he doesn't want the global result so
to speak he wants a local result so what
happens when you change things
infinitesimally and and then he thinks
of that and then he wants to use in the
function theorem so he wants to say that
this indentation result is what exactly
you didn't you know saying the Jacobi of
some map is nonzero ok and and and then
you can you can start moving things
around and eventually and actually he
changes he changes the convicts body
itself he changes the cake oh and and
eventually it gets what he wants so let
me um so so what I'm going to do is
assert so I'm not going to cover the
whole the whole proof the proof has sort
of technical parts and which you won't
like and analytic parts that i
personally don't care for and I'm not
qualified to speak about so I'm going to
give you a key me at oriole park and
then and and this is this is all you
need from topology really for that proof
this is this is saying roughly the
following that if you have a map let's
say both B and a manifold connected
manifold for the same dimension and if
your map is injective continuous and
anas proper then it's actually from a
morphism then it's very important that
they have the same dimension otherwise
nothing worked ok and so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to illustrate this
topological principle on a completely
different serum and then I'm going to go
back and talk about
how you know the rigidity part of their
GG part of a death proof so so here is a
very simple question this you can ask in
maybe in high school I don't know so you
want to describe or if you have a fixed
rate fixed raise starting from the
origin and you look at this polygon and
you want to describe the sequence of
sequence of angles of angles alpha I of
all those polygons what are they do this
for many nice set okay and and well you
know you predict will discover there is
one linear relation and that this one
and there are a whole bunch of linear
inequalities which they have to satisfy
so what I mean is you can have all those
angles to be concentrating in one
direction and there is basically zero
here that's impossible and this is where
these inequalities come from that's the
only restriction um now now here is a
key observation and this is going to be
sort of a rigidity result for the angles
own race and the result is the following
if you have two polygons with the same
sequence of angles then one has to be an
expansion of the other okay that sounds
easy enough to have a short proof and
this is the whole proof you you make one
polygon to the tynion starts so it fits
inside resume and start slowly expanding
it you expand it until it hits the big
one then there's going to be one of the
angles smaller than the other done so
this is them and so this is the kind of
rigidity results that now you can you
can take let me let me go back to the
serum so so so now if you think about it
you have a map fight from coordinates of
your kisses along the race into the
angles and
that map is it continues its injective
from what we just proved and it's a
proper that takes a little bit of
thinking and it's actually a both sets
are connected and then you're done then
from Jeff this almost trivial or gt
result so to speak i would say
uniqueness result you get the results
that you know give it given the set of
angles which decides those inequalities
they're just a polygon with shortages on
the race which has those angles that's
the idea that's a very basic idea and
that the same idea that Odette uses in
his that i did use in his proof so so
just to illustrate that this is this you
know angus is not a toy this is the real
serum and this is of alexandra so this
is three-dimensional version of the same
result for or on the plane okay we are
instead of angles you get her which is a
birthday section and the his his
Alexandra's idea was that he should
discretize suppose you have a convex
body you take a curvature projected on a
unit sphere and the question is can you
reconstruct the convex body from this
gaussian curvature so this is a discrete
version of that resolve okay and you can
actually prove the continuous version
using this feature all right now when I
now want to present a much easier result
than what SRAM had but i'm going to show
you this can be a total of tools that
SRAM users and hopefully you can get a
flavor for what's exactly is in that
paper what is where is the kinetics so
i'm going to so this is van-g GT serum
which people often confuse with keshiri
duty serum and in fact there are sort of
neither of them implies the charger
because the way Cassius tae
its uniqueness result and this isn't a
similar do it yourself ok so both
results are saying that if you have to
to pull the tops then if you have one
put one convex polytope then they spoil
it up is rigid so you cannot you cannot
move vertices around so that all the
edge lengths are preserved for a
simplicial potahto now why is this
victor no no it's not it's not weaker no
she doesn't khushi a uniqueness result
which may may may be something that
comes from the second order GTA not
everything that's not everything that
unique is infinitesimally rigid remember
the information in rotation
so correct so let me let me say it again
so both both Koshien then reduce a serum
show you that you cannot continuously
deform but the museum's i apply the
chatter okay crochet is that global is a
global result so anyhow let me define
what's infinitesimal motion I'm going to
put a velocity vector velocity vector in
every vertex and I'm going to say that
in synthetic new motion is if this
difference between the oct vectors
always are talking about to the to the
edge vector well and and technology if
every infinitesimal motion is actually
rigid motion all right it's important to
understand clear what I just said yeah
oh you're not following and why why it's
not weaker
me too but I connected by a
he was motion
but
my coach is not weaker I mean every
tooth taken implies another but it's not
directly you cannot derive one from
another now anyhow let me let me let me
show you what what what what what
exactly this shrub do so what I'm going
to do is I'm going I'm going to prove
I'm going to weaken we can this property
we can this property of for
infinitesimal motion I'm going to allow
a larger set of possible velocities ok
and I'm going to so what I all I'm going
to do is require them to have basically
the same sign when projected onto the
edge vector that's a much bigger
property so if the orthogonal is a boss
orthogonal but if if one has a negative
negative projections and so with another
ok and and I do that so I i'm going to
orient all the edges depending on this
side ok so all that's important going to
be the sign signs along the edges and
and then basically what you need is a
completely crematoria Liz that saying
that if you have any kind of vectors at
if you have any kind of velocity vectors
appointing from each vertex so that so
that one particular triangular face is
fixed then a done and it satisfies all
these three properties then the whole
than the whole orientation there is no
orientation all that L pages are not
oriented we have we have basically zeros
everywhere
the whole the whole all velocity vectors
becomes zero that's what you prove okay
and that's a conveyor torial result so
so this is this is almost directly from
Schramm's paper what what she does is
she looks at orientations and he defines
just almost like an inn in the proof of
Kashi but somewhat different also he
defines this full versions and half
conversions so in particular so if you
have if you have a age oriented to into
into the vortex and another oriented out
of the vortex that's going to be two
halves it's one full inversion but
you're going to have lots of unoriented
edges so this is an orientation this and
you get and it gets half inversion in
each on each side all right so that's
that's what he does and and then and
then a little convene at aura
observations this lemma 1 which you can
obtain by just basically looking at all
possibilities if you like that that this
this set of Schramm's inversions is
actually very good in a sense that it is
there is at least one light vertx in a
triangle then then the then the whole
triangle has at least one inversion and
line vertex think of line gore-tex is
the one that that's actually moved by
those velocity vectors so so so that
that's a believe it or not that's half
of the proof so here is another half of
the proof so previously previously we
bounded the number of inversions from
below now we're going to bound them from
above by making the following generation
stead of looking triangles I'm going to
look at the vertices and and turns out
that if you start looking the vertices
there at most two inversions around
every light verjus
and again you can just consider all the
possibilities in in each vertex or so I
should probably point out that you
cannot have a edge going in out in out
simply because there is this edge this
all this edges are convex so let's say
they're pointing towards the book
towards a blackboard then then
projection of velocity vector has to be
sort of pointing in one direction you
cannot have them alternating and that's
all you need to do for the lamb metal to
just absorb that and the rest is Euler
formula and double counting argument
that's that's how the proof goes and so
I know you want to go to lunch let's see
so let me just say that this is somehow
finish with an anecdote from that from
that paper so I actually looked at
looked at all these details and at some
point that got really confused because a
debt spends like two paragraph signing
some end those calculating some formula
and later on I realized that that's
owners former so in addition to proving
many other things including dense
rigidity theorem he proves Euler's
formula you know using a non-standard
new proof of Euler's for her okay so
that's it thank you
are there any questions
not a completely different it then
calculated the determinant as a product
of its a beautiful dance had a beautiful
proof 1959 reddit very careful let me
plug it it's also in my book Odin German
choose your language
other questions if not let's thank the
