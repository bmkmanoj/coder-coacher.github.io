developers to do distributed computing
at a large scale in a simple way a small
data set might be tens of gigabytes and
medium-sized would be maybe a couple of
terabytes and some jobs go up to
hundreds of terabytes the sets are too
large to analyze on a single computer
you know in the past maybe you've done
it using sequel server and now you want
to use a cluster of hundreds or maybe
even thousands of computers and so we
need a simple way to program that is
trusted over the last 10 years or so
more and more people have had access to
very large data sets so writing
distributed computation is hard and
there are a lot of things you need to be
concerned about like fault tolerance and
how the things are being managed on a
large data center so what the
combination of dried and the dry link
allows you to write very simple program
and the programmer does doesn't have to
know anything about distributed
computation so the program is compiled
and there is execution drive execution
plan is generated and and the sort of
the entire commutation is shaped it to
the cluster and that's all the program
is executed there and that the result
comes back triad is the system that
executes the program that you write and
it's in charge of taking the program
that you've written on your local
computer shipping it out to all of the
computers in the cluster and then
managing the parts of the program as
different parts execute on the different
computers monitoring those if there's a
failure somewhere re running that failed
part and at the end gathering together
all of the answers and reporting them
back to your local computer there's a
programming language which we called
ride link which is a combination of the
link operators that are in the standard
net languages and our distributed
execution system which is called dryad
the basic idea is that any pro any
program who can write program in darnet
and a link should be able to write a dry
the program so dry it lets researchers
and and practitioners do things they
couldn't do before apparently just
because of the the saving in time
so if there's a job that you need to run
every day it has to take less than a day
to run and so certainly it being that's
very important they have daily jobs that
would have taken weeks before they had a
distributed computing system like dryad
there are also problems that have a very
large working set and so they need a lot
of memory and so being able to use all
of the computers in the cluster at once
make those jobs feasible where they
wouldn't have been feasible before as
computing is increasingly moving away
from the desktop and into the cloud more
and more people are going to be using
systems like dried to run their jobs on
clusters whether they know it or not
