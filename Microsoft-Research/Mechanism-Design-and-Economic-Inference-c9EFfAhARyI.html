you
okay we're going to go ahead and get
started I welcome to the MSR cloak Liam
and very pleased to introduce to
introduce Jason Hartline from
Northwestern University he was my
colleague for several years and he moved
to Northwestern from Microsoft so he's
also been all of your colleagues at some
point in the past he's done a lot of
phenomenal work on algorithmic mechanism
design especially focusing on
approximations in mechanism design and
sort of spurred a whole field that looks
at these kinds of questions and today
he's going to talk to us about mechanism
design for data science he's also very
skilled at wearing purple thank you it's
good to be back here so this is a joint
work with my colleagues shuchi chela and
Dennis who is also your colleague is
frequently by here and this has been for
me a really fun collaboration between
myself and choo chee hoo hoo doo
approximation in Mecca design kind of
work and dennis is an economy trish in'
trying to understand the interplay
between mechanism design and issues
relating to doing inference with data
sets that come from economic systems and
so I am completely confident of Dennis's
ability as an Oracle for everything
economic counter metric and so if you
ever want to know something about that
you should definitely ask him and any
any econometrics mistakes that I'm a car
because I misunderstood what he was
telling me ok so this is when I think of
you know what the promise of data
science is I think of the following high
level goal the high level goal is that
well if we have lots of data from
complicated systems where things
interacting then if we can understand
that data we can use that understanding
to them potentially
you make decisions or change the system
so that things work better okay so we
might like to then for instance optimize
performance with the understanding we
have from the data oh but frequently if
the decision we're making is then going
to impact how behavior is then generated
then this decision we make we optimize
performance will then come back and
affect the behavior in the system what
this means is we need to predict
behavior in the new system to know if
the change is going to work well not
just know how people were behaving in
the old system okay so we're going to
have to do something called inference
which is to see how people were behaving
and infer how they're going to behave if
we make any given change to the system
okay and a central observations is going
to motivate this work is that not all
systems induced behavior that permit
good inference so it won't be the case
that everything every decision you might
make in optimizing performance will lead
to a system where you can infer the
things you want to infer so that you can
then optimize the system so because of
this we're going to need to understand
how to make systems that are good both
for inference and for performance so
that we can have this mentality of 0
with design a system and let's see how
it's working it lets infer stuff from
the date in that system and then tune
the system in the future so that
continues to work well okay today I'm
going to focus on some problems in
auction theory as my examples of where
this situation is going to come up but
my my perspective is that this kind of
methodology applies to any system where
the behavior is endogenous to prep for
is that aren't necessarily in the data
themselves but then have to be inferred
from the data and where behavior will
depend on how the system is actually
working itself and so good ok so I'm
going to be motivating this work with
simple auction examples and I'll start
out with a simple too bitter one item
highest bid wins first price auction
okay so i have two bidders who want to
win one item i'm selling and i'm going
to award this item to the bitter who
bids the most i'm going to charge in
their bid okay and let's suppose this
situation happens a number of times and
i have data sets for 200 different
oxygens but from similar a similar
population to bidders ok so now the
question is suppose I care about
optimizing my revenue the question is
how shall I adapt my auction to get more
revenue using this data okay well to
answer that question the first thing I
might want to know is what auctions get
good revenue and so if I turn to the
economic theory then I would learn for
instance that the revenue optimal
auction for a large class of problems is
just the first price auction with the
reserve price which is a nice really
simple auction so the instead of just
running the first price option as I did
here I'm going to run the first place
oxygen with reserve meaning I won't
accept bids below some minimal value
okay so that's the optimal auction good
so I have data I know I want to run this
optimal auction I need to determine a
good reserve price from my data okay
that's like the starting problem okay so
we're going to sort of walk through this
example looking at the data and what
happens when we I get reserves I want to
comment though that when i said i'm
going to have data what I mean is a
synthetic data that I made up from a
model that I had in mind already and not
real data which is actually helpful for
stuff I want to do because then I can
tell you about every single
counterfactual I might want to tell you
about because it's synthetic data and
this theorem requires some
distributional assumptions which I'm not
going to tell you about but it's not
going to matter okay yes yeah I'm
assuming all of my bidders and all the
auctions come from the same population
so there's very symmetric so that wasn't
there another question yes yes okay so
here's the data that I have so we ran a
bunch of first price too bitter auctions
and I've numbered the auctions 1 through
200 I've shown you the two bids I've
shown you the revenue which is obviously
the maximum of the two numbers because
if I have two bids and its first price
the winner is the bitter with the
highest bid and they pay their bid so
this is what's going on so here's a
first thing you might try to do to
figure out how to come up with a good
reserve price and this is not going to
work but I just want to put this up as
something that you might have thought to
do before thinking about the endogenous
behavior that's going on so I can
simulate the reserves using the old bid
data so i could assume that when i put a
reserve no one's going to change their
behavior there's going to bid the way
they were bidding before okay and then i
can just calculate what the new revenue
would be so of course when i add a
reserve i'm going to lose revenue
because bids below the reserve are no
longer if both bid to blow the reserve
then i get nothing right because that's
i'm losing revenue here um and with a
reserve bidders should raise their bids
to account for the reserve but because
i'm just simulating with the old data
they're not doing that so this would
tend to drive bids back up but it's not
going to be happening here because i'm
using the old data okay and so the
problem with with doing this failed
approach is that simulation does not
account for bidders
raising their bids at all and as you
might expect as I simulate here using
whichever point five my revenue only
goes down why because I'm just taking
the places where they're both below the
reserve and zeroing them out like here
they're both letters everybody is zero
it out so I just put zeros places where
i was getting revenue of course again
here because I have kinetic data I can
do the counterfactual be like what would
really have happened had I use this
reserve well really everyone would have
been more and my real revenues are here
and I'm getting more revenue okay and I
could similarly add a higher reserve
again I'm zeroing out more columns here
getting even lower revenue and with the
real reserves I'm getting even higher
revenue okay so the takeaway point here
is that I really have to think about the
model that the bidders have that's
making them bid if I want to do anything
because if I just simulate a new
mechanism with the old data it's not
telling me anything useful at all it's
telling me the revenues just going down
down down when in fact it's going up up
up okay so I want to continue with this
example and see what's going on with
another perspective so what I want to do
is I want to take the bids that I've
received in this auction and sort them
by decreasing bid so all the bids are
here they're all sorted and I just
normalize this access to go from 0 to 1
so 1 is all of my bids and 0 with none
of my bids and now I want to see what
the behavioral revenue is by actually
calculate the counterfactual what should
happen versus my simulation revenue for
various reserve prices i could post and
of course if I have no reserve price
well then that was where the these
things were the same so they're both the
same bids and now i can think of adding
a reserve price of point 5 and in the
simulation what does that do which is
says everyone
are you are getting less rabbiting the
point 5 you've lop off the revenue right
and in the simulation well the people
below are going to not no longer show up
but now other people going to bid more
and that's going to drive revenue up
okay and so to see how much what the
change was what we lost this little
triangle here but we gained all of this
ok so the revenue goes up I use another
a 0.75 again we lose some revenue goes
up again and actually as you can see my
bids are all below one right which if
you had bits below one you like well
should i use the reserve price of one
that seems terrible if your bids are all
below one but if that gets table for the
simulation but in behavioral revenue
that's actually still your revenues
going up right and so somehow in my data
all the bids were below one and I'm
saying well actually using richard price
of one is great for this data ok and in
fact now if i start using a high reserve
there was the revenue starts to drop the
point seven seven and then point six
five and in fact using reach over of one
was actually the best reserved to use in
this situation so is it clear what's
what's going on ok so that's my
introduction I now want to tell you what
I'm going to be talking about in this
talk so I'm going to start talking about
inference for predicting behavior in
auctions so we can see what we have to
do so basically you want to look at the
data we want to try to come up with the
model that generated the data so then we
can when we change the auction go
forward and see what that new auction
revenue would get ok I'm then I'm going
to look at a revenue optimal auction so
as I said in the first slide the revenue
otha option for instance might be a
first price auction with reserve and
we'll see that this is not going to be a
very good auction for inference if we
ran this off
auction would not have good inference
and so if we want to run a good option
to get good revenue but also maintain
the property that we can analyze our
data and have good inference so we can
tune the auction in the future we're
going to have to do something that's not
revenue optimum we're going to sacrifice
revenue to get good inference and so the
last part of the talk will be to the
revelation subject to good inference and
we'll see the kind of options we get
when we do this okay so to start off
let's talk about what how we're going to
do inference how we're going to infer
what bidders would do in a different
auction given the often we actually ran
okay and so my the fundamental
assumption for our auction is that the
bidders are happy with the bids they
made in the auction bitters bid and
before knowing what would happen they're
happy with the bid but because they
chose the bid so they must be happy with
it right and so more formally what this
means is the bidders bids must be a best
response to the competing distribution
of bids right if a bitter knew what the
other bids were in the auction they
could then optimize their bid to figure
out what the best bid was for them okay
and so they're happy if they've done
this optimization okay so what's what's
nice about this statement though is that
they're trying to optimize versus the
competing bids and the competing bids
are what's in the data we have a bunch
of samples from the bid distribution so
we know what the bitter draught the
Mizen against so we can put ourselves in
their perspective and say well for any
value for the good you're selling I
might that bitter might have what should
they bid in this auction given that the
competing bid distribution looks like
this and so given them we can figure out
what any value should a bid and if we
can figure out what every value should
be we can invert that function and
figure out what value
use a bitter who bid something could
have and once we know their values then
we can get a distribution of values and
once we have a tradition of values we
can figure out what would happen in any
other out who might want to run yeah no
I'm not a bidder's bid must be best
response to the competing bid
distribution I'm assumed that they have
optimized their bid for the distribution
of bids that are arising in the auction
so maybe they know the distribution of
bids or at least they've optimized to it
and changing their bid doesn't give them
anything yeah I am assuming that when
they realize that changing their bid
does not give them more revenue they
stop changing their bid so it's not your
it's not the same details right they can
sorry the auctions I'm running are all
different bidders every single time so
the story where someone learns is a
separate story that's assumed that each
auction there was a process of learning
and then people bid that way but i'm not
talking about learning at all they
somehow figured out how to do this ok so
good let's look at our example this was
the example data i had before so our
competing bid distribution is observed
in the data great now we can figure out
how someone might bid so given the bid
distribution i want to solve with a bid
strategy then i want to invert that
bicester as you get the bitters value
from their bid so let's see this example
for the data we have ok so if I were to
look at this bid distribution i would
say that looks really uniform to me it
looks like the line if this axis i call
q this is 1 minus q okay so it looks
like a uniform distribution I'm good so
if I told you you're bidding in an
auction and the person you're bidding
against is bidding according to the
uniform distribution how should you bid
and so suppose your value is B let's
figure out what bid be you should make
give them that the competing bid is
uniform okay well what is your utility
giving your values be if you bid be
well if you win with your bid then your
utility is your value minus your bid as
you gain your value you pay your bid
that's your utility okay good and I know
all these things because I know the
probability you win with bid be because
it's a uniform distribution so for any
bid be I can say what's the probably you
win well the other guy is random from
the distribution so they're either going
to be here beating you or here losing to
you and what's that probability well if
it's uniform that's exactly 1 minus B
right so that's this area and so that's
1 minus B and this is V minus B sorry V
this is B naught 1 minus B this little
area probably you win is 1 minus B
probably lose be probably you win is be
probably loses 1 minus be good and V
minus B so I've drawn this area your
utility which is exactly this formula
probably would be is this whip and V
minus B is that with that's a rectangle
so what am I saying you're doing you're
trying to optimize the area's rectangle
somewhere here okay and simplifying this
formula you get this equation which you
can take the real effective be insult
set it to zero and solve and you see
that you should bid half your value in
equilibrium like that's your best
strategy good well if I think that every
you should bid half their value and I
see your bid then I know your value is
right your value is twice your bid and
if the bids are uniform 01 and
everyone's value is twice their bid and
the values your uniform 02 so now I know
the value distribution and so I did this
for the uniform station you can do this
for any tribution you it's the same
basic calculation okay so
and then from value distribution I can
solve for equal behavior any auction I
want and so now i can say what's the
optimal walking forward this
distribution i can tell you what it is
okay so we look through this in pieces
if i put these pieces all together then
i will get this equation as a formula
for my value as a function of the
observables like the bid and then when i
differentiate i get the derivative the
bid function and this term which is the
allocation probability so X of Q is it
probably the player who's the cute
highest amongst the distribution of bids
when's the auction in X prime of Q is
the derivative of that function okay and
let's note this is the imprint equation
that we get out from doing that
calculation we do in the previous slide
so what are these things so this is the
allocation as a function of how strong
you are that's known and so for the
examples I gave this probability of
winning is 1 minus how strong you are
and the derivative is minus 1 okay
that's this it's basically the function
the function we had before was the line
1 minus Q that's the function and its
derivatives minus 1 okay now our just
our bids that's what we don't know yet
in the auction we're trying to infer
that we can observe that in the data but
we don't necessarily know it without
observing the data we must infer these
okay and so from the picture we drew we
said well this distribution looks
basically like 1 minus Q again and the
derivative is like minus 1 and we plug
into this formula and we inferred that
the value distribution was like this
which actually the the primes are both
minus 1 so they cancel and we get a 1
minus Q plus 1 minus Q which is 2 times
1 minus Q which is their bidding twice
their values yeah it's just walking
through everything we did before but we
of an example so good so I want to
basically imply this formula where the
exes are known and I have to get
estimators for the bids and the
derivative bids that's tenancy what you
have to do to this inference problem
okay so let's just see what are the
issues with this so if I have n samples
from the bid distribution then I can use
standard estimators for B hat and they
have rate square root n ok now it's
going to be a little bit harder to
estimate the derivative of the bid
function but there are standard
estimators for estimating the derivative
of the distribution you're observing but
they have rate that's bigger than square
root n and those are based on some
assumptions like continuity and
basically the assumptions that you make
then tell you how much bigger the rate
is that's also kind of standard where
we're going with this actually is that
we're going to be able to infer good
auctions using only this and not this so
actually if this part is confusing to
you then don't worry we're not going to
have to use it but if you were to do
like the naive straightforward approach
you'd be do using these two things and
doing what we said before okay one thing
that you should note is probably pretty
important it better be that X prime of Q
is is not going to 0 right because look
it appears to the denominator here and
if I'm trying to infer something and one
of the things is going to 0 I'm could be
in big trouble and then denominator
right so that I could be worried about
that's going to come up probably on the
next slide slide after the next slide
okay so that's the basic of imprint
that's what you would do in auction
straight up applying econometrics to
this auction problem that's what you
would do okay now I want to talk about
optimizing auction revenue and looking
at whether they can get good imprints
from those auctions okay so on my very
second slide I said the bread wapo
oxygen was the first price auction with
reserved under some distributional
assumptions and I want to point out
something super obvious for bidders with
values below the reserve I cannot infer
anything right super obvious but that
came out of my formula also because the
derivative of the allocation rule for
those bidders is zero so this thing I'm
trying to invert which has that in the
denominator just going to blow up okay
so this is problematic why well suppose
I have a population of bitters and we're
using an optimal octant we have a
reserve price and we're running this
auction and then we do some advertising
but our advertising only targets lower
value bidders and so now more lower
evaluate or show up and it would be
getting me more revenue to lower my
reserve price but I never see that in my
data because I'm already using a reserve
price that excludes these lower value
bitters so this is problematic so and
that was it's really sort of the moto
fight motivating goal this work is that
optimal auctions don't necessarily give
you good inference so if you want to
design good auctions you have to
sacrifice off the mound and get back
your inference properties you want ok
good so let's talk about revenue
optimization subject to good inference
I want to change settings from a single
item auction to a more general setting
talk about inference and the setting and
I talked about is the one that people
use to model the advertising on internet
search engine so Microsoft Bing shows
ads on the side of the page that's as or
Sheldon auctions you typically model
those with decreasing click
probabilities for each slot and that
corresponds to this situation so I have
n agents or bidders I have n positions
these are the flotsam side of the page
each position as a probability of click
which I'll call weights which are
decreasing as you go down the page ok I
would like to design a good auction for
this situation that has revenue and good
inference properties why because I want
to then look at the data and optimize my
auction as the data changes this has a
special cases the auction we were
talking about before so the single item
auction is just this exact same thing
but where the weight for position 1 is 1
and the way for all our pigeons is 0 and
I can generalize that to give a
multi-unit auction where the weights for
the first say K of the positions is all
one and the ways for all substitutions
is 0 so most of my examples actually
give for this and so we won't really be
talking about this one yeah so as the
distribution drifts will you be assuming
that the bidders will actually be
bidding according to the same
distribution because I mean according to
the new distribution because the bidders
don't observe the right fit so I'm going
to assume that as the distribution
shifts the bitters follow the
distribution I'm assuming that the
district is shifting Moore's got kind of
slowly and they'll be updating their
best responses and the actually the
distribution is observed by the bidders
because as new bidder show up
I they will be bidding for the
strategies that they should be when they
show up and said administration changes
okay the point is if I have all of a
sudden more lower valued bitters and I
all of a sudden also have more lower
valued bids I so I actually do you do
see this in the data right away I see I
guess the point is that the bid's at the
base of the values below the reserve
will not affect other people's best
response anyway so so we're not gonna
have options with reserves anyway so
that's not going to matter but and that
that's the reason why is because we had
no inference for these any these bids
blood the reserve at all in the first
place yeah maximizing revenue we
understand that technically right but
they usually couldn't friends what do
you mean so as an example of what you
might need for good inference a minimal
thing is remember X prime can't go to
zero so we need kind of lower bound on X
prime but how the allocation rule
changes so what is X prime members X is
the probability of winning as a function
how strong you are and X prime is how
that changes as your strength changes
it's the derivative okay and so if the
auction is not very sensitive to how
strong you are right it means like if
you change your your bid a little bit
nothing really changes this is going to
be really bad for imprints for obvious
reasons okay so what we're going to what
it's going to turn out too we're going
to need for good inference is it just a
lower bound on X prime it'll be that
simple
okay so I want to give you an example of
the kind of thing we're going to get so
that when I then say more formally what
we're going to get you'll know what the
pieces correspond to okay so let's
imagine this end bitter k unit auctions
I've been bidders had k units I can view
this as a position auction right where
the first k weights are one in the last
n minus K weights or zero good so here's
a picture my first k weights are one
mile asked a waiter zero so here's an
auction you could run that would get
close to the optimal revenue and have
good imprint properties let's let K
prime B they expect the number of units
sold if we ran the optimal auction so
the Alpha auction might use a reserve
price right and in expectation it's
going to sell some number of units okay
it's not going to sell more than K units
because the only Oh has k units it's
going to some stuff in k prime less than
K units so let's take a prime B about
that ok so here i drawn k prime as some
number less than K okay again if you'd
as a position auction I now want to make
sure that i have that people really want
to be in the order that they're in and
one thing you'll notice here is that all
these guys up here they're kind of
indifferent to where they are they're
all getting the good and all these guys
down here kind of indifferent to where
they're they're getting the good so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to steak
take mass and shift it downwards like
this so now everyone is really much
happier in their position than in the
next position okay so i basically I've
added it's like an epsilon stare where
this width is epsilon okay and adding
this epsilon stare ensures that X prime
is at least some epsilon which will then
come into my imprints equation and let
me show that i have good inference
okay so this is an example of what an
auction could do to let you see like
what the space of things looks like
we're going to be trying to do and one
of the things you can see here is we're
basically simulating having a reserve
price but not really using a Verger
price we're actually just ordering the
bidders and if they're the K prime top
ones basically win but with slightly
fewer clothes probability as you as you
are not less top and the what n minus K
prime bidders basically lose but they
actually have a small probability
winning yeah I don't know if you're
going here but with neural nets right
they had this problem that they could
either have a learning mechanism or they
could have things with step functions
and at some point someone said we could
put a differentiable function that looks
kind of like a step function in here by
using a sigmoid function is that and it
worth is exactly um and one of the
things that are one of the things that's
nice about a que unit auction versus an
auction with a reserve price so the
reserve price cuts off exactly at your
value so it's got a sharp drop at your
value whereas a que unit auction well if
we happen to have more high bidders now
than average or less high bidders now
than average actually smooth is out the
step okay so just the K unit auction
it's a really good all just a nice
smooth step just because if I draw
random people from the diffusion I have
you know potential having a slightly
more higher ones than usual or slightly
less higher ones than usual so it gives
you a very nice smooth function and
we're going to work directly with those
nice smooth functions that we get out of
the K unit auction okay um so
a rank based auction is a auction where
I just order I ordered the bidders based
on their bids and then how people get
allocated depends only on this order and
not on their actual bids okay so in the
previous slide I'm assuming that I
ordered the bidders by their bids and
then the first bidder got this slide the
second bidder got this slot but they're
bitter got this slot right and got this
blue probability okay now if I actually
had this constraint k what that really
means is I'm ordering them by the
bidders and then running some auction
that already froze out some like
sometimes doesn't serve the cave highest
person right and that's still in a rank
based auction because that decision is
made based on the person's rank and not
based on their bid okay so if I'm have a
position auction environment with these
weights then when I'm optimizing ranked
based auctions what can I do well I can
take weight and shift it downwards I can
also take weight on Lopez and to just
drop it so dropping weights like a
reserve price and shifting weight
downwards is another option you another
thing you can do okay and again here's
my picture of what these two things look
like so I shifted I basically drop this
weight here and then I shifted way
downward okay um so I'm going to be
claiming that rank based auctions have
both good revenue and good inference
properties and so I'm now going to talk
about how they have good revenue and how
you optimize revenue and how they have
good inference and how you do infringe
for rank based auctions I'm going to use
it a pretty high level though okay so
the first thing I want to do is consider
running the K unit auction for every k
if I have some
auction situation consider running the
community for every k and let pkb their
revenue of the K unit auction for each
of the KS and let's let w prime of kb
the difference in successive position
wait so it's this for instance it was
that epsilon is going down and then at k
prime it dropped a lot it was a big
number and then it was an epsilon going
down in my picture before so basically
you can view a position auction as a
convex combination of these K unit
auctions and so if your revenue for each
K in an auction is given by PK and the
convex combination actually has
probability w prime K on B&amp;amp;K unit
auction then you can you to write your
revenue yet based on linearity as this
sum ok what does this mean this means a
position auction revenue is given
entirely and only by knowing what these
PKS are ok which means if I want to do
imprints and I want to then optimize a
position auction the only thing I need
to know for this imprint is the P case I
do not need to infer the the value curve
okay so these are enough to do all the
inverts I want to do also these are not
for the optimization I want to do and so
let's talk about this optimization we
need to know these P these p1 through
PM's to optimize and the auction that
optimizes revenue for these given P 1
through P n will actually look a lot
like the optimal option from the
economics literature except that up
logically economic literature uses the
distribution to determine revenues and
here we use this basically we can view
p1 through pianos like an empirical
distribution and we're using those
instead so our optimal auction for these
rank that for ranked based auctions
looks exactly like the Alpha option the
literature except that it uses the peas
as an empirical distribution instead of
the actual value distribution
yeah so when you say the search option
is just a comment combination of these
cute I'm assuming that you're randomized
over K unit auctions with k being
randomized that's right and when do you
announce this is K you never know this
is this this is um the state but point
is a position auction is isomorphic to a
situation where you picked a random k
for this we should rent a Kenyan auction
and since they're the same I some work
that it's the same structurally that
means people play the same way in them
and it means the revenue is the same in
the both settings so I'm actually going
to run the position auction I'm not
going to pick a k and then running k you
an auction but the revenue i get is the
exact same 02 situation so i want to
talk about revenue the revenue it's the
viewpoint of randomizing a bouquet and
picking k from with this probability is
a good viewpoint for understanding how
to get revenue i see that point of view
for incentive compatible auctions for
nice incompatible auctions is it clear
that the people will play the
equilibrium just as a rad new
improvements okay okay yeah who are not
versed in auction three like what you
were optimizing in the very first
example you were doing before you were
having this idea that there's going to
be reserved price exactly and so when I
say they're structurally similar what do
I mean the optimal auction for that's
ranked based will have a reserve rank
okay and everyone above the reserve rank
wins everybody below the reserve rank
losses okay that's exactly what I mean
so any sort of intuition that you have
from optimal auction theory will
translate directly to let you think
about these things so if we have the
intuition it was a reserve price auction
than that intuition translates exactly
towards our rank auction just so I
completely understand where you're going
with this the problem before with the
reserve price auction was you could have
real data that you've gotten from some
people but because of this property that
you
can't tell what the people who fall
below the reserve would have done you
can't figure out a way to use your
existing data to come up with an optimal
reserve value and with this approach you
can now in theory run it on some people
and then later on decide would reserve
value should have been based on them yes
and because of the point you made
earlier the reserve rank auction has a
smooth allocation rule because of this
people coming from a distribution right
so it looks more like this the Sigma
light that you were talking about
whereas the reserve price auction drops
abruptly when your value gets below the
reserve it goes to 0 there right and so
it's got this abrupt thing which means
it's you can't do in French below but
I'm actually going to make an additional
change additional like fix that I can
also add this constraint that I want the
changes in successive positions to be at
least epsilon which is in my previous
picture why i got these steps going down
okay so if I don't do this I will still
have not so good inference at the far
away from where it drops right and this
makes sure i have good inference
everywhere so this is just optimizing
ranked based I want to optimize subject
to good inference I add this constraint
yeah
so for a one item auction the bays Nash
equilibrium is unique when the players
are symmetric right but here for
position options it's also unique but
you can get an assumption that you need
yesterday do you need these to the
identification because otherwise you can
assume that he's there now you don't
need unique and speaker libram to get
identification because people are just
best responding to the bid distribution
and you're observing the bid
distribution and so you can see what
their values are
make like some periods I'm looking
that's true you would have to be so for
instance if I want to look at
potentially other equilibrium I mean the
ecolitans are unique so talking about
this is kind of like an academic
exercise if you had a situation with eco
we're not unique and you I sort of said
okay players player 1 there's player too
and each time I assume that player 1
player 2 are playing the same
equilibrium the same not unique
equilibrium then I can do the same thing
right obviously if people are picking
higley pigley's time which equilibria
are playing I don't know what yeah I
could say
okay okay let's talk about inference for
these ranked based options so as I said
before the allocation rule is known
because it's a rank based auction and I
written down with his action ways are
and essentially we're then looking at
how this gets smoothed out by drawing
from a distribution which is again like
the sigmoid right which smooths it a
little bit but we know exactly how it's
getting smoothed out we need to estimate
these these are these p 1 through P n
and you're able to estimate P 1 2 pn
based only on the big distribution to
what you see in the data and X you do
not need the derivative to estimate
these Peas I'm not going to let the
details about why this is the case the
the intuition is is that it comes from
this actually the smoothness of the
smoothness of the allocation rule okay
and therefore estimator has this ideal
rate of root n which is the best to rate
you can have for an estimator okay
so I want to summarize with sort of if I
were to write a theorem statement with
what is the main result here the main
result here is do you give me any
petition weights and any value
distribution then I can come up with a
rank based auction which approximately
optimal in terms of revenue and has good
inference properties and the way I do it
is like on the previous slide I used
basically optimal washing theory but
applied to the empirical distribution
given by the P 1 through P ends and I
get good inference by maintaining that
the successive slots have at least this
epsilon drop I'm going to have made some
very mild assumptions on the
distribution to get this theorem I can't
have really really heavy tail
distributions meaning a bitter shows up
only once every sort of million tries it
has a really high value like that I
can't deal with but for things that
we're that doesn't happen then you're
fine okay so to conclude system
performance and inference depend on the
design of the system so if you're
thinking about optimizing a system and
you want to be able to re optimize your
system as you get data for your system
and your your data is based on people's
behaviors but not based on original but
based on their behaviors and you don't
observe their actual preferences then
you need to think about designing the
system itself to have both good
inference and get good performance we
talked about how the optimal auctions
which are value-based by using reserve
prices in value space are bad for
imprints we saw that rank based auctions
are good for inference and we can get
approximately optimal revenue with those
and we saw that structurally these
optimal rank based options look very
similar to up mo value-based elections
they just use ranks instead of values
and here is my
picture for kind of what it looks like
thank you yeah I guess this would bring
up the question you mentioned this
epsilon that you need to figure out how
good welcome to for your inference and
this epsilon also must have some
relation to how much you're losing an
optimality yes that's great so here's
the point the way to think about this is
how many samples do you think you're
going to have before the world has
changed enough that you want to change
your auction okay look at that many
samples now choosing epsilon so that
you've inferred enough with that many
samples and that's the right epsilon
obviously the smaller epsilon the better
t choose a smallest epsilon where you've
learned enough in that many samples to
get what you want now that makes sense I
guess this next question will probably
move beyond where where you guys are
because your theory people um would do
you have any ideas of places or options
or things that you might do where you
can take a look at and figure out what
that epsilon number might be for
something real worldly like I want to
put my clarinet for sale on eBay with a
reserve price of X could I use this to
study the previous clarinet sales of
similar people to figure out anything
fun um so this is naturally set up for
this situation of position options which
are how people sell ads on search
engines and so that's one example where
you could think to try to do this
instead of what people are doing which
is using reserve prices okay so one
thing I will say is that this is we've
been looking at this in the sort of big
end Big K case because we want to
understand situations where it could be
really hard to get good revenue if I
have small n in small K actually lots of
things at good revenue and I can't
really separate good from bad very
easily
to understand structurally what's good
and what's bad in a in a real situation
you're probably thinking of running you
probably have small K and small n like
so for the position auctions maybe I
have 30 advertisers and maybe k is like
six ads on the side of the page and when
in these cases when K is really small
you don't even have to do the thing with
the epsilon okay because what you care
about is the derivative of the
allocation rule and for that few number
of bidders these things that are smooth
are already going to put smooth is
everywhere okay so you actually wouldn't
even do a thing with an epsilon you just
do a rank based reserve essentially yeah
so you assuming that advertisers are
going to respond to the fact that you
might use their bids to change future
reserves or his idea that it's different
advertisers so it would so the model I'm
talking about here is just a pure
imprints model where I assume the
bidders are new bidders each time so
there's no strategic behavior between
the people I'm observing and the prices
I'm changing in the future none at all
and i'll tell you getting to that so
there's been a lot of work on how to do
imprint how to learn the distribution on
the fly when mechanisms have
truth-telling equilibrium when everyone
says their value right and here the
inference problem is trivial because
everyone says what their value is right
and so this question though gets at what
happens when people don't want to tell
you their value because it might you
might use it against them in the future
and so combining these two areas you
would get a theory for how to do
inference and deal with people who are
worried about affecting their own prices
in the future right so i would that
would be like a logical next step is to
merge these two theories and write that
paper yeah
when you think about face or something
like that you can more natural
environment because in Edwards or stuff
like this game right absolutely I agree
so this this issue of a bit the same
bitters coming back would be a problem
facebook said yeah perhaps or perhaps
i'll do this imprint looking across many
different keywords instead of successive
draws of the same auction and you're not
safe not the same environment yeah but
if if so for instance I you might group
keywords based on they have similar
distributions and then and do something
like that which is actually I mean
there's a paper that looks at estimating
reserves for at auctions and that's what
they did oh yeah I have a question not
so much about the value prefer base
versus ring face but as somebody who
doesn't know auction theory at all it
seems that whenever I encounter these
kinds of discussions it's always about
raising revenue for the person who's
doing the selling which makes sense if
your Microsoft and you've got thing for
example can this be flipped around is
there some way to turn this on its head
or is it a completely different set of
questions to ask how do you save the
most money and get the most stuff
cheapest because that seems like a huge
auction game theory algorithm problem
also is that just a totally different or
does this know so sit down and put a
mirror in front of it or so I like to
use revenue as an example of an
objective that the designer might want
to optimize and i like to use it over
using something like social welfare
which is another example of an objective
and the reason why is because optimizing
social welfare in auctions does it
require any distributional knowledge at
all optimizing revenue does require
distributional knowledge you have to
tune the mecha them to the setting you
are in and in general most objectives do
require having distributional knowledge
so revenue is an example of one of the
objectives that requires a special
knowledge
and welfare is not okay but for instance
if you were trying to so suppose you are
trying to optimize the utility the
players and you don't care about the
payments made to the designer like maybe
you're the government that doesn't care
about its own revenues but care to all
end up utility players in this situation
this is not welfare welfare is the
welfare everybody including the designer
and the players so if I just look at the
welfare of the players right the exact
same theory that I put forth here can
give you optimal auctions for this
objective of the utility of the players
and it will look exactly like this yeah
this approach be applied something like
voting in which saw government or some
sort of entity is trying to as you said
maximize social welfare and people who
are voting on truth-telling search and
further your preferences so perhaps
immersing themselves in that party some
things you your you prefer the third
candidate I'd like to see you yeah so
the short answer is the challenge so
their number the short answer is yes the
reason why you could look at social
affair where the voting is because you
don't be allowed transfers in voting
like there no payments and that makes it
not like the standard welfare situation
in mecca design where you allow
transfers and then things become easy so
you can look at these kinds of questions
for voting the difference between the
class of work that this falls in in sort
of optimal auction theory versus voting
theory is that voting theory tends to
not be using a distribution but if you
were to try to do voting theory with
distributions and come up with a voting
mechanism it was good for your
distribution then you could try to get a
theory like this to work and you would
need to get a theory like this to work
to make that work I don't know of much
work in that area myself
um but it's a great area to explore for
sure yeah so the solution is not the
unique way to do this that optimizes
your revenue and has different
properties for approximately optimized
script and that's going to movies right
and so what I assume Microsoft is doing
and Google and all these things although
I don't really know it's like they have
a rank based top k people get the top
case lots but then they do some
preferential randomness like
occasionally allocate maybe you're okay
it would be smart if they did something
like that but they there's a lot of
randomness in the system so the curves
are kind of smooth so we're kind of
relying on that giving us what we need
but it's probably not optimal so I so
this brings up a good point which is you
could imagine having other auction rules
which guaranteed the smoothness which
means you could do good inference I want
to point out that rank based rules have
another nice property over rules based
on values which is that rules based on
values the actual allocation rule X is
then also endogenous to how the values
map the bids okay whereas a rank based
rule the your you're probably of winning
is a function of how strong you are does
not depend on your value at all it just
depends on what order you guys are in
and in these rank based auction to
everyone lines up in order of value the
same way so the allocation rules are
just numb okay as an example as an
example so I said the optimal auction
has a reserve price under many
distributional situations under some of
the more extreme distribution elected
yeah bro reserve price but also some
interval where you basically treat all
bidders the same any bitter business
mineral you see the exact same way and
if that interval is it now in bid space
so I say no bids below five dollars but
bids between ten and twenty dollars I'm
not going to sort you in order i'll put
you in a random order
okay then where does 10 to 20 in bid
space fall in value space let depends on
the equilibrium ok so now I don't know
what the allocation rule was and so this
makes it much harder to do the inference
property the imprint properly and so
that's going to be a big challenge and
trying to do inference with non ranked
based auction rules but I can stick to
you could stick to rank base and do some
other allocation function so if your
goal is to optimize this subject to this
this is the optimal that you can just
write that off fascia prom and do it
optimally a point you could be making is
the actual thing you need for good
inference is not exactly this it's a
this guarantees it but it's not exactly
this you can actually write down what
the function is and then do it exactly
ok and I haven't bothered to write it
down here for you it's complicated and
and a little he's solving for it is
actually also not so easy but if you
have a computer doing this thing you
just have the computer do it yeah
all night learning so big the very first
example where I have all these different
prices on my time I just tried them yeah
it's a great question so one of the
things that I like one of the things I
really like about this approach over the
online learning approach is if I'm
imagining my population of bitters
distribution is changing slowly over
time and I'm evolving with that with one
mechanism that I run and everyone knows
this one mechanism I'm running and it's
changing a little bit and the bids are
changing a little bit they're just
adapting valuations change over time not
just the way they were your mechanism
okay so the the premise of doing
inference in a system is that I want to
know if suppose I knew the distribution
starting out at my optimizer
distribution I ran this mechanism right
now why would I want to do inference
well I want to see if maybe things have
changed we've got done advertising got
some more bidders I need to adapt the
system to still perform well for this
change so if you imagine your situation
where the distributions are gradually
changing and you're gradually adapting
the mechanism because you're doing
inference to adapt to this changing
system and everything is very everything
changes a very little bit every at every
step okay now I want to compare this to
the online learning approach so an
online learning approach says well
there's a large space of mechanism we
can run so let's pick different
mechanisms from the space to make sure
that we learn which one is good and run
a different one each time ok and the
problem I have with that approach is
that changes the mechanism completely
every single day and I need bitters to
be an equilibrium for this mechanism to
even work at all so it doesn't make any
sense for me I so the equilibrium
assumption is something that players are
best responding to the mechanism that
requires them to have known that this
was the mechanism
if you're changing it every day how are
they going to best respond to the
mechanism so that the problem is is is
it exactly the point right if you don't
have a somewhat stable mechanism bidders
won't be able to how to bid in that
mechanism and it's just it's going to be
probably mayhem me try in the compatible
ones so everyone doesn't actually I not
using any incentive pedal mechanism here
but I'm send in dilemma learning let me
tell you why I don't want to use in
sanik battle mechanisms so in real life
no Mecca in static compatible ok in real
life these learning Beckham's are not
incentive compatible because the guy you
was bidding in big could bid on Google
instead ok so saying is true value in
bing is not a good strategy ok so in
real life you never have incentive
compatible mechanisms given you never
haven't sent in front of I we need to
inference now if you have a mechanism
where you're changing nons trivially
what the mechanism is probably a bad
assumption right government saying we're
trying to be in steady state and if
you're training every day you're not in
steady state I mean that point seems
problematic for pretty much all of
auction to it what that there are other
options out there they you know like
Google and it's especially problematic /
truthful options actually why is it ok
so that's it so there's a there's a
fantastic essay by possible and Milgram
called a lovely bit lonely Vickrey
auction which basically talks about this
second price auction which has truthful
beddings a dominant strategy and says
why you never see this in practice yeah
and one of the reasons why is because
it's really not robust to out of model
phenomena like other things happening
whereas other options are much more
robust which
the way when quantifies that what's the
way you quantify nama buses to out of
model phenomena chuck it means just a
qualitative thing and so for instance I
have some more quantifying this using
approximation which says that if you its
mechanisms good with a approximately
good without modeling this phenomena
it's still good right where if it's not
if it destroys everything when you add
this out of model phenomena then it's
not it's not still good so that's one
way you could try to do it in this paper
they don't take that approach hey it's a
more is less grounded in theory and more
sort of observation like this is what we
observed and this is why we think that
these are not working these are some bad
properties and they sort of try to map
on what's happening any auctions to so
yeah build in this inference do you
think are you positive that you can have
situation that you can hold twisting the
system it just seemed luxion but you
have inference so I'm not sure about
your question but we haven't about
truthfulness you have to respond the
store like some options but now you are
building this inference on top of it so
if i have a truthful option i don't need
em prints yes yes i'm saying so wyd my
building imprints on top of a tree for
auction no not on top of course blog I'm
saying can you imagine just one auction
which has in France on top of it which
would be also crucible can you imagine
like proven cross for our sins suction
again I don't understand the question
because if i have a truthful auction I
don't need imprints so why would I build
imprints on top the tree for auction if
the evaluations changer return why
wouldn't a difference if i have a
truthful auction
need to somehow but it's a truthful
auction so I do see the valuation yeah
it's like very similar you need to
indicate yes of the ocean the point is
it's trivial inference and therefore you
have not much to do and you can look at
all of the literature that looks at
doing basically learning the
distribution on the fly so the
literature on prior free auctions which
does this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
