microphones can I have Scott sex for two
and a half minutes excellent now I
probably won't need it so you guys voted
me up here to talk about howdy and I
don't really want to talk about like you
guys should use howdy so I thought I
would talk about some really stupid
problems that we created for ourselves
so howdy is a slack pot it lives on your
team and you ask it to ask your peers
questions so one example would be like
an agile stand up what did you do today
you know what are your blockers whatever
collects all that information aggregates
it puts it on a wiki shares over the
team that's how it works so seemed like
a pretty straightforward problem to us
when we set out on that path but we ran
into some really crazy problem so number
one what happens if to project managers
schedule a meeting at the same time or
schedule a check in at the same time
it's a fairly difficult problem to solve
right because howdy the bot dm's you
when it has a question to ask so if it
if to if the body is trying to DM you at
the same time with two different
questions what the hell happens you know
by default it basically just sends you
two messages and now you don't know
which question you're answering or and
the bot doesn't know which question
you're answering and there's no
straightforward or obvious way around
that so we actually had to build like a
crazy queuing system and like cron job
system so that it could like not you
know buffer that question for later and
then but then when do you pick up later
and like is the is your project manager
going to wait around for you to answer
those questions like later or maybe you
don't have time to do two back-to-back
so no no no good solution it's actually
a shitshow another one is multi line
input so has
sometimes the answer to what you are you
working on today requires you to say
more than one small string and actually
what we found very quickly was that
people would be like it would say like
hey Ben what did you work on today and
the person would be like uh enter and
now they're on to the next question so
and you know so when we want to do this
in a graceful way so like what how can
you how can you collect several lines of
input and then move on to the next
question without having like an awkward
like say done when you're done like you
wait 30 seconds and there's no typing so
you move on like not a straightforward
thing I have no no solution to that
problem at all time zones you know time
zones are difficult to deal with anyways
but so one of the key functions of howdy
would be scheduling these things right
like 9am every day the check-in happens
well teams on slack are distributed and
they're not just distributed around like
Austin they're distributed like you know
it's half the teams in India half the
teams in error in San Francisco so what
does it mean to schedule a 9am meeting
and we thought this was a fairly
straightforward question like it me it
9am of in the time zone at which the
project manager scheduled it but that
turned out to not be what anybody wanted
they actually wanted to run in 9am of in
local time wherever those people are and
aggregate all those responses over like
a 24-hour period into a one final
document how the hell am I supposed to
do that I mean I got a lot more
complicated than than we thought and
then another sort of similar one is like
is the person at work today like should
I wait for this person to answer before
I move on to the other people or like
finish the job like so you'd think that
this would be an obvious like something
that's supported in slack already right
like there's an away mode you could be
offline
you know there's all these various
signals and and settings that you can
have in slack but none of them actually
explicitly mean I'm away so we we were
again we thought we were being really
clever we're just like if the person is
marked as a way we just won't send them
any messages and when they come online
well like say hey you missed some stuff
while you're away the we launched this
thing and like immediately people
started yelling at us because for a
variety of reasons right project
managers were using howdy to bring
people online to get them to come online
and answer the questions other people
set themselves away to not so that piece
so that their peers won't bother them or
you know just as a social indicator but
that doesn't actually mean they're away
and then like what if you're sick or on
vacation like there's not a there's not
our actual way to say like hey slack I'm
on vacation for a week and I'll be back
in seven days and then you can send me
messages so really really challenging
problems to deal with from an
application standpoint yeah that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
