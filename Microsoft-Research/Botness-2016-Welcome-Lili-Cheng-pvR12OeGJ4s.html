should be a fun two days i thought i'd
give you a little bit of an overview of
what's going to happen and then we'll
we'll begin the day so this is the first
time we've done botanist we have really
good t-shirts you'll get them at once
and the goal is to have everybody a
small enough group for everybody can
really just meet one another and talk
and share ideas and think about what we
could do together going forward and so
we're going to have a morning and an
afternoon in the morning and afternoon
of talks and around different themes and
really the idea of the talks is to get
people enough shared context for
discussions afterwards so I'll just go
through the agenda so first we're going
to do intros we do intros and you guys
might just be thinking about this each
person can give a short intro and then
also say if you were chosen what you
might want to give a five-minute talk
about and when you hear people give
these ideas I left you paper and you can
write down who you would like to have
talked and what kind of tally does will
tally those and and I'd have people
talking the evening so if you don't want
to talk you can also just say what
you're interested in today and you know
what you'd like to learn all right so
we'll do intros and then we'll go
through Chris and a mirror are going to
post a session on sort of early adopters
and intros with some short 10 or 15
minute talks in the morning and then
we'll have lunch in an unconference and
then in the afternoon we'll talk about
some more stories so you can kind of see
who's scheduled to talk this might
change a little bit and the equal
Brady's going to host a dinner the
audience choice talks which are always
super fun so those are five minute box
and then tomorrow ben Brown and I've jon
worth Whitaker Peter and some folks
you're going to talk about devtools an
ecosystem and then
me and brady and mimi hostess all types
of design and culture so the goal is for
everybody really honestly everybody here
could give a talk and so we just want
people to have fun enjoy it and let us
know if there's things that we should be
doing together and we sort of have the
for the blogging rule if you want to
post just talk to people and make sure
they're cool with that and we are
recording the sessions so if there's
something that you don't want recorded a
lot of snow and will if your speaker
will make sure that you're good with
having that posted before we actually
post them so thanks especially to
everybody else who helped organize this
van Braun in the air Brady over there is
hosted in this awesome space I've are
from kick Chris Messina were somewhere
here anybody else a meanie who's coming
in a bit and you do do you guys have
anything else you want to add all right
so why don't we get in with intros
the Greg pal just joined automatic today
so the space up here with ambien and
just look forward to getting to know you
better of the two days hey Andy CEO an
automat I'm going to do a five-minute
talk on the thing I'm obsessed with
which is bots that can learn from people
Scott Rothenberg I'm a writer journal
been covering the stuff for a really
long time I co-edited a book on boxed in
that came out in 1996 just so put it
into context and if I don't well if I
gave a talk I would maybe give some talk
about the responsibility for BOTS and
fiduciary responsibility what what what
about is an agent who is it responsible
to peets camera with a company called
skip flag I haven't had time to think
about what a talk would be but I'm
really interested and what bots are
actually getting usage right now and
maybe looking at past platforms and even
things like Twitter and what crazy bots
on Twitter are working my name is Greg
bornstein I'm independent guide you
computer vision and interactive machine
learning and a bunch of other stuff and
if I was gonna give a talk I could talk
about the that's will make Twitter bots
so the creative Twitter bot community
that this group of practitioners like I
think a lot of excitement kind of comes
from but is maybe not as aware of some
of the cultural things that are going on
with Twitter bots or also just the
specific academic field of interactive
machine learning which has been studying
like in particular how do you build
interactions around machine learning
systems which is something that I think
is a lot of what this is about and
there's like some really fascinating
work that's been going on in that field
that isn't gotten enough notice in the
shadow of all these amazing deep
learning results hi i'm adel fun from
things and
I'd be interested in talking about bots
that help people manage visit the
physical spaces around them and the
social relationships between each other
hi I'm Brady Forrest I started ignite
and I run highway 1a hardware
accelerator next door and part of the
PCH so i'll tell you more about PCH
later i can give a talk about why you
shouldn't use use hardware for your BOTS
health i perform in person we create the
conversational bot that simulate famous
characters from movies and TV shows like
Miss Piggy and Doc Brown that we did
with Disney and Universal I'm interested
in talking about natural language
conversation between users and BOTS and
nonlinear conversation hi my name is Dan
Driscoll the Microsoft and here on the
bat framework team and I'm certainly
going to share with you anything I i can
offer about the tools we have but I'm
also really all bots intelligent even
really simple box okay i'm one of the
co-founders of career Lord we are HR
tech company in the bot space we just
launched our first product which is a
slack bot that makes it really easy for
employees to give and get lightweight
performance feedback we were actually
featured in the slack directory so thank
you slacking for the past couple weeks
one thing that I could talk about is all
the customer interactions we've had in
the last few weeks on the slack platform
and the highlights on what we learned
from that everyone I'm gallery I am also
a co-founder of career lark with Ellen
as Alan mentioned we launched our bought
a few weeks ago and I think one thing
that I could talk about as well as a lot
of our learnings there so really
surprised by just a sheer number of
people that are willing to try out
different things on black box and it's
not just tech savvy people so that was
one of the key findings for us a lot of
these people are not not super tech
savvy a nerd kind of it figuring out how
to enter
with bots as they go along so that was
something that we found interesting good
morning I'm rob thinks might cut out
about the search learning intelligence
humor what we do what slack or I also
offer an open source library called
super script with a dialogue engine for
managing conversations that are
nonlinear I could talk probations behind
why I built it and some of my learnings
for the last four or five years hi my
name is Andres monroy I'm a researcher
in microsoft research and I've been
working on a couple of both related
projects for a talk I could talk about
something that we did some research on a
few years ago on how people use bots for
political manipulation on different
channels on social media hi my name is
Mike pervert I created beep boop which
is a hosting platform for slack bots and
His Messenger BOTS and would you end
again like slack integration for
deploying your customizations is like so
tomorrow I'm talking about this whole
idea of a bada ba communication and
bought networks and I could also talk
about how we're built admin user
interface and our entire product that
we've built we're building all that out
only nine spots
hi hi everyone I'm sandy my person I run
a company called quid and then in my
spare time I've built a chatbot called
San Eamon so I could probably talk a
little bit about it but at this point
it's just a little side project hey I'm
Daniel ill kovitch I run a company
called dexter out of beta works we are a
guy blue product that has found a nice
little bot community so people building
boss to interact with with third party
services and and we're looking at
building up a platform to enable you
know more more and more about
interactions so certainly like to hear
from you guys about types of tools you
need for an admin side the global which
button at now Richie Matthew is part of
the global search partnerships team at
Yahoo we just launched a couple of bots
on cake last week so sergio anaya thanks
a lot one of the topics that I'm curious
about is obviously how users are going
to discover bots and there's only
limited space on a mobile phone so
that's one topic that is intriguing and
exciting for me personally hi Bob
lafrance also with Yahoo Richard global
partnerships team so none not on the dev
side where the business side shout out
also to the kick guys for their help in
launching last week we're excited about
that Yahoo's exploring messaging
platform spots we've got three release
now and will continue to take a look at
that mostly listening today but happy to
contribute any way we can thanks hey my
name is Vinci jank i'm one of the
founders of hyper travel which is a
messaging based travel management
so instead of you know having to call up
agents in a traditional tell management
setting like with calls in vol ly you
can just message our agents and so
uninterested in talking to you guys
about and learning from you guys about
different conversational interaction
models and in particular applications
around commerce hi I'm Amy Joachim a
brain seacoast oak CEO of shuffle brain
and I'm a social game design and startup
coach I run online coaching and training
programs for entrepreneurs from all over
the world and slack and I'm interested
in and could give a talk about how game
thinking can impact bought design
particularly the players journey and I'm
mostly here to learn from all of you
amazing people I'm Jonathan Kaye blue
i'm one of the founders with sam we have
two BOTS ones and anonymous 101 chopped
off between real humans and then what
we're doing is we're taking those
million conversations and putting them
into a dynamic corpus that we used to
build a completely artificial AI chat
bot so having to talk about you know how
we store that corpus how we access
information from it and anything to do
with natural language thanks hey I'm not
McCausland I'm with Jonathan with those
two bats you just heard about we have
bots on kik SMS iPhone and Android and
Facebook so I'd be
the difference between marketing bots to
teens and adults and how they interact
with thoughts differently

our CEO sound wave which modify choir in
the year I'm really happy to talk about
any music music use cases when it comes
to the bots see okay so okay we built a
slack bought that helps people track
processes within their companies and I'm
happy to talk about how we're slowly
making the bots smarter over time and
what we've learned is required to do
that hi I'm Ryan block on the co-founder
of a bot company called beacon we're at

really interested to hear from the early
bought companies that are market what's
working what's not yeah love to take
everybody's brains on there hi I'm Brian
I'm Ryan's co-founder it's awkward

I'm Dan Strickland I work for Bloomberg
beta where a seed-stage drove work and
I'm mostly here to learn and try to
understand kind of pitch right now and
looking at sort through a bit of the
noise and get a sense of what seems to
be working for most of you all and what
hasn't yet taken hold I'm Lars for
microsoft research I think the
discoverability problem is probably
going to be solved by having a concierge
bot that uses context then offset
messages to other BOTS and I'm kind of
curious to see what kind of technology
you can use and what ideas people have
around that I'm Esther I made a book
called s turbot and it was a resume bot
and so I could talk about what I was
like to manage a job search through a
bot and also what it was like to have
interactions over telegram SMS and

different platforms hi there my name is
