hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
alright good afternoon everyone welcome
Microsoft glad to be here I'm my name is
Jeff Cologne I'm a group product
marketing manager at work for microsoft
search advertising which is always funny
after always know where you work at
Microsoft because we're like a city
actually a nation-state unto ourselves
some respects really glad to be here to
welcome our author for our visiting
lecture series just a personal story in
terms of why I wanted to make an intro
to Whitney was traveling like a lot of
people do at Microsoft probably about
four months ago and was walking through
an airport and of course like a lot of
people I'm like what business books are
out that i can read since my asus
zenbook only holds about a 30-minute
charge and i can't really do much work
on a five hour trip to the east coast
and i came upon Whitney's book and was
so excited about it when i got back to
one of my group meetings i had said to
everyone everyone needs to read this
book and of course people who said i
don't really need to read that i've been
here for nine years i said that's
exactly why you need to read this book
so i hope you'll get a lot of out of her
discussion today just to give her a
quick background for everyone here she
was recognized as one of the world's
most influential management thinkers in
2015 and is the former president and
co-founder of a boutique investment firm
with Harvard Business School's Clayton
Christensen who also is the author of
the innovators dilemma she's the author
of the critically acclaimed disrupt
yourself putting the power of disruptive
innovation to work one of ink magazine's
top 100 business books in 2015 she's a
frequent contributor to the heart
harvard business review a linkedin
influencer co-founder of 40 women over
40 to watch and was named one of fortune
fortunes 55 women to follow on twitter
in 2014 she and her husband and their
two children live in Lexington Virginia
so without further ado let's give a nice
welcome to Whitney Johnson
Thank You duck six times higher 20 times
greater that's what the theory of
disruption indicates will happen when
you pursue a disruptive course your odds
of success will be six times higher your
revenue opportunity 20 times greater not
just for Microsoft but for you you don't
need to cope with the force of
disruption you can harness its power and
its unpredictability to propel you
forward and that's what I want to talk
to you about today I want to tell you a
little bit of my story in 2005 I was
working as an equity analyst at Merrill
Lynch it was my job to issue buy and
sell recommendations on stocks like
America Movil the fourth-largest
cellular company in the world one day I
said to a very good friend of mine I'm
going to quit my job Whitney have you
lost your mind I knew it was the right
thing to do but it was illogical I was
the top of my game I had just come back
from Mexico for an investor day and as I
sat in the audience with hundreds of
other people Carlos Slim the controlling
shareholder of America Melville and one
of the world's richest people he ping
pongs with Bill Gates was quoting my
research he was referring to me as love
Whitney hide institutions like fidelity
asking me for my financial model and
when I would upgrade or downgrade a
stock it would typically move several
percentage points not only was I at the
top of my game but getting to this place
of power and respect was hard won 15
years earlier I'd arrived in New York
with my husband so he could purse pursue
his PhD
in microbiology I was terrified I would
never have gone to New York on my own
there were so many people in such tall
buildings and horror stories about crime
and drugs for the first week I wouldn't
go anywhere by myself but we had to put
food on the table so I eventually had to
go out of our 17th floor student housing
apartment and get a job I majored in
music so the obvious choice was Wall
Street because I had never set foot in
any sort of business course I had no
connections in New York and clearly no
confidence I started as a secretary
working for a retail broker at smith
barney in midtown Manhattan it was an
exciting time to be on Wall Street it
was nineteen eighty-nine it was the era
of liars poker a bonfire of the vanities
of working girl it swept up I didn't
just want a job I wanted to work on Wall
Street so I started taking business
courses at night and then I had this
boss who believed in me which allowed me
to move up from secretary to investment
banker and if he worked on Wall Street
you know that rarely happens then a step
back to become an equity analyst and
eventually i co-founded an investment
firm with Clayton Christensen at the
Harvard Business School I would not have
known to call it this then but when I
walked onto Wall Street for the
secretarial side door and when I walked
off of Wall Street to become an
entrepreneur I was a disruptor now
you're probably familiar with the term a
disruptive innovation is it innovation
that's a low-end or new market
innovation that eventually up ends an
industry so for example we all know GM
was disrupted by Toyota okay in a minute
you're gonna get to do this with me
Sears was disrupted by target
borders was disrupted by amazon now this
one you've got yellow cabs by uber and
hotels which I feel terrible because I'm
staying at this hotel is disrupted by
Airbnb now in my case I started the
bottom I climbed to the top and now I
wanted to up end my career lost you can
only get this if you have children but
if you have children you totally
understand that they look at you like
this okay according to the theory a
disruptor secures the foot held at the
low end of the market think Amazon in
the 90s initially its products are
inferior its position is weak barnes and
noble and borders could have crushed
them like a cockroach but they didn't
market leaders rarely bother it's just a
silly little product let's go after
bigger or faster or better the problem
is is that once a disruptor gains a
foothold it too is motivated by bigger
faster better and by the time a
counter-attack does make sense say it
with me it's too late to be fair the
low-end disruptors they're really easy
to miss in 2002 I started to build my
model on America Melville and one of the
key inputs for this model was wireless
penetration at this point in time
wireline penetration or fixed line
penetration in Mexico was fifteen
percent wireless was twenty-five percent
that was up from one percent five years
earlier so the question is how much more
can wireless penetration increased based
on the demographics the number of people
who could afford a phone who had access
to credit I thought maybe possibly maybe
penetration can increase from
twenty-five percent to forty percent
enter Carlos Slim he saw a much bigger
opportunity sure he saw the forty
percent of the 40 million people I saw
but he saw another fifty percent or 50
million people who wanted to be
connected but couldn't afford to so what
does Carlos Slim do he offers them
subsidized handsets prepaid phone cards
making affordability and credit a
non-issue sure sound quality is bad for
this silly little product but that
sounds better than no sound today
wireline penetration in Mexico has
increased a paltry five percentage
points from fifteen to twenty percent
wireless is up from twenty-five percent
not to forty percent but if you're doing
your math you got it ninety percent one
of the reasons that disruption is so
hard to spot is the timing growth can be
totally flat for years and then suddenly
spiked upward wireless was introduced in
Mexico in 1988 for almost a decade
penetration was less than one percent a
decade and then from 1997 to 2002 foo to
twenty-five percent when an industry is
in upheaval booya say the fifty percent
or 50 million people who are now
connected but for the individual
experiencing a seismic shift in what the
world looks like it can be unsettling
each of us has a view of the world that
is powered higher personal algorithms we
look at all the individual components of
our personal social system and how they
interact and we come up with patterns to
predict what will happen next when
systems behave linearly and react
immediately we're fairly accurate with
our forecasts you flip a switch in boom
the light goes on but when they don't
our predictive power plummets one of the
best ways to make sense of this
non-linear world is the s-curve this is
the s-curve helps us gauge how quickly
an innovation will be adopted it also
helps us understand the psychology of
disruption if for example you started
out at the low end of the curve you know
that growth is going to be slow once a
tipping point is reached typically ten
to fifteen percent you enter hyper
growth and at the high end of the curve
you reach saturation or ninety percent
Facebook for example ascending a market
opportunity of a billion people which is
now exceeded it took Facebook roughly
four years to reach a tipping point of
ten percent but then it once it reached
this critical mass of a hundred million
users it entered hyper growth and over
the next four years it added not a
hundred million but 800 million users
now we could quibble over whether or not
it has reached saturation but there is
no question the rate of growth has begun
to slow now what I find fascinating and
encouraging is that the s-curve also
helps us understand the psychology of
disruption if you for example just
started a new job or just launched a new
product the escrow tells you that
initially progress is going to be slow
this helps you avoid discouragement then
as you put in the hours of practice of
deliberate practice you accelerate into
competence
and confidence and this is the exciting
part of the curb where all of your
neurons are firing then as you approach
mastery you'll be able to do things
automatically very easily but because
you're no longer enjoying the feel good
effects of learning boredom and
complacency kick in if at this point you
don't jump to a new curve or aren't
allowed to jump your plateau can become
a precipice there are volumes of
research indicating that the odds of
success improved for products services
companies even countries but the
fundamental unit of disruption is the
individual the best way to drive
corporate innovation is through personal
disruption if you can surf the s-curve
waves of learning and master you will
have a competitive advantage in an era
of accelerating disruption and whether
an organization whether Microsoft or you
I've identified seven accelerants that
will help you move along the curve
number one take the right risks now
there are two kinds of risks I'm going
to talk about there's competitive risks
and there is market risk first
competitive risk if one of your
colleagues comes to you and says there's
a huge market opportunity out there and
I have got the projections to prove it
it's likely someone's already scoped out
the market there's a kingpin and it
ain't you so you can be confident that
there will be customers but you're going
to have to gauge if you can compete and
win this is competitive risk if a call
it comes to you and says I don't know if
there's a market I really don't but I
think there's a need not being met
there's no guarantee that there will be
customers but if there are and there's
no competition as the first mover you
are favored to own the market that's
market risk
so how does this apply to you as
individuals 19 years ago right after my
son was born who's obviously now 19 I
was hired into equity research and I was
going to cover the cement and
construction sector and believe it or
not I was really excited I started to
build my model smith barney announces
its going to merge with salomon brothers
and guess what they already had a
highly-ranked cement and construction
analyst hmmm cement shoes however there
were a number of media companies going
public and no analyst to cover them as
the theory of disruption would dictate
rather than knocking on a cement door
that was closed I built my own media
door and within a year I too was a
ranked analyst now here's the rub as you
think about yourself and your team
competitive risk feels less risky
because it's more certain but if you can
deal with the uncertainty of market risk
then you're more likely to be successful
and then you walk through the door of
market opportunity by playing to your
distinctive strengths and that's number
two a distinctive strength being
something that you do well that other
people within your sphere do not like a
fish out of water let me give you an
example Janie van is a partner at a law
firm in Cleveland and which it was a
second-year associate her mother got
sick with cancer so she went online
trying to figure out what was happening
and she discovered this huge support
group at the same time she's a
second-year associate and she's got this
requirement that she needs to network so
she can't go out at night because her
mom's sick why not network online well
her partners of course thought this was
a crazy idea law firms tend to be pretty
conservative but she persisted
in 2008 when the downturn came she was
able to sidestep layoffs because she'd
actually landed clients via social media
and when she was up for partner she was
able to make a very compelling case now
this is after the fact the fish out of
water the swimming social media fish
swimming in in legal waters but most of
us struggle to know what our strengths
are in the first place so let me give
you a few clues first of all what makes
you feel strong Marcus Buckingham says
that our strengths clamor for our
attention in the most basic way using
them makes you feel inquisitive
invigorated successful another way you
could think about it is what's your
go-to activity when you're really
stressed out now i'm not talking about
eating a quart of haagen-dazs ice cream
or going out and getting sloshed I'm
talking about that activity whether it's
a spreadsheet whether it's code whether
it's making sale that making a sale that
thing that you do that allows you to
feel in control again order is restored
because you feel in control you feel in
control because you feel strong the
trick is is to figure out how to use
this strength deliberately and not just
when you're in a bind
what exasperates you the frustration of
genius is in believing that if it's easy
for you it must be easy for everybody
else it may not be that the people
around you are incompetent though they
may be it may just be that you are
prodigy like in this one area you don't
know how to tell people how to do what
you want done because you don't know how
you know the next time you find yourself
exasperated consider the possibility
that people are bumping up against your
genius what do other people say you do
well and specifically what compliments
do you dismiss if to a particular
compliment people you find yourself just
saying it was nothing because for you it
is nothing it's as natural as breathing
or if they say to you they give you a
compliment you think yourself oh that
compliment again why can't they
compliment me on this other thing that I
worked really really hard to learn
people tend to overvalue what they
aren't and undervalue what they are it's
quite likely that compliment is pointing
you in the direction of one of your
greatest strengths in fact it's quite
possible that your superpowers are not
on your resume because you overlooked or
ignored them if you want to fly up the
s-curve bring your superpowers to work
and then play where no one else is
playing number three embrace constraints
whenever you try something new you're up
ending your status quo and you want you
need lots of feedback and so one of the
best ways to get this feedback is to
impose constraints think about
skateboarders there's some of the
quickest learners in the world because
they receive incredibly fast and useful
feedback every action every move has an
immediate consequence
did you know that some of the most
famous scenes in Jaws came about because
the mechanical shark that Steven
Spielberg wanted to use it didn't work
he was over budget and behind schedule
so he finally decided to film the scenes
from the Sharks point of view and let
the music everybody can hear it in their
mind and the imagination do the rest
most of us are like Steven Spielberg we
don't have enough money which usually is
a pretty good thing because when you
have a do or don't eat situation you're
pretty incentivized to get the business
model right in 2007 Entrepreneur
Magazine compile the list of the 500
fastest growing companies in the United
States now what was unusual about this
list is it looked at how these companies
had funded their growth here's what they
found only twenty-eight percent had
access to bank loans or lines of credit
only eighteen percent had access to
equity and only four percent had access
to venture capital what this means is
that at least fifty percent as much as
seventy two percent of these companies
had bootstrapped or built their
businesses with what they had on hand
and sixty-one percent were profitable
within the first year so I asked myself
with Steven Spielberg were these
entrepreneurs successful in spite of or
because of their constraints
in 1954 an editor at Houghton Mifflin
read the now famous article why Johnny
can't read he was concerned so he
reached out to an editor friend of his
he said I need you to take 225 unique
words every six year old nose and write
me a story they can't put down at one
point he was so discouraged it took him
18 months but when he finally published
The Cat in the Hat it was an instant
success years of reciting rhymes of
creating cartoons of leveraging what
heated uniquely well-prepared Theodore
Geisel to reinvent children's literature
when presented with a 225 ward
constraint for disruptors constraints
are not a check on absolute freedom
they're a tool of creation number for
battle entitlement this is the belief
that I exist therefore I'm entitled and
no it's not just Millennials in fact the
more successful will become the more we
think we deserve our success sadly I see
entitlement in myself all the time it
comes in many guises like cultural
entitlement we all need to feel that we
belong a sense of belonging gives us the
confidence that we need to climb a new
curve but as we begin to see the fruits
of taking the right risks of playing to
our distinctive strengths it's easy to
believe that this is the way things will
and should always be when my husband was
studying microbiology he would grow
cells in his beautiful pink colored
media after three or four days the cells
would use up all the nutrients so they
produced by products some of which were
toxic he'd have to replate the cells
into a new petri dish we may like our
cultural petri dish we may feel we
belong but if we want to avoid
stagnation we want to avoid toxicity
that pushes us back down the curve
occasionally we need to transplant
ourselves to
new cultures a very practical way of
doing this is to simply open up our
network now closed network of course
reinforces our sense of belonging but we
hear the same idea is over and over and
over again an open network can be
psychically somewhat painful but we're
more likely to have breakthrough ideas
let's look at the signs study was done
out of Northwestern and they looked at
18 million academic articles written
over the course of a decade they
classified them into high impact and low
impact papers so the high impact papers
were papers that people read and then
talked about low impact not so much for
the low impact papers a hundred percent
of their sources were highly
conventional people and ideas from
inside of their network for the high
impact papers 85 to 95 percent were
conventional the usual suspects the five
to fifteen percent were highly novel
people and ideas outside of their
network now when we think about
networking we tend to think of it in
this how shall I display my largesse
sort of way but sometimes opening up our
network actually requires humility it
puts us in a one down position so when I
was thinking through my ideas of the
s-curve I reached out to an mit-trained
systems engineer and computer scientist
I will concede that there were times
when I said to him I have no idea what
you're talking about but because I was
willing to move beyond my current
intellectual borders I was able to have
a breakthrough in my thinking and in
fact here's what the research found when
these scientists or these academics were
willing to transplant themselves
intellectually they were two times more
likely to have a high impact paper if
you want to move up the curve if you
want to go into hyper growth if you want
to stay there battle entitlement which
sometimes means you're going to have to
take a step back
in order to grow when organizations get
too big they often stop exploring
smaller opportunities because the
revenue it's just not big enough just as
barnes and noble and borders were slow
to embrace ecommerce people can stall at
the top of their learning curve and the
way to a boy this is to jump to a new
curve this does not necessarily mean
that you need to change companies you
need to leave Microsoft where the people
who work for you need to leave Microsoft
in fact in the best companies people are
able to disrupt from within Dave Blakely
started his career at I do you're
probably familiar with it it's a design
firm and he was an engineer he could
have worked his way up to manage
technical staff but instead he
volunteered to become a project manager
which many of his peers dismissed as an
escape route from the rigor and detail
of engineering but this backward move
allowed Blakely to begin to climb a new
ladder and when he completed his 25 year
tenure at I do he was the head of
Technology Strategy as you look to tilt
the odds in your favor beware the
undertow of the status quo lots of
people may like you right where you are
you may like you right where you are but
there really is no such thing as
standing still and sometimes sideways
turns into a slingshot sometimes too
there's failure
whenever we try something new there's
this fantasy of a simple linear world no
work hard and your dreams will come true
but sometimes they don't my moments of
humiliation include bombing a speech in
front of hundreds of people being fired
and backing a business that imploded
when I fail no matter how many chirpy
quotes I tweet I am despondent I'm
pessimistic and I want to move to
another city because I can never show my
face in public ever again Marjorie house
said there is dignity and suffering
nobility and pain but failure is
assaulted wound that burns and burns and
burns again brenÃ© Brown said failure is
especially acute for corporate
professionals when the ethos is kill or
be killed control or be controlled
failure is being killed and it elicits
tremendous shame that business that I
backed will know let me start with
another place that speech that I bond by
the time I finished I had beads of sweat
dripping down my face I looked like I
had just run three miles when I was
fired I was so devastated I thought I
would never recover emotionally and the
business that I backed how could I claim
to be a savvy investor when I fail I'm
not only embarrassed but I'm I'm
heartbroken because I had envisioned a
future in which I would achieve a goal
perhaps even be hailed the conquering
hero and then I didn't and I wasn't it's
important to grieve and then you have to
ditch the shame because when we buy into
the shame we allow the failure to become
a referendum on us and we can no longer
ask that question what important truth
did I learn because of this failure so
for example the business that imploded I
learned that I need to
that prospective partners more carefully
especially friends which I now do the
most important thing I've learned is
that whether I see an experience as a
failure or a success it's a choice about
a year and a half ago is giving a speech
in Portland Oregon to about 2,500 people
and the gist of the speech was different
than it is today it was a it was based
on Union psychology and and trying to
persuade the audience to put as much
emphasis on feminine characteristics
such as connection as we do on masculine
characteristics such as power and
achieving speech was off to a great
start until about 20 seconds in when I
completely forgot what I was going to
say technical term is I went up so I'm
walking across the stage just a minute I
really can't fake it just a minute when
someone sitting right over where you are
hollered you can do it Whitney and with
that my memory came back a few hours
later my agent texted me so how did it
go huh well how did it go because
according to the metric of power and
achieving it was the worst speech I'd
ever given I forgot what I was going to
say on stage in front of 2,500 people
but according to the metric of
connection it was the best speech I'd
ever given so now I had to decide was it
the best or the worst it was hard you
don't work on Wall Street without
valuing power and achieving but I
ultimately chose best paraphrasing John
Milton the mind is its own place it can
make of every heaven a hell of every
hell a heaven the mind is its own place
and can make of every successive failure
of every failure a success as you climb
your learning curves what will you make
of your experiences
okay number seven and the last one be
discovery driven as a disruptor you are
in search of a yet to be defined market
you're taking a market risk you're
playing where no one else is played this
requires an emergent strategy rather
than developing a step-by-step plan to
achieve a goal you take a step forward
you gather feedback you adapt
accordingly probably means you'll end up
in a place you had not anticipated and
you will not be alone seventy percent of
all successful new businesses end up in
a different place to groupon started out
as an activism platform bringing people
together to fundraise for a cause or to
boycott retailers which I find ironic
Netflix started out as a door-to-door
DVD rental service we all like to make
plans for the future but pursuing a
disruptive course requires that you
cannot see the top of the curve from the
bottom and sometimes you can't see the
bottom from the top you also need to get
your metrics right metrics are in fact a
de facto constraint because they give
you lots of information there's a myriad
of metrics you can use to measure your
progress think about Moneyball but
there's only one metric that always
matters and that's how many times you
show up did you know that the odds of a
scientist writing a groundbreaking
research paper are directly correlated
to not how smart the scientist is but
how many papers the scientist is written
not how smart but to how many once
startup makes it to the final round of a
pitch contest there's no statistical
difference between the returns of the
finalists and the actual winners it's
called the equal odds rule if you want
to write a paper that people read you
publish if you want a product that sells
you sell and if you want to get good at
jumping from one learning curve to the
next you jump a simple metric show up
and keep showing up especially
when you are scared and this is the
other thing that the textbooks on
disruption don't tell you disruption is
by definition scary and lonely perhaps
you have the experience of announcing to
the new market an initiative you believe
will be game-changing only to discover
that your customers they hate it then
there's personal disruption like when I
left Wall Street after the initial rush
of excitement wore off I felt a loss of
identity I could no longer call people
say Whitney Johnson Merrill Lynch now it
was just Whitney Johnson some days that
wasn't enough there have been other days
where the PE or puke to excitement ratio
is so uncomfortably high I feel like I'm
on a thrill ride 20 cash flow it doesn't
mean you shouldn't disrupt it just means
if it's scary and lonely you're probably
on the right track in fact if you have
that feeling and the deepest part of
yourself that you need to try something
new and you don't you'll die inside just
a little that's why we call it the
innovators dilemma whether you innovate
or not you risk downward mobility which
is why our dreams are so important why
we have to bring our dreams to work when
we dream we hunger for a better life
when we dream we become problem solvers
letting nothing stand in our way
dreaming is the engine of disruption and
the odds of success six times higher the
revenue opportunity 20 times greater do
I dare do I dare do I dare disturb the
universe
most of us are pretty adept at doing the
math around the future when things are
linear but neither business nor life is
linear and what the brain craves even
requires is a delicious dopamine of the
unpredictable saleh kaplan the chief
catalyst of the business innovation
factory said my life has been about
searching for the steep learning curve
swinging like Tarzan from one curve to
the next because that is where I do my
best work and when I do my best work
money stature and happiness have always
followed we give a lot of airtime to
building and buying disruptive companies
and we should but innovation ultimately
begins on the inside we start at the low
into the curb we shift to dig ears that
will allow us to scale and when our
learning peaks we do what all great
disruptors do we walk straight into the
innovators dilemma and jump to a new
curve because companies don't disrupt
people do thank you questions ask that
people use the one of these a microphone
so that we can hear it online and don't
be shy ask whatever you want yes what is
my dream Oh see that's a good one he
throws down the gauntlet right off the
bat okay well I have to sort of
near-term dreams so one of my dreams is
to I guess I have to be honest don't I I
have to say well what it really is okay
one of my really big big dreams is to
eventually have a book that's a new york
times bestseller so that's one and then
another dream which I have more control
over is to have a happy family and so
far so good thanks for asking pardon me
yes exactly exactly sure come on do do
you have a question comment thoughts
yeah I'm calling on him I'm cold calling
whatever you want whatever you're
thinking I've gone through repotting my
career a number of times started a
couple of companies and now at Microsoft
mm-hmm I have also read that when you
are looking for a successful career it
matters that you're deep in a given area
and continue working on it rather than a
jump from one to the other and here
you're proposing a counter theory how do
you reconcile between the two well
you're absolutely right in fact I'm
working on a paper right now that
suggests that deep domain expertise is
very valuable and important and in fact
when you have deep but but here's the
thing when you have deep domain
expertise you're actually very
marketable and you're the compensation
data shows that it behooves you to
actually change every three or four
years so so you want deep domain
expertise and in fact you're going to
maximize your earnings if you're willing
to jump now ideally if you're really
good at what you do Microsoft allows you
to continue to jump internally and your
salary continues to go up and your boss
is going to hate me right now but there
you go yes
so I just started the new role a week
ago that's very different than my old
role it's the same title and everything
but it's completely different domain and
how do you what's your suggestion to
best leapfrog those moments of well I
don't know enough yet towards becoming
influential and knowing when that okay
right moment is all right so if you take
a look at this if you map this curb
against the 10,000 hour rule which is a
great rule of thumb if you're working 40
hours a week what that 10,000 hour rule
suggests if you do some quick math is
going to take you roughly six months in
order to accelerate so what I would say
to you is one of the best ways to
leapfrog des is on the one hand you can
work more hours but on the other hand
what I would say is if you know that
you're at the low end of the curve then
if you can be patient with yourself and
just say i don't know what i'm doing yet
but i know i don't know what I'm doing
and I'm not supposed to know what I'm
doing and allow yourself to just immerse
yourself and develop and grow you're
more likely to move quickly because
you're not going to be getting on you
know sort of bludgeoning yourself with
that how come I don't know how to do
this yet because you'll just say of
course I don't know but in six months I
will and if you are patient with
yourself you'll probably get to that
point faster okay let's hear from this
side of the room who wants to go I've
got one online question someone's just
wondering how to really know if it's the
ref its a right or wrong risk oh and one
right DUI stop risking great question
okay so on for questions that I came up
with to answer that question number one
is on first of all they're not unlike
this answer but you know how I said that
the odds of success improve their six
times higher that goes from six percent
to thirty six percent so there's still a
70 / 70 no sixty-four percent
probability that it won't work so you
need to be aware of that but in the
meantime the way that you can know if
you're taking the right wrist because
number one are you playing where no one
else is playing number two are
you playing To Your Strengths one of the
things that's really difficult here is
that so many of us because we don't
value our strengths we tend not to play
to them think about that are you really
playing To Your Strengths on the job the
third thing you want to consider is when
you're looking at your learning curve is
it hard or is it frustrating because if
it's hard then you should keep going if
it's frustrating the research actually
says that's a signal to you that you may
be on the wrong curve and then the
fourth thing that you look at is am i
gaining momentum you're gonna have to
pick some metric to look at it can be I
asked fewer questions this week than I
did last week whatever metric you prove
you choose are you gaining momentum is
it speeding up is the rate of growth
increasing and if it is then you have
enough then you stay on that curve until
you have enough information to know to
stay off that curve and I actually wrote
a piece about this so if you email me I
can send you the link to it so you can
look at it more closely okay thanks I've
been in the learning curve quite a bit
and I've continually transitioned
throughout my career but I feel like in
the last you know 68 years or something
like that I've kind of stalled yep um
any words of advice yes does your boss
know you've stalled kind of okay so what
I would say there is first of all
explain this to them because if you're
working 40 hours a week after five years
you're at the top of the curve and the
brain science says that you are only
going to you're going to actually
maximize your performance when you're in
the sweet spot and so stretch
assignments aren't just for junior
employees therefore season employees who
have been in a row a long time and so
what you want to do is say look number
one brain sciences says I'm going to be
more able to contribute to the firm if
you push me to a new curve and the
people that are coming up behind me this
gives them a chance to achieve mastery
and we know that the research the
research tells us that the best
performing companies are tho those are
prepare competencies before they need
them
and so I think that's one way to start
the conversation with your boss yeah
I've got another online question she
asks how much of disruption is
attributed to luck being at the right
time at the right and the right place
there's always luck I mean if you were
to do an r-squared you couldn't get to a
hundred percent and luck is just part of
life what I will say to you is that no S
curve is ever wasted so even if you're
on an S curve and it doesn't work out
and it may not if you show up and that's
why I wanted to really emphasize this
idea show up we've all had experiences
and I said on failures do we turn that
failure to success we've all had
failures that you know experiences it
didn't work and yet i would i would
hazard a guess that nearly every single
one of you in this room would say that
one of the experiences that has made you
the person that you are so did its seeds
in a failure almost to a one i can
probably predict that because i think
it's true we gained straight from our
failures and so i would say i don't
remember what the question was i got off
and what i was saying uh luck oh yeah
luck plays into it but like i said no
curve it is ever wasted someone was
gonna raise their hand and that's like
this our last question okay one more
person on the spot okay can you talk
about your strategies for staying
discovery driven is it is it surrounding
yourself with people who aren't actually
interested is it reading any literature
in particular how do you stay discovery
driven that's a really good question i
think absolutely because your point is
well first of all I haven't actually
thought about the question exactly how
you phrased it so I'm thinking more of
discovery driven from a planning
perspective and you're saying stay
curious on two things number one if
you're around people who are willing to
open up their networks that's going to
allow you to stay on state discovery
driven and the second thing is is that
knowing that the science says that
you're going to get bored at the top of
your curve you want to make sure you're
putting yourself into some type of
roll every three to four years and
that's those two things I think are the
most important great thank you very much
Whitney thank you so much for coming you
for being here so Whitney will be
signing she'll be at the front desk and
there are still $10 books left</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
