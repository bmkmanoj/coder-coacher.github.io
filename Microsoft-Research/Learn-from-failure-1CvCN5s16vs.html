looking for a job and one of the places
i interviewed was HP Labs in Silicon
Valley and I just think remember whoever
was the general manager was interviewing
me he's looking at my resume and he said
well let's see he worked at bell labs on
micro processors and they're not in that
business anymore are they and then you
went to a startup called Three Rivers
computer and they're dead aren't they
and then you went to multiflo and
they're out of business aren't they how
much would i have to pay you to go work
at IBM and i said very funny i mean it's
it's it's you know if you take on
startups the odds are pretty much not in
your favor but if you want to get into a
high energy high Learning never to be
repeated kind of a mode that's the way
to do it and I think it's easier when
you're younger than when you get older I
would encourage everybody to consider it
you know for at least once or twice in
your career it's see because you just
learn a lot it's the thing I liked about
it the most was there was no baloney
associated with it you there's no
corporate bureaucracy to work around
it'sit's you know all of your strengths
are brought way out and some of your
weaknesses are too and you have to fill
out you know fill up the weaknesses with
your people around you and make sure
that your strengths are brought to play
and I just really liked that environment
and I you know and but that's that's
worse some of my failures have come from
by the way those failures are what
informed what I was able to do at Intel
for the next 11 years after that it's
you know that's the things you learn
when you have failed it's something you
tried really hard at just stick with you
there there a movable after that
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
