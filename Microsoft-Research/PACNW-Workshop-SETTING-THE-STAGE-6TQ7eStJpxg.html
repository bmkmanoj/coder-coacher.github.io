hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
here's what I'm and talk about what is I
use its vision the structure of the
components some drivers and examples
what are the payoffs and outcomes which
have already been realized which are
certainly to be realized in the future
and then finally again based on that why
we are here I begin with the vision I
use has is its vision these seven goals
to be satisfied by one system from
climate maritime operations improving
forecasts of natural hazards in their
mitigation improving national defense
and homeland security minimizing public
health risks preserving and restoring
healthy marine ecosystems and sustaining
living marine resources all of that to
be supported by the data and products of
one system in that context I use has
both a regional and a federal footprint
the federal takes care of the global
aspects of this for us the regional
takes care of the coastal that allows
for both local connection and
connectivity with regional stakeholders
and and building and then trained and
educated constituency while it also
ensures national consistency as Laura
mentioned we have this regional presence
is via 11 regional associations kind of
liaised with by national federation of
regional associations in this area the
regional association is nana's and also
federal agencies also contribute to I
use and all of this is managed at least
by the REM by the NOAA I use office
these are the 11 regional associations
around the country Laura mentioned a use
up in Alaska and here in the Pacific
Northwest we are nanus all of these
regional associations are coordinated
nationally by the US I use office and
we're pleased today that the director of
the u.s. iOS office has joined us Cinco
Willis would you please raise your hand
or stand up for us
thank you my friend for coming here
today to see this there are also some 19
federal partners that are also engaged
at various levels of effort with with
this i/o system and we're so pleased and
I personally thank you laura for your
strong endorsement of bayous from the
National Weather Service that was
wonderful to hear i use itself is a
system of systems consisting of
observations distributed data management
and communications modeling analysis and
products education and outreach and
again stressing the fact that all of
those are prioritized and driven by our
users graphically this is what it looks
like on the bottom are all the various
ways of observations themselves which
are seamlessly stitched together by a
data management and communication system
again with national consistency and
regional flavor modeling and analysis
systems to ingest was as Rob mentioned
are going to be inherently sparse data
extended spatially and temporally with
models and then putting out products and
the various I use products and services
at the end tailored or driven by the
user community itself just going through
that listing observations is a plethora
of various types aviation born satellite
born ship-borne buoys gliders coastal
radars and the like makeup just some of
the various ways that data is acquired
for for the I use enterprise then once
you get the zeros and ones off an
electronic measurement system it's
turned into some geophysical parameter
those are then quality controlled and
put into various types of products with
via the data management and
communication systems that delivers the
data to users and finally we we have a
strong component of education and
outreach because first of all the
necessity of an informed constituency to
drive this process forward both
nationally and regionally is paramount
and we need to make sure that our
children are fully informed about the
necessity of having a competent ocean
observing system for them
and their children looking at some of
the drivers that that drive this I'm
just going through some examples I'm go
high level 22 specificity marine
operations which is a powerful component
in the Pacific Northwest we are a
maritime region of the country with
strong connections to the global economy
and the Pacific Rim 3 via Ocean trade I
use in the data promotes safe and
efficient marine operations supports
Coast Guard search and rescue and
informs offshore energy planning and
operations looking at some examples the
Coast Guard clearly has a need for
quality data and prognostic data for
search and rescue operations some of
those data come from high-frequency
phased array radars on the coast and
Oregon has a very excellent example of
that run out of Oregon State with Mike
cause row and then taking those data and
injected in the various types of models
that can then be utilized on a regional
scale to provide products in this case
for wave danger or search and rescue
operations climate the same kind of
thing the integrated ocean observing
system serves to support the regional
climate status and trends why is that
because climate change in an ocean sense
is going to impact humans as a species
where the ocean meets the meats humans
and that's in the coastal regions we
also provide national climate experts
with our regional measurements and
provide coastal communities with more
accurate estimates of trends as an
example with climate change marine
ecosystems are highly sensitive to
climate variation an example of I guess
they would say collaboration we can use
various types of ocean acidification
sensors on I will call them buoys of
opportunity and certainly uh nan use the
collaboration with pmel is an excellent
example of that and then taking those
types of data out and and again
extending them spatially and temporally
so that a region can understand the
connections and the teleconnections
between its local environment and what
happened on the global on the global
scales ecosystems fisheries and water
quality what do we do there certainly
we're there to minimize
potential harm from harmful algal blooms
hypoxia both regional threats here on
the west coast as as is ocean
acidification that data can support
ecosystem based management it can
support the protection of drinking water
supplies part of the thing we're talking
about here of course is that the Great
Lakes is part of this national iu system
and as and it can also assist public
health officials and others be easy
access to data access as an example
speaking of drinking water some 40
million people depend on the Great Lakes
for the drinking water supply and the
Great Lakes are part of this of this
enterprise so what do we do there well
we have various water quality of modern
frame abilities that can measure water
quality both in the Great Lakes and in
our coastal oceans and then we can put
out products here looking at something
like a red tide or harmful algal bloom
all of which are informed and enabled by
the IU's system that is data to
communications to products to put out a
warning for people coastal hazards
clearly we are well aware of that what
has happened in Japan and then the
implications of the actions of the
tsunami here on our West Coast but for
coastal hazards we support the coast
guard against search and rescue as well
as promote safe and efficient operations
and warn people about this type of thing
we're here on the west coast clearly the
the the impact of ocean waves winter
storms and the gradual erosion of this
has a profound effect on lives and
property I use can go out and actually
measure changes in that and then model
the impact of local waves or distant
ways from a tsunami here's an example of
Nan use for that you'll hear more about
this later where where those types of
data can be made available to the public
and easily accessible forms and this is
clearly a life-or-death kind of product
as far as its implications are concerned
coastal and marine spatial planning can
do the end of these drivers if I might
again supporting all of these kinds of
different operations to in this case
inform offshore energy planning and
operations which will allow for multiple
uses of a marine environment while
minimized
potential conflicts observations here on
the East Coast using our au vs and our
ovies to survey the actual oceanic
environment and then put together a
product like this which allows various
users to access via GIS technologies
where the different types of legitimate
utility or utilization of the marine
environment are best suited for in this
case wind energy extraction off on the
coast all that was a very rapid flyby of
what I hope will be increasingly clear
for the rest of the day of what the
payoffs of I us are why you are in fact
here today this allows for increased
efficiencies of data access it provides
local connections with National
Coordination there's a tremendous amount
of leveraging you'll hear more of that
in and gents talk in a minute as well as
providing linkage of existing assets
into this system much along the lines of
what Rob was talking about one-stop
shopping where and you doesn't really
matter where those data are coming from
the outcomes that we are aiming for here
are to improve the economy of first of
us a nation and hopefully the world by
unlocking the economic potential and
business benefits of the ocean safety as
I mentioned here a couple of times to
help ensure our citizens safety security
both on the codes as well as at sea and
environment I use and the data there
from is key to protecting our
environment for future generations
looking at the economy here to some
examples of how I use can do that
shipping routes on the from the global
sense the teleconnections between the
ENSO monitoring and the pirata
monitoring are raised in the Pacific
have a direct impact on the long-term
seasonal trends for people in Iowa who
need to know they should plant cotton or
soybeans that year those are driven by
the interconnectivity of our planet
offshore energy facilities can be best
facilitated by these data and certainly
things like tourism and marine
recreation if you've got those kind of
economic drivers that also depend on
accurate and timely data the environment
seems to be fairly self-explanatory
of it just quickly we need to understand
what the impacts of climate change are
there are in fact insults to the
environment as Laura mentioned such as
Deepwater Horizon we need to know where
those trajectories are going to go even
things like roundings here in the in the
Columbia bar we're in tidal heights and
density differences have a profound
impact on the decisions of wind across
that particular stretch of water to
prevent grounding of very large tankers
going into Portland as well as a that
last one here toxic algal blooms again a
powerful problem on our coastal regions
and now unfortunately making its way
into some of our urbanized estuaries out
here in the Pacific Northwest safety
obviously better weather Lord did a
superb job and understand it explaining
how understanding the ocean environment
the heat engine of the planet enables
better weather predictions including
hazardous weather search and rescue
clearly are going to be benefited by
having accurate data and on the homeland
security or national security I use as
part of the common operational picture
that's going to make sense to military
and Coast Guard people that just
understand it's necessary the
environment is a venue through which all
the other information passes so finally
why are we here we're here to educate
and inform you and to be educated and
informed by you especially important
today is those of you who have not yet
been part of this enterprise thank you
for coming it's important that you're
part of this we need to hear from the
users as I mentioned earlier both to
understand what they're doing and how
we're doing is helping them as well as
what we need to do to do it better that
has a secondary benefit to us to those
of you who are not yet and trained in
this process I want you to hear today
how important it is to us that we are in
fact user driven and finally for those
agencies state local tribal and federal
and their regional components if you're
not yet engaged with us here in the
northwest please do so and do so by
understanding that by becoming part
of this colloquium this collaborative
enterprise we can increase the
efficiency of your operations we can
increase the economy of how you do
business and and we can do this in a
collaborative fashion by leveraging
would already exist thank you very much
this has been the overview for the rest
of these talks today we'll be going to
drill back down into that and to begin
that for the Pacific Northwest it is my
distinct pleasure to engines my friend
my colleague and the executive director
of nana's Jan Newton
thank you so much David so it's my
pleasure to be the second batter in our
in our three-part presentation here and
so David gave you an excellent view of
of what I use is all about and the
national scale and you saw many national
examples what I'm really going to focus
on with you now is delivering
observations in the northwest region all
right so you saw this slide and it was
much more conceptual I want to make it
be real and specific to our region the
consistent national capability that
these regional associations can give to
a national perspective just makes so
much sense but this is the part that I'm
going to concentrate on you with now is
how nanos a regional association engages
with local and diverse stakeholders and
that is who you all many of you in this
room really represent and that's my
message to you all right so first of all
this is the nanny's region it's
beautiful and it's also quite diverse we
have we have urban harbors like Puget
Sound in the Columbia River with a lot
of maritime trade we have more rural and
open coastal environments on the owner
outer coast of Washington Oregon and
Northern California very different
environments we also have an enormous
number of very real sustained human
interactions with these environments
humans are part of this ecosystem this
is not distinct we have long legacies of
tribal industry and recreational folks
who are harvesting and being sustained
by our natural resources as you see
shellfish some of our conditions
offshore are some of the most dangerous
out there as you can see by this coast
guard vessel we have very active
geological processes in our area as you
see by that that lower graphic and the
and the communities perched there and
the other element there showing the
the girl interacting with a fish trap is
is that we're in this ecosystem together
and it is our understanding our common
understanding of how best to nurture it
that we truly nurture our nest so this
is the diversity of the nannies region
but we also have the fortunate
opportunity to use a lot of very
exciting techniques as you've been
hearing about and as many of you are
involved with technologies that give us
insight to those those regions the
coastal HF radar that we have along part
of the coast primarily in Oregon buoys
and and blighters this this one happens
to be off of La Push but the one thing
that I want to emphasize is that when we
do things we don't just do one item on a
buoy this one happened to be funded by a
foundation through the University of
Washington we've partnered with Noah
pmel to put their sensors on them
there's also an autonomous glider that
goes around the buoy we've partnered
with the pacific ocean shelf tracking
system to put receivers that detects am
and migrations so we're really making an
integrated ecosystem level observing
system and optimizing the information we
get out from that this is our goal and
of course the the diverse techniques
that we have for understanding our
shorelines and this is one of nanosys
early successes was that the state of
oregon and the state of washington
through to state agencies doe gamme the
oregon department of geology and mineral
industries and the Washington Department
of Ecology came together and instead of
just doing things their own
idiosyncratic ways said let's do this in
a common manner so that we can make
assessments along the coastline together
so we've already had some really good
success stories but the question that
faced us as we started to stand up nany
asst is how do we deliver observations
to the Northwest region what and for
what purpose by whom and how best okay
those are challenging questions
is this is not a trivial item well what
do you have to start with you have to
start with the people right so that
engaging with our diverse local
stakeholders I know you can't read this
but what this represents is the at
present 45 member governing council that
nanos has engaged with and who have
signed our memorandum of agreement and I
just want to put a plug in that if you
want to be an annus member it is free it
is legally non-binding but it does
require your signature and memorandum
and agreements are in the back of the
room Amy Springer there can help you
with one and you can be part of our
governance structure this governance
structure is real this isn't just
happenstance up here these are people
who attend meetings and give us input
help us to define priorities these are
color-coded because I wanted to show the
diversity we have industries we have
tribal as well as federal state and
local governments we have nonprofits and
we have academic and research
institutions and you know sometimes
you've heard I uses being labeled oh
it's just an academic exercise it is not
it is very very well integrated and
certainly here in nany's we are
extremely proud of that that group of
individuals and the governance structure
that we've worked out in a democratic
fashion with representational executive
council have helped they helped us every
year we write a proposal identify where
are our priorities Maness doesn't want
to recreate the wheel we don't want to
do things that people are already doing
we want to be that glue or that that
that helpful bit that can take a need
and get it in a way that's going to
serve one of our stakeholders one of our
members in a way that's more efficient
and more effective okay that takes
everybody's input to identify it I might
not come up with the right idea but
those 45 people definitely will this
list that David went over maritime
operations
ecosystem impacts and assessments
fisheries biodiversity coastal hazards
and climate was in the very first
multi-year proposal that we submitted to
the National I us office and it had that
very quote in there that these were the
issues having the greatest impact on
Pacific Northwest citizenry ecosystems
and that we believe were amenable to
being substitute in proved okay so that
was the real message there we can start
to make a difference and and we rely on
our governing council every year to keep
giving us feedback how are we doing on
these things and these are high-level
words here and this afternoon you're
going to be hearing examples some of
which we've done and and we want your
ideas for where the places that we
should go all right so we had two
strategies they're pretty easy integrate
what we have and that doesn't mean just
the widgets that means the people that
means the technologies so so let's let's
bring together what we have we've been
mentioned in partnerships all morning
and we'd thrive on partnerships I don't
think partnerships or something to do
just because budgets are tight I think
partnerships are the right thing to do
regardless of the budget because that's
where you get the synergies that's where
you get the good cross-fertilization of
ideas that's where you get the
efficiencies but just what you have
isn't always what you need um so we have
to be strategic about what else we need
and we link those back to those
priorities ok that's a cycle that's
really been working well so Nana's has
done this and here's a perfect example
of being integrating what we have in a
full sense you'll notice that there are
22 different logos up here and my
clicker doesn't work the first one is
nana's you can see that up there the
second one is ooi that stands for the
ocean observatories initiative ooi is a
program directed by the National Science
Foundation another very major ocean
observing initiative I use you
heard about they are both going to have
assets in our region these should not be
two pillars going on independently and
we have not we have meetings together
this conceptual model was drafted
together we are not going to put buoys
where their plan is for buoys we are
going to work together in citing these
we work together consistently to come up
with the best plan based on the
scientific input the processes in our
large marine ecosystem and the
California current system that are going
to give us this underlying understanding
of the system all right by doing that
that enables nannies to be as efficient
as we can we always need more we always
request more than what we get that
there's budget for but we can really
sharpen and hone in on okay you know
what there was no measurement off of La
Push Washington and we went after that
and we went after it in a creative way
we went through a foundation we
leveraged the heck out of everything but
these are the kinds of things we can do
until I have a lot of passion for this
but I think it's because the people in
menus really care about this and we want
to do it in a way that that makes sense
and when you start doing it and you get
some success it's really exciting the
other thing is that once you start doing
this you find out that you have a lot of
friends that come out of the woodwork
that say wow this is pretty cool what
this map is showing you are dots each
one of those dot is an observing asset
they're color-coded okay green yellow
and red the night nanus smooth the NOAA
I use office funds the RAS to do
observations as well as all of those
other services and you can see that if
there were green dots on there that
would be funded a hundred percent by the
nannies that the NOAA is office yellow
is funded partially and red is funded 0%
okay there are no green dots on here but
you see an awful lot of yellow and red
dots on there because we've got people
who have you know never even heard of
nannies but they see the data delivery
system that you're going to see in just
a few minutes and they'll say wow
you want to be part of that that's a
great idea so we're already integrating
these things so this extreme level of
leverage and linkage so that now you
don't just go to one place to get one
kind of data in another place and
Jonathan will tell you more about this
but you're seeing an overall composite
picture all right how do we organize our
people people is what gets things done
right and so people have different
capabilities and perspectives so nana's
has established three standing
committees in addition to our
observational component one is our data
management and communications committee
and Steve oosik I and Emilio may or
gusty from Boeing and Emilio from UW are
co-chairs of that committee in our
audience with us today they lead an
amazing team from from a diversity of
places OSU ohsu state agencies a team
that works together on how to do all
that data stuff that I don't have a clue
attitude and David and I take great
pride that we have no idea how to do
that stuff we have another group the
education and outreach group and Amy
spranger in the back is our education
outreach specialist here in Washington
State she's joined by another person
Sarah mikula in Oregon and they
collectively work together with another
committee chaired by Nancy hunter of
Oregon Sea Grant who is working towards
what education and outreach needs okay
then we have a third committee the user
products committee and I'm going to be
turning the floor over to Jonathan Allen
from doe gammy who is the chair for that
who says okay you know we've got this
information and we've got these needs
how are we going to start delivering
this information what are these products
what do people want to see do they want
to see it like this okay so they each
have different perspectives but as you
can see in the center that where it says
tricom these committees work
comprehensively together some people are
on one or more
two or more committees every year they
annually meet they sit they set
priorities they have an awful lot of
communication and it keeps it integrated
and going we think it's a great recipe
for for how we've made some progress all
right so I've given you just a snippet
on what for what purpose by whom how
best to do it I'm going to just give you
very quick examples jonathan is going to
tell you a little bit more about them
but how best to get this out there this
is what we've done to date we want your
feedback on what we've done to date we
also want your ideas on how to make it
better the first thing is our website or
I guess I'm supposed to say web portal I
don't know the difference but I know
that one is bigger but anyways so this
is a nanny's website and it is your
entry point from here you can get
everywhere those little turquoise things
across the top are a priority items
they're hyperlinked if you click on
those they have themed pages to say like
ocean acidification and it's not just
our ocean acidification page we link to
the NOAA pmel and we link to the
shellfish industry information on it so
so we really have the capacity to build
from one portal a lot of information
some of our noteworthy things the
nannies visualization system i'll
mention in a minute our memorandum of
agreement right here you can download it
and sign it if you don't do it here and
so this is our our website the nannies
visualization ship visualization system
nvs as we're supposed to call it is our
pride and joy and I'm not going to say
anything more about that because that's
what Jonathan will introduce to you but
it's how you access and visualize the
data we have also had the pleasure and
honor to work with several groups to
tailor a user product to a specific need
this is an example we worked with the
National Estrin research reserve system
and Kathy angel through the coastal
training program here in the state of
Washington Department of Ecology did a
lot of outreach to the shellfish grower
industry
said okay you need real-time data what
format do you want it in do you want it
in Fahrenheit do you want it in Celsius
have you know what's the time record you
want and so work together to optimize
the data that you can get through our
nvs system as well as in a specifically
tailored application one a quick example
we've also given a lot of thought into
how do we deliver this okay not
everybody sits in front of a computer
unfortunately I spend more and more of
my time that day but you know what the
people who are interacting with the
environment they may be on a boat they
may be on a shoreline they may be on a
dock and more and more we have these
wonderful mobile applications these
androids and iPhones and and nannies
working with that wonderful d-mat team
has put together these apps that you can
get their free and you can access the
data you can you can scroll through
these graphics and you'll hear more
about those for people who are on the
move first responders they don't want to
be calling hey can you log onto your
computer it's right there in their hand
and lastly learning tools if we do not
educate society if we do not educate the
next generation we're missing the point
and so nanny's also works with our
regional scientists and information
givers to collect information and to
produce some useful learning tools we
have lesson plans we even have a
competition for teachers to send us
lesson plans right now using nanny's
data so that they're engaged in this we
have videos that lead people through how
does hypoxia happen what are some of the
processes so so these learning tools are
another important endeavor so in summary
that's that's making nannies regional
for you here in the Pacific Northwest
and that's what we're doing to date very
briefly but I need to conclude my talk
with one really important aspect of nano
Senate and it really tied with with what
both of our keynote speakers Laura and
and and John
in both his words and and what he has
heard Kevin say and that's to explain to
you the nannies logo you know this isn't
even really a logo this is a work of art
it was drawn for us by a shim shin
tribal member Tom Guthrie he used to
work at the University of Washington and
this is 3 for critters to the the
Pacific Northwest um the one I always
like to start with this one with the
teeth on the bottom see that hole there
that's a blowhole that's an orca a
toothed whale okay and the Orca is the
protector of the ocean the one to its
left it also has teeth and it has a long
thin in the head that is the wolf that's
the protector of the land all right up
on the top there are actually two birds
one has a hooked beak and one has a
smooth beak the hook beak is an eagle
that's the protector of the sky the one
on the left is the Raven and in much of
the the Salish and Pacific Northwest
tribal lore The Raven is the trickster
and from my perspective listening to Tom
and his explanation to me that's entropy
that and the red circle around this is
the ecosystem see there's a red circle
around all four of those critters he
said that's the ecosystem and at the
center are the water waves he said I
kind of think that's what you guys are
doing isn't it and so so that circle of
protection that understanding of that
very connected ecosystem this symbology
for nany asst is real and I think we're
putting it into practice and it's my
honor to be able to explain Tom's art
but also to give you a tiny snippet into
nannies and I'm going to conclude now
and turn it over to Jonathan Allen to
tell us about how we're delivering the
data to you thank
thanks Jen so I have the pleasure of
talking a little bit about visualization
which is kind of ironic because I'm a
sand guy and spent a lot of time
pounding the beaches and yet have worked
with the core team of I should say the
privilege of working with the core team
of folks were the nanos who have
actually been instrumental in
integrating a lot of the different data
sets that we have out there and and
developing the platform that we see
today in terms of delivering information
to the folks so what I'm going to talk
about is a little bit about where we
were a few years ago and we were out
today and some insights into in terms of
where we might be going down the line in
the future and you know we've heard so
far today that you know one of the key
components of iOS and nanos in general
is the acknowledgement that you know
several years ago decade ago access to
information was being accomplished
through multiple venues multiple data
streams multiple sites and to be honest
of is actually for those who are not
well versed than in finding information
it's a challenge for folks particularly
the public at large and so really in
terms of trying to integrate all those
different data streams and develop a
platform for for making them available
that was a core focus for our team of
folks so a key need then is to be able
to you know seamlessly deliver all these
different types of data products from
both open ocean is trained to rigidus
sources things like that throughout the
nanos domain integrating across both
cross-border so working with folks up in
Canada as well as within adjacent
regional ocean observing systems in the
south and up in the Gulf of Alaska and
that's quite a challenge when you think
about it drawing together all these
different
types of data streams that are out there
now news currently provides access to
something on the order of 40 40 to 50
different types of variables these are
the different types of parameters the
waves the winds you name it and in total
we're actually serving something on the
order of 160 assets and that includes
both models as well as gliders and other
in satori expand radar and things like
that so it's a a tremendous suite of
data variables and in-situ assets that
are available throughout the Pacific
Northwest all in one type of
visualization system your real goal here
obviously is to improve people's
awareness in terms of situational
awareness of conditions that's obviously
very important national weather service
features very highly in this particular
area and it's critical to operations of
many many organizations that serve the
public out there so improving access and
understanding of these different types
of very very mental conditions is also a
critical element with what we try to do
and obviously over the short to long
term building up the the data streams
both short-term long-term data series is
absolutely paramount in terms of our
understanding of the short to long term
changes that we witness along our
coastline so these are the overall goals
and towards ultimately improving our
understanding of climate variability
safety particularly in the Pacific
Northwest with our extreme wave
environment operations in order to
accomplish day-to-day activities and
then critically improving resource
management for those state agencies and
federal agencies that have important
roles in these particular areas that
hopefully in when when brought together
will help in terms of overall regional
productivity so that's kind of the
overall sort of visualization of where
we were several years ago in terms of
trying to integrate all these these
different types of data streams the
challenge obviously is as we see in this
room here today is that you know
there are many many different
stakeholders out there and every one of
us have different needs and in terms of
being able to access information of
particular types and that's quite a
challenge for for us as a team trying to
figure out ways in which to actually
make these data available so through a
lot of sort of visioning in the early
years and discussions with with multiple
folks you know we identified sort of
critical elements they would actually
form the backbone for the nanos
visualization system that is we need to
be able to seamlessly deliver
information must be accurate it must be
of sufficient temporal spatial
resolution to meet all those different
user needs and clearly ultimately the
final step meeting individual year needs
or agency needs so within that that sort
of scheme of things we identified sort
of four key requirements
interoperability at both regional
national level scales as well as the
global level we must have a reliable
mechanism for ingesting the suite of
data that's out there and then obviously
developing the the tools and mechanisms
for making that available through models
and applications and so on and so based
around there we settled on a essentially
a very simple interface of google maps
type portal that resolves revolves
around really three core components that
is providing information on current
conditions making daily forecasts will
forecasts out through several days
available and then obviously access to
historical data and it's the latter the
latter point there that is an area that
we're actually working on as we move
forward in time here on Jan showed this
image earlier and it just highlights the
R coos that we we are developing within
the Pacific Northwest a ously there's a
federal backbone here which is based
around the NDB see buoys the National
Ocean service tie gauge stations that
are strewn along our coastline but
there's also other parameters you know
the satellite based imagery that's being
collected for
Northwest and so the challenge was
actually how you go about integrating
these widely disparate data sets and
data streams into into one mechanism
what we settled on was this really quite
neat interface the Nash the nanos
visualization visualization system or
envious and it's based around you know
multiple assets and with key icons
indicating the types of instruments or
payloads that are out there ocean
observing type ones land based systems
and things like that and there are
multiple parameters that are being
presented and made available through
this type of system I'm also showing as
a backdrop here is a composite one month
satellite imagery of water temperature
and over the past month Ian Pacific
Northwest and not surprisingly it's all
cold and so there's nothing terribly
interesting to to identify there but it
just highlights this capability of being
able to visualize an overlay multiple
types of data streams in 11 portal and
and this was something clearly we never
had before so this is my one complicated
slide and I just put this up here just
to actually highlight the complexity of
the in VA system and the mechanisms that
are being utilized to try and deliver
information to your desktop anywhere in
the country and I mean anywhere in
country whether you want to access it by
mobile applications from smartphones or
through web portals but ultimately it
starts with the data assets that are out
there in the ocean delivering
information via a harvester that goes
out and sucks in their data processes it
based on a database and then it's being
delivered through a portal or through
other types of delivery systems and then
ultimately reaching your smartphone or
your desktop so it's a very complicated
process and there's a lot of different
elements that are being well there are
coming into play through this this
process and over the years we've
actually built in mechanisms that is one
part of the system fails
someone is immediately notified through
their cell phone that we can then go
back and try and identify with that
problem is so there's some redundancy
being built into the system as well to
try to alleviate downtime which you know
periodically does happen so within the
envious systems you have again access to
multiple information here's an example
this is showing wave watch free forecast
highlighting a very strong storm system
you have Victor arrow showing directions
of waiver wave angles these can be
actually all in individually turned on
or off you've got access to individual
sensors in this case here and this is a
profiling buoy and Karen litter in Puget
Sound here and you have access to
multiple variables and in this case in
multiple depths this is oxygen
concentration at multiple depths at one
particular location and you can
obviously access information over short
time periods 24 hours 7 days 30 days and
we're actually in the process of
bringing out a 60 day time series very
shortly and the other element that will
be arriving on the scene and the
not-too-distant future is actually a
time slider bar which allows you to
access a much longer time series which
may be of much greater use to to folks
on the left here you've got access to
the Institute assets you've got cruise
information gliders there's information
about the status of the buoys here shown
for example green indicates that the the
buoy is online the shape of the pie the
indicates when the last observation was
taken whether it's up to date if the
system is down for some reason it's
turns red now there's all these types of
very useful information that's being
available to folks in in one location as
sure as I point out there's other
critical things like linking directly to
the specific providers of those buoys
you can click on that and I'll tell you
who that person is or where that website
is there may be also information about
within the
details tab about the status of that
particular instrument whether it's down
or its whether it's been updated or
modified in some fashion so there's a
tremendous amount of information that's
being disseminated through this
particular portal another really neat
component here's an example this is a
federal asset that's a 10db Cebu
Istanbul banks buoy located offshore
from Newport on the Central Oregon coast
here we're actually integrating as a
backdrop this is the North American
mesoscale model showing wind patterns
across the pacific northwest wind speed
vectors are shown and strength of the
wind speeds are shown in the scalp
bottom bottom scale down here and at the
particular buoys station we're providing
information about the current wave
conditions at this particular sorry this
is wind wind conditions at this
particular locations this is actually in
the comparator tab where we're actually
overlaying information or model
information for that particular site and
it's being updated on a daily basis as
the model is improved as new more
information is being provided there we
can see the level of skill of the model
in terms of predicting the conditions
out through several days and it's
changing obviously as the day goes by so
this is a pretty neat capability within
the nba's system you have access to
other types of numerical models out
there there's a high-resolution Oregon
State University wave watch model which
integrates much higher resolution
symmetry there's the Pacific Basin wave
watch model it's operated by Noah so
there's a lot of other types of data
sets and variables that one can access
through this particular system another
element is actually that presents
challenges obviously is how you deal
with taking and casts of transit cars at
particular locations and this is based
on prism cruisers done in the Puget
Sound region developing in a longshore
plot of changes in dissolve oxygen at
depth of different locations and you can
see a particular area here down in the
bottom of hood canal where very low
oxygen levels of being achieved compared
with out in the
open Puget Sound region so it's another
tool within the envious system that can
be accessed by folks so that's kind of
where we're at at the moment we were
going we're and going back to my second
slide acknowledging the the range of
stakeholders that are out there this
obviously presents real problems for us
because you know clearly NBS has reached
a stage now where it's actually fairly
complicated in terms of the amount of
information that's available to folks so
the approach we're taking now is to try
to develop more focused applications and
and so we call these in vets or nannies
visualization applications and these are
now being targeted at specific user
groups so for example to invest
occurrent lee available is the beach and
shoreline mapping portal which i'll show
a little bit about in a minute and just
recently we released in november the
Pacific Northwest tsunami evacuation
zones providing information about
inundation from both local and distant
tsunami events other portals that are
actually in the making at the moment
we're looking at developing a Maritimes
operations portal a situational
awareness where you actually will have
current conditions of a particular
parameters that may be of interest and
then there are the more significant
developments such as the integrated data
access system allowing for access to
much longer time series of data being
able to customize and develop your own
plots and and comparisons of multiple
parameters and then also through a
collaboration with the sea mop costal
margin center we're actually working
with them to through the data Explorer
to again allow for more simplified axis
of multiple variables and from multiple
sites through a simple user-defined
portal here's an example one of the
inverse this is the the beaches in that
showing in this particular case these
are stations along the coast here and
down in Central Oregon showing a time
history of changes of changes on the
spit here and the current conditions in
black
and eventually you know the the
indications are that this particular
site down through here will probably
breach potentially opening up a hole
into netarts Bay which could obviously
have ramifications for example the
shellfish growing industry that's based
in eat at bay so these are the types of
things that could be delivered as well
as longer time series of this particular
location I just skipped over one slide
the other really neat portal that we've
recently released is the the tsunami
evacuation zones and this is a through a
collaboration between my agency Oregon
popular geology the Washington puppet of
natural resources and nanos where we're
as the agency tasked with developing
evacuation zones we're providing that
information to nana's and nana news is
able to take that information and
develop a really neat portal for
allowing folks to actually figure out
where they are and whether they're in a
tsunami inundation zone and things like
that so here's an example this is cannon
beach you can do a search by street
address you enter that in based on the
shaded polygons it tells you whether
you're in a an evacuation zone or a nun
dacians own associate with a local
Cascadia which is the the bright yellow
here showing the maximum extent of
inundation for this particular location
versus a more distant tsunami and that
may inundate a much obviously a much
smaller area I point out there one of
the neat things about this particular
portal is that we're actually directly
linked to the Alaska Tsunami Warning
Center and as as information bulletins
are released through them it's
automatically being updated on the news
on the news portal and here's an example
where we had an earthquake 6.9 this
morning down near vanuatu Alaska Tsunami
Warning Center issued a statement
information statement saying that
basically everything's okay there's no
tsunami likely to be generated with this
type of event everything's hunky-dory so
this is one of the other sort of neat
mechanisms about this type of interface
we can actually bring in lots of
different types of overlays
identifying critical facilities we can
identify things like bridges if you
actually gloss over that little point
that'll tell you that be careful when
you're planning your evacuation route
this bridge could be damaged in an
earthquake you know things like that
that people would not normally think
about but we can actually provide that
make that information through this this
type of portal other types of
information that's listed there i mean
there's a really wide a huge amount of
information about preparation procedures
for evacuation how to respond in local
and distant earthquake scenarios and
information about where to go so there's
a tremendous amount of information here
which is now available or more easily
available to to the public at large
significant amount of development in
time and effort has also been directed
at developing applications that are
going to be able to or available for
smartphones it's very clear that
smartphone technology is really probably
the way of the future and increasingly a
lot of the information that we're seeing
on desktop type applications will become
more available through these types of
smartphone apps so nano is released an
NV s mobile application basically
analogous to the main portal which has
all those in situations you can actually
you're able to obtain direct information
about waves tides you name it at any
point along the coast or wherever you
want to be and so you can you can get
access their information very easily in
November we release the tsunami
Northwest evacuation app for iPhones and
then in January just a few weeks ago we
released a similar version for the
android market and so both of these are
now available and it basically emulates
the tsunami portal and it brings in that
added advantage that when you're out
there you can locate yourself
immediately you can tell whether you're
in the inundation zone or not and you
can obviously plan accordingly I was
saying to my boss earlier it's quite
thought-provoking when you're actually
standing out on the spit there and you
locate yourself
on using that tsunami portal and you
suddenly realize the area that you are
in an area behind you that's going to be
inundated it's actually a real wake-up
call and it makes you think about where
you need to go in the advent of such an
emergency so you know it's very clear
that this type of technology will play
an increasingly more important role in
all our lives I'll just finish up by
saying that within this portal it has
you know essentially every capability
that you see within the actual main
website is being emulated here you can
control elements of you know in terms of
backdrops you can control the degree of
shading or transparency things like that
you've got access to brochures the PDFs
themselves that are produced by the
state agencies responsible for that you
can turn on and off markers and all that
sort of stuff so there's a lot of a lot
of features within this particular tool
that you can manipulate and control and
utilize so one of the the great things
to see about a slide like this which is
is attempting to capture the usage
trends of the nanny's portal and website
over the past several years it's it's
great to see that we are indeed growing
I'll point out that these black lines
are sort of averages for those years
there and clearly you see a lot of
spikes as incidents happen along our
coastline and it generates interest and
here's an example March 11th we saw a
very dramatic rise and number of people
wanting to access the nanos NBS side in
terms of trying to find out information
whether it be information on water
levels or the tsunami inundation zones
or things like that but the the neat
thing to see is that over time we
actually are growing we're growing
slowly but it's it's happening and it's
very exciting to see certainly in the
last year or so no significant uptake in
interest in in the news system so it's
it's very encouraging in that respect
and I'll end there and I just again just
last comment I mean I think we've done a
remarkable job in a very short period of
time I'm excited too
to see some of the potential future
technologies that nany's can actually
help and hope to utilize better and I
think certainly providing we remain
integrated and are able to maximize that
to the best of our abilities I see some
exciting new opportunities and products
for the nanos region as a whole thank
you ok so we have time now for a panel
so I'm just going to ask that the the
three of us Jonathan I just wanted to
ask you to explain one last thing on
here which are those little arrows there
oh I'm sorry I didn't mention it so in
addition to obviously viewing and
viewing the plots themselves and I like
two things I mentioned one is if you
click on that little little layers
magnifying glass in the bottom
right-hand corner it'll pop you up into
a another page which shows a bigger
image of that particular plot and then
the other components is that obviously
you can actually download that
information and a variety of formats by
clicking on each of these little bottom
pointing arrows in the longer term being
able to access much longer time series
is the direction that we're heading and
I'm confident that we'll be able to at
least provide annual if not maybe
slightly longer time series in the
not-too-distant future which will be an
exciting new development for nana's as a
whole great so let's take our chairs
over here and we're right at
eleven-thirty right on time so we
actually have about 20 minutes for a
question and answer session if you have
one for us yes
the very last slide that you showed your
user statistics give it right you're
focusing or you have where we're getting
there slowly that's an area that we've
been thinking about quite a bit over the
last couple of years is to try to make a
better assessment of who our end users
are and and you know at this point in
time we're reliant on emails and traffic
like that that informing us of things
that may be breaking down at cetera and
and how they may be using products and
you know we utilize obviously Google
Analytics to some degree to make
determinations about how much usage is
going on how many page views very simple
statistics and but you're really limited
in terms of at least correct me if I'm
wrong but are you look really limited in
terms of through those mechanisms
determining who the actual users are you
can only sort of locate them to two
general areas and you can't get down to
level of detail as to whether it's a
fisherman or a resource manage or
anything like that that's another level
of investigative work that you know it's
a direction that we want to go and and
we're very mindful of it and i know that
i use in general in terms of making the
case to Congress etc it's a critical
piece of the puzzle to demonstrate that
we are being successful or went off
let's see let's go um Chris and then
Chris and then there was another hand
here she picked the guy with the tennis
shoes I far away from you as I can get
the amount of information that you've
pulled together is really quite amazing
and impressive but it raises a question
in my mind as a scientist of data
quality you know you you basically are
pulling together all these data sets
that you have no control over
how they're done or the quality of the
data coming in do you have some sense of
how you might be able to do some quality
control I'll start on that and then
others might want to chime in Chris
that's that to me is the central
question of this all the data we serve
are the data providers the data we serve
are what the data providers are giving
us so it is only as good as what the
provider gives us now if nanus is
partially funding a data provider we
have agreed upon you know methods of
quality assurance that we're working on
sharing collectively across the group to
do that but if it's real time data it's
real time data so real time data you
know can always have its pluses or
minuses and we do have those disclaimers
on there in terms of that when we have
our slider bar then going able to go
back and have those those QA QC
procedures for the the data providers
that is that is something we are doing
as an annus organization now you notice
we're also serving a lot of data from
people who who just say we would like to
have our data part of your system and
that truly is caveat emptor this is this
is something we really struggle with and
as a scientist I think the scientist is
going to need to know what they are
going to allow into their analysis and
do some extra work to see whether you
want to use it but I think that there
are two strategies I think one and it
depends on what questions you're
researching obviously you may need the
level of precision to the highest order
for some of the research you're doing
other times you need to see more
observations that allow you to see more
of the picture in a comprehensive manner
and if you do have less precision it may
not affect the research question that
you're asking so much so it is a mix and
I know that that the national office has
been working there's court on there's
there's all of these different acronyms
and I can never remember what the the
one dish or is but
this is this is a huge issue Charlie
Alexander in stankus offices is working
on this it's not an easy thing to do but
i think we either you know stop
providing people with real-time data I
don't think that's the way to go or we
try to limit and so our policy has been
it is caveat emptor but it's important
so I believe mrs. Moore's and then there
was another over here jonathan is there
an explicit role for the value-added
private industry to participate in
making environmental information
products within the present conception
of the system that's actually an
interesting question it's not something
that we've really discussed I mean
obviously I don't think there's any any
prohibition against the private sector
wanting to develop products there could
integrate with what we have here and but
it's not you know to be honest it's not
something that I think we really thought
about at this point in time sector plays
a big role in meteorology and so you
anticipate should anticipate this is
going to play a big role in operational
oceanography Joe and right in the
southeast there are private providers of
information who are very upset about
what's what's happening because they see
their market being encroached upon by so
you are you talking about more the
implications are you talking more about
the implications of the types of data
with serving and the impact that it
would have on private entities that are
trying to serve similar data or
developers or providing sorry those
companies that make products right yeah
yeah there's there's no prohibition or
adjunct against that the these for the
most part our data which are provided by
US taxpayer dollars in general those are
provided the American public can have
access to those that's what we're doing
the the next step that you're talking
about going from that to
q weather whatever the analog might be
in the Northwest Pacific Ocean I don't
believe has occurred yet but there's
nothing preventing that if there's a
market and an economic engine to drive
such a product my opinion is that ought
to be explored because it could be
important component of economic
development yeah absolutely should say
something we obviously have been
struggling with this over the years and
not really struggling but making sure
that we have policies in place and one
of the policies is the fair weather
policy that's our private public
partnership policy to make sure that the
information we have the public can take
and then add to it so it's the
value-added that that we need as a part
of building our weather ready nation we
have to have the private sector right
beside us I guess symbiotically
exploring our information and producing
products that will help save lives and
property so it's definitely something to
know the climate community is struggling
with now as well we have Noah has a
science advisory board and we have a
response now that we need to respond to
them in regards to the open weather and
climate service so how can we ensure
that our information is available to the
public and to the private sector so they
can then continue to make a profit so
there is a fine line between what we're
doing but we definitely need to maintain
that partnership the other thing I was
going to mention is a we have to instill
that partnership and make sure that we
aren't infringing upon the pub the
private sectors ability to make a profit
at the same time there was a one key
element I had there and I just lost it
so thank you fairweather yeah the fair
weather policy we are updating the fair
weather policy we're in the process of
updating that and so that's that's the
point I was going to make so thank you
it's a partnership and we have to
continue to X
were those avenues that's just the name
of the policy it's the fair weather
policy so it's our public private
partnership has nothing to do with the
actual weather the way I was going to
respond to that is that you need to have
these relationships established before
the severe weather comes so you can make
sure that the information is is going
out to the right folks another thing
what I was going to say was we have some
individuals some private entities that
will give us the information we do the
quality control on it and then by having
that Noah meatball on there or that Noah
stamp of approval it actually makes the
information more valuable for them to
then take and do the value added
information so we have a question over
here um yeah this is that might be a
follow-up question for that i'm a
developer for a private company and when
i look at this i think it's great you
got a lot of data on there a lot of data
for somebody who's never seen it and I
think you're seeing that when you're
doing your applications now that a more
targeted and focused towards groups how
can I get this data as a developer I
don't want the graphs I want the data is
there a way that I can pull this data
into my application so you guys don't
have to write every focused application
I'm sure there is but it's not I'll turn
it over to my colleague Amelia Mayer
goes in the back there you may be able
to better answer that for you we can't
hear you n yeah well we'll need a
microphone so because we are recording
this so it's very important for us to
wouldn't be obvious from sorry so the
brief answers yes we have data services
that would do exactly what you were
interested in that wouldn't be apparent
by just looking at NBS because the
audience for nvs is users so talk to us
we have I don't want to go into details
here because of the diversity of the
audience but we have a couple of options
they're fairly new and we're still
careful because we have limited
resources and we don't want to be
flooded by a request that brings
on our servers but definitely talk to us
that's part of our mission make the data
available integrated and make it
available thanks a million there's a
question in the back and then one here
as well this question would be for Jan
yes um I represent the fishing industry
at the federal level and state of Oregon
and this information looks very
encouraging to the fishing industry and
I guess there's no limit to how this
could possibly help the fishing industry
my number one concern is it looks
expensive and I was wondering what
threats your possible opportunities
exists in the future for long-term
funding of this process this you know
you guys are asking all the easy
questions um data quality data sharing
and long-term funding so I use was set
up to be a sustained system that that
was what Congress called for in 1999 and
what was enacted in the authorization
sustained federal dollars are only as
good as federal budgets so so that's
that's that's no easy that's no easy nut
to crack we believe we have faith that
the I use program will continue that
this will continue to be part of the
nation's effort going forward we heard
this morning some very strong statements
about the importance of this what will
that funding level be you know nanosys
revenues each year or right around to a
couple million dollars will that float
up to four or five where we could be
doing a lot more will it regress to a
million where we're going to have some
really really tough decisions and and I
don't know what we're going to do I
don't know those are those are our
national questions to answer from our
congress but i will say that part
engaging with you all is that you know
you you speak to your Congress people
you speak to your legislators and the
folks who make those decisions sees if
we have things that that are making a
difference in jobs and the economy and
safety and people hear about that and
they hear that it is cost-effective
that's that's the kinds of things we
need to hear about and when David and I
and others go back and we talked to
members on the hill it's amazing both
sides of the aisle say yes this is good
but you know our nation is in great
uproar in terms of what to do about the
economy but they have to hear that this
is important and that it matters to
folks like you really is important just
a few seconds on that one of the reasons
we've been striving so diligently for
now off eight years with with nanos to
to build and informed and educated
constituency is for that very reason is
is to be able to carry a coherent
message which is true and which speaks
to the efficiency and the collaborative
benefits of of this approach to meeting
federal regional agency needs while
serendipitously meeting the regionally
focused needs of our people this is we
what we believe is the most
cost-effective way to do that and so
thank you for being here to hear that
story and to hopefully carry it with you
and you leave and i'll also add very
quickly that it doesn't just have to be
the feds funding this you know that's
that's another thing if people think
that this is an important idea it i
think i use was really thought of as
public-private partnership and so really
trying to pull that out right now we
have one funding source but but we could
improve that base and and we have the
means to have fiscal responsibility and
ways to allocate that in a way that
gives you the kinds of things that you
want so that's another business model
that we should definitely be exploring
stenka so on the sustainability i wanted
to let you know a couple couple key
things
in the progression of us i use it yes i
do think it is sustainable first the
legislation that was passed in march of
2009 it'll come up for reauthorization
in a year from now we're going to need
everybody support to get that
reauthorized it's important to have that
legislation secondly the program started
as congressional earmark and it really
got the program going but in 2008 it
became part of the President's budget
and that is a big milestone to make it a
sustaining program the lead federal
agency is in NOAA and therefore there
are two lines as you can see in the
federal budget that talk at a national
level for I use and at the regional
level for the IU Senate's and I think
it's very important to note that
seventy-five percent of the funding for
this program does not stay inside the
federal agency in this case Noah it
comes out to support this regional
enterprise which we are absolutely
committed to keeping going and and
educating and advocating for how
mission-critical this is this is not
just a nice to have extramural research
program that are critically important in
the research perspective but its mission
critical to the mission agencies the
Coast Guard who relies on it for their
search and rescue and you heard from
from NOAA this morning and our other
federal agencies the Army Corps who the
the bill burka Myers here representing
the Army Corps and that sustained
partnership the other thing that you
should know is that we now have opened a
five-year partnership with all of our
region's it's not a year-to-year
proposal process that we do we are now
in the second year of this fiscal year
of a five-year partnership to show that
commitment to in this case nana's and
the other 11 regions so for those
reasons and we do are committed to the
sustainment of this but as Jen said we
need your support and in real terms of
how it helps you from an economic
perspective a safety perspective
and helping you do what you do every day
because that's you know that's our
mission so thank you I believe there's
two more questions one here went over
there thank you al-azhar I I'm here
representing the commercial fishing
industry from Oregon as a usergroup
question for Jonathan great presentation
by the way and by the way you're doing a
really good job with a two million
dollar budget near as I can see it's
good stuff Jonathan you showed a slide I
think it was the Stonewall buoy with
wave actual there was a blue actual and
then a red line that showed the
prediction i think that was actually
wind speed wind speed i miss miss miss
bike i'm going to be of the 47 or so
parameters that you track is there a
prediction made for each of those and
and if so how many are yeah there it is
are accurate to some degree or are there
are the Sun with with less accuracy than
others oh you're sure well so to answer
the first part and for most of the
certainly all the Indy bc buoys that I'm
aware of correct me if I'm wrong Emilio
and any station that's showing
meteorological parameters there are both
observational and model values for that
location that are being derived from
larger scale models and in this case
here we're using the name model to
provide predictions of wind conditions
of that particular site going out over
multiple days but then the other neat
thing about that is that over time those
predictions are changing based on
trajectories of storms etc as the
conditions are changing the models are
being updated and being reflected
accordingly up here I'm sorry what was
the other part of the question
you know I couldn't answer that directly
but it's a moat you know certainly all
the oceanographic stations where the
fundamental parameters waves direction
frequency winds pressure things like
that there will be for the most part I'm
pretty sure there are model predictions
of those locations but not all not all
47 have have model results associate or
type with them the accuracy is the
challenge I mean you can clearly see in
this case here the the initial forecast
made on the twenty-ninth had fairly
significant deviations relative to the
midget but over time as the system got
closer to that location the model
estimates are improving and so they're
getting better but the actual accuracies
I couldn't tell you the numbers I mean
that that's something you have to dig
down to look at the individual models
themselves so we're relying on in this
case here federal models so wave watch 3
or the name model and there will be
accuracies associate with those but
clearly as time changes they'll bail
very
like 10 ohm about traditions chillin
dissolved oxygen some of those two
predictions for any of those based on
their our model predictions for ocean
upwelling and we do make for example we
have a fish's web page that provides
information on the ocean circulation
patterns primarily temperature
integrates ocean currents and that's all
being driven by a numerical model that
was developed at Oregon State University
careful here and those are being those
models are obviously being fed by in
situ observations at different locations
to help calibrate their model let's come
back to this for the fisheries session
because this is a really good topic a
land and I'm hoping that people can see
there are three different weighted lines
there each of those is a different days
prediction and what Jonathan was saying
is the one that's very fine wasn't as
good as time goes by it gets better
there's a question bill and then Timmy
you had your hand up bill burr par with
the Army Corps of Engineers and two
questions once or mechanical this nvs
which I think I looked at when it first
came out and it's like really advanced
from then and and is it transportable i
think in i mean i don't know about the
other regions and but it's the most
sophisticated thing i've seen and is it
transportable and is their interest in
unit so the answer to that is yes and
again I'll defer to Amelia on the back
there but yes we have transported it and
the basic programming interface to other
regions it's a very cool and I've
interesting that the other thing is this
tsunami prediction because this is where
it looks like neon news is actually
doing something that the state under
state ages or something and so is that
where people go in the state for their
tsunami in freighter that like the
single place which then puts Nana's you
got to be there because this is where
people are going so sort of what is
whose whose role is that and is that one
that the Nana's is
now taken on the official tsunami we're
not worn no so two answers to that one
is we're not warning people David's
absolutely right there we're just
utilizing information from in our case
the primary warning centers the Alaska
Tsunami Warning Center that feeds
directly into our our portal and we just
provide that information and folks can
actually link to that particular site
through the the tsunami portal the other
component is the primary responsibility
of all tsunami inundation modeling and
mapping is the state agencies within
Washington Oregon's their responsibility
and in Oregon's case it's the arc my
agency Oregon a parlor geology and we're
in the process of actually completely
redoing all our tsunami inundation
evacuation maps for the entire organ
coast which were last which were done
originally in the mid-1990s and based on
new earthquake source parameters new
technologies we're updating those maps
and we're making those overlays
available through a collaboration with
nanos and Washington DNR has a similar
approach as well we got to be wrapping
the service to be wrapping this up at
Timmy has the most of a quick question
to me van with Noah and in recognition
of the fact that we're at world
headquarters of Microsoft and graciously
hosted by Microsoft Research and inside
a nice presentation by Rob fought 'land
on some of the applications that
Microsoft is developing on the research
and tech development side I feel
compelled to ask the three of you where
you sort of see in the near term areas
of opportunity to collaborate with lions
of Industry like Microsoft and whether
or not it's on the data consumption side
as they develop new and innovative
applications or if it also includes
innovating sort of the next best thing
to me that's an excellent question and
that is actually one of the very strong
impetus for why we wanted to have this
meeting
here with microsoft research and explore
with Rob and his team we will be largely
exploring this tomorrow in a session
tomorrow morning but one of the things
that we that we know that that microsoft
research has been doing is is this
two-way everything you're seeing here is
very much one way right and and we know
that there's a lot of people whether
it's citizen scientists or just folks
out in the field with observations they
want to be able to get stuff up there so
I think the sky is the limit for the
kinds of developments that we want to do
but but when we through Ralph Rainer's
leadership were exploring how and where
to host this to to be here at the guest
of microsoft research was a strong
impetus because we see that there's lots
of potential here so with that I think I
would like to thank our speakers but
also rappers recognize that we are just
telling you what so many of the people
of nanos have done and I would also like
to thank our hosts microsoft research
because that is who is treating us to
lunch right now so thank you we're
adjourned for lunch we'll see you again
