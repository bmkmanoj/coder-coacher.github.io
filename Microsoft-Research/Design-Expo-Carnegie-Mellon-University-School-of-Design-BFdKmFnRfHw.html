hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
next up we have Carnegie Mellon and dr.
lon done done all right hi I'm Bren this
is wini Sarah and Juwan were from
Carnegie Mellon University School of
Design when people come together they do
amazing things and digital technology
has the power to magnify this greatness
but too often we get so involved in our
digital world that we lose sight of
what's going on in our own backyard
presenting seedlings seedlings is a
system that uses data to help people who
care contribute to their local
communities it addresses needs
cultivates relationships and helps
people build knowledge there are other
systems out there which help people meet
one another work together or donate but
what the focus of seedlings really is is
on pushing people out into their local
communities and it helps people
collaborate and it fosters positive
social change so how did we come up with
seedlings we started by exploring the
realm of the community and civic
engagement we read literature we
interviewed we volunteered at local
community organizations and we conducted
generative research so from the word
research we quit four personas based on
their engagement in their community and
their skills we have the professional
the leaders the regular and the warm
body here which is to focus on warm body
because he had the most potential to
grow we call him water water is recently
or college students
move to Pittsburgh new job he really
wants to meet the new people there and
wants to do something good to his
community but he doesn't know where to
start he doubles into a one hearing
before and really enjoys it but at the
same time he wants to choose the levels
in the engagement and if you want to see
his impact here water mist savings and
our story starts
alright now that we saw how Walter
experiences the system let's take a
closer look at what's actually happening
at the core of seed links everything is
driven by data and this data comes from
several different places there's
publicly available community data
there's personal data that comes in from
places like facebook and linkedin and
there's also data that is curated
through the seedlings platform itself
building on this data seed like users
like Walter are able to create nurture
and celebrate projects when creating a
project previous project data is piped
into the system to offer tips and
tutorials about how to make the project
as successful as proud as possible when
nurturing a project there are several
different ways that people can
contribute for example we saw a Walter
contribute online by joining a
collaborative to-do list and we also saw
him attend a local event where he was
able to use the mobile app to track his
data and connect with other selig
members after the project was done
Walter was able to celebrate with his
team and see their contribution to the
community they were able to see how many
plants trees they planted and how many
hours they donated Walter is also able
to track his own personal growth on his
dashboard he can see his connections and
his achievements over time the next part
to the system is the Commons this is the
knowledge management portion of the
system that has built for and by the
people and it is free and open to all
within the comments there are three main
components there's a wiki page a forum
and a mentorship link where you can have
real-time conversations with more
experienced users to make sure that your
projects are successful so obviously
Walter uses a system and people like
Walter because they are the core of the
community and they know what's going on
where they live but they're not the only
ones with seedlings people like Walter
can connect with their local business
other nonprofit organizations and groups
to help the community
so seedlings really empowers communities
and allows them to leverage data to
identify and in dress address their real
needs to cultivate relationships and to
build knowledge by taking a local
collaborative and open approach and we
think this is really exciting but we
also know that from our research that
getting people to come together to work
towards the common good is really
challenging so Steve links addresses
this in three different ways first we
facilitate trust data is open and
available so Walter can make sure that
projects are worthwhile and he can also
assess the credibility of organizers by
looking at user profiles which lists
achievements as well as peer feedback
next we motivate socially so we pull
Walter into seed links using his
existing relationships and then we help
him create new ones so that we can
continue to motivate him intrinsically
and finally we encourage users to learn
and share so Walter learns by getting
involved in projects and then he passes
on this knowledge to the rest of his
community through the Commons so see
links gives neighbors like Walter the
agency to take action and to strengthen
their communities but imagine what could
happen if local communities across the
nation could pull their resources and
knowledge for the greater good and what
if we could continue that open
connecting and sharing on an even
greater scale well then we could change
the world so let's get started in our
own backyards thank you
I love the sentiment of what you're
doing I'm really curious in my own life
as to why the things like the on the
local cafe which so many people use
around me don't have things like this up
inside it and equally there's a single
code club running in the UK where a
similar kind of thing is gathering is
facilitating people to teach code in
schools so I'm split between whether you
need a normal type of unprecendented or
whether the fact that it doesn't seem to
happen in my local cafes in the street
is there's a real problem as to maybe
I'm just split between these two points
of view and yeah so I and yeah it's
interesting I mean I'm the same I think
I love the idea of trying to get people
to join in and solve local problems and
improve the environment around where
they live I'm sort of curious which bit
of the the actors lots of things I'm
just wondering which you see is the most
important bit is it the drawing
attention to opportunities in the
neighborhood that someone can volunteer
to help out with or is it all the kind
of incentivizing and reward systems that
in a way sort of socially pays back at
the volunteer I guess I don't say it's
kind of hard to tell in the sense that
we really see them as coming both of
those things working together um yeah
cuz the first what was the first part of
what you said this more
showing all the different things in the
neighborhood that if someone has the
time and the will they they might not be
aware of and this draws their attention
to it so that could be one step but then
you go much further and provide
incentives feedback and I'm wondering
well I guess is your view of humans that
we sort of need to be paid even if it's
not in money but in sort of rewards in
order to help our own neighborhoods I
guess we were thinking of it as more
feedback so less kind of like oh we're
rewarding you for this and more oh we're
providing a space for you to share with
each other and so like that would
naturally hopefully reward people but it
we're think of it less as like oh we're
rewarding you and more as you know if
people really are communicating and
giving each other feedback and having
time to reflect then that can kind of
happen within this process so just uh
are we going yeah um it's a quick
comment I mean I find that really
intestine so we live in a society where
increasingly everybody wants everything
to be free and yet we're not very giving
and it's interesting you need this type
of catalyst in order to balance the
equation so you can actually give as
well as take for free that's a it's
really interesting the one question I do
have is how if I have a project that has
a need would I you didn't talk much
about how you talk about the big the
volunteers side view of it get it
quickly summarize if I was the one who
need sure it's a project right so you're
saying if you create a project how does
that happen right so if you know how to
do the project then you can just go
ahead and set it up and try to leverage
people around you to join in on that
project and they can do everything from
sharing a link to raise awareness they
can sign up to bring supplies or they
can actually attend whatever this
project is but if you don't know how to
actually make the project happen and you
don't know what the stuffs are or what
is actually needed then that's where we
would pull in data from other projects
that are happening anywhere else and it
can be like well if you're trying to
plant a garden cycle in Seattle this is
how they did it would you like to try
these things and it kind of pushes you
along in the right
all right thank you thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
