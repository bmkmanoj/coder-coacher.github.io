distinguished engineer Larry heck of
microsoft research and general manager
at Bing experiences Mike calcaneal and
they're going to tell us all about the
research is going into Cortana the new
personal assistant for windows phone 8.1
Larry Mike thanks for being here oh
thanks this is going to be fun and I
don't want to get off on the wrong foot
but there's already some other popular
popular personal assistant phones out
there there's a month at sorry I think
people have heard of the less chatty
sibling google now what makes this is
whatever is going to be wondering what
makes Cortana different better than her
counterparts yeah well I'll take that I
think you know the the first thing that
we you know set out to do was really you
know we we didn't overly focus on you
know products that were already in the
market I think Google now Siri they're
actually excellent products they're
useful right our goal was really to you
know build something useful ourselves
right it's like you know I don't think
we set out with a with a goal and
building Cortana to you know knock off
Syria now cough google now our goal was
really to make the phone better right so
I think there's you know in so far that
they do interesting things I think
there's some natural overlap in terms of
like you know what we think an assistant
should do i do think we made some
different choices in terms of you know
what we envisioned assistant to be right
what we where we wanted the assistant to
go and some of the you know kind of
design choices we made or around how how
we actually realized around the phone
the biggest difference i would say it's
like if you look at the you know kind of
space together is that we've really
modeled Cortana after the interaction
model that we developed with Cortana
really is that of a it's a real
assistant right we uses a North Star you
know the metaphor of having a real
assistant right a competent personal
professional assistant that you could
use and count on to get through your day
right and so things like the notebook
right things like you know what the
assistant can do right away for you
right the the ability to of the
assistant to confirm with you right you
know where she should start where she
should stop what you should know right
we really think that
you know that's a it's a design choice
that we made early on that will you know
not only I think doesn't differentiate
what we what we have in the market now
but I think it'll also cause the
assistant to kind of like take its own
course right as we as we develop it over
time absolutely and obviously we saw
some of court on display this morning
during the opening keynote and it's
fascinating to see where it's going and
what all of this is doing let's talk
about the research that's gone into
realizing the Cortana advantages as
we're calling it uh Larry what can you
tell us about the speech recognition
research that Cortana utilizes yeah so
the speech recognition research that's
been done here and at other places has
been evolving gradually over time twenty
years of investment at microsoft
microsoft research on speech recognition
and a lot of the advances in speech
recognition has been due to data and and
figuring out how to get data fed back
into into the systems and this is all
based on teaching the computer how to
recognize speech by giving examples so
called machine learning so that's been a
big foundation for many years and speech
recognition it's it's that kind of
technology is also being now used in
other components that you need to pull
off something like like Cortana that
speech recognition is only one of those
pieces you know as you recognize speech
you have to then understand what the
person is talking about and so for that
natural language understanding is
another component it sits on top of the
speech recognizer then you have to
figure out what you want to do with it
whether if the person is asking you for
directions Cortana has to decide okay
well you know this is relevant
information about directions I want to
give that you know show a map for
example and that's taken care of in the
dialogue manager component and then
there may be some speech output back to
the user to to say okay these are the
directions to the you know closest
starbucks to you so there's a texas
speed synthesis as well so this all
these different technologies that said
with speech recognition that are
required to pull off something like
Cortana and you need to have investments
in research and all of those for many
years to come
pull that off until how you know for
folks watch how is this speech
recognition different from the powers
and other personal assistants are using
well I think a lot of like I say a lot
of advancement speech recognition is
depending on the data and how much data
you have that's fed back into the system
and the quality of data that you have
fed back and you know the amount of data
that we're getting right now we're
pulling back particularly from being
searched voice search is tremendous and
you know we're extending speech
recognition capabilities also into skype
and the Skype translator for speeches
speech translation so that there's you
know speech recognition that occurs when
the person is talking and let's say
English and then translation and then
synthesis into let's say German well all
of that data on the translator sigh on
the voice search side and Cortana side
and all the other speech applications
feeds back into a single recognizer that
we use across the board across for the
whole company so I think one of the
things that's an advantage for us is
that we have so many different you know
scenarios and products are out there
that that feedback into this speech
recognition technology yeah I know a lot
of the folks joining us online today
probably have either only heard of
Cortana or only seen a snippet and
seeing and hearing is believing so let's
say we jump into a little demo yeah sure
be happy to don't have a lot of time to
show up the full features I thought for
a second I might be able to show off any
all right so this is just my normal
windows phone 8.1 right it's a Lumia
icon I can get to Cortana one or two
ways I can come in through what we call
a live tile or I can actually just hit
the search button here as you can see
here I'm kind of greeted by Cortana the
spinning circle is kind of her
personality and persona mm-hmm and then
peeking up through the bottom here this
is the information that the Cortana has
for me it's information that based on
her knowledge of me she's prepared for
me in advance so for instance you see on
the screen you know it's only you know
three o'clock 330 but you know Cortana
thinking like well this is probably you
know around the time where you know Mike
might be wanting to go home right
so uh Larry's laughing because he knows
I never go out already that if it early
hasn't yeah that's right um but yeah so
you know actually it has my current
location it has a suggested traffic
route and he'll tell me it'll take if I
leave right now 26 minutes in order to
get home and then if I scroll up you can
see other things that she's gotten for
me one thing that I do is I you know
here's some you know suggested places
around here that I might want to go
after work maybe instead of going home
some stocks I'm looking at some news i'm
a fan of the San Francisco Giants
actually use Cortana the track Cortana
and this notion of the notebook I you
know we find that right here it's like I
can actually if I want to tell Cortana
something about hey I'm not interested
in San Francisco Giants anymore or if
I'm interested in another team or
another thing I can actually go into the
interest look over the information that
she actually has on me right and make
some adjustments so you can see here
she's tracking some you know flights
that I'm gonna be on soon right there's
some you know stocks and I'm interested
in she knows I'm interested in eating
and drinking and the best nearby right
so that's kind of like the Cortana and
the notebook and how she keeps track of
my interests and of course he can also
speak to her yeah you know one of the
three here yeah sure i think you know
just in general the way we attached the
kind of like they're the way we attack
the kind of a speech fart is that you
know the primary thing that we really
wanted to enable Cortana to do like a
real assistant is to help you get
through your day you know so putting
things on your calendar knowing where
you have to be reminding you to do
things so I can actually use Cortana to
set you know a person time or place
based reminders right so going through
the same entry point I can say remind me
to call my mom when I get home so here
you can see that yes got it so katana
actually knows where I live right she
knows that my home is this particular
you know kind of like what we call it
geofence right that reminder will
trigger when I actually pull into my
driveway or I get a nice little kinder
on my phone says call my mom Wow we've
also built Cortana on top of Bing so i
can answer just you know questions that
you would expect of a search engine
alright so
what's the weather this weekend in Paris
on Saturday in Paris there will be
cloudy skies with a high of 80 and on
Sunday there will be mostly sunny skies
with a high of 72 so what I like about
that particular example is like you know
rather than just getting you know 10
blue links are getting even yeah right
now five day forecast you actually knew
that I was asking for you know the
weather this weekend it she gave me that
exactly there's a lot of meteorologists
who are not happy about that yeah let's
try it just started sweating yeah and
then back to what we're doing
differently i'll just show one more
thing it's like you know one thing that
we really wanted to do with Cortana and
it sounds like kind of fun and games but
we actually think there's a serious
reason behind it is we really did think
it was important to imbue ER with a very
engaging and specific personality right
so one of the things you can actually do
with Cortana's you can ask her anything
right and we're continuously kind of
like evolving her personality and
updating this stuff right so that we we
feel like it serves two purposes one is
it helps connect the user to you know
kind of their assistant and helps them
build a relationship around trust and
it's also just entertaining and fun well
the fact of the matter is this Cortana
is a real person right she's not a real
person and most people don't think she's
a real per night right i think but
there's a real voice behind it there is
a real voice behind it so let me just
all demo in and then we'll talk about
the voice yeah right so do you sleep I
never sleep sleep is for ambulatory
carbon based games so re honest answer
yeah we get we get answers like that so
the voice that we actually have is so
that audio actually comes from the cloud
right it's part of our service that
powers Cortana and the the voice actress
that we asked to record that is actually
the same actress that records the
character Cortana in halo which is
generally yeah so I'm lucky enough to
live in the Seattle area where Jen lives
and I've worked with her before so any
day now maybe a year from now and
Cortana is in everybody's pocket is
gonna be the greatest thing to say hey I
know her she's a local jump yeah sorry
she's a local guys this is great stuff
thank you so much for popping by and
showing us what you're up to this is
very exciting earth you appreciate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
