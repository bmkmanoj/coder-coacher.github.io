you
gentlemen please welcome Catherine
McKinley
good morning thank you I hope you all
had a great time at the Museum last
night and if you didn't like it you can
complain to me because I wanted to try
something new other than the boat we can
go back to the boat next year so I'm
really thrilled to have you all here I
think this is one of the very special
venues where people from all walks of
computer science actually get together
instead of in our more domain-specific
conferences so it's one of my favorite
events and so I was really happy to be
asked to help organize it this year and
I hope I gave you content that helped
you broaden your perspectives so today
I'm introducing Keith Hampton who's an
associate professor in the Department of
Communication School of Communication
and Information at Rutgers University
unlike most of you who have a PhD in
computer science he has a PhD in
sociology from the University of Toronto
he's interested in the social
consequences of Technology so how the
internet the cell phone are affecting
you and your relationships and he uses
empirical approaches and those have
included ethnographies of urban
neighborhoods and public spaces and
large-scale national surveys please join
me in welcoming Keith thank you
today I want to talk about this I want
to talk about this healthy-looking
fellow and what he's doing on the other
side of this fence we have our
perception with new technologies that
somehow in the past we often had more
leisure time we worked less that we had
closer relationships maybe more
interaction less than track less
isolation perhaps better community and
even better morality than we did before
the introduction of these technologies
well I suspect it you know this may not
be shared by everyone in this room this
is often the image that we get from the
popular press to me studying social
change is like studying grass
particularly when you're talking about
social change and new technology use the
problem is sociology and new
technologies are very different types of
grass right so this is new technologies
new technologies are exciting they are
psychedelic they are you know
occasionally responsible for you doing
things you might regret and I hear you
can now find a lot of this here in
Washington State on the other hand this
is grass when we think about sociology
sociology is really the study of the
ubiquitous it's the study of the mundane
and this is where we get into a little
bit of trouble when we're trying to
think about how new technologies are
influencing society new technology is
about supplanting them adain through
innovation whereas sociology is about
piercing the mundane to reveal the
splendor of the obvious right my job is
essentially to reveal the obvious as a
result of the ubiquity of new
technologies the problem is that thanks
to people like you new technologies are
constantly changing but we can only
understand how those technologies are
influencing society once they've become
mundane predictions about how new
technology will influence society are
often mixed with nostalgia because we
don't wait to the point where they are
maintained we can study them because we
want to know how these new and exciting
features are
acting our lives as a result we end up
with how can I put it fertilizer right
we end up with a lot of misunderstanding
that fortunately encourages new growth
so we can think back to other new
technological changes this is a quote
from a newspaper article in 1888 that
appeared in New York Times excessive use
of electricity is a corrupting the
morals of the young this from an article
in 1899 the chicago daily women a
refinement and exquisite moral training
addicted to the use of the wheel
detrimental to the advancement of
morality nay even as stability and then
there are questions that are more open
for more recent times where we wonder
about how new social media are affecting
our relationships we expect more from
technology less one another and seem
increasingly drawn to technologies to
provide the illusion of companionship
without the demands of relationships
this from an op that by sherry turkle in
the New York Times just a couple years
ago I want to talk about two questions
about how we think about new
technologies and its implications for
society I can't find a better way of
phrasing them then the way Stephen
Colbert did in his interview with sherry
turkle he said even if i only get
information from you and little sips
doesn't that up to add up to a big gulp
aren't eventually knowing more about you
and if i'm constantly online and you're
online and we're seeing what each other
are doing and we're communicating in
that way how does that alienate each
other I'm going to argue that new
communication technology particularly
social media are responsible for two
fundamental changes in the structure of
our communities and these changes are
only starting to be revealed as the
vault of the recent ubiquity of these
technologies so are we more aware are we
less isolated I'm suggesting that the
first trend that we can start to see now
is persistent social contact social
relationships are probably less
transitory today than they are at any
time in recent history in the recent
past social ties were lost during key
life course events and fewer social ties
are now lost over the life course so
what I mean by this or some classic
examples it used to be then we
when I grew up went off to college we
would leave our neighborhood and often
we leave those neighborhood social ties
behind we leave our high school friends
behind do you remember those days and we
didn't have contact with our high school
friends anymore now they're back right
it's harder to lose those foci of
activity that we used to naturally lose
in the past it used to be the same about
changing occupations we would leave a
workplace behind maybe maintain a couple
social ties but that's really not the
case anymore organically connected
social ties which are these ties of
kinship locality and occupation they
persist and they are applying social
pressure over the life course in ways
that they haven't in a very long time
social size are also increasingly
pervasive we're aware of the activities
interest resources and in particular the
life course transitions of social ties
as their broadcast through these new
technologies there's a higher
surveillance of social ties than they're
worth in the past social ties are
increasingly specialized we have an
increased awareness of the diversity in
our social networks whether or not that
diversity is actually increased as I
known but we're certainly more aware of
diversity and there's a higher rate
abridging communication within those
social networks something that has been
well articulated by Microsoft
researchers like Danah Boyd and people
like Alice marwick which I think you're
here today as contacts collapse these
trans contrast was really what is the
contemporary view of how technological
change has affected relationships over
time the traditional view of sociology
and community over time is an image of
how mobility has increased the the the
the looseness of our bonds how social
ties have increasingly become less
enduring how they are more disposable
over time and we have less of these kind
of enduring true relationships that are
persistent and tied to place and tied to
specific foci of activity I'm arguing
that this is really a verification point
this is a transitional stage in the
nature of community so before we can
talk about how the structure of
community is changing as a result of
these technologies we do need to know a
little bit of what they look like in the
past so before we had computer networks
we have social networks and when I
talking about social networks here i'm
not talking about facebook i'm talking
about those networks
connections that we all have to people
around us over our life course this is
what community looked like in kind of a
pre-industrial time we had relatively
few social ties those social ties were
relatively dense lean it we had very few
foci of activity often things like home
and work were combined into one social
setting we had a high level of
structural equivalence with meant that
when we lost the social tie in the
setting they were often replaced by
someone who was connected to those
around us in similar ways we had
relatively low diversity generalized
reciprocity high levels of surveillance
and there was also a collective
Authority and very repressive sanctions
this is very different than what
community tends to look like in our kind
of modern pre-industrial urbanized
setting today urban industrial community
or at least up until today consisted of
you know multiple foci of activity we
had voluntary associations we had work
separated from home we had kinship
separated from neighborhood these are
lower density there are fewer bridges
between these foci of activity while
they were present they were relatively
rare there's relatively low level of
surveillance and a higher level of
diversity foci appear and they disappear
over the life course we have different
social settings that we kind of match us
at different stages in our life course
and then the relationships in those
sides for the most part they disappear
and there's a low level of structural
equivalence when we lose a social tie in
some of these settings they're replaced
but they're generally not replaced by
someone who is connected in similar ways
to those around us persistent and
pervasive community combines the
conditions of pre and post industrial
community in a new way foci are more
stable over the life course we no longer
lose those social settings that we would
transition through in the life course
there's more bridging between these foci
of activity density is higher as a
result surveillance is higher and the
perception of diversity around us is
also higher whether or not that
diversity has increased as relatively
unknown we may also have things like
higher levels of generalized reciprocity
and
even a revival of kind of repressive
sanctions so how do we start to
understand how the implications of this
shift are affecting everyday
relationships well I would argue that we
need to be doing less of this which is
where we study very specific foci of
activity say relationships on Facebook
and Facebook only relationships within
an organization and an organization only
and ignoring all the other folk I have
activity that exist around us and how
they overlap and the connections between
them I would argue that only by studying
our social networks in our communities
as a whole and the interconnections
amongst them can we begin to understand
the consequences of persistent and
pervasive contact now indeed the very
notion that we somehow were able to look
at just one foci of activity and
generalize to that about our community
at large was always a bit of a false
dichotomy we've always known the
relationships that start in person often
move online and those relationships that
start online often move to other foci of
activity and by ignoring those
connections I feel like we miss a large
portion of our social connectivity and a
large part of the story about how
persistent pervasive contact is
affecting our relationships so what is
community like when social ties become
persistent and pervasive your social
ties are less transient it's harder to
leave your relationships behind foci
persist online and the density of
relationships creates this perpetual
awareness if not direct awareness
through 1st 2nd and 3 degrees of
separation here are more aware the
attributes of your family your friends
and your acquaintances while the overall
diversity of our networks is likely not
increasing we're actually much more
aware the things that are happening
around us inside our social networks and
you assume all the benefits of awareness
awareness is important as a
pre-conditioner to things like empathy
and Trust and you're also more aware the
resources they're embedded in your
social network something that we often
call social capital you'll also
experience all the costs of awareness
your ties are aware of your resources
too and they're happy to take them from
you their awareness is experienced by
you as social pressures and there's a
cost of caring associated with you're
aware
earnest other things that are happening
the lives of those around you so first I
want to talk about some of the benefits
of awareness these benefits are from a
series of studies that I did with the
pew internet and american life project
data that we collected first in 2009 and
then we went back and recollected in
2011 these are from large national
random samples of american adults each
samples over 2,000 people which gives us
more than enough statistical power to
generalize to the american population of
adults at whole i'm going to talk about
the benefits of awareness in terms of
social capital social capital is the sum
of those resources that are embedded in
your social structure we can divide
social capital into a kind of two
subsets one is bonding social capital
which is the resources that you get from
kind of your closest social
relationships this includes things like
warm hugs and companionship but it also
includes a lot of nurturing and other
types of things like that it's really
your intimate relationships its
associated with things like network
closure it's associated with trust and
its associated with things like shared
norms and then there's bridging social
capital bridging social capital is the
resources that are embedded any more
heterogeneous social ties it really is
your less intimate or weak social ties
it's associated with things like the
diversity of your network and your
ability to bridge to new types of social
resources so we know from these studies
that there is a relationship between the
use of these new technologies and your
bonding social capital so we did a study
of core networks which is really those
people who are closest to you we ask
people to name those who are closest to
them and then we looked at variation in
their use of different types of
technologies we found that for example
people who are using the internet
compared to those who are not just a
simple dichotomy have on average about
fourteen percent more close
relationships and then those people who
are using social media in this case
particularly facebook also tend to have
more close relationships this isn't just
close relationships online this is more
close relationships in everyday life we
also looked at the bridging pneus of
people's social ties we decided the
diversity of their network in terms of
the different types of social positions
could they could access so are you able
to access a judge and a professor as
well as say someone
who works is in a secretarial position
or middle management just how diverse is
the range of your social ties again we
found the Internet users on average tend
to have more diverse social networks and
that those people using social media
particularly Facebook again also tend to
have even more diverse social networks
on top of that however the important
part that that we sometimes miss when
we're discussing this is that most
bridging social capital doesn't come
from online interactions that comes from
our participation and very traditional
social settings that we've long known
our tribute to the diversity of our
network really network diversity comes
from participating in diverse social
milieus so people who participate in
voluntary groups religious institutions
neighborhoods public spaces even semi
public spaces the more different social
settings of those sort that you
participating in the more likely your
network has become diverse if we look at
the role the social media plays in the
use of these traditional social settings
we found that about half of the bridging
social capital but half of the diversity
of people's networks actually comes
through both the use of technology and
the use of technology in relationship to
these existing social spaces so for
example internet use is associated with
more frequent visits to semi public
spaces this is places like cafes and
restaurants bloggers attend church more
often they volunteer more organizations
and are more frequent visitors to public
spaces people who share digital photos
online they volunteer even more and
visit public spaces even more often as
one example of this if we look at it
most kind of the most extreme example of
a social media user someone who belongs
to multiple platforms it uses them
fairly regularly that intensive social
media user has a network that is about
forty six percent more diverse than
someone who doesn't use those
technologies and about half of that or
twenty one percent of that forty-six
percent is attributed to greater use of
these established social settings that
have long been associated with more
diverse social contacts so to move on to
something different here so the
technology that provides the persistent
interface of contact is for the most
part I think a social good but it's
really not about the technology itself
it
about the underlying social structure
that is afforded by this technology so
these network structures may also have
less desirable consequences and in some
ways I feel like I have to apologize to
my host here for a second because my
invitation to come here was prefaced
with a very nice sentence that says we
noticed that you've recently discovered
all these really nice positive
relationships between new technology and
society and relationships we think that
that's exactly the type of thing that
you're that our audience here is going
to want to hear and I knew instantly
when i read that that i had just
collected some data that suggests that
there may be some social outcomes
they're not as positive and i would have
to talk about them these are findings
that we haven't published yet they will
be published later the summer as part of
two reports with pew internet everyday
life so with appropriate theming i feel
like they should have darkened the
lights too but the threat okay
the costs of awareness I want to give
two examples of how the awareness
afforded by persistent pervasive contact
can be problematic where it's
potentially problematic the first one
delete deals with participation a
deliberative democracy as something that
in communication we talk about is the
spiral of silence and the second is
social stress and specifically the costs
associated with caring so first let's
get a little bit of terminology out of
the way what do I mean by deliberative
democracy well the little deliberative
democracy is the idea that somehow the
legitimacy of our democratic process
here in America and elsewhere is about
more than just voting it's about a
process whereby citizens go out and they
voluntarily discuss important political
issues with other citizens as well as
our elected officials and so on and this
ability to have political conversations
is important things like tolerance
political knowledge and political
participation that is the more we
deliberate the more informed we are the
more we understand opposite points of
view and the better we are to have a
common discussion about these issues
there's some debate in communication and
elsewhere about just how deliberative
these conversations have to be some
people think it has to be a forum like
this where we take turns up here talking
to each other and it's very formalistic
and that's true deliberation others and
this is where I kind of favor this
argument is that political conversation
can be much more everyday it can be
things that take place in our home it
can be to have conversations we have
over breakfast and in the hallway that
these conversations about education and
about politics are just as informative
to us in shaping our opinions however
this process fundamentally depends on
people's willingness and their exposure
to information on public issues and
their willingness to discuss these
issues with those around them there is
some existing evidence out there the new
technologies in particular social media
use are associated with higher levels of
political participation participation is
somewhat different than deliberation so
again from some of the research I've
done with the Pew Internet and everyday
life project during the national
elections in
11 we went out and surveyed people over
the election period and we found that
those people who are using Facebook a
couple of times per week compared to
those sorry someone to uses Facebook a
couple of times per week compared to
someone who uses the platform multiple
times a day the more frequently these
for facebook the more politically active
they were they were more than twice as
likely to have attended a political
rally or a meeting there are 50 cent
more likely to try to have convinced
someone else to vote for particular
candidate and there are about forty
percent more likely to instead they
voted or intended to vote there's also
evidence from other studies to suggest
that social media has aided in things
like collective action in the Middle
East and elsewhere again Democratic
participation does not equal
deliberation in fact there's some
evidence out there to suggest that the
more cross-cutting deliberation we have
particularly most are close to social
ties the less likely we are to
participate that is the less likely we
are to do things like vote so there is
somewhat of a tension between the
liberation and participation but more
than that there's very little empirical
evidence out there that for most people
social media have increased exposure to
information on political issues opened
up new opportunities for everyday
political conversations or reduced
barriers to sharing opinions with those
around us so that's why we set out to
study political conversations so from
August September of last year we did a
random digit dial survey of american
adults again we did a sample of people
on their traditional phone lines we use
their mobile phone lines we did the
survey in English we did it in Spanish
about 1800 adults and it was collected
by the pew internet and american life
project we wanted to know where people
got news about important public issues
we wanted to know how willing people are
to discuss politicals and political
issues in different social settings we
wanted to know how likely they were to
discuss politics at home how likely they
were discuss it with friends at a
restaurant in public meetings and in the
workplace as well as how likely the word
to discuss political issues through
social media on Facebook and Twitter are
too kind of most ubiquitous social
medias we wanted to know how social
media use is related to information
exposure and people's willingness to
join conversations in these different
social settings in doing so
be focused on one very specific
political issue that political issue is
the recent revelations and last summer
of Edward Snowden and the US
government's use of surveillance to
monitor people's telephone calls email
and other online communications now we
could have chosen any popular political
issue to be able to use to to follow on
the survey to be able to see how people
were willing to discuss you know such an
important topic but this one it was new
it was hot it had just happened at the
time Edward Snowden said you know the US
government has been collecting metadata
and it was limited to metadata last
summer and you know that type of
collection which you know we all learned
something about what we think metadata
is and things have changed since then I
mean we now know that the information
that the US government was collecting is
probably much more extensive than
metadata and I'm not sure we would have
picked the same topic to follow if we
had done the survey this summer as
opposed to last summer because I think
you could argue now that there may even
be a kind of repression in democratic
deliberation online around this issue
just out of fear of being monitored we
don't have any evidence that's true but
it certainly was not true last summer
when we did this survey so we focused on
Edward Snowden's revelations okay and at
the risk of giving you a little bit too
much information here this report will
be released probably later this month
with Lee Rainie and my graduate students
wheesh Lou and in young-shin the
dependent variable here that we're most
interested is is people's willingness to
join a conversation about these issues
in different social settings we looked
at a range of different independent
variables as controls we looked at your
kind of standard demographic control
variables like age and education but we
also looked at different types of social
media use and different types of
traditional media use so we looked at
where people were getting their news
weather through TV whether it was
through radio newspapers online sources
we looked at variation in their use of a
wide range of social media and we also
looked at variation in how they use
those social media so how often they
sent personal messages through Facebook
versus how often they were commenting on
people's posts in in in the social media
stream
initial findings okay this is a bar
graph of people's willingness to voice
their opinion in different social
settings the first four bars are
in-person interactions so this is your
willingness to have a conversation over
a family dinner a restaurant with
friends in a community meeting and in a
workplace as you can see about
eighty-six percent of people were
willing to have an in-person
conversation with people around this
issue this last two bars are people's
willingness to have a conversation
around the same issue through two
different social media platforms people
were about half is willing or about half
as many people we're willing to have a
conversation online about this issue as
that we're likely to have it in person
that leaves if you if you do the math
here about fourteen percent of Americans
we're not willing to have a conversation
in person about this issue about an
important public issue we would like to
think that social media is providing an
opportunity for that fourteen percent to
engage in political discussion here's
what we found this needle in this Apple
that's the percentage of people who are
willing to have a conversation online
who weren't already willing to have a
conversation offline point three percent
of american adults who were otherwise
unwilling to have a conversation about
an important political issue in person
we're willing to do so online now this
was actually kind of surprising but i'm
not sure should have been because all of
our prior research suggests that new
technologies are not replacing social
interaction that they're supplementing
social interaction so maybe i shouldn't
have been overly surprised to find this
not providing new opportunities
necessarily as well okay what did turn
out to be really important is awareness
awareness is the most important
difference between social media users
and others so here we have two graphs
about awareness of the opinions of
family and close friends non internet
users are the first bar as you can see
about eighteen percent of non
internet users express uncertainty about
the opinions of their friends and
families opinions on this issue internet
users who don't use social media a few
couple percent less expressed
uncertainty about the opinions of those
around them but what gets really
interesting here is when we look at
those people using different social
media Facebook users and Twitter users
are much more certain about the opinions
of those family and friends around them
than people who are not using social
media and non internet users in general
and I should say the difference here
between Facebook users and Twitter users
is a little bit it's not it's not being
presented ideally Twitter users there
are very few Twitter users who are not
Facebook users so really that final bar
is an additive bar it's people who are
using both Facebook and Twitter so
people who are using so Morris types of
social media are more likely to say
they're aware of the opinions of their
friends and family now awareness we tend
to think of as a fairly good thing that
turns out awareness is not always good
and there's a classic example from the
communication literature in the spiral
of silence those who feel that they hold
a minority opinion about a particular
issue will be more likely to self-censor
in a social setting out of fear of
social isolation or ostracism or some
sort of ridicule the tendency to
self-censor depends on both the
reference group the year around and the
forum for discussion so for example a
person might be willing to have a
conversation with family over dinner if
they suspect that their family members
agree with them on their opinion of this
particular political issue but that same
person might not be willing to have a
conversation at work about this issue if
they feel that their colleagues don't
support their opinion on the same issue
so just to make this clear your
awareness of the opinions that people in
your workplace influences your
willingness to speak out at work about
this public issue the same issue your
awareness of your family members
opinions about this issue influences
your your willingness to speak out say
over a family dinner about this issue
for the most part and for most people
awareness of your family's opinion
doesn't have much influence on your
willingness to speak out about that same
issue in the work
place and there are of course some
people who are willing to speak out
about an issue don't matter what the
social situation right they are people
who from the most part have really
strong opinions and we control for that
in this particular analysis okay so some
of our findings the old spiral of
silence continues to persist right so we
found the people at work we're about
three times more likely to say they join
a conversation around this political
issue if they felt that their co-workers
agreed with their opinion on this
political issue we're on the same thing
and family over dinner people are about
one and a half times more likely to be
willing to discuss the issue with their
with her sorry this is dinner with
friends other about one and a half times
more likely discuss this issue with
close friends if they felt that those
friends were in agreement and we found
the same thing on social media platforms
Facebook users were about twice as
likely to say they'd be willing to talk
about this on Facebook if they felt that
their Facebook friends were it agreement
with their opinion on this issue here's
where things get a little bit different
we find a new kind of spin on the spiral
of silence as you know social media it
makes it somewhat difficult to be able
to constrain your social ties into
different contexts sometimes workmates
see what friends are doing sometimes
friends see what family are doing and so
on and this kind of contest kolaks leads
to a kind of spillover effect in social
media use in the spiral of silence
someone who uses facebook a few times
per day to start off with is almost half
as likely to be willing to discuss this
topic at a public meeting so Facebook
users less willing to speak out in
person in public about this political
issue to top it off the spiral of
silence from social media affects
self-censorship across domains if a
Twitter user felt that their Twitter
followers did not agree with their
opinion that typical Twitter user is
about one-third as likely to join a
conversation at work if they felt that
their followers on Twitter zari with
them that encouraged them to speak out
at work those people who are at work and
felt that their twitter twitter
followers didn't agree with them were
less likely to speak out regardless of
how much agreement they felt in the
workplace about those set around that
same issue and it
same in other domains so a typical
Facebook user who does not feel that his
or her Facebook friends agree with their
position was half as likely to join a
conversation went out to dinner with
friends if they felt that their Facebook
friends agree with them regardless of
the opinions of their family of their
friends and family there were only a
point seven times less likely to speak
out so why does social media use reduce
people's willingness to join political
conversations well I suspect is probably
associated with increased awareness of
other people's opinions on political
issues as well as increased awareness of
the diversity of our social network
overall failing to find opinion
agreement with social media friends and
seeing diversity in our social network
at the whole results in a fear of
isolation and self-censorship online and
in other social settings to put that
another way we know that you know for
example the birds of a feather tend to
flock together and we see this as
somewhat an advantage when you can break
from that mold so when you break from
the flock diversity is often related to
opportunity however it's also true the
you know people who birds of a feather
flock together they also tend to flock
to the same places right it's no
coincidence that everybody in this room
for the most part has a PhD right we
tend to flock to similar places and when
you encounter differences where you
expect of similarity in place that can
lead to to uncertainty okay I want to
move on to the second potential negative
example and that is social stress so
again a little bit of a definitions here
social stress that's the stress that
comes from people's relationships
typically the result of stressful life
events that you experience in your own
life like having a child getting married
experiencing a divorce having someone in
your life die these are social stressors
in addition to social stress we also
have psychological stress psychological
stress is the state where an individual
lacks the ability or the resources to
adapt and cope with the demands of their
situations in addition to that we know
that there's something out there called
the high cost of caring that is the
psychological distress the results from
events that happen in the lives that
people around you knowing that people
are close to you who are going through
unfortunate things in their lives like
losing a job increases your
psychological distress okay a little bit
of a disclaimer here we'll call it a
trigger warning for the men in the
audience everything my wife told me is
true she wanted me to underline that but
I didn't men are insensitive jerks and
women do carry the weight of their world
of the shoulders and that is the primary
finding of this particular study and
this will be released in a second pew
report later the summer again with Lee
Rainie and my students when we study
social stress we asked participants if
they knew someone other than themselves
who had experienced any of a dozen major
life events over the past 12 months and
that the person was close to them or if
they were just an acquaintance that they
weren't too close with the 12 events we
used were taken from a kind of known
battery of major life events and here
are those events that included those
that almost everybody knew someone who
had experienced such as starting a new
job all the way down to those life
events that are fairly rare in other
people's lives such as them being a
victim of a robbery or a physical
assault or accused or arrested of a
crime relatively few people knew someone
who had gone through those vents and
they were more likely to know someone
who's a weak tie that had gone through
those events because we had many more
weak ties than someone who was close to
us the game of life is a full 3d action
game we sample from a universe of really
unfortunate events out there if we had
had more time and more surveys we
probably could have picked more than 12
events and there certainly is a larger
thing out there in terms of major life
events we focus on 12 who is most aware
of these major life course events around
them on average women are more aware
major events on the lives of people
around them is specifically close social
ties and then not just a little bit more
aware women are way more aware major
life events around them than men are
twenty percent more aware younger people
and those with more education are also
more aware why are these folks more
aware I have no idea right we can think
of many possible explanations you know
ignoring
you don't care earring I'm not listening
my wife thinks it's all of the above
okay social media amplifies awareness so
awareness of close ties these are
examples based on typical levels of
social media and other technology use a
woman who visits Pinterest about six
times per month is aware of almost
thirty percent more major life events
around her and her social network if she
shares about 8 photos a week another
fourteen percent additional awareness at
average number of Facebook friends which
in our survey was about 320 Facebook
friends they're aware of about thirteen
percent more major life events it's very
different from men different
technologies and different magnitude of
awareness the typical man who sends
about three text messages per day is
aware of about twelve percent more major
events they visit licks LinkedIn about
six times per months about six percent
more events using Pinterest believe it
or not the one consistent technology
we're only about three more three
percent more where awareness of events
to give you some idea of the difference
in magnitude of this of this effect a
woman who visits Pinterest about nine
times per month was aware but one
additional event from the 12 we studied
men had to visit more than daily before
they were aware of one additional event
in the major lives of the major event
and the lives of those people who are
close to them so information the little
bits does add up to a big gulp each drop
can have a big impact and different
technologies have different impacts for
men and for women awareness and
psychological stress so how does social
stress affect psychological stress well
we use a measure that's very common in
the literature to measure psychological
stress it's called KOA's perceived
social stress scale and we ask people
questions like in the last 30 days how
often do you found you couldn't cope
with all the things you had to do and we
created a scale out of this and we
looked at the relationship between both
technology use and awareness and
psychological stress well it started
with you know who has more stress well
men has significantly less stressed
women right those who have higher
education less stress those who are
married or living with a partner
significantly less stress and for women
but not for men those were a younger and
those who are employed and paid work
outside of the home experience less
stress what about the relationship
between stress and technology use
directly for men we found no
relationships whatsoever between their
use of any type of technology ranging
from email through Facebook and stress
there simply was no relationship that's
not what we found for women for women we
found that they have lower levels of
stress the more pictures they share it
online to their mobile phones the more
emails they sent and received and they
more frequently they used Twitter in
particular however the relationship
isn't exactly overwhelmingly substantive
so a woman who uses Twitter a typical
level of about half dozen times per
month sends her received 25 emails per
day shares a couple digital photos here
and there she scores about three percent
less and her psychological stress
overall only sending private messages
private you know almost like emails on
Facebook was associated with high levels
of stress or higher levels of stress for
women as an important point I want to
come back to in a second the cost of
caring awareness of unfortunate events
and only unfortunate events was
associated with higher levels of stress
other events such as awareness a
positive event had no effect on women
psychological stress or immense
psychological stress women were affected
by a larger range of an unfortunate
events than men were women in the cost
of caring the average woman who knew
someone who was close to them who had
experienced the death of a child partner
exposed they had about fourteen percent
higher psychological stress in their
everyday life and say aware that an
acquaintance was accused of a crime or
arrested they were about eleven percent
higher and psychological stress an
acquaintance experienced a demotion or
pay there's to higher levels of stress
and if they were aware that someone
close to them and hot been hospitalized
or experienced a serious accident injury
again slightly higher psychological
stress we get a very
picture when we look at the relationship
between awareness and stress and men
fewer overall stressors and actually
lower magnitude men and the cost of
caring someone close to them it had been
accused of arrest of a crime that about
fifteen percent higher stress on average
as that acquaintance to the experience
of demotion or a pay cut at work about
twelve percent higher and psychological
stress so given the relatively larger
number of events related to women's
stress and the higher level of awareness
the women have of major events in
people's lives the cost of caring as a
result of the awareness provided by
social media but also awareness in
general is really a cost especially felt
by women we did find a couple of
interesting anomalies the joys of
missing out when we controlled for
awareness that is we controlled for
exposure to these unfortunate events and
people in women's lives and men's lives
the relationship between higher stress
and private messaging on Facebook
disappeared so let's reveal something
about how women are using private
messaging on Facebook it's related
directly to how women are exposed
information about unfortunate events and
the lies around them when they see an
unfortunate event they turn to Facebook
and private messaging presumably to
provide something back recall them when
women were aware that someone close to
them had experienced a death of a child
spouse or partner their stress was about
fourteen percent higher on average well
women who are aware than an acquaintance
not a close relationship but an
acquaintance who is not close to them
had experienced the death of a child
partner or spouse they reported lower
levels of psychological stress so it
moved in the opposite direction women
who were aware of someone who was close
to them had experienced one of these
tragedies higher levels of stress women
who are aware of someone who wasn't
close to them experiencing the same type
of tragedy lower levels of stress and
it's not a small magnitude either it was
equivalent to roughly the reduction in
stress that you would get from being
married or having a spouse or partner I
want to stress that I don't think this
is something that we would call in
German schadenfreude is this is
the pleasure from other people's
misfortune rather this is probably
related to awareness that things could
be much worse amongst your closest
social relationships and they are and
seeing that other people are suffering
as a result of things that are not
affecting you actually reduces women's
stress okay summing up life under the
conditions a persistent and pervasive
relationships you are going to enjoy the
brace of family friends acquaintances
throughout the life course dermot ties
we never truly become dormant so you'll
have more clothes social ties for
companionship and support and a bonding
social capital more weak ties and better
awareness of diversity for jobs unique
information and so on what we call
bridging social capital but you're also
going to suffer the embrace of family
friends and acquaintances throughout the
life course there will be new
uncertainties as a result of newfound
diversity there will be an excrescence
of the cost of carrying especially for
women and there are long-term social
trends that are at this point relatively
unclear we don't know the under what
conditions in group versus crops group
social pressures will matter we don't
know if people who have higher levels of
empathy and trusts as a result of this
increased awareness and we don't know if
there will be returned of kind of more
negative outcomes such as collective
group control and repressive sanctions
as a result of the social structures
that are likely to result from this
shift in community how do we design for
a better tomorrow well we have to
remember it's really not about the
technology it's about the underlying
social Trek social structures that are
afforded by that technology the
structures of relationships under
persistent pers ace of contact provides
both opportunities and constraints
persistent and pervasive contact despite
what a lot of the kind of mass media
suggests is not about alienation and
disagreement sorry alienation and
disengagement is quite the opposite it's
about connectivity and increased levels
of awareness awareness and connectivity
are generally considered social goods
but they're not without their costs how
do we manage the costs I really wish I
knew right I mean we could spend some
time brainstorming about
the relationship between social
structure and technology use and we
could think about how some of those
networks of relationships might be
integrated into algorithms to reduce
some of the costs of caring maybe to
encourage higher levels of deliberation
but the problem with that is this again
we will not know if the grass is Benny
greener on the other side of the fence
for a relatively long period of time
because standard studying social change
requires a certain level of mundane
pneus and that's going to take a while
in addition to that things that I have
suggested are as kind of normative
positives I'm normative negatives
negatives like the cost of caring at a
loss a democratic deliberation may not
be as negative as I've led you to
believe should we maximize for
deliberation well fundamentally the
cross-cutting exposure that brings the
benefits of Tolerance understanding and
knowledge of different points of view
may be a better social good if
deliberation is lower as a result of
higher awareness of diversity that may
be the more important social good then
encouraging deliberation by itself
there's also some evidence to suggest
that areas where we have higher levels
of cross-cutting deliberation we have
lower levels of political participation
do we want to design for deliberation or
do we want to design for engagement
should we be reducing the cost of caring
social media does not directly increase
the cost of caring it's about awareness
right the technology affords higher
levels of awareness but just so does
going to a lot of parties right these
are all affordances for awareness if we
want to redistribute the cost of
awareness same or two men than women do
we know that men are equipped to deal
with that types of stress will they
actually see that information or will
they ignore it it's also not clear that
all types of stress are bad it may be
the women are using using social media
as a tool to help deal with the cost of
caring and that will be removing is
social good by trying to build an
affordance to reduce that cost so with
that I'm going to end with an idea that
we can build a better hybrid together
that somehow bringing new technologies
and the study of sociology together will
help us build both better technologies
and build a better understanding of how
these technologies are affecting
community in the long term thank you
very much we have time for questions so
we have people with microphones so raise
your hand there
hi that was great I have a question I
actually have two questions ones
relatively dark but did you did you take
into account avatar aang as a part of
the disc Reese discourse as it relates
to politics for instance I'm not alone
in my peer group but my facebook version
of me is way cooler than I am and I
spend a lot of time managing my persona
as it relates to the community that I
engage with on Facebook so did you take
that into account and how that might be
impacting people's decisions about
engaging in these conversations in these
relatively mainstream social medias the
second question I have is Facebook and
Twitter are of course relatively
mainstream have you got any anecdotal
evidence through your research about how
the anonymity of certain social networks
snapchat whisper or injure / reddit are
having on traditional relationships
pair-bonded relationships fidelity and
the ease with which a number of people
will enter into those kinds of
conversations and entertain those and
and what the impact of that might be
right so the answer is the same for both
questions it's no and the reason for
that is fairly straightforward this
particular study is a large national
random survey right and there's only so
much information we can hope to collect
through that type of intervention if we
want to know more about how presentation
of self through social media was
influencing people's willingness to
discuss we would have to either do a
very focused survey on that or we'd have
to do more qualitative maybe even death
and graphic approaches and unfortunately
in this particular study those were not
things we could accomplish right
similarly when it comes to less
frequently used social media those
particular social media are used amongst
youth and this was also a study of
adults alright and we do that because
youth offical they they move through
technologies more rapidly than adults
too
adopt new technologies more quickly and
they also use less pervasive
technologies and really we can only
understand long-term trends about how
these technologies are used by studying
the mundane ones anytime that we try and
measure the use of kind of infrequent
technologies we just don't have the
statistical power in a survey like this
in the back number two Barbara gross
thanks Keith very much this was
fascinating and I will go read your
papers and recommend them to others I
had a comment and then a question and
the comment is that as you talked about
the cost of awareness I was reminded of
the cognitive psychology research that
shows forgetting is good for remembering
and I just wanted to pass that on to you
in case that analogy could prove useful
the question so first I guess the other
comment is it seems like you're talking
about correlations rather than cause and
effect and I just wanted to lay that out
the question is that in your studies not
the not the cost of carrying ones which
I have to say the results we're not
surprising and I want to talk with you
about that afterwards but on men and
women and how they're very different did
you control for occupation career stage
and other sorts of things that might
have been different among the two
populations right uh right those are
really really important things yes
absolutely this is cross-sectional data
fortunately for some of this up the time
orders a little bit more clear than it
usually is with cross-sectional data but
yes we are not talking causation we're
talking correlation in terms of
forgetting yeah it's kind of interesting
and we talked to a range of experts in
stress before designing the survey and
thinking about forgetting none of them
could ever remember anyone asking about
awareness of stressors and other
people's lives before we thought we were
doing something totally new and unique
and then lo and behold three weeks ago I
discover a paper that was written you
know 30 years ago that everybody had
forgotten about that had done the exact
same method all
gee and found exactly the same thing
before we had the internet the cost of
awareness was particularly felt by women
as regards to be able to measure
variation based on stage and
occupational path and even variation in
career I really wish we could do that
study it would be fantastic right I mean
I think we could imagine that there
would be all sorts of different findings
and for some reason over the last few
weeks I've noticed a real uptake in
discussions of stress and even social
stress on NPR and they've had a lot more
detailed studies about how things like
women and careers of affecting stress so
I think there's data out there
unfortunately it's not really about
technology you use and I don't have it
yeah bill so I have excuse me to two
quick questions one is um in your
comparing for example face-to-face over
dinner in the home versus online you
talk about communication but I think do
you differentiate to the question of
whether you're having exchanged versus
that levels of trust so I think that
what I would call and have called trust
ification is as important thing to
measure and affordances for trust
building on each Channel and not just
whether you're conversing and there's
and that would make normalizer balance
things yeah I think that's an excellent
point and that was that was one of the
reasons that we did the study the way
that we did it because we were really
interested in how willingness to speak
out about a political issue might vary
by both social setting anti strange for
example right so we knew that you know
family relationships and close friends
these are you know by very nature close
relationships we expected people would
feel more willing to speak out in these
social settings than they would say at
the workplace which tends to be you know
some close ties but more mixed in
general and a public meeting we imagined
is kind of you know the kind of weakest
opportunity for deliberation that we can
imagine in kind of a traditional setting
what surprised us I think was that the
same social forces persist
us all of those settings and we didn't
know where social media fell on that
continuum now do people consider
Facebook and Twitter to be different
types of social media types of
relationships maintained would you know
I think we we often think you know
Facebook is where close relationships
and Twitter's more weaker relationships
would we see that you know social
pressures are less likely to exist out
there and some social media like Twitter
and more likely to exist in some social
settings like Facebook what surprised
this again was it just didn't matter
that those social pressures persist
regardless of the setting and the social
pressure and tie strength but what
really surprised us I think was that the
social media pressures seem to exist in
physical social settings again you know
there's some issues here with
correlation and causation but I think it
is the least problematic to think about
how our inability to be able to you know
silo off social media into different
types of social relationships might lead
to social pressures that persist in
settings that didn't exist before so so
if you have these interactions the
question is it's the political
discussions own having any constructive
value is anybody learning or is it just
churning and chatter so for example
comes back to trust in the world's most
connected act with access to information
with to communications technologies how
to explain with all of that ability to
discuss that pic percent of the United
States still believe the said I was
saying had was responsible for 911 yeah
well I mean a tough question because it
brings up the very notions of whether or
not we think deliberation has value in a
democracy and how much that deliberation
matters the things like participation it
also brings up a flaw in the study which
is you know we really don't know how
informed these people were at the time
we interviewed them it could be the
deliberation was low because knowledge
was high and they no longer felt the
need to continue to deliberate because
they had already done so or been highly
informed the part of the story I didn't
tell was the part about exposure to news
about this issue through social media
and
other settings and what we found was
somewhat surprising and that people who
are using social media like Twitter for
example we found them to be much higher
consumers of news through traditional
social media people were using Twitter
we're far more likely to be gained news
about political issues through
television radio and newsprint which is
not the usual story right in addition to
that somewhat forgot what I was going to
say in addition to that in addition to
that it we found that that people
weren't actually gaining knowledge about
political issues through their use of
social media it could be you know this
is the kind of getting negative side of
the story is that we may only use social
media for keeping up with the
kardashians right it may turn out that
that actually doesn't provide a lot of
new news in relation to kind of port and
political issues and I think that would
be an unfortunate part of the story but
it may be true as well all right let's
take one more question for their high so
I wanted to make a difference in
political discourse between talking at
and talking to and what the gentleman
said about his cool persona on social
media means that as a person who is
talking to somebody he might be feel a
little shy but on the social media he
could be aggressive and he can be
talking at and a lot of political
discourse on the social media is talking
at rather than talking to right so I
mean it's interesting we don't know from
this particular study but we do know
that people are much less likely to feel
willing to talk out online than they are
in person so if as you suggest that
people feel like the technology is
somehow provides for less kind of true
deliberation and is more kind of one way
then that may provide you know some
explanation for why people have less
willingness to speak out in those
settings it may also be that there is
some kind of expert you know
experiential learning going on here and
that you know people see maybe as a
result of
increase repressive sanctions how you
know trying to speak out in a social
media setting has resulted in their
conversation being shut down through one
means or another and people being you
know punitive ly punished or embarrassed
or ostracized as a result of trying to
speak out about a political issue they
may learn something from that and then
turn be less willing to speak out in the
future let's thank our speaker one more
time thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
