you
start from the motivation of the work
and basically the question we try to
answer is how can we perform optimal
high-dimensional hypothesis testing and
so I will illustrate using the genetics
application especially testing for the
gene defect and with a genetic network
effect and against the sparse
alternative to answer three questions
the first is whether we can use the
verbal selection based the penalized
likelihood estimator for example a sew
and construct the sparse estimator and
use that to construct the test how would
that perform and second question is if
we construct some kind of higher
criticism test and whether the
performance will be the same for linear
regression also for binary regression
like logistic regression the third
question is if the genetic markers are
correlated in other words if the design
matrix are correlated and whether the we
can improve the higher criticism test
that by accounting for the correlation
among the markers now illustrate that
using a GPS data and also the discussion
so to start on the GOI study mainly
focus on the common variants which
genotype millions of common genetic
variants across the genome so whole
genome sequencing under so that sequence
is a whole genome and which consists
about three billion base pairs across
the genome and the challenge for that
whole genome sequencing study is ninety
percent of the genetic variance across
the genome are real virus so only very
small number of people having it and to
show the difference between these two
type of data that the LED panel is the
jiva study which you can see basically
that focus on the low size whereas the
burns are sufficiently common so we
called the minor do that in the if for
example if the probability of sorry if
the property they say the probability of
g is greater than five percent in the
population that is called common
variance
and so the difference between the chivas
study and the sequencing study a
sequencing study basically get
information every single base pairs and
so that also measure the rear valance so
the reverence is missed in the gos but
is captured by the whole genome
sequencing for example if you look at
this and then among the time people only
one person has this variance all the
rest don't have and so that makes
analysis much more challenging so the
data set have is we have a with genotype
of sequence tens of thousand subjects on
the soda major interest is we want to
study whether there is the effect of the
gene what genetic pathway what genetics
network and the soul which generally
consist a large number of genetic marker
like sleep markers and we want to see
whether there is association with the
disease outcome what is this phenotype
and the so the major challenge in this
setting yes that on the signals
generally are weak and sparse in
particular the problem we want to see
you suppose this is a chromosome and
within chromosome so there's one
reaching the chin and the general it is
this is the genotype across different
low side so want to see whether this
gene is associated with that obesity for
example what we want to see whether this
genetics network is associated with the
obesity this is a diva's phenotype so
but the problem is a modest Jeanette is
network would mount is Jean only a small
number of genetic markers and are likely
to be signal so and also the signal are
likely to be weak and so how can we
develop a test which contact for this
that the association between the gene
with genetics network with the phenotype
accounting was sparse and weak signal
and so basically we want to test a large
number perimeter against a sparse
alternative so to set this up suppose
the why is the phenotype what outcome we
have in subjects and then XR the
coverage like age gender and so on and
she indicate the genotype under of the
peace nip suppose if one gene has 1000
snip
and then p will be a thousand a genetic
network has like 100 gene eaching has
like 20 snip and then basically had
2,000 the p will be two thousand and the
certain design matrix for Chi basically
take values 0 1 2 so each column take
values 0 1 2 under fill the betas are
regression coefficients so the new is
the mean of the phenotype for example a
case-control studies conditional on the
genotype and the cover is so we set up
like generalized linear model so H will
be a link function and for linear
equations they should be undone TT link
and follow chesty regression they should
be the logit link and so we regress that
on the cover is and also on the genotype
and the sort of energy were you know ela
genetic network and so we want to see
whether there is association between the
gene understand order generic network
with the phenotype and so basically we
pass the betas which can be high
dimensional and but still finite that
can be hundreds or can be can be dozens
what can be thousands and then we want
to see whether the beta you go 2-0
against the beta naught equal to 0 so if
the beta the pd man ap is like 2000 you
can see that the very is a
high-dimensional test and if we think
about what are the challenges in this
kind of high-dimensional testing problem
and first in the sequencing studies that
these are matrix can be very sparse
under saw the Chi matrix and so
basically for each column and a lot of
lots of zeros only a very small number
one tooth and secondly under the snips
and can be correlated we causal linkage
disequilibrium basically statistician
called correlation and so basically a
sniper correlated and due to LD and also
the number of snips imaging will network
and maybe large and the commit disease
or thousands and the so also under the
alternative can take two situation
either a dense alternative was a sparse
alternative so what that mean yes under
the alternative whether there are lots
of
Peter not equal to 0 or small number
beta naught equal to zero and so if i
set this up and the soapy see what that
mean yes suppose the p is a number of
markers on the energy will network and
thus until k is the number of signal so
number P does not equal to 0 so we
assumed okay is a function of the P as a
power 1 minus alpha on the syllabus is
the null hypothesis if it has the P beta
equal to zero against this beta naught
equal to zero so the difference between
the tents and spars alternative is
basically lies in the artful so in
rville quit less than half it doesn't
mean fifty percent abated not equal to
zero it means the post p called 100 if
alpha is point 6 that means 16 beta
naught equal to zero the other 84th are
0 and for the sparse alternative that
basically assume Arthur greater than
half for the Spurs reaching if like our
fight a 2.4 then that means 7 beta dot
equal to 0 and the 94 beta equal to 0 so
ideally this Oracle test is the postcard
tell me among those 100 betas no 7 not
equal to 0 what I should do is a pick up
those seven through a with a net 94 that
would be most powerful test right but in
reality I don't know which seven out you
how to do I even don't know how many not
equal to 0 and so that makes the test
challenging and how can we how can we do
that so and even make sense worse and
there is no global optimal test it
doesn't exist the test optimality
depends a multiple things it depends on
the genotype matrix the design matrix
how sparse it is and also how much
correlation among markers the Audi
structure also it depends on the signal
sparsity signals and depends on the
spouse parts the signals are how strong
the signals are and whether the beta are
in the same direction or different
direction and the furthermore it turns
out it also depends on the distribution
of Y whether it is a continuous
distribution or binary distribution and
the soul so this clip in order to
construct the test and without knowing
which one are signals so supposedly we
start from the marginal statistics on
the service fee is a correlation between
the gene each genetic marker and the y
and then we assume the Z statistic after
standardized it it is normally
distributed so the question is if I have
within this genetics network I have its
results in the Z statistic so how can
optimally aggregate those 1000d
statistics to detect association between
the genetics network and the phenotype
and so here are a few popular approaches
we have been used the individual genetic
literature the first one is it is 9th
racial statistics I have 1000 Z
statistic I'm going to aggregate of them
and it's aggregate out as each is
squares and so this intuitive youth you
would think that this will hype have
high power if the signals is sparsity is
low and also the p value can be
calculated analytically and but it will
have low power if the sparsity is high
as if alternative is sparse and one
simple approach it to do the minimum
p-value approach with a maximum Z
statistic approach and the so
intuitively would think this has a high
power when the sparsity of the signal is
high and also were likely to have a
lower power if the sparsity of the
signal is low and also the p value
calculation is more difficult if the
markers the design matrix is correlated
and so because we cannot use order
statistic population anymore and so the
higher criticism is another approach and
that you a test for the spot against
these parts are turned him so the basic
idea is suppose I have a thousand mark I
have certain these statistics and what
I'm going to do is I'm going to throw
away those these statistics which are
small I'm going to
those these statistic which are large
basically try to keep the signals under
then so basically we can't how many
estimate the signals are its racial that
this statistic count how many
significant markers are under so this
you can see if the the markers are
independent this basically follow up a
normal distribution and the so if you
try showed using 1.96 this may not be
optimal and also here so basically if
the that the damage is a local here is
matrix that means have low correlations
that means the covariance of the design
matrix and will be independence was
sparse then the higher criticism test is
based in the literature like industry
download gene and the arista and care so
and so on basically you compare the
number of significant test- its
expectation / virus so you can see this
variance assume the test statistic are
independent and the so biscuit
graphically so you basically want to do
is try to find out what is optimal oh
sorry what you do here then you copy the
soup you try to find out which p that
makes them at the soup and so basically
that is that you find out that he under
the threshold of the Z statistic that
maximizes HC statistics it is not 1.96
and also what are the existing result
for linear regression for the existing
result and the cell if the signals are
tense then if the signal is too weak and
that note out has a perilous if the
signal is strong enough then this kind
of scat like some of these square Nance
racial statistic would be powerful if
the signal is you know sparse regime and
even signals too weak then all the tests
will be powerless if the signal is
strong enough then HC was the most
powerful so that means HC is can reach
the detection boundary if the signals is
sparse so here the assumptions are that
these images has to be weak correlation
and also the a is that
as the signal strength of the beta and
so we assume that the Alpha basically
measures the sparsity index so the
natural question to ask is there have
been quite a bit ly picture on variable
selections under for example like lasso
and so can we use the sparse estimator
based on variable selection to construct
the test statistics and how that will
perform compared to HC the higher
criticism past so in queue today if you
think we ran lasso and selected ten
marbles I can use those ten variable to
construct my test statistics and so here
basically is a setup yes suppose we have
a verbal selection procedure using the
penalized likelihood and so the panel he
is a concrete from penalty and is a la
so scared and mcp or belong to this
class then I'm going to construct the
several test statistic based on the beta
hat p no less likely for the estimator
either account hominid non 0 beta hat
estimated or use the quadratic function
of the survival 90 beta hat or use the
penalized likelihood ratio statistic so
the patient we ask is can the test based
on consistent verbal selection procedure
have the correct happen arrow like typo
error rate is point 05 second how small
the signal can this penalized likelihood
based approach detect and how that
compared to a detection boundary that is
optimal one unless specified by the
higher criticism turns out the result
quite interesting first if we use the
penalized likelihood based approach to
construct the variable selection
consistent variable selection as and
hopefully we cannot have our four level
test as and hopefully it will be 0 and
then also the if we use this verbal
selection based estimator to construct
the test and so it is it has read
optimal for that space reaching but is
sub-optimal for the dense regime so
basically the take-home message is for
linear regression with low coherent
matrix that means weak correlation among
the columns of the design matrix as long
as the signal is strong enough
I'm going to be able to take the
detected and so an actual question is
are these results to chew if I have case
control study the phenotype is binary
and the so intuitively you would think
that will still be true turns out the
results not that is not the case so for
example and so if i have the jiva study
i'm going to have a common barriers and
so the design matrix will be tense and
so if i have a sequencing study and i'm
going to have the rear variance and i'm
going to have very sparse these images
and the south to illustrate how sparse
the design matrix is so here is the
earlier candidate gene sequencing study
at sequence about 3,500 people three
candidate genes totally about 96 virus
it turns out nine he's fifty percent of
those 96 merits as synchronous so that
means if you look at it these images is
3000 x 100 matrix and the for each
column as there's only one once all the
rest are zeros and fifty percent of
those columns are like that on this so
the phenotype here is the binary
hypertension will not to show you the
how the genotype matrix look like and so
this is for 500 rose and the black
indicates the d rose and the break that
indicate one will choose so you can see
for this sequence that genotype matrix
and the fee each column you can see a
lot of lots of black dots so that means
they are all zeros very small number one
or two doz apply to us only this varies
a common virus all the rest are real
birds so that means the design matrix
very very sparse each column and a lot
of lots of dildos very small number of
ones and if we shuffle the columns the
design matrix will look like this in
like a block diagonal matrix on the top
and the bottom is the contamination
matrix and so what has a key result it
turns out the result for logistic
regression are quite different from the
results on linear equation for linear
regression the detection only depends on
how strong the signal star has nothing
to do with the design major
but for the final regression turns out
if that these are measures are to smarts
like the seal sequencing study and if
the design nation to sparks no matter
how strong the signal is we are not able
to detect it so therefore for the panel
regression instead of one point
detection boundary and so it has to
point detection boundary and so the
detection boundary will depends on not
only the sparse that signal sparsity and
signal strength also depends on how
sparse the design matrix is so if the
design matrix is not too sparse then the
binary regression result using the this
stat word regular likelihood ratio test
statistic where higher criticism will
parallel the linear regression okay and
so the other issue I need to worry about
in genetic study is when I work with the
chain on generators out in structure so
they are course that the genetics nips
are correlated so this is out the map so
you can see that basically the dark
indicates a correlation between two
markers so if it's very dark for example
this so this snip and this tip are
highly correlated so you can see if
basically if that there is quite a bit
correlation among the genetic markers
send up secondly when test for whether
there is association between a gene and
what genetic network with the phenotype
my pee is finite even the P is not small
but the P is finite and so I need to a
deal with the correlation because a
higher criticism assume that that the
test I independent to each other but in
genetic study they are not so how can we
deal with the correlation so one idea is
proposed by by peter hall and jasmine
gene using this innovated higher
criticism test so the idea is basically
we d correlate the test statistics so if
the correlation of the distant a stick
is sigma less d correlate exist using
the single value decomposition and then
transform it to the star and then i'm
going to be correlated then i'm going to
apply the higher criticism test to the
décor latest
sticks and so this you'll work no matter
what kind of correlation that have under
then we construct the higher criticism
test and using the be correlated
statistic that it could you know bit
higher criticism and so it turns out
that for the asymptotic to work in to
kick in and as in hockley required very
very large p very very large markers and
so that asymptotically this statistical
follow this combo distribution and so if
the markers are independent this
innovated higher criticism and the
higher criticism have the same
distribution and it had converged to you
in this very very slow rate is log p
rate and so what that means is in order
for the asymptotic latina i basically
need a very very large number of markers
and so if so the third line is a
theoretical a distribution of the higher
criticism and so this is an empirical
distribution for p equal to 100 what p
co 2 10 6 you can see even what pico to
10 6 is still quite far away from the
Cerreta code distribution so but in
genetic study the number markers with
energy or within the network generally
range from thousand two thousand so that
means as in total will never kick in it
is just too slow and so what that means
is that hyper error rate will be wrong
if i use as an AA degree not apply to
scan the whole genome and so what we
need to do is to develop analytical
exact p-value calculation for any giving
p it turns out we can do that so if we
define a p-value for the higher
criticism statistics it turns out
analytic p value can be constructed for
any given p and exactly so that is nice
that makes things much easier and the
results will here we compare the the
empirical p value with the empirical
temporal arrow with the exact analytical
p value and isentropic p value so for
example if you look at that alpha level
is 10-2 FP how to curl you can
see that if i use as in 30 p value it
can be quite a far off ap how 250 is you
can be quite far off but analytic
exactly value is very accurate so the
other problem is ID correlate that has
statistics by choice from the Z
statistics and but the problem is will I
d correlate the test statistic I'm going
to mix the signals and with the noise
and ongoing bumpin the signals that
caused the innovated higher criticism
lose the power and so for example if you
look at the the g was studying for the
breast kinds of studies and original
skill at original test and if I have a
sparse signals at original test for each
markers and so you can see I have a few
Piggly statistic when I be correlated
them you can see that this statistic
become much smaller and because a 10
pins of a dump in the signal with the
noise so that's why motivate us to
propose this generalized higher
criticism idea so I don't want to
transform the Z statistics i'm going to
use original these statistics i'm going
to allow the sigma to have any arbitrary
correlations and so then in this
situation this s doesn't follow a
binomial distribution more it followed
beta binomial so I'm so therefore the
denominator part you need to be the true
variance of s so that need to account
for the correlation among the marker it
turns out this covariance can be
constructed is it over disperse the
binomial so that can be constructed so
therefore i'm able to construct the
p-value analytically and so for any
giving p that is nice so to illustrate
and so here suppose i have a 40 markers
and so suppose this correlation among
the signal marker is point for the
correlation among the noise marker is a
point for and suppose two of them are
cultural barriers and this row 2 is a
correlation between the signal and noise
markers and the soulless this green line
is the innovative higher wisdom you can
see the power is here and
so the solid line is generalized heroism
you can see the power is much higher
similar thing if I have a four signals
and so so we also apply this to the
breast cancer gy study and so then
they'd find out using the channel try
analyze the higher criticism and this
fgfr2 gene and reach the genome-wide
significance to summarize on statistical
inference for high-dimensional data is
challenging and the hypothesis testing
based on consistent variable selection
based enormous likelihood passed against
a sparse alternative had similar
property to higher criticism and the
property of a signal detection depends
on the distribution of the outcome for
linear regression depends on the signal
sparsity and strength popeye linear
equation also depends on the design
matrix so as an RVP value for higher
criticism doesn't work well in practice
and for finite p but exact p-value is
available and the d correlate the test
statistic is not a good idea it lose the
power so generalize the heroism account
for correlation and also its power is
robust yeah thank you any questions so i
whiten data it makes you is that sparse
even if you were given a great espouse
signal originally now it's not sponsored
so that's why the horror character with
it so that's innovative higher criticism
and so the so you did know is that these
statistics unless all the size still
right just the power you lose the power
yeah so that's why the idea do you know
we use the generalized higher criticism
we don't be noisy and the chozo to
contain remains the original skill
so I have a quick one so these genotypes
are measured with error especially the
rare variant entity wonder if that the
game is about 30 x40 TS at the sequence
ero is very low so you in your model you
you just needs to be treated as
deterministic yeah we should be a
determinist don't work for low coverage
but I theme for no coverage and then the
size is still right and just a power
issue yeah each year microsoft research
