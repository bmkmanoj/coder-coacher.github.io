hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
welcome I know many of you not all of
you I'm Liz lolly I'm the one who's been
sending you all of these reminder emails
and updates and things like that just
out of curiosity how many of you have
never been to one of these symposia
before oh yay all right that's not
accidental we try really hard to get new
people here on a regular basis this is
the 11th symposium the first one was in
2004 then there was some argument about
whether there was one every year and so
it's either the 11th or the 12th we're
not going to we're not going to argue
that at this point but but it has always
been this idea of trying to bring
together people from academia and from
industry people who live in these
interstitial spaces who are deeply
curious about other areas who who want
to learn and so and you know some of you
have heard me say this before but
there's two real criteria for being
invited to this one is somebody who is
organizing this thinks you're one of the
best people in the world at what you do
and everybody in here it's that test the
other is that you're not an asshole
right and that's a non-trivial
requirement to tack on to the best in
the world at what you do because the
whole idea here is that everybody here
is probably more excited about learning
what you do then they are about telling
you what they do right and that's really
important so yes we're going to have
talks or in our presentations we're
going to have panels we're going to have
breakups we also have big chunks of time
for you to just talk to each other the
presentations are the glue that pull all
this together and the conversations are
the really important part of what comes
out of this so I want to introduce some
of the people who have been particularly
important in all of this i'm going to
start with where Sarah there she is back
there that lovely woman with the does
sarah is the person who makes the magic
happen sarah make sure that everything
is where it's supposed to be if there
are issues if there are problems if
they're just
cool things she is the magical person to
talk to about stuff like they didn't
have my hotel reservation or things like
that and and she's going to make sure
all the food and things like that happen
everybody knows lily I think lily is the
reason we have this every year Lily
finds the funds for it and the
administrative support and pulls us all
together and without that yeah we have a
bunch of people who organized sessions
this eat this year so you'll be seeing
all of them as we come along but yeah
Fiona Romeo it's doing the the session
on his organized session on design
Andres monroy Hernandez did I say that
even close to right okay look close
enough right is doing a very cool
session on crowdsourcing lily has some
really interesting speakers who are
coming in Brady is doing stuff on
hardware and I am macadie where's Katie
there she is katie is doing something on
humanizing systems the the con all of
these are about consequences often
unintended consequences so if you read
the email that I sent you last week you
know what comes next now right which is
we're going to pass this microphone
around and you are going to very briefly
say your name your affiliation if you
want to provide that and what's the
thing that you would love to give a
five-minute talk about I suggest that
everybody have something out where they
can take notes because there will in
fact be a quiz and the quiz is who are
the no more than seven because it's so
hard for them to collate this no more
than seven people that you really want
to hear that five-minute talk we will
actually pick the top 10 on vote-getters
to give talks this evening and we will
collate these between now and lunchtime
so you will know by lunchtime if you got
picked for tonight it's really it does
not need to be on something related to
the symposium topics hey what it should
be is something that you really care
about something that you really want to
share so on the example I give is one of
the best ones we've had was ethan
Zuckerman from MIT who talked about the
geopolitics of sumo wrestling which was
an amazing talk and totally unrelated to
anything we did that year at the
symposium so I will start you know who i
am i'm liz lolli I teach at RIT and if I
give a talk it would be on the project I
did in 2014 where I posted a gratitude
photo every day and the way that that
process reshaped my outlook on
day-to-day life and I am going to hand
this to Fiona hi I'm Fiona Romeo I'm the
director of digital content and strategy
at the Museum of Modern Art in New York
I've only been there for about six
months I had a what would seem in
America to be an extravagantly long time
off looking after my now and
two-year-old twins before that I worked
in the museum sector for a few years but
I originally was part of this group when
I worked in what I refer to as the web
proper so it's nice to be invited back
up to my many years of tossing about in
museums I'm not going to propose a talk
because I've got a session this morning
so I think that's way too much of me
already hi Karina Gardner and i work at
the Victoria and Albert Museum in London

this morning should you wish to hear
something again this evening it will be
about finding design in Shenzhen hi I'm
Alexandra lang I'm a design critic and I

the inside hi I'm Linda stone and I
study the psychophysiology of our

for doing that I'm Brad younger and I'm
a chief medical officer for a company
called mo basante we do mobile health
care so you ought to be hearing from me
later today if I was going to speak for
five minutes I probably talk about do
your health care stories around the
world people hacking into health care to
make their lives better but I really
want to hear about exploding kittens so
let's keep focused on a police my name
is Brian Keegan i'm a research associate
at the Harvard Business School I work on
HP X versus online learning platform so
I just started but happy to answer any
questions about that 55 minutes I would
want to talk about a project that's kind
of a near and dear to my heart recently
I'm Bradley Ashton sort of this concept
with Samuel arguments called long data
so how we could go about and look at old
historical archive data and interrogate
that with new kinds of methods so I'd
want to give a five-minute talk about
how we could create network set of major
league played major league baseball
player data from the past
yes I'm Nathan Matthias I'm a PhD
student at the MIT Media Lab in center
for civic media and spent a summer at
fuse labs and with my five minutes I
would talk about those crazy
productivity loss calculations for
everything from bathroom breaks too
angry birds and how I calculated the
productivity loss to the US economy due
to mansplaining I'm Alex Levitt I'm a
PhD candidate at USC in the annenberg
school I study social media and online
games with a photography and machine
learning I I'm torn between two ideas so
I can either talk about the one time i
rented a botnet to win a free trip to
New York or I could talk about looking
at my facebook year in review and how I
tried to reverse engineer it hi I'm Kate
miltner I am also p12 PhD student not
candidate at USC annenberg I study
internet pop culture or an academic
speak trivialized forms of online
cultural production um i would like to
talk about if i had five minutes project
i just finished which figures out how we
ended up with an all-white emoji set hi
I'm Erin cope I'm a head of engineering
and the digital and emerging media
department at the cooper-hewitt
Smithsonian National Design Museum it's
all your stuff I'm also speaking so I I
think you should vote for someone else
also because it means that I don't
actually have to figure out what I mean
when I say I would do a five-minute talk
about a manifesto against experiences in
design
hi I'm Josette Melchior I'm the
executive director and founder of a gray
area foundation for the Arts we support
art and technology for social impact
here in San Francisco if I had five
minutes I would talk about what not to
say to the planning department when
you're reviving a theater in the mission
hi my name is on Desmond Royal nandus
I'm a researcher in few slaps microsoft
research and if i were to speak i will
talk about how my neighborhood use a cat
in the context of kittens and a Facebook
page to revive the neighborhood hi i'm
jose medina I about political science
professor in Mexico City and I have a
company called data for and if I have
five minutes and being from mexico i
guess i would talk about data and
violence and what we know and what we
don't and especially how to actually
convey the idea of violence to a mass
audience in Mexico
I have kettering a fake and I am a
serial entrepreneur co-founder of flickr
hunch currently finery also formally
chairwoman of the Board of Etsy if I
were to be given five minutes to speak I
would speak about some of the topics
which currently interest me which are
homeschooling child sex trafficking and
campus assault we miss anybody that came
in late and that I didn't tag okay so um
so here's the thing you get the pic only
seven right only seven I know that's
hard here's the other thing you have to
write legibly because Carolyn and Sarah
have to put these together you also have
to find out the name of the person you
can't just say hacking into smart house
talk so that means you might have to
actually get up right now and find that
person and find out their name or ask
somebody near you who might know their
name because it's just not fair to Sarah
and Carolyn to have to figure out what
your cryptic notes mean in terms of a
person and so so that's what you need to
do now seven people their actual names
sarah has paper and pen if you need it
ok and I'm going to give you a couple of
minutes in case you have to actually get
up and read somebody's name tag in order
to accomplish this each year Microsoft
