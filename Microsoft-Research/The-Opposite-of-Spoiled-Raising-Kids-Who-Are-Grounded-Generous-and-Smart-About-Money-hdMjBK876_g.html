spoiled raising kids who are grounded
generous and smart about money it's a
practical guide book and a values based

Wall Street Journal fortune and Fast
Company magazine magazines
he is the author or co-author of three
additional books including taking time
off please join me in to give him a very
warm welcome hey everybody thanks so
much for coming this represents a sort
of homecoming for me a little bit so my
wife used to work at Slate it was her
first job in journalism back when
Microsoft owned slate and she was an
em-dash for a while and then she
graduated you know got her badge
what was the color badge back then that
was the eye I can go in any door badge
blue right she was a blue badge for a
while and then you know moved on to
other things in journalism but you know
we used to come out here all the time
there was a you know sort of a deal
there at at slate that you know spouses
were always welcome to come hang out so
sometimes I would come here and do my
work too when I need to be out on the
west coast and the thing that I'd
forgotten until I got out of the car
here was how much better it smells on
this side of the lake what is it just
trees is that it it's the tree smell oh
my god Brooklyn does not smell like that
it is awesome
it is awesome anyway thank you for
having me it's such a thrill to me that
people are interested in this topic you
know this is really for me a manifesto
it's a cause that we are going to be
better at this than our parents were
generationally and so much has changed
to make it so much more important
getting this
anything right with our kids with our
grandkids with our nieces and nephews
and with our students and so that is why
I'm here and so please do me the favor
of keeping your laptops open of keeping
your cellphone's out if you do you know
that's where you can tweet anything
outrageous or ridiculous that I say come
hang out we've got a community thousand
strong now kicking around a lot of these
money and parenting issues and that's
where you find me if you want to sign up
for my newsletter there's literally a 15
second sign up there feel free to do it
now when I'm talking your boss may be
texting you that's totally cool keep
your phone's out and thanks that's me
age 10 with more hair I can still get
that big if I if I wait long enough for
a haircut I want to tell you a little
bit the story of how I got to this topic
and why I care so much about it and it
really began with my navigation of the
financial aid system as an undergrad you
know I learned a lot about about money
from having less money all of a sudden
when my family went through a divorce
first and then there was a job loss and
you know our household income didn't
really return to where it had been for a
good long while
and so my brother and sister and I were
on financial aid at the school that we
went to in Chicago yeah and then I went
to college to Amherst College in Amherst
Massachusetts so there any Lord Jeffs in
the house for chance no nobody here
today
all right so this is the first one where
nobody has come out to root me on but
you know I assume they're all busy they
work here so so I went there and there
were you know a couple of points of you
know sort of consciousness-raising and
switch flipping for me the first one was
when my mother came out and she came out
every year including during orientation
the very first moment I was there and we
would sit down with a director of
financial aid who believe it or not was
an ordained minister Joe Paul Kaiser as
we refer to him in our house st. Joe who
every year sort of took us in and we
basically haggled we
said Joe you know I understand that this
is what you think that you can do or
this is what you think we ought to get
but here's how the numbers look to us
this is what I'm capable of earning this
is what you know we think my mother will
get off of her sales commissions this is
you know what my father can do we think
and can you do a little better and every
year he always did Joe and I are still
in touch I was at the National
Association of student financial aid
administrators conference just last year
where he now has emeritus status he just
retired after 40 years in the business
and we took a picture together you know
and I had a button on that said I love
my financial aid administrator they were
passing those out all over the
conference though anyway yes Saint Joe
was very good to me but the other thing
that happened at school was that there
was a moment in the very first weekend
when they sent all of the financial aid
kids down the hill to a meeting by
themselves and all the kids who weren't
on financial aid stayed at the top of
the hill in the dorms to hang out and
get to know one another and I don't
think they meant this to be any big deal
but I remember anticipating it knowing
that it was going to happen and trying
to guess by looking the everyone at the
room which one of the kids were gonna be
walking down the hill with me and which
ones were gonna stay at the top and I
never forgot that moment and so you know
one of the things that I learned from my
experiences with st. Joe was that you
know almost every system can be beaten
in a completely legal way that does not
involve sticking your toe over the line
right complex systems you know they have
loopholes they have rules that people
don't understand and there are perfectly
legitimate ways to exploit them maybe
that's too strong of a word but at least
take advantage of the system as it's set
up and so I grew up to be the person in
journalism whose beat is beating the
system I didn't figure this out for
myself at all it wasn't until ten years
into my career when I went to work for
The Wall Street Journal that they kind
of figured it out for me that I was the
guy who wrote the story that explained
that there were five mattress retailers
in the United States where you could
call them
pay them some money have them ship you
or deliver you the mattress and you
could try it out for free and then give
it back and get a full refund and so not
only did I figure out that that was
possible but I actually did it over the
course of three months we had a bunch of
mattresses in and out just to prove to
readers that like this really important
purchase now you spend a third of your
life on it if you're lucky if you get
that much sleep you know you ought to be
able to try it out you know you don't
just go to the showroom and lay down on
it for a minute so things like that and
they said you know Ron that's personal
finance we've just never defined it in
that way before and this is this is what
you were born to do and it became my
life's work because I had good editors
who saw something in me that I had never
seen in myself but then I became a
parent and I lost all confidence right
there's nothing like a little person who
is relying on you to really shake you up
and within a couple of years even though
by then I was playing this money expert
in the newspaper at the New York Times
in front of a million people or so every
weekend you know sure questions to me
and my wife stopped me cold I didn't
know how to answer her I wasn't sure
what to say
and the reason was I finally figured out
was that it was clear to me that these
questions that she had about money in
particular starting fast and furious at
the age of three or four were actually
questions about values at their root
they were about why did we make the
choices that we did why do we live in
this size house instead of that size
house or this neighborhood said of that
neighborhood why were we journalists and
not software developers that we could
make a little bit more money you know I
mean they were asking she asked these
questions early on you know questions
that kind of cut to our core and they
were all the more complex because she
was too young to really understand the
sophisticated version of the answers so
I started putting these questions up
online on a blog at the Times and a
bunch of people saw them and right
around the time that Occupy Wall Street
happened they asked me to come speak to
their communities where people with more
and people with less we're feeling very
uncomfortable about the conversations
that were going on around the dinner
table and they didn't know what to say
to their kids about it and I tried to
think about how I could help those
people
I thought well if there's one thing that
everybody has in common is that nobody
wants to raise a spoiled child because
spoiled is something that you do to them
they are not born that way spoiled kids
are made and they're usually made by
their parents so I thought okay well if
we can agree on that and I think we can
then what's the opposite of spoiled you
know what's the solution here right and
the dictionary wasn't helpful at this
that the source wasn't either right
because the opposite of spoiled is fresh
which you can apply to froat produce or
meat but it doesn't really work in this
context so you know I made this list of
all of the values and virtues and
character traits then added up to the
opposite of spoiled modesty and patience
and generosity and grit and thrift and
curiosity and prudence and perspective
and I looked at that list and I thought
whoa you can use money to teach every
single one of these values right you
know we give and we're careful about our
spending and it's okay to ask questions
in fact we value that because being
curious about money is you know the
beginning of mastering it having
perspective on how much you have and who
has more and who has less and how that
came to pass and whether it's fair and
not bragging or showing off the things
that we have or that we do and being
willing to wait too late gratification
and all of that and so I realized that
money was actually a great teaching tool
for these things and I went and spoke to
the parents about it and they were the
ones that encouraged me to write this
book so once again you know somebody
else seen something that I had not
realized in my work that was adding up
to something more so I did what I was
told I took a leave and I and I wrote
this book and that's kind of how I got
to where we are today so this is
actually supposed to be my daughter one
of the illustrators at The Times put
this together when I wrote the original
column about the questions the kids
asked and you can see there's like a
shadow sort of looming over her she's
kind of looking up you know she's got a
million questions they're all kind of
exploding out of her
and and it is our job to answer them
right their job is to be curious to
figure out how the world works
money is a source of great mystery and
Wonder and so they ask and so there are
a number of ways for us to answer right
so I would ask you to think about a
couple things first of all one of the
best answers to almost any money
question and it works pretty well for
other hard questions too is why do you
ask and it's not why do you ask
as if they're doing something wrong by
asking or that it's impolite or
inconvenient we want to honor their
curiosity I think and encourage them to
keep asking but often the questions
don't actually have anything or very
much to do with what they're saying so
very often kids who are young will ask
if we're rich or if we're poor or
they'll ask how much money we make even
though you know they're not matha boleyn
ufff at that point to really comprehend
the answer because they're not up to you
know five and six figure numbers and
math cause so you really want to try and
figure out what's at the root of it and
if you ask them that question why do you
ask you know often the answer is well
you know someone on the playground said
that their mother made a million dollars
right or I heard you and dad fighting
about money and I'm worried that we're
running out of money right or once they
start reading they see something in the
newspaper about people who are
unemployed and maybe you're unemployed
and they think that they're about to be
poor or you just got a new car and they
think they're rich and so you want to
try and divert the conversation if you
can you know to the things that they're
actually asking about and not answer
anything more because they may not
actually be curious about what they
originally said that they were going to
plus why do you ask is a great stalling
tactic it would have worked particularly
well for my friend Christy who a couple
years ago was confronted by you know her
son who marched into the room one day at
the age of six and pulled himself up and
said to Christy and her conservative
father from the South when are we gonna
start having some more sex around here
so Christie didn't know what to do
Christy and I had not had the why do you
ask conversation yeah so Christie in
front of her father had to deliver a
sort of abbreviated version of the birds
and the bees and explained you know Gus
that he wasn't really ready for sex yet
and it was a grown-up thing and oh by
the way that's like how you make babies
and Gus looks very confused you know Gus
did not want to have sex he did not want
to have sex with his mother with his
grandfather that wasn't what he was
after he had been watching Family Guy I
don't know why they let him do that
but it occurred to him after several
episodes of FAMILY GUY that the word sex
was a great way to make the laugh track
Oh crazy and so there he was when are we
gonna start having some more sex around
here something else to keep in mind you
know I'm glad that the person in that
picture is a girl there's a lot of
research out there that shows that girls
do not ask as much about money as boys
do that parents don't talk to them as
much about money
as they do to boys when they do talk to
girls they talked to them about charity
and as a result girls when they're
polled as teenagers have salary
expectations that are 20 to 30 percent
lower than boys do as a father of a
nine-year-old girl this really pisses me
off and if there's anything that I
intend to accomplish here it's to make
sure that parents don't see you know
silence from their girls as a lack of
curiosity or a lack of need to learn
about money it just may be that
something in the culture has told them
that they should be asking or that it's
not something for them and of course
that's not true but we have to tack
against it so these are the three jars
from the front of my book and I put them
there for a reason they're there in part
because this is the sort of basic
foundation of what it means to create an
adult budget you know if we're doing it
right and you know we're reasonably
generous people you know we're spending
80 percent of what we make on mortgages
and cars and school and whatever
you know we're saving 10 or 15% so that
we can retire someday and we're giving
away the rest or you know if you're if
you're a Mormon or some other faith
where you automatically give 10% no
matter much no matter what maybe you're
giving it a little more but that's a
basic adult budget but the other thing
that I like about this is that you know
these words and these jars or stand-ins
for some of the values that we want to
imprint right spending well what we're
really trying to teach is prudence and
thrift but not you know self-denial I
mean what we want our kids to be able to
do is is have the kind of wherewithal to
understand what kind of spending makes
them most happy delivers the highest
return and then it's spend a lot of
extra money on that and nothing on the
stuff that really doesn't you know give
us the same kind of thumbs saving you
know it's patience it's delayed
gratification and giving is all about
generosity so you know it's a stand-in
for our values too and it's the basic
foundation for allowance and so
something else that allowance is about
now why are you laughing
we who laughed first and tell me why
this is funny cuz let's get at the root
of this you're smiling but what made
this all right anybody wearing hunter
boots
okay yeah this is this has been an issue
for me I you know there's nothing wrong
with adults wearing hunter boots and
there isn't even really well anyway the
biggest challenge that adults have in
figuring out their spending and
certainly the biggest challenge we have
with teaching kids is understanding the
difference between wants and needs and
for every category of spending adult
spending and kids spending there's a
range of items on the list right so if
we're thinking about wellies and you
know I love doing this here because it
rains a lot right so people totally get
the rain boot thing every kid needs them
right you can get you know generic rain
boots from where would you get your
generic rain boots here like pay less or
something right yeah so see our Target
or Walmart right so
those cost 20 bucks and over here we
have the hunter boots and the hunter
boots for kids probably cost 70 80 90
bucks and for grown-ups they're into the
low three digits and so as parents you
know when I try and courage people to do
is to say for every category to their
kids look this is what we are willing to
pay for you know in in the athletic shoe
category in the underwear category in
the winter coat category in the bicycle
electric guitar you know a softball
glove everyone you know you need to be
able to say the kids look this is this
is where we are and this is what we'll
pay for and so in clothing look I'm from
the Midwest like out here it would be it
would be REI maybe you would make the
REI line right but but for you know
every category of spending you say this
is what we'll do and in our household my
feeling is that we always try and draw
the Lands End line which says to our
daughter right okay in whatever category
we're in we will pay for whatever the
Lands End equivalent price is so for you
know the well East it would probably 40
50 bucks for the lands and ones and if
you want the hunter boots you're gonna
have to pay for the difference between
here and here out of your own money your
birthday money your Christmas money your
Hanukkah money out of your allowance
whatever so again different families may
have different lines you know your your
line may be a target line or it may be a
North Face line so it might be to the
left or the right of fine but if you can
lay it out this way for kids you know
they don't have to like it
right there have to like where you put
the line and it's not up for negotiation
but it does give them a sense of you
know how you make these decisions and so
one of the trickiest questions that
anybody ever asked me when I was giving
one of these talks is you know mother
got up and said so my son came to me
recently and said he didn't understand
why he could not have a carnivorous
plant terrarium given that they had
bought hunter boots for his sister to
wear and I thought that was awesome
because he saw something I think that
his mother hadn't quite been able to
articulate which was that you know his
ask was for a tool for
learning right carnivorous plant
terrarium you got botany you got animal
behavior you've got you know a science
you know it's all all sorts of good
stuff Hunter boots are a luxury product
they are a want and not a need where as
tools for learning I think in most
families that you know have some
disposable income tools for learning are
sort of mandatory we spend as much on
them as we possibly can so I said you
should get the kid the carnivorous plant
where I am but make him pay for his own
flies so you know this is all well and
good and I puffed myself up a couple
months ago my daughter came home where
he knows and I thought okay this is not
something I would have ever chosen to
pay for I think my wife knows that I've
been you know riffing and the Spanish
script on hunter boots what on earth
happened here that it turns out the
grandma got involved grandparents are a
menace in this regard they think it's
their job to spoil kids that they were
put on the earth specifically to subvert
all of our rules and values and
decisions they do it with great Glee and
so a couple years earlier a leather
miniskirt had showed up in the mail from
a different grandma that went back to
the store I sucked it up
and left this one go and I'm glad I did
because now my daughter is like totally
tuned into this right she thinks all the
thing is very funny so we're walking
down the street just a couple weeks ago
we were in Fulton Street in downtown
Brooklyn where there is a ton of sort of
cut-rate discount stores she grabs my
hand she said dad dad
there's generic hunter boots in the
window and sure enough there they were
for the same twenty dollars they would
have cost at Payless and so we took a
little glamour shot and and let it go so
people often ask me about about chores
and whether kids should have to do
chores in order to get allowance I think
the answer is no I think money again as
a tool for learning it's for kids to
practice it falls in the same category
as a paintbrush or an electric guitar or
a book we would not take these things
away if the kids weren't doing
their chores so I don't think we should
take the money away either but as far as
the chores are concerned they should do
a ton of them they can do more than we
think they are capable of are any of you
guys watching MasterChef junior right
now do you know it's a it's a reality
show with a bunch of like eight to
twelve year olds cooking insane feasts
in competing against one another it is
now clear to me the ten year olds
absolutely can and should be cooking
dinner and they should do it for free
the same way we do all a lot of stuff
for them for free
and if we don't like the way they're
doing those charts we can take away
privileges we can take away screen time
we can take away car keys we can do all
sorts of things to keep them in line
but again chores there should be a ton
of them and you can really geek out on
this stuff so I spent some time with
Mormon families in Utah while I was
doing the reporting for this book just
to see what life is like in families
with a whole mess of kids and so this is
you know one of the chore charts from
one of the Mormon families I visited the
Palmer family and you know they got
points for the completion of various
chores those are the Palmer points they
also you know got extra bonuses for
being for being anxiously engaged which
to them means like you know doing it
with a lot of expediency and care and
and focus and then you know you've got
all of there you've got all of their you
know the regular duties that they need
to do as well and it gets highly
specific right so I I don't actually
know what an entry bench is but they
have one and they need to be dusted you
know the bedroom that needs to be good
and clean not just clean and not just
good but good and clean the door between
the mud Reuben kitchen must be washed at
this facility this is a household that
actually had a water fountain installed
right next to the mudroom it just gives
you a sense of like the level of traffic
and excitement in that house they just
decided to put water and so you know you
can go you can go really deep on the
chores but I don't know that I would pay
for them exactly so we were looking at
the share chart the share jar before I
think all of us want to raise generous
kids and people ask me a lot well what
are kids really capable of at the age of
four or five or six are they born Jenner
and the answer is yes right science
shows us that and we know it just from
you know the toddlers who are constantly
trying to hand us their grimy Cheerios
right they like sharing they like
reaction that it fosters and they're
primed you know for charity and
forgiving that at a very early age this
comes from a girl whose family I know in
Brooklyn and she had questions about the
protesters during Occupy Wall Street she
want to know what was going on and her
parents said to her well you know there
are some people who have war and there's
some people who have less and there's a
lot of people who think that's not fair
and we're trying to figure out what to
do about it which was a pretty good
explanation of what the protests were
all about and so she went home and she
drew a sharing machine and so at the top
you know goes in the gold pieces and
they come down the pink funnel and it
turns into you know red and blue money
and then out it goes off the phallic
elephant tusks
you know out into the world where the
money is I guess redistributed now you
know not every kid is a fan of
redistribution it turns out some of them
go to school and write stories about how
people should not have to pay higher
taxes so this showed up at my daughter
school and of course being a busybody
reporter I called the family I said did
you did you know about this I said I
think it's so cool that he has these
opinions where does it come from and
they were horrified
and then they stopped and they looked
through the book collection and they
realized that like two months earlier
they had been reading a book about the
Boston Tea Party and so he remembered
that there had been this protest a
couple hundred years ago and the people
didn't want to pay higher taxes to the
British and that was how it started
and so it's not clear you know what sort
of politics this boys gonna have when he
grows up but you know clearly he's
absorbing this whole question about you
know equity and redistribution and we
can absolutely bring kids in our on our
own discussions as well
last year we sat down with our daughter
and we put a bunch of beans on the table
a hundred beans and then we divided them
into piles according to how we allocated
our charities giving and so you know
river blindness devastating disease for
you know it's something like 75 or a
hundred bucks you know you can you can
actually save a life because the
treatments are so you know effective and
and there there are organizations now
that do a really great job making sure
that people are inoculated and get
treated and you know there's the you
know basically what I consider to be
payback for financial aid there's a
couple of those and you know breast
cancer my mom's is there a survivor of
premenopausal breast cancer so we give
their you know food for the hungry
homeless children Public Radio my
grandmother by marriage is a Holocaust
survivor you know so we try and help
older Jewish people and then and then
there was the one you can see that this
one's in a different handwriting so we
said to our daughter what's missing here
and do we need to move the beans around
to make it more fair and more reflective
of the things that are truly important
to us and truly important to you and the
thing that I liked about what she did is
that she saw this which is payback for
my financial aid and this which is
payback for my financial aid and she
decided that she wanted us to give money
to the scholarship fund at her camp so
that kids who are like the way that I
was when I was a kid would be able to go
to that to me who was victory
a close cousin of generosity is
gratitude because one of the things we
try and talk to our kids about I think
is you know we sort of have almost a
duty as human beings to sort of throw
the rope back for others one day it
might be us that need help or maybe we
have already been the people who needed
help whether it was you know financial
aid from a fancy private school or like
her great grandmother grandma Hana who
you know was literally taken in and you
know spirited across Europe and on a
boat into New York and taken in by all
of the refugee organizations in the
1940s and 50s so that she can make a
life and a family and make a wife or
help make a wife for me
and so you know this is part of what
this is part of what we do you know we
help and and we are grateful for what we
have and for all of the things they've
been given to us and so you know when
you start thinking about gratitude on a
more kind of consistent basis it's
really powerful there's a lot of science
that's been done on this particularly
out of the greater good science center
at the University of California at
Berkeley didn't if you get there a
newsletter the greater good science
center it's fantastic totally worth
signing up for you know thinking about
the power of gratitude has has literally
made me a happier person I feel like I'm
about 20% happier than I was when I
started the research for this book and
it's just through some sort of daily
gratitude ritual sometimes when I'm
waiting for the subway I'll stop and
I'll think about someone or something
that did something awesome that day for
me for the world something that you know
move me even in a small way so turns out
kids like to do this too it's incredibly
powerful for kids to do it and you can
do it through a grey Seine ritual if you
happen to be people of faith or you can
just sit around the table and hold hands
and close your eyes and say gracias
which is what a family in Vermont and
it's a great way to sort of stop pause
think about what you have and simply say
one word thank you but what kids really
love to do it turns out is give toasts
because it makes them feel like
grown-ups and they're raising their
glass and it's raucous and everybody
does Cheers
kids love that stuff right so
you know if nothing else have a nightly
or a Friday night ly or at least a
semi-regular hosting session so they can
think about the things and the people
that did cool stuff that week that made
them happy and grateful so we haven't
talked so much about paid work and paid
work for teenagers has gone out of style
a little bit you know it started with
the labor laws all of which are great
but you know we still have some sort of
historical memory of that and we worry
now about kids working too much but in
you know upper-middle class and above
communities the definition of too much
equals their grades will suffer this
after-school job is not as important as
being a theater person or an athlete and
they won't get into Stanford and so this
idea has developed that I believe is
actually false and I've spoken to enough
admissions officers now that to know for
sure that it's false that that work is
actually kind of devalued that paid work
is devalued and it's better for them to
do all of the usual array of
extracurricular activities so their
applications look like everybody else's
which is not really the way to stand out
when you know only one in 20 kids get
into Stanford and so just to prove this
point I started this you know annual
series of college admissions essays
where we do a contest in the newspaper
where we pick the very best essays that
have been written about money and work
by seventeen year olds who are applying
to college and these kids are going in
amazing places telling incredible
stories and it turns out kids wanna work
they're primed to work there's a whole
riff in the book about tin-can
collection and redemption kids do it up
and down the income spectrum I have
stories of families who do it all the
time you know the Clark girls that's the
back of the elder girl's head they live
in San Jose California and they got so
into the can and bottle collection their
parents drink a lot of beer they have a
lot of parties and the girls you know
dutifully clean it all up and in
exchange for that you know once every
three months mom or dad takes them to
the scrap yard in San Jose and off they
go and this place is like the scene out
of the movie in the first Star Wars film
you know where it's like if
race shapes size of person from all over
the place you know Boy Scout troops and
you know you name it people working
there and going there there's like
shards of glass flying around there
crunching stuff it's really noisy you
can actually borrow earplugs when you're
there it's so loud and you know the
girls walk through and know exactly what
to do they know everybody behind the
scales they know the cashier by name you
know and they walk out of there with 80
or 90 bucks and they take it to the
credit union and put it away
kids like working and I was so
interested in this idea of kids and work
I got it in my head that we might
actually all be better off if we were
more like farm families where you know
in the old days you would actually
produce more kids specifically to do the
work and so I went and I tracked down
some dairy farm families in Utah again
you know where they had a lot of kids
many of them were Mormon and this is
zebb short for zebediah he is the
youngest of eight on a dairy farm near
the Utah Idaho border he was five at the
time that I met him and it is clear to
the Smith boys from the earliest
possible age that they will work and
that they can do much of what the
grown-ups do so Zev at the age of five
he's perched on the tractor okay so the
tractor is on it's moving and Zeb's job
is to steer the tractor at one mile an
hour as it sort of goes down the aisles
of newly-born calves and then a
seven-year-old and the five year old or
the seven year old a nine year old are
trailing behind him and they're grabbing
the bottles that then that the 11 and
the 13 year old have prepared out and
they're dropping them in the slot in the
calf pens so that the calves can have
their milk so Zeb does this you know
every every five-year-old boy in the
Smith family gets his first gun and
Zeb's job is to be safe with the gun
first and foremost they know all about
gun safety and Zeb's job is to shoot at
the Tweety birds that bother the cows
and can potentially spread disease so
that's another job that Zeb has so you
know we can't all be farm families and
not every family lives outside of a
place like you know Redmon or Belle
of you or you know on the side of Lake
Washington where most of what surrounds
you are people who are more or less like
you and for that you know to get kids
away from what surrounds them during the
year many parents turn to summer camp
overnight camp in particularly and I
wanted to find the sort of most amazing
version of overnight camp that kind of
strips away all of the non necessities
in life I found it on an island in Maine
in the middle of the state in the middle
of a lake
it's called Pine Island camp there are
90 boys there each summer no electricity
barely any running water the only
entertainment there is what they do for
one another they make up skits they make
up games and you know each night
the fun that they have is based on the
fund that they make and create for
themselves it's such a communal
experience in fact that you know the
kids are no longer at home where
everyone has their own bathroom they are
no longer at home where everyone has a
bathroom door even and this is where
they go it's called the loo with a view
it's up two flights of stairs it's you
know beautiful view you can't see the
screened window on the other side but
this is where they sit and do their
business and and they take great delight
in taking visitors in there and making
them go to the bathroom and you know you
want to talk about like you sort of
getting away from like the stuff and the
amenities the tendus around kids these
days overnight camp can be a great way
to do it
so or you can do this
right you can go to the kind of store
and the store shall remain nameless
where a camp is somehow associated with
a luxury product I still can't get over
this one and I'm actually speaking in a
couple weeks in the town where this was
spotted I have no idea what I'm going to
say to these people
so for the truly affluent you know there
may be some some folks around here who
were in on this whole Microsoft business
early and you may well be you know
sitting on millions and millions of
dollars and if you are that's great
you're probably thinking about how best
to make sure that your kids are not
getting the wrong idea about what their
adult life is going to be like or how
hard they're gonna have to work to
reproduce whatever it is that you
managed to make and I was talking to a
family about this recently
and they said that they had realized
that they made a mistake by taking their
kids on too many fancy vacations too
soon because they overheard the kids
comparing the poolside amenities that
were delivered by the staff at various
Four Seasons resorts that they had been
to and they were horrified these parents
both grew up working-class they hustled
for everything that they got and they
were now extremely wealthy but they
realized that they had it all wrong and
they needed to be doing more what they
were referred to as deliberate
downgrades which sounds like a very
upper-class thing to say but the fact of
the matter is and you know the
sociological research is kind of pointed
this out and named it for families that
have more than average there's a lot of
you know sort of symbolic deprivation
that goes on right if you can afford
much or even all of what your kids want
you certainly don't want to give it all
to them and so you're gonna need to draw
lines in the sand of like what is okay
and what is not and so you know being
served a poolside drink a you know
resort with a you know graduated edge
pool you know may or may not be your
version of over being over the line but
you know I I now think about you know
this family in the Four Seasons when I
go out and talk to people and when I
think about you know what we splurge on
and whether our daughter is getting the
wrong idea from that and you know they
may be getting the wrong idea if we're
not narrating our choices phones
technology look we're at Microsoft this
is a big deal with ten eleven twelve
thirteen year olds when they start to
get them my feeling about this is
smartphones are a want
they are not a need every kid needs a
cell phone at a certain point I think
just cuz teachers and coaches even are
texting them they sex text with one
another but I'm not sure you need
internet access on your phone at the age
of 11 or 12 when you probably have a PC
at home or a tablet that they can use
that has internet access there and so my
feeling is if they want this if they
want Instagram on their phones or
whatever it is that they want while
they're on the go or whether they're in
school if it's allowed then they ought
to pay for it they ought to pay for the
data plan they ought to pay for the
hardware you pay for the basics they pay
for the rest and the same thing goes
with cars you know this is the boxy
Volvo of many of our youths to me it's
sort of symbolic of a sturdy kind of
tank like used vehicle that you know
that you can rely on cars have only
gotten better over time even the
ten-year-old ones today you know all
have airbags many of them have stability
control all the stuff that you'd want
kids to have and so you know big
believer in in used cars and making kids
pay for them this they cannot pay for
this is the kind of thing that only a
parent can pay for maybe we have some
you know fractional owners or jet owners
in the room I'm not sure but where kids
tend to see this kind of thing most
often is on Instagram inevitably in you
know relatively well-off communities or
especially well-off communities there
will come a point when a kid that they
know are a friend of a friend posts a
picture of themselves in some insane
place you know maybe it's the 50-yard
line at the Super Bowl or maybe it's
down on the field with Russell Wilson or
maybe it's you know in a private jet
they hitched a ride on or that you know
they have access to 25 hours of each
year and you know I've heard from a lot
of parents who have said that I actually
wanted to break my kids phone the first
time I realized that they were looking
at this stuff and they can follow do any
of you know the rich kids of Instagram
account you can actually follow account
with a whole bunch of pictures like this
and you know kids get all the wrong
reasons about you know what's possible
and you know Instagram and
always can become a sort of engine of
envy right even if there are no private
jet photos it's possible for kids to get
the wrong idea about what everybody
else's life is like because all anybody
ever posts is their awesome right like
here me you know I just got these
awesome new clothes with my awesome
friends on my awesome birthday and you
weren't invited and my post has more
likes than yours does and it can be very
easy as an adult so let alone a child
following that stuff to think that your
life is somehow wanting and so it's not
to say the kitchen have phones not to
say the kids shouldn't have Instagram
just that we need to watch what they're
consuming in the same way that we watch
carefully what they're consuming on
television I mean this for them the rich
kids of Instagram this is the new TV so
you can probably tell by now you know I
feel really strongly so there's a
deep-rooted connection between money and
feelings and behavior and emotions you
know the basic science and economics of
personal finance are pretty
well-established now you know you spend
a little bit less than you make you know
you put the rest away for safekeeping
and for retirement invested in index
funds or Microsoft stock or maybe not
recently I can't remember but anyway you
know you you you know you save as much
as you can you put it someplace
relatively stable you have a diverse
collection of assets and you buy some
insurance and you know you continue to
work diligently and you know cross your
fingers that you don't have a big
interruption in income but the way that
we screw things up is when we let our
emotions govern our spending and our
investing and even sometimes our giving
and it's especially powerful when it
comes to our kids and our money and
their money and what we want to do for
them because it's a it's a complex
emotional stew right on one hand you've
got your parenting instincts you know
which are all emotion and you've got
your money instincts which are often
majority emotions and when you try and
think about parenting and money and kids
it's just incredibly complicated and so
I always ask people to just think right
you know am I making a money decision
here or am I making a feelings to see
here because when it comes to our kids
we really want to get that right thank
you so that's where you can find me
literally 15 seconds drop in your first
name and email address I promise I won't
bug you too often but I have other acts
of long form journalism I intend to
commit in this particular area of
parents and money and values and
decisions before too long so please keep
me posted on where to find you and I
will keep you posted on what else I'm
learning but before we go I'd love to
take questions ask me anything about the
newspaper without the book about the
rich kids of Instagram not in isolation
for a child aged six to ten but one
thing that I advocate doing and I think
we're going to do this with our daughter
starting in the next year or two is that
you can take your collection of you know
Lands End lines or Target lines or REI
lines and you know sit down with your
child in July or August and say okay
here are all the things that we think
you've grown out of or that you'll need
and we've got a Lands End line for your
boots and we've got a North Face line
for your winter coat and we've got a
target line for your underwear and so
here's the budget here's the underwear
money for Target here's the lands in
line for the boots here's the you know
180 bucks or whatever it is for the
North Face jacket we're gonna throw that
money into a pile and you decide and if
you don't want the North Face jacket
then you can buy the target jacket and
if you want to you know buy your bras
and underwear at Victoria's Secret
how about it but you know we're not
going to give you any more money and if
you screw it up you're gonna have to
find a way to earn more to get the
things that you need and it's up to
you so you know you can you can bring
them in on that and in effect reward
them for making good trade-offs at a
certain point but yeah I don't know if I
would give them money back at an early
age for picking the cheaper option well
it's an interesting idea I know parents
that you know when they go out for
dinner they'll give their kid a dollar
for having water so that's sort of like
a similar similar way to go at it
although I don't know I'm different
parents are different you know we
generally don't let our daughter order
drinks in a restaurant because going to
a restaurant is a treat in and of itself
so that was me I wrote it I didn't do it
but I wrote it yeah it was an excerpt
from the opposite of spoiled yeah right
yeah so so the question yeah sorry the
question was should you disclose what
you make to your kids and if so when and
so this gentleman Scott Parker he he did
this with kids ages 17 to 7 I think you
know completely radical he throws the
money on the table he starts peeling it
off into the budget pile so that they
could see where it all went and there
really wasn't very much left because he
had six kids and you know even at
$10,000 a month you know the kids were
in Cub Scouts than they had pizza night
once a week and yeah a pizza night for
eight and you know you're down 150 bucks
right so so anyway so yeah he did that
for them I don't think the young ones
are ready my feeling about this is that
your kids deserve to know it's a great
thing to teach them but not until at
least 10 years have gone by of intensive
you know allowance training over here
and then you introduce them to the idea
of the household budget so they know
what that money might go into so they're
learning about rent and mortgage and
insurance and bills and they're going to
the grocery store with you for a year
and then over here right you're teaching
them about discretion you're testing
them am I gonna are they gonna keep
their sibling secrets which they often
have trouble doing if they have sip
are they gonna keep their friends
secrets or are they gonna gossip and
cause pain to people who are close to
them are they going to keep the family
secrets and then you know you pose it as
a test to them say this is grown-up
information we believe that you're ready
for it we want you to understand what it
takes to have a life like this and if
you want a different life what that how
much more that pipe tank and you know
you could ask us questions about that
but you should know that this
information it's not valuable outside of
our household people aren't really all
that interested in it and so if you talk
about it you are going to sound like an
asshole and so you know at that point
kids are not going to want to flunk the
discretion test they're not gonna want
to flunk the maturity test they're
definitely not going to want to flunk
the asshole test with their friends and
at that point they keep it to themselves
and it's good information now yeah I
think it's okay to tell them if you
happen to be going on a four seasons
type vacation and you wouldn't want that
getting out you know it's a tricky
question right but you know I think we
ought to own our choices and we ought to
own our choices with our children and if
it makes us uncomfortable to spend that
much or who would make us uncomfortable
for people to find out well then don't
post your four seasons photos on
Instagram that's for sure but you know
there maybe we ought to check like are
we really spending money in a way that
makes us feel good or would we be better
off going camping and putting that money
towards college or charity or you know
adding another room on the house so we
could have bigger parties to make more
memories with the people that we love
right so I think it's okay to tell them
and even better it's you can bring them
in on it right you can say all right you
know this is the this is the budget for
vacation this year you decide and you
know we can downgrade the hotel and you
know upgrade the you know day trips or
we can pack our own food and stay in the
Four Seasons but not even the restaurant
right I mean you can you can do all
sorts of things you never know what they
might be willing to try and you know I
get this I get the
the stakes are sort of high because we
grown-ups don't have a lot of vacation
time so do we really want them planning
all of our vacations maybe not but it's
a fun experiment to try at least what so
the question is does my book cover
university life I made a decision to
stop at roughly 16 or 17 because the
whole question of who pays for college
and how much and where has is so complex
and it's gotten so big that I actually
believe that it's the biggest financial
decision that anyone will ever make and
and the fact that teenagers are making
that decision is madness it's a real
problem so I'll have more to say about
that at some point in the near future
but the one thing I do address is that
because it is a really really big
decision and it's a really big number
the kids should have some skin in the
game and I profiled one family that sits
down with each and every 14-year old and
there have been four of them and says
okay you're going into high school now
you're probably gonna want to go to
college and you are going to pay for the
first semester of tuition and that has
added up to I think the last one paid
fifteen or sixteen thousand dollars to
go to Northwestern and we're gonna
support you we will wake up at five in
the morning before you have your
driver's license and take you to
whatever job you want to get you know
will help you with your resume well you
know we'll help you with your taxes but
you are going to earn this money and you
don't have a choice in the matter and
they scrubbed toilets and they scooped
ice cream and they umpired softball
games and when they were old enough they
worked as bar backs and got their
lifeguard credentials and they all did
it cuz it's just what they did and you
know and the kids all you know Harvard
Northwestern Stanford right I mean it's
you look these this is correlation right
but I think there's something to the
fact that you know a work ethic and
knowing what it means to work for
somebody other than your family who
doesn't you know doesn't give a lick
about you and it's not gonna cut you any
slack and will fire you if you show up
at 5:30 1:00 in the morning instead of
five-thirty you know this is all good I
think it can make College easier during
high school time yeah during the summer
too late Oh about my about college it
was on you right yeah right so yeah so
you're right uh-huh
yeah yeah no I totally understand so
your point about starting earlier with
the college talk in the college tuition
is is totally right this family that I
was talking about before they had saved
enough and done well enough that they
were gonna be able to pay for everything
else so the kids is the first semester
was on the kids but everything else the
parents were gonna be able to handle so
that not most families are not like that
and if your family is not like that you
know you need to say so or if you think
you're not gonna be like that you need
to tell them at the earliest possible
age we tell our daughter how much of
college we've managed to put aside every
six months when the statement comes we
say Thalia we've gotten to yeah I don't
even I don't remember what the number is
but we say you know we've got thirty two
percent finished now and we think by
next year we'll be a thirty six percent
and then when you go to college you know
you're gonna work and we're gonna work
and we're gonna you know not go on
vacation for four years and we're gonna
shovel even more money at it and then
you know maybe we'll have to pay some
loans back afterwards but you know this
is a really really large number now and
you know maybe we'll get some help and
maybe you'll qualify for some
but maybe you won't and you know I think
they they need to be aware of it I mean
look what's happened very quietly in a
way that nobody has noticed and I had
not noticed until somebody actually you
know sort of hit me over the head and
and told me a couple weeks ago they said
we've gone in America from a point where
there were only two things in our lives
that we paid for over decades right our
house if you have a mortgage and our
retirement which you save for over 40
years whatever to there being three
things that we pay for over decades
we've now added college to that mix just
a generation later right you spend 20
years saving for it and then if you've
got to borrow whether you're yanking
equity out of the house or taking a
parent a Parent PLUS loan or the kid is
taking on debt maybe they're
consolidating it eventually into a you
know another different kind of loan you
could be looking as a family at half a
century to pay for this bill which could
easily be over a quarter of a million
dollars in today's dollars per family
it's a lot of money it's a big deal and
it is a real problem
stay tuned oh you and then you okay yeah
all right yeah I you know I don't go
there all that much with kids although
you know when they ask about social
class right you know it's it's hard not
to have a larger discussion with them
about okay well how did why is it that
some people earn so much more than other
people and shouldn't we be doing
something to make it more equal you know
what what what's the government version
of a share machine and you know the
share machine question was answered by
the kid in the next picture who you know
didn't want to pay the higher taxes and
so I mean it's they get it right these
are these were five-year-olds who drew
those pictures and what the
macroeconomic reasons that I'm so
passionate about this is I mean the
college is just the start of it right
they are going
you graduate into a world where more and
more responsibility and risk has been
heaped upon them at the age of 22 we are
all essentially responsible for our own
retirements now although we might work
for the New York Times or Microsoft
where we get some stock or we get a
match but even so we've got to put money
in in order to get whatever we get we
are legally required to buy health
insurance now which is a pretty big deal
particularly if you don't work for an
employer that just hands you a form and
asks you to check a box right so kids
are gonna have to do that and you know
there are enough hiccups in the economy
we've seen just in the last 20 years
that it's clear now that you know it's
it's it's essential to win your 20s
right you've got all this responsibility
you can't wait to get your act together
until you're in your 30s or 40s because
there just won't be enough time to save
I mean you'll literally work the entire
rest of your life so they have to be
ready for that and you know and it
doesn't end there I mean I don't want to
depress you these are not insurmountable
challenges right but you know I mean you
mentioned politicians right so I mean I
think it's becoming increasingly clear
to all of us that we have not taxed
ourselves enough to pay for all of the
promises that we have made to one
another whether it's municipal or state
pensions whether it's Medicare you know
all the things that we would like to do
and in fact promises that we have made
we are now talking about breaking and so
it doesn't really matter where you are
on the political spectrum you may think
that the best solution to this problem
is to raise taxes more or you may think
the best solution to the problem is to
break the promises that we've made or
certainly not make any new ones and
slowly lower what the government
provides in which case people are
reaching into their own pockets more but
either way a couple of extra percentage
points of income are gonna be flying out
of our kids pockets and ours too I think
in the next 10 to 15 years so that we
don't break these promises or to pay
each of us for the cost of the fact that
they're being broken and so I mean this
is not doomsday stuff right it just
means that they have to be ready at the
earliest possible age to spend and save
in the wisest possible manner there's
just you know flitting around in your
twenties now I mean it's not an economic
death sentence right but it just puts
you so far behind the eight-ball that
you're I think it's almost indisputably
the case that you know your life may not
be as good as it would be as if you
started earlier and so that's the reason
to have these conversations you know for
a decade or more before we shove them
off to college or whatever they're going
to do yeah how often are they hanging
out with the grandparents they live here
and is it there they're literally
calling them up every week and asking
for things and then they get them or
okay yeah sure right yep yeah so the
question is you know what to do about
grandparents and the grandparent menace
so yeah I originally thought that I was
gonna write a whole chapter about this
but I I was actually I actually decided
that I was wrong and unless there is you
know kind of a dire situation where they
are both you know maybe living with you
and or your primary source of
afterschool childcare and they are sort
of deliberately subverting kind of
foundational rules that you've set then
I think it's probably okay I mean unless
you feel like they are kind of the first
kids to get every new thing in every
category and it's kind of out of control
and they're becoming so used to the
grandparents saying yes they're becoming
materialistic that they're valuing stuff
over people in relationships they
probably let it go right because you're
their parents they live with you they're
going to pick up your
values more than they're gonna pick up
their grandparents values and not only
do we want them to love the grandparents
we want them to want to go to the
grandparents so that you know we can
have a little time to ourselves so I
think unless it's completely out of hand
you know I wouldn't try to nip it in bud
yeah and look you know every family has
their own list of banned items and I
think there you draw the line and you
know for me it was that leather
miniskirt right you know for you it may
be you know guns or or whether you know
a gun like Jeff like Zeb had or you know
fake guns
it may be pierced enables it may be
push-up bras it may be dogs right I mean
if the you know the grandparents show up
with a puppy and they haven't asked you
yet you know could be end days for
everybody right so you know make it
clear what's on your band item list you
know I it hadn't occurred to me to put
leather skirts on the band item list for
three-year-olds but but still you know
you're in charge and you know it all
goes back if you don't like it and
nobody else has to like it but you know
it's on you all right one more here in
the front sure so the question was if
you're choosing between private and
public school and let's say you make the
choice for private school how do you
explain it it's two stories about that
one I heard just a couple of weeks ago
from a parent who told me that she sits
down with her five-year-old in her
seven-year-old every month and they sit
down in front of the you know the
computer and they dial up the website
for the school and she has the kids push
the button on the mouse to move the
money from the checking account to the
school so that they know and then I
heard a story from a Brooklyn family a
couple years ago who told me that their
daughter who was 10 years old had
discovered the bill for the private
school
and she said I didn't know you were
paying for this so the parents clearly
were they embarrassed by it did they not
want her asking uncomfortable questions
about why you you know pay for our
school and there's a perfectly good
public school nearby you know because
then we start getting into the whole
question of why do families make
different choices and that can be an
uncomfortable question to ask without
you know devaluing the schools in your
community or without kind of
inadvertently or or indirectly
criticizing the choices of other parents
or other parents who may not be able to
make that choice because they can't
write the checks or they can't qualify
for financial aid for whatever reason or
because they didn't want to make the
sacrifices that you have made and so you
know you try not to criticize other
people's decision-making or other
people's schools and you can just say
something like this you know this was
the choice that was best for us and it
was best for you and we like what the
school stands for because you know we
like the values that you're learning and
we like the fact that you have these
musical instruments or that you you know
have two teachers in your classroom
instead of one that doesn't make it
better than any other school in general
it just makes it better for you and we
sacrifice to do this and it's almost
always a sacrifice because you know if
you're writing a thirty or thirty-five
thousand dollar check that could
certainly go to charity right if it
wasn't going to private school tuition
so there is a sacrifice being made
you're being less generous or you have a
smaller house or you take fewer
vacations but you know you said this was
a choice that we made because we felt
like this was the way to spend the money
that would give us the most happiness
because you would have a really happy
experience in school and we really want
you to be happy and so that's why we did
what we did but that doesn't mean that
your friends you know made a wrong
choice they just made a different one or
one that was right for them as it sound
was also in terms of they go into school
and oh okay so it's the compare you're
asking about the comparison stuff - yeah
I mean look that's that's hard
particularly in communities where there
are people with a lot of money and you
know again this is one of the situations
where they don't have to like the answer
and we may feel defensive about it -
because what they're saying is you know
I mean around here the diversion that
question is why didn't you start a
company instead of just working for one
right I mean a bratty 13 or 14 year old
might stick you with that right and you
know and it feels like an indictment of
the choice that you've made or of your
own enterprise or or you know sort of
smarts all right so you're gonna take a
deep breath you know again it's
perfectly reasonable for them to ask
these questions and then you just try
and explain to them look you know there
are not very many people in the world
who can do all of those amazing things
that you know you seem to want to do
yourself you know we we are not one of
them right now
you have the ability to go out and earn
more and become one but hopefully if
you're doing the gratitude rituals all
along they have a sense not only of what
they do have but also the special things
that make your family unique and you
want to emphasize those whether it's a
you know a hardscrabble you know
immigrant tale a you know surviving you
know a noxious man with a mustache you
wanted to wipe your people off the
planet right you know we all have these
stories or we all have our own existing
rituals that make us unique the way that
we give together or the places that we
go the things that we do you know all
those things directly or indirectly
involve money and so you know you have
your own unique way of being in the
world and you try when there you know
feeling a little bit less or lesser to
remind them that there's some things
that are really awesome about your
family - so I think that's it thank you
so much for coming I'll hang around
answer questions sign books and oh one
other thing I should tell you I've done
a partnership with DonorsChoose as part
of this book launch it's a nonprofit
that some of the humane
that allows you to direct your giving to
teachers who post projects online for
which they want funding for their public
school classrooms it's a particularly
great way for kids to give because they
get to see exactly where the money is
going you can literally go on and say I
like even say tie-dye you know my
daughter loved tie-dye a couple years
ago we found three tie-dye projects all
over the country we drop some money in
one of the buckets and two months later
we got this envelope in the mail with
you know 22 thank-you notes and all
these pictures of kids in their tie-dye
shirts that my daughter had helped pay
for so anyway with each book that you
buy you get a twenty seven dollar
DonorsChoose gift card to use with your
kids or by yourself you don't want to
share it online and thanks for being
there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
