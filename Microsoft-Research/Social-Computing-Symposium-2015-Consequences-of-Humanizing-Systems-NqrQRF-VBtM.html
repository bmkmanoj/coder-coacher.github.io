you
okay so we are the last session of this
year's social computing symposium so
happy that all of you guys are here by
the way this is something this is an
event that I've enjoyed being at I've
been lucky to be here I think for the
past like nine sessions at nine years
and it's been so awesome every year and
sort of like energizes me and I think
it's like full circle Tom coats who's
speaking on this session was the person
who invited me to the first one in 2008
or 2007 so anywho we've been talking
about different aspects of humans and
technology today in particular crowd
sourcing and crowd workers and this
session is about the consequences of
humanizing systems so you know everyday
technology can do the notion is that
everyday technology can do more for us
so that we can spend more time on the
things that we want to spend time on are
the things that matter the most and I
think one of the questions around the
notion of humanizing technology or
technological systems is what does it
take for us as users to give permission
to these technologies to listen to think
to act on behalf of us whether it's
active or passive or hybrid and
designers are constantly kind of
exploring ways to integrate human social
cues and human behavior into the
interfaces and interaction systems that
were that we're using both on hardware
and software and to make it feel more
natural so that's you know this is led
to things like you know talking plans
like botanic halls or toms talking house
which will probably hear about house of
codes or that time that to bots we're
talking on twitter and the bank of
america but it in our self-aware street
signs which we'll see in a little bit or
an autistic boy becoming bffs with Siri
and i think that there's a lot of
opportunities and challenges and so
hopefully we're going to get into some
of the meat of that space today so we'll
cover these are the four fantastic
humans who are joining us
day and I'll get out of their way very
shortly I'll give their individual
introductions as they come up to give
their talks but quickly that's Julian
Bleeker in the upper corner Katherine is
mr. Tom coats and Darius Kazemi and I
will cover things like sociality and
chat BOTS and systems that are designed
to be our slaves or assistance and think
about issues of intimacy and cognitive
overhead and noise so Katherine isbister
will talk a little bit about using a
motion for designing interaction with
examples from her forthcoming book that
spans games and wearables Tom coats is
going to talk about objects that act
like people and personalities and and
what that's all about Darius is going to
talk about his experience creating bots
and the bots summit and Julian bleecker
is going to talk about this area in
terms of design fiction so imagining and
representing humanized technology not in
product requirements or specifications
but as a thing on somebody's kitchen
counter or what an ad for that is I'm
really trying to get into the meat of
what that experience is like and then
we're going to do break out so we're
going to hear from each person for about
circa 15 to 30 minutes depending on the
human and then maybe have a few
questions one question per person I
think and then we'll do 40 minutes or so
breakouts and we're going to come back
here and the sesh the breakout session
leaders will give you a quick synopsis
of what came out of those sessions and
so just to give you a quick quick sense
of why I care about some of this stuff
this is a recent project that i did with
jenny rodent house and which is called
here here in New York City and it turned
it used 311 complaint data to
procedurally generate with a with a
personality or a perspective from a
particular neighborhood in New York City
and behind that you know really is is
something called the sentient data
system or server and the idea with this
who I worked on with Lars Leiden who's
in this room and the idea here was to
challenge designers and developers to
think of data in terms of relationships
personnel
an emotion so really taking complex real
time or network data streams process it
through the sentient data server and
have human readable output and then i
just thought i'd show you really quickly
this is a two-minute video i just wanted
to show you some student projects that
came out of it from a research and
prototyping group that i ran at ITP sam
Slover who's here he's a research
assistant one of his projects is in that
class I think it's the first one so
hopefully this little video will play
let's see yeah my audio is not on which
kind of sucks can you guys do anything
about that dang my pc audio alright well
the first thing that you saw was a
self-aware street sign that was using
like a human face and positive feedback
to talk to let me pause this and just
tell you what these projects are or not
here we'll just skip ahead so this was a
self-aware street sign where it's
telling you to stop jaywalking so they
were looking at what's happening locally
on the street and then giving real-time
feedback to passersby is to help connect
them to their environment and there was
a little button you could press for
positive feedback as well but it can't
brings up issues of pedestrian
permissions privacy issues and kind of
meaningful social etiquette so the video
that you're not seeing is actually all
very positive experiences and these
slides after I'm just going to kind of
call out some of the the challenges that
emerged from those interactions systems
this was a dynamic map that would kind
of hide or expand the size of
neighborhoods in New York City based on
3 13 11 complaint data and that was
meant to express shame or pride and that
brings up issues of like who defines
shame and what is shame and 311 data as
a data set does everybody in this room
know what that is 311 okay um you know
it's subjective so it's it's not like
ground truth so there's there's that and
then oversimplification and more privacy
concerns this was a system that used
emotion as a way to abstract a user
state to tell third party services went
when and where on the social stack to
reach them so it might say that you're
feeling down
or something based on your calendar data
your Fitbit data and your location
information as a way to tell a
third-party service where when and how
to reach a user like via text message or
email or phone call or what have you but
it brings up issues of like how do you
debug a system like that and what does
it mean to silent systems without Mike
without a user's knowledge and this is
from a reactive room that was looking at
noise levels and human presence in a
room and based on it was it was meant to
encourage collaboration so when there
were a certain number of people threat
that a threshold that was reached and
individuals are being too loud the room
itself would shush would introduce white
noise to kind of like quiet down the
space it also had screens to kind of
like encourage dynamic participation but
that brings up issues of data management
of audio and this constant shushing and
agitating and who sets the permissions
for the room and this last one which is
a shame you're not seeing these were
self-aware bikes that were network to
the city bike system in New York City
and they used a tail mechanism to
express their kind of emotional state
and they were optimized to get you to
move the bikes to the different hubs in
the city that we're missing bikes but it
might be the second time you're using
them or the first time you're using them
so their tails my way to express
happiness or alarm or that sort of thing
and they played music based on their
emotional state and would sync up when
they were next to people but it brings
up the issue of complexity and overload
and noise and again what's the social
etiquette and so there's a bunch of
these projects that are being explored
by students this is a project coming out
of Microsoft right now that I'm headed
to China to check out tomorrow called
Xiao Weis this is a chat bot and that's
strangely incredibly popular right now
in China and it does things like count
sheep with you to help you go to sleep
just like says one sheep baa you say two
and then it says three or it'll identify
species of dogs based on pictures and
and people have been interviewing it so
with that said just so you have a sense
of where I'm coming from with this I'd
like to welcome Catherine isbister who's
going to be our first speaker and
Catherine is an associate professor
jointly appointed between New York
University's
engineering computer science program and
NYU's Game Center in tisch school of the
arts she's a director of the game
innovation lab where her team creates
research games with support from the NSF
and Microsoft and bell labs and other
funders her projects have been featured
in wired and scientific american and on
NPR as well and she's an early recipient
of the MIT Technology Review young
innovators award and is a humble
experienced research fellow she's
currently on sabbatical as a fellow at
Stanford's cabs Center Catherine okay so
I'm going to talk about playful
relations with machines and as Katie
mentioned I direct this game innovation
lab I'll give you some pictures of that
so this is a place that's housed in
Brooklyn at the NYU School of
Engineering and the purpose of the place
is really focusing on the engineering
and computer science side of game
development but with an eye toward
partnering with all the amazing people
then why use such as those at the NYU
game center where I'm jointly appointed
looking at essentially where technology
and experience get together in games but
when Katie contacted me about this panel
I was super excited because it took me
sort of back in the Wayback Machine to
what I was doing before I was working
with games some of you may recognize
hypercard this is a really old
interactive prototyping tool so actually
did my PhD thesis on humanizing
technology and I worked with a guy named
cliff Nass who some of you might
remember his name he and his colleague
Byron Reeves wrote a book called the
media equation which was basically they
did a series of studies that showed that
people would treat technology as if it
was human and very amusing way sometimes
simply by virtue of the computer acting
as if it was human so a classic example
is if a computer did a favor for you
basically helped you out during the
course of a training you were going
through after you went through the
training if you were asked by that
computer to do a favor for it which was
basically color correcting a series of
colors because it was trying to fix its
monitor you would help that computer
much more than you would
help a second computer who asked you to
do a favor while you were evaluating so
just really silly stuff so so my thesis
was actually about body language so it
wasn't about verbal communication it was
about nonverbal communication and you
had to do this desert survival task with
this character where you chose which
things that you fell out of an airplane
into the desert and you're trying to
survive which things should you rank the
highest so it turns out if the character
is sending you inconsistent nonverbal
cues about itself about its personality
you distrust its advice which is kind of
ridiculous when you think about it was
something as as poor as this but
nonetheless which is true so I was super
excited about all this and I you know I
went off to go to a postdoc in Japan
doing some more work on this and then
this thing happened which people who are
older in the room probably remember that
Microsoft Office had this paper clip and
a paper clip is long gone but my advisor
had actually worked on this project and
the idea was there would be this helpful
agent who would come in and assist you
in doing things and it turned out people
really really hated it and mocked it and
made fun of it and it became this thing
and so every time I would tell anybody
about my research and what I was doing
there was oh god you mean like that
paper clip and I thought wow my career
is over before it's even started you
know how am I going to work on
intelligent interfaces when no one wants
to actually see them or deal with them
so there I was in Japan kind of mulling
this over and meanwhile my boyfriend
bought me this PlayStation console
because I had seen this game that I
really wanted to play so has anybody
ever played proper the rapper a few
people okay this was actually the very
first rhythm game it's totally fun and
its really really easy so if you are not
a good twitch gamer you can still play
this game anyway so you're basically
this earnest little dog and you're
trying to like succeed in life and get
the girl and whatever and so you have to
do all these tasks and the way you do
them is you you play this rhythm game
and I was completely charmed by this
game and as I was playing it I suddenly
realized wait a minute video games have
characters all over them and people love
it so obviously there's something
problematic in the way that we're
tackling you know these characters in
the workspace I don't think I need to
abandon this work I should figure out
what's going on and
do games and why characters and and
anthropomorphizing is acceptable in this
domain and I realized that actually if
you go back historically games have
always had little creatures little
characters in them since the beginning
days and when I was young I used to play
centipede and I was thinking about that
and I was thinking oh well you know
partly why I like centipede is because I
felt okay about killing bugs which you
know if you're Buddhist you would
disagree with me on that one but as a
kid I you know I wasn't comfortable
killing other things in a video game but
I was okay with killing the these kinds
of characters so I thought all right you
know obviously there's something to this
this is this is a consistent part of
video games and I'm going to figure out
what games are doing well so I can
resurrect my research area and I
literally spent several years working on
this and actually I taught a class at
Stanford for a while on game character
design and it resulted in a book about
what game developers were doing really
well in terms of game character design
and since I had been trained in a social
science department most of the lens
through which I was looking at an
understanding it was that the best game
characters were very artfully using
things about how people read nonverbal
signals about how people sighs up one
another about how we do social dances
with each other through things like
social roles and I basically put that
information into a book mostly actually
for active practitioners so there's
there's too much material in that book
to actually convey to you all in this
talk I wanted to share a couple of
things high level insights that I had
because I see that the space is sort of
heating up again one of the things I
realized about the failure of the paper
clip to excite people was that at that
time and I think this has changed now
computers were primarily work machines
that were were situated in work and
there were you know there were laptops
and such but everyone expected the
computer to be a very quiet focused
space for themselves they were not used
to receiving resistance and
socialization from the computer so that
in and of itself was completely
disturbing whereas firing up a video
game from the beginning you would expect
oh okay surprising things could happen
this
be social it will be interesting this is
actually a picture of my daughter and
her friends who made up a game with a
hula-hoop of just running around all
together and falling down in the loop so
just to sort of you know represent the
chaos that one expects in video games so
part of it was just context another part
of it was context in a different sense
which is that what I realized in
thinking about Parappa versus this clip
e on the desktop was the desktop
metaphor gives you very little
information for poor Clippy to use about
what a person's goals are what their
intentions are and what's happening next
for them and kind of the heroic arc of
their daily experience with their
computer whereas video games are
conceived from the beginning as these
whole spaces with a narrative arc and
the designer is controlling everything
about the experience so it's really easy
for the designer to know that oh wow I'm
trying to get my driver's license in the
game I'm very excited about it and to
give me emotional payoff with really
interesting funny things that the
character does to me whereas Clippy was
was a sort of reduced to saying hey
looks like you're trying to write a
letter because that's about the only
thing that he could guess about you so
it's no great surprise that it was
pretty frustrating probably you know if
Clippy could be frustrated he would have
been profoundly frustrated probably by
that and I was thinking about that
mansplaining talk and thinking that
Clippy kind of was doing mansplaining in
a funny way when he would say looks like
you're trying to write a letter because
of course you were trying to let write a
letter it was very annoying anyway so so
I guess what I'm trying to say as I
realized games know the goals you're
working toward they drive you toward the
goals you're working toward and a lot of
human emotion and connection actually
comes out of working toward goals so
knowing about that makes a big
difference in creating a really
compelling experience with the
technology that's trying to relate to
you in a human and social way so when I
was doing this project I also did some
massive surveys of people you know
gamers and game developers about well it
would have been emotional moments for
you and gaming would have been times
where you felt really profoundly have
you ever cried there's this whole sort
of trophy did you ever you know kind of
game make you cry that electronic arts
was had
it's about years ago and funny enough
one of the games that came up again and
in was actually a text-based adventure
called planetfall anybody here played it
it's pretty old okay a few people have
so anyway it's a very funny game and you
have this this very silly robot named
Floyd that you meet up with in the game
and who persists and goes along with you
to accomplish these missions and then
this is a spoiler so you know close your
ears if you think you're going to go
play this game but at a certain point
Floyd basically sacrifices himself for
you he realizes that in order to get to
the final stage of the game you're going
to have to get something and so he just
sort of throws himself into the task and
you know when he sacrifices himself you
end up your character singing the song
to him and it's very poignant and
apparently this just made people burst
into tears and I think part of it was
the character's personality but also the
sheer persistence of activity in the
game I've been playing this game for
hours I've been hanging out essentially
with this character for hours and now
he's done something that's deeply
meaningful for me in the game and it's a
genuine loss i know i'm not going to get
him back and that was true of other
emotional moments that people shared
with video games so that that's kind of
amazing thing to do with a game that is
only text based and only lasts for a few
hours ok so um flashing forward a few
years right now as Katie said I'm on
sabbatical at Stanford and I've been
working on this book one of the things
I'm working on is the book for MIT press
which is essentially trying to take some
of the things that so my first book was
for game developers this book is
actually for the general public to help
people understand what is it the games
are doing to affect people emotionally
there are actually very very profound
design moves that have been made that
are that are shaping where media
technology can go and and i think this
notion of forging a relationship over
time that has little emotional nuances
and ticks in it is a very deep one so
has anybody seen japanese dating sims a
couple of people not so many people okay
so so this is a genre of game that's
mostly popular in Japan
and some of them are erotic and
pornographic but actually not all of
them are some of them are really sweet
and this is an example of that sort of
genre and basically what you do is you
you spend days and days in this game
well first there you know three or four
different people usually women that
you're picking to decide to court
because you would like to go out with
them and then you spend a hundred days
in the game making little moves like
offering to carry their books you know
like getting to know their brother like
you know learning about their hobbies
and also building up your skills and
abilities and then at a certain point
you may be lucky enough that one of
these characters and you have to pick
one to really focus on decides that they
want to go out with you and then after
that you're actually going on dates and
you're sort of getting to know them and
you're getting to know their intimate
little habits and funny routines and so
on and so forth it's a really sweet kind
of interaction to have with a fictional
character I mean in some sense it's it
reminds me of people reading romance
novels but in the case of these dating
Sims you're actually interacting and
forging this strong connection with this
character through your own actions and
Hank literally hanging out together so
there was actually a guy from Japan that
that staged a wedding to his character
in Guam this is in 2009 and I don't
think that he you know really you know
thinks it's a real marriage but it sort
of highlighted the fact that people
really enjoy these relationships and
some of the players who talk about these
games say that it feels better to play a
dating sim than to actually try to date
women because in the dating stem I know
if I follow the rules and if I do things
properly eventually I'm going to be
rewarded and for somebody who's having
trouble amassed during those social
skills that could actually be an
enjoyable way to practice and also could
potentially become a kind of disturbing
safe space to be in right so have you
seen this movie her yes right so we said
we keep revisiting the same
I mean Blade Runner is an older version
of this and for me I think that
cultivating pseudo relationships with
things can be really compelling when it
gets someone to ruminate on themselves
and how they relate to others and maybe
be moved by that to engage with other
people I think it can also be kind of a
disturbing wandering off into the weeds
so to speak and and and I think that's
true of any powerful mediated experience
so personally I took a turn after diving
so deeply into the pseudo social react
relationships toward thinking about well
how could i use characters and such to
to to advance relationships between
people so not making them the center of
attention I did a really strange project
when I was when I was at that lab in
Japan where I had a character inter
mediate conversation between people and
what it would do was in the strange
little online environment and when there
was a silence it would come up and offer
a topic of conversation so I've made two
versions one version would offer really
safe topics to talk about but the other
version would intentionally offer very
provocative topics so this was meant to
help conversations between English and
Japanese speaking students and they were
you know Japanese students were learning
English so some of the topics would be
things like is it okay to fish for and
kill whales which people felt very
differently in both cultures so it turns
out that when the character would say
something really awkward like that
people loved it they love scapegoating
and blaming the character and they felt
much closer to each other and so they
were essentially using the character as
a vehicle through which to become closer
to each other and I thought you know I
really like that I think it's good to
make the character it's good to make the
technology really serve human
relationships so in the last few years
I've been building games mostly in the
physical world so not entirely digital
world and trying to enhance human
relationships through the way that the
technology intervenes basically making
them sensitive to social signals so I'm
going to tell you about
of them very briefly one is called yah
move and it's a dance battle game that
uses mobile phones and I got a little
funding for it from Elizabeth when she
was back at Yahoo just super so so this
game is basically working with the fact
that movement builds connection and at
least in the u.s. we sometimes use that
fact by having people do dances at
weddings and such to build community
between folks so what we did was we took
b-boy dance battles as a metaphor and I
don't know if people have seen these
before probably not many people have
been to in life but what happens is
there's a group of people in a circle
and then dancers get up and they dance
sometimes their teams of dancers
sometimes of individuals and they do
these crazy dance moves and then there's
some judging that goes on it's all
pretty you know secret and kind of
informal it's not always there you know
what the criteria are but anyways
somebody wins somebody wins a dance
battle so we basically took this
metaphor and we took mobile phones and
we strap them to people's wrists and we
created partner dance battles so you and
your partner would dance and sync
against another pair that was dancing in
sync and so the computer is basically
the arbiter of being in sync so it's
just trying to create human connection
between the players as they focus on one
another while they're dancing has
anybody play dance central anything like
that okay a lot of people so normally
when you play dance games on the
computer you're staring at the screen
because you're copying the moves of
dancers on the screen with this game the
attention is on the other dancer and the
whole point is to build connection
between the dancers so let me show you a
little video of the game so this is that
indicate which is a big independent game
festival
and basically people can make up any
moves they wanted so you know two teams
dancing against each other each team
could make up any set of moves they
wanted during each round and what would
happen is people would have to pay
really close attention to each other
decide what moves they could do well
usually quickly one or the other person
would start to lead and you know they
kind of figure out who was comfortable
leading and have a really great time
with improvising and since the algorithm
was just looking for synchrony and
mixing it up and keeping the pace up you
could have very different levels of
dance ability going on between the two
teams and between the two dancers and
you can still have interesting results
so we had everything from people who are
expert dancers wandering through to like
soccer moms and their kids and everyone
had a really good time with it and you
know unlike playing something like an
central where everyone typically is up
staring the screen both players and the
spectators because there's so much going
on and you're trying to follow it with
this game people are all looking at the
dancers so this is one example of using
a sensing technology to track on
something that can change a social
dynamic that benefits relationship that
make sense okay so super brief on the
other project this one is a
collaboration with an artist whose
artisan residence in my lab and she was
really interested in how people take on
alternate personas within video games
and whether we could take that out of
the screen and into interaction so she
was really inspired by things like
common writers which is these 70s TV
characters that would transform through
strange gestures and become superheroes
and she wanted to see if she could
create a game in which you would have
wearable elements and have to
collaborate with someone and transform
yourself through this collaboration so
she sketched up some ideas and she
created these these wearables that you
can put on and this is the this is the
gauntlet and then there's also a
backpack and so essentially the way you
play the game is you you the person with
the backpack has to collect energy by
doing movements and then hold hands with
the person who is wearing the gauntlet
who then aims the
let to fire at things so it's a deeply
collaborative game and I'll just show
you briefly a little video of this so we
we were testing we were play testing
this at at IBM which is a gallery in New
York and a bunch of people brought their
kids which was kind of funny so it
wasn't intended to be a kids game but
it's sort of a sort of took over and you
can see when you rub your hands together
the backpack fills up and then they run
over and hold hands and so one of the
kids there was my daughter actually and
when she was playing the game and
holding the hand of this boy who she was
playing with apparently some kind of
transformation happened to her because
as we were walking home after the play
test she said mommy I think I kind of
think that boy is cute and I was like
cuz she was like 7 years old I'm like oh
my god you know and I sort of realized
it was this you know the physical act of
holding hands actually changed how she
felt maybe even for the first time in
her life so I mean on a certain level
it's disturbing as a parent but it's
also really powerful and it has to do
with that just taking technology and
using it to to empower that relationship
instead of making everyone stare at the
screen so so i guess i would conclude by
saying i've sort of moved from trying to
create technologies that draw a lot of
attention to themselves and provoke a
pseudo human relation with you two
making technologies that artfully
humanize relations between people so
that's it thank you
