thanks so much for coming my name is Amy
Draves and I'm really pleased today to
welcome the founder of Seattle's own
theo chocolate Joe Winnie and his lead
chocolate here Steve popplewell to the
Microsoft Research visiting speaker
series they are here to discuss the
company in their recent cookbook it's a
fascinating story of how North Americans
north america's first organic and fair
trade chocolate factory came to be and
why they're so passionate about how
their chocolate is made please join me
in giving him a very warm welcome hi can
you can hear me okay um so welcome and
thank you so much for having us my name
is joe and i'm the founder of theo and
i'm going to tell you a few stories
about the company and starting the
company and steve is hourly trucks here
Steve makes so did you get to have some
chocolate before the before the event
okay so those are all Steve's creations
and while while I'm chatting a little
bit Steve's going to start cooking and
making some ganache and move on to hand
dipping chocolate that will also get to
eat and he'll be telling you and
explaining to you what he's doing as
well but during our talk and chocolate
making presentation if you have any
questions please ask we love
conversation and much rather with a
group this size being dialogue with you
then just stand up here and talk about
chocolate the entire time so if you have
questions just let me know so how many
people have been to Theo before that's
wow thank you thank you very much I
guess I can't make anything up then the
so and have you taken the factory tour
awesome that's great thank you for doing
that you know I got into chocolate a
little more than 25 years ago and I was
I think good i went to high school I
dropped out of senior class president
I'm
didn't go to college and decided I
wanted to have an adventure and so I
bought a beat-up old sailboat with a
friend of mine and went sailing I'm
headed for the seven coast of baileys
because this is in the late 80s Early
90s at the time it was very very remote
and has the second largest Barrier Reef
in the world with the mountains its
tropical rain forests mountains come
right down to the ocean and I thought
this would be an amazing place to have
an adventure so off we went and after
sailing around the islands and the boat
had no motor no electronics we're
literally navigating by the stars as
best as we could I'm the fact that we
lived through all of that was really the
feet of that time in my life but I fell
in love with that part of the world and
so I volunteered for a small
conservation foundation that was doing
two things they were collecting plants
from that part of the rain forest
because it was threatened by logging
concessions and the foundation was also
working with indigenous Mayans
understanding how they were interacting
with their environment and positive
positive ways truly sustainable because
they at that time these the communities
in southern baileys were primarily
subsistence and I just had a strong back
and I wanted to volunteer and I wanted
to give back so my very first job they
handed me this rice old rice sack that
had a car seat both you know remember
the kind of you have to sort of put
around your waist as shoulder straps in
the shotgun and said go with these guys
and help them harvest their cocoa now I
grew up in Northeast Philly and you know
I I thought I mean maybe cocoa or
chocolate came from Switzerland maybe I
know that I stole it from my brother on
Halloween and it was brown and cheap and
sweet and I loved it so they came the
shotgun I thought what do I do do I
shoot the cocoa I mean how is this
really going to work so off I went and
for those of you anybody been to a cocoa
farm or a place like that before so Coco
is a really beautiful tree it's
typically about the size of an apple
tree if you can imagine that and the
pods which are like small footballs sort
of a cross between a small football and
a pumpkin
gord if you did the factory tour you
might have seen some they grow right off
the the trunk of the tree and and
they're an understory crop in the
rainforest and so they really do well
with a high canopy above them and these
cocoa farms that I was on at the time
were well over a hundred years old which
is unique in in modern agriculture with
this large canopy tree and these these
rainforest trees with giant buttresses
it was a little bit like out of dr.
Seuss and so as a kid with no experience
before having no real experience in
certainly in rainforest and harvesting
cocoa I my mind was blown and my job was
to pick up the pods after they were cut
from the tree so the farmers would go
around with a pole that had a long knife
on it to cut the pods off and was pretty
hilly and the pods would just roll
everywhere so I was running around as
fast as i could to gather up these pods
and I went to reach for one and there
was this huge snake that just went right
by where my hand was and I was just
curious and I asked the foreman of the
crew this guy choppiness atropine what
kind of snake is this and he just was
like a cartoon is like eyes got huge
like get the gun boy get the gun I was
like oh ok now i know what the gun was
for finally and it was it turned out it
was a fair to lance or what's called a
yellow jaw which is one of the most
dangerous snakes in in Central America
because it's venomous but it's uh it
hunts in pairs its territorial and it's
very aggressive most snakes that I've
encountered in the rainforest and I've
traveled throughout Latin America and
Africa they don't care about you these
snakes are very aggressive so um so
harvesting cocoa turned into this
venture and I had no idea what what
really went into a chocolate bar at this
time the economic reality of the farmers
was was increasingly poor over the
course of three years of doing this work
as a cash economy encroached what I saw
were these same farmers who were
subsistence and knew how to work with
their environment incredibly positive
ways were starting to make decisions
that were not in the interest of their
landscape but certainly interesting
much cash as quickly as they could and
those decisions had a negative impact
that was amazing to see and so I thought
well if they could just make a little
bit more money for their crop and and
grow it in a sustainable way then they
could afford health care for their
family they could afford the school fees
that they now had the environment would
be healthy everything would be fine and
this was around 1991-92 and at the time
the entire organic food market was about
a billion dollars and I thought well
that's huge everyone's going to want
organic chocolate and so at that so I
contacted all the chocolate
manufacturers one of them said were
interested I brought in the first
container of organic cocoa beans into
the North American 1994 and through the
90s grew this business by developing raw
material supply of cocoa beans and
selling chocolate to other brands like
Newman's Own cascadian farm and Whole
Foods in a wide variety of others by the
way Steve how are we doing oh good yeah
what will you be doing first I'm just
curious I'm gonna demonstrate how to
make a mint ganache and then had a hand
dip them in chocolate and we're gonna
eat those right we're gonna eat him all
right now okay you can try hand dipping
if you want Oh Oh everybody gets to try
that if they want to if they want to all
right why not so so after doing this for
several years of developing the organic
market in North America it was clear to
me that in order to deliver on the
mission that I had which was to bring
value back to farmers so that they could
invest in their landscapes while feeding
their families and having a high quality
of life I needed to build a brand that
was and also had Vertical manufacturing
so that we can keep more of the margin
and that margin goes into our raw
material price obviously compensating
the farmers well and that's where Theo
came from so in 2004 Debra and I and if
for those of you that have the book or
read the book there's a little bit of
our story in the beginning it's he said
she said her she said he said Deborah
who couldn't make it today and she is
sorry she wasn't feeling well Deborah is
my ex-wife and we split up before moving
out he
from these coasts and Sophie Oh
sometimes is a little bit like a reality
TV show but we were obviously meant to
be together just not as a married couple
and so we work through a lot of things
personally to work together because
Deborah is an incredible incredible
person and really responsible for so
much of the success that we've had and
so in that book we tell the story about
the what we went through to sort of our
paths kind of joining and then moving to
Seattle to create to create Theo and as
mentioned at the beginning we are the
first organic and fair trade chocolate
maker being tabar in the country and
this concept of being debar is kind of
important to us it's used often time to
sort of describe chocolate make or
manufacturer who really is handling the
raw material so that you can trust where
that's coming from for us that model is
important because of the economics of it
right I mean for those of you that have
an interest in food economics or
sustainable agriculture really the
driver for the decisions that farmers
make our is often the economic pressure
that they have the downward pressure on
price typically and if we have control
over that and we're in a better position
to create the change that we want to
create so fast forward 10 well to 2009
so we started in 2005 made our first
chocolate for sale in February of 2006
so it's our ten-year anniversary this
year which is one of the reasons why we
wanted to do the book and 2009 I made my
first trip to the eastern eastern Congo
eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and
for those of you that don't know eastern
Congo is a site of the worst
humanitarian tragedy since World War two
more than 5 million people killed
because of war and disease and it's
consistently at the bottom of economics
of any economic indicators it's one of
the worst countries to be in if you're a
woman rape is something that's used as a
form of intimidation and there's a lot
of challenges and you can imagine that
this is not a place that most businesses
will go and choose to do you know source
half of their raw material supply today
more than half of our cocoa is coming
from Eastern
go and the reason that eastern Congo is
so important to us not only the quality
of the cocoa fabulous but the impact
that we're having there is dramatic so
from our first visit in late two
thousand nine until today we're now
contracting for more than eight hundred
and fifty tons of cocoa a year which is
impacting more than 5,000 families and
you know fee oh it's it's interesting to
me and I realized I should step back
chocolate is for those of you that don't
know the supply chain of chocolate is
has been a very very difficult one for
most of the farmers growing cocoa and
you can tell what my orientation is I
mean I'm this is the world that I've
come from working in this environment
for more than 25 years but the the
economic devastation social devastation
that that the cocoa industry has had
especially on cocoa farmers in West
Africa is is so incongruous to me
because this is a raw material that's
used to make something that we share
with people we love right we give this
as a form of celebration it's one of the
most beautiful foods as Steve will be
demonstrating very shortly that that I
think is made on the planet today and I
believe and we believe a Theo that
everything that goes into that product
should have a positive impact that
everyone should be feeling the love all
the way through and so for us today to
have such success in eastern Congo is
really demonstration ultimately of what
it is that we set out to do to create
this change to have a vehicle where we
can engage consumers through a beautiful
product and at the end of the day I want
you to buy feel because you enjoy the
product and if you feel if it makes any
difference at all that you're having a
positive impact that's great but I want
you to buy it because it tastes it
tastes so good so to that end Steve do
you want to give us an update on where
you're at as Joe may have mentioned
before I'm demoing a ganache today so
what you just ate has two components it
has the filling which is the ganache and
the couverture is the coating the
chocolate coating the chocolate shell so
to make the interior of that of that
first you've got to decide what you want
to make it out of it
case we're doing mint so I just chopped
up some fresh mint leaf I steeped it in
some cream and honey here honey is a
great for a ganache you wouldn't want to
use a sugar or anything like that it'll
taste very granular so a nice invert
sugar like honey any kind of you can use
brown rice syrup ghahve anything like
that so I chopped the mint steeped it
for you steep it for about a half an
hour straighten the mint leaves out with
some kind of a you know a chinois or a
cheesecloth or whatever you have on hand
this is something you can do at home
with really rudimentary equipment as you
can see i don't even have electricity up
here so doing it old-school because i
just want to show you how simple it is
you use this in the book steve it sure
is yeah there there might be some
different equipment that's in the book
but this is like the most basic so now
that I've straightened out my mint
leaves I have mint flavored cream here
cream and honey I'm going to heat this
up to just a bare simmer okay the thing
about ganache is is to get your cream
too hot it's going to separate it's
gonna be a separated mess if anyone has
ever made a ganache because it has a lot
of butter as a lot of fat and all that
fat and butter doesn't like combining
with the chocolate it doesn't want to it
doesn't want to stay in place so the
butter will just kind of float to the
surface if you don't if you get your
cream too hot so if you're using a probe
thermometer 145 degrees is perfect you
can get your cream and honey to 145
degrees Fahrenheit as just hot enough to
melt out your chopped chocolate but not
so hot that it's going to throw it out
of temper okay that makes sense and I'll
go over what that means tempering if
anyone's not familiar with that term so
I've got it to about that I don't have a
thermometer up here but I'm gonna do it
like I said I'm gonna do it old school
just to a bare simmer if you don't have
a thermometer really easy pour it over
your chops chocolate this is actually
milk and dark chocolate it's us similar
to the recipe that's in the book ok I'm
going to stir that around I'm actually
going to whisk it now you can it's
actually a lot easier if you have a
really nice and held immersion blender
that you would use for salad dressing or
something like that this is kind of an
industrial one but
sell smaller ones that you can use if
anyone has any questions shout it out
totally fine but I'm going to use a
whisk you can do that too again not
using electricity today just going for
it so I'm just going to whisk that okay
and it looks like I'm you may not have
got my cream hot enough but that's
totally fine do a little trouble
shooting here so since I'm not using a
probe thermometer this is a thing that
you might run into because it you can
just dump a little back into your pot
and you may not even have to turn the
heat on okay you might just have enough
residual heat in your pot already the
temperature is very very very very
important when you're making ganache
it's the most important thing if your
temperature is too low you're going to
have issues if it's too hot you're going
to have separation issues this butter is
going to separate out the creams going
to separate it's going to look like a
strip broken mess like a salad dressing
when the oil and everything separates
out right it's kind of like that um so
I'm going to stir that around a little
bit get it nice and hot or warm I should
say so it's important to chop your
chocolate you need to have chocolate
that's small enough in size to melt out
otherwise you're going to have a ganache
with a bunch of chocolate chips in it
which might be fine if that's what
you're going for but not necessarily
okay there we go that looks good dump
this back in this is good
troubleshooting so if you get your
ganache too hot and it looks like a
separated mess just stick it in the
fridge for a little bit 10 minutes or so
let it relax or you can just let it sit
at room temperature let it come down and
then just keep whisking or immersion
blending works really well or if you
have a food processor you can put
chopped chocolate in your food processor
pour your cream into it blast it that's
actually the most effective way so you
can see my chocolate chunks are starting
to melt out very nice so this is the
ganache again this is going to be our
interior ok now I'm going to be hand
piping these guys
and then we're going to dip them okay
with our curvature with our with our
chocolate so this is a my little tub of
chocolate here I'm going to give you a
quick little demo on a tempering
chocolate and talk about that why that's
so important has anyone ever tempered
chocolate before or attempted to temper
chocolate yeah a successful layer yeah
awesome so a word about our chocolate we
are a you know a soy-free facility we
don't use any kind of binding agents in
our chocolates always typically used as
a binding agent to keep the cocoa butter
kind of locked in what's nice about our
chocolate is that people that think
they're allergic to chocolate or
sometimes just allergic to soy so they
can actually eat our chocolates kind of
hard to come by soy free chocolate is
kind of hard to come by but the upside
to you know the best thing about that is
you're getting pure chocolate you're not
getting any sort of chocolate that has
additives or anything like that so this
is looking pretty good i'm gonna start
adding my butter it's also important to
add butter this room temperature a
little melt out okay very important kind
of add it gradually now as you can see
here I have my pre piped truffles it's
beautiful see how they really hold their
shape they once the chocolate solidifies
once the chocolate kind of crystallizes
I mean you can handle them you can pick
them up they're not like the textures
were going to be really velvety and
smooth and you can handle them so these
are what we're gonna be dipping stir
that butter in I think it's still a
little too hot it's very thick but it
looks nice lovely I'm gonna get it just
a little warmer now this is risky
because you can also burn your ganache
very easily so be careful use medium
heat if you have to add a little bit
more ganache back into your pot be
careful be very careful just a little
bit steve is dark chocolate different to
handle than milk chocolate yeah so milk
chocolate if you're making a ganache
that's just milk chocolate the
consistency of your ganache is going to
be a little softer if you're using a
white chocolate it's gonna behave a
little differently
basically it's just all about
temperature if you are using say you're
using I don't know forty five percent
milk chocolate filling you're going to
make just a milk chocolate ganache the
temperature that you're going to take
your cream to is going to be a little a
little lower like 140 degrees instead of
145 because the the darker a Chuck the
chocolate is the higher the temperature
has to be in order for it to to melt to
come into temper so if you're using a
mixer like this this is about a two to
one I think to milk and dark so this
looks really good this looks like it's
come together so something to keep in
mind up the higher the percentage of
chocolate this is a seventy percent
chocolate the more natural cocoa butter
is considered there's going to be in
your chocolate okay so that's going to
affect texture that's going to affect
flavor it's going to affect the way the
chocolate behaves just pit especially
when you are tempering and so the
percentage when you see a percentage on
the cocoa yeah chocolate bar that is the
amount by weight of cocoa based products
in that so great combination was called
Coco master chocolate liqueur which is
roasted and ground cocoa beans I'm also
combined with cocoa butter some
manufacturers even put cocoa powder the
cocoa mass which is a roasted ground
cocoa beans what is half of that is fat
cocoa butter the other half is solid or
cocoa powder so you can separate the
solids and the fat that make cocoa
butter and cocoa powder so the higher
the percentage typically the more cocoa
butter and total would be in there
because of what's naturally occurring in
the mass as well as maybe some added
butter Yeah Yeah right and so like the
seventy percent for example that's
seventy percent the other percentage
would be like what refined sugar with a
milk chocolate our milk chocolates
actually a pretty dark milk chocolates
forty five percent so the other ratio of
ingredients is milk powder and sugar so
the higher the percentage the more
chocolate you're actually getting except
if that makes sense can anyone guess
what the percentage of white chocolate
is here go sharp well yeah
weigh in on that well there is this
interesting is if you include cocoa
butter then it could be as high as 30
year oh that's true higher that's true
white chocolate is cocoa butter sugar
and milk powder typically rate and so
that's why it starts together some
companies only used the cocoa bean the
full cocoa bean as a percentage others
include the the fat as well right so you
can see my ganache is ready to go there
is no separation whatsoever it's nice
velvety and smooth so if your ganache is
going to separate you're going to know
right away all that butter is going to
be sitting in a pool right on the
surface and it will not combine until
the temperature comes down okay so you
can just let it sit for a while and then
stir it together gradually and it'll
come together you can stick it in the
fridge but stick it in the fridge you
risk taking it too too low and then you
can't work with it it'll end up being
stiff so hey do you want to give me a
hand yeah totally now we're going to
pipe our ganache this is what we're
going to be dipping just hold that open
and I'm gonna put this in a bag now who
would anyone like to try piping some
ganache today anyone want to like
participate because I love audience
participation personally this is so fun
isn't it I mean this is really really
well done and ganache here this is good
it's got really nice bite it's gonna set
up really well does anyone of course
well I've got one bag but you can
certainly come up and you me move this
out of the way Steve sure and I forgot
to bring a pair of scissors i need to
snip my bag so want a knife I got a
knife here I got a little pair of
scissors on my knife that might work
just just see I always have this handy
all right so no you got to keep in mind
you want to make a nice good sized
truffle because these are going to go
into chocolate okay so you don't want
anything too small you could lose it
because you're gonna dip it straight
into the chocolate and you want to have
it you know have some some volume okay
so you're just gonna take it and do
these like little like chocolate kisses
just like that okay
see how that just kind of hold its shape
that's a good sign if it were too hot or
there was some weird things going on it
would just it would just kind of squish
out okay so this is really really well
mixed it looks good so go ahead give it
a shot give it you know maybe it in ice
half-dollar sized piece yep there you go
get it right on the paper don't hold it
up too high there you go otherwise it'll
start drying in a year no it's just it's
just not as neat it's not a clean so you
can just set it like down on the paper
and kind of let it there you go that's
good see how it kind of holds its shape
a little better you don't get these
little squigglies yeah yeah go ahead got
plenty to to try whoa nice very good
okay so this is just a trick to get
people to do my work for me by this oh
haha so the next step after you
successfully made a ganache you ideally
would like to these just kind of set
overnight to fully crystallize okay
they're going to be soft for quite a
while you could set them in the fridge
for a little while if you do refrigerate
them and you're not going to let them
set at room temperature if you do
refrigerate them let them come back up
to room temperature before you dip or
the KU pitcher is going to crack if your
ganache is too cold like chocolate will
just contract and it'll crack they still
perfectly edible but they might not last
as long they might not look as pretty to
keep something to keep in mind any kind
of tippecanoe difference is going to
cause issues with your couverture your
coding well that's fine that's totally
fine I was talking like you wouldn't
want a chocolate chip size piece you
know what I mean yeah so that's good
yeah great anyone else yeah do it it
looks good yeah okay now
I have my seventy percent now this is
just straight up chocolate this is going
to be our couverture this is going to be
our coding this is what we're going to
be dipping with does that make sense
this is not a ganache this is just
seventy percent chocolate okay so I'm
going to be tempering my chocolate today
on this little granite slab that I
brought from home that anybody if you
don't have granite table tops at home
just go out to like a stone yard and get
yourself a granite slab it is awesome to
have this at home I mean it's great you
can really impress people too soapstone
is yeah I mean that should be fine as
long as it has a polished surface
soapstone I won't stay as cold but it
would probably work it's a softer stone
so you might risk breaking pieces of it
off but probably be fine what what's
that gloss circle is Oh glass I've never
tempered on glass I don't know I would
my instinct would say that it wouldn't
work too well glass the reason why
marble and granite works so well is it
kind of keeps it maintains a cold
temperature ambient temperature of the
room so this was in my car for a little
while and i sanitized it so it's kind of
still call it still holding the cold
temperature that my car was at so that
makes sense sofas you could even put it
outside for a minute if your kitchen is
hot bring it in and it'll stay cold for
a long time even if the room is warm
that's why it works so especially
particularly marble marble works best
marble will maintain the ambient
temperature of whatever environment it's
in for the longest so I'm pouring out
quite a bit as a rule of thumb about
two-thirds of whatever volume your
tempering would go on your surface and
the one-third would stay in the
container so what basically what we're
doing here is if you've ever seen a
chocolate bar that has like a white haze
on the surface or a truffle for that
matter that is the cocoa butter rising
to the surface and that happens when
there is a temperature fluctuation in
the chocolate that the cocoa butter
wants to separate out like a fat like a
peanut butter you know the oil separates
out i would say okay now Steve just
pardon but this year sure absolutely so
basically all this is is a sort of
controlled cooling process in order to
keep the cocoa butter in the chocolate
instead of rising to the surface so that
when we dip
our chocolates will set up quickly and
they'll look beautiful they look shiny
so the shine and the snap that chocolate
has is a property of the cocoa butter
there's several different crystalline
structures that cocoa butter has and
there's only two of them that are
desirable really for for for tempering
so does that make sense so tempering
sounds a little weird like you're like
strengthening steel or something that
but I equate it more to like it's a
crystalline structure it's like when
water cools it starts to form
crystalline structure and it firms up
that's what chocolate does it firms up
so that basically what we want to do
here is we want to take this down to
about 86 degrees Fahrenheit and that is
going to ensure that all that cocoa
butter stays put instead of rising to
the surface why do you reserve some oh
the reason I do that is because we want
this chocolate to stay liquid long
enough to work with we wanted to be
liquid and in temper so I keep some of
it warm in the container and this is
typical of any kind of chocolate that
you would work with you want to keep
some of it warm so that when i add this
back into it this is going to start
getting a firmer and the viscosity is
going to decrease it's going to start
getting a little chunky and then i'm
going to dump it back into my warm
chocolate stir it all together and
hopefully that's going to create the
exact perfect uniform temperature
throughout my whole batch of chocolate
and that way it'll stay liquid as well
longer i'm just cooling it off on the
surface of the Marvel so I'm moving it
around the surface of the marble so all
of the chocolate gets contact with that
Mar with the surface or the granite in
this case and that is just controlling
the chocolate in a controlled way you
can do this several way I mean you don't
necessarily need a marble surface to do
this you can't you could say you have
three bars of chocolate you could take
two bars chop them up and then take a
one bar and melt it down and then sand
use it as a seed right so you just take
those chunks and put it in there oh I'll
just reverse I'm sorry you want to melt
two bars down take one bar chop it up
and then use and then slowly add that
into your hot chocolate and that will
bring the temperature down gradually as
you stir you could use a like a ice bath
you know
put your hot chocolate in an ice bath
and stir it until the temperature comes
down to 86 there are several different
methods any way that you can just but
the main thing is is you want to keep it
moving so there's something so much fun
about it yeah wearing it all right so
I've been asked yeah exactly I've been
asked in classes before well if it's
just a temperature issue why don't you
just let it sit until it reaches 86 so
that's not going to do anything you have
to actively move it you have to
encourage those crystalline structures
to start forming so let's say I wanted
this to come into temporary I'm like
I'll just wait till it comes down to 86
because right now it's at about a
hundred and ten probably want it yeah so
you can see all the difference in
viscosity here like if you just waited
for this to come down to 86 degrees that
magic temperature where it'll be in
temper if you don't do anything to it if
you don't move it around it's not going
to do anything it'll stay the
crystalline structure will stay in the
same state unless you manipulate it does
that make sense so so you can see here
my chocolate is starting to get a little
chunkier and you can see this a fancy
tool that i'm using here is a is a five
dollar home depot scraping tool right
there has a stainless steel you know
food safe well i was at the cowboy
academy in chicago several years back
and after i took the course they said
now you're going to need a scraping tool
we have this fancy a scraping tool that
has callebaut written nicely on the
thing and it was like 35 dollars and
this is five bucks says the exact same
thing so I'm just saying you don't
always need fancy equipment to make
awesome chocolate you can you know don't
fall for that kind of stuff really i
mean it's it doesn't matter i mean ii
and these are industry standard things
like scrapers for tempering chocolate in
the chocolatier world like everyone uses
scrapers to do this so you can see the
difference here in viscosity already did
you see that this is starting to look
chunky this is still very liquid so
that's what we want so if i do this just
right i'm going to add all this back in
i'm going to stir it around all those
chunks are going to melt out it's going
to seed seed my batch is going to lower
the temperature of the whole volume
and it's going to create the right
crystalline structure in my entire batch
and then we can you can hand dip these
guys these guys might not be ready and
oh they might be actually they're
setting up nicely so if anyone is
interested in what the temperature is
here I'm taking this down to about 74 75
degrees okay 76 somewhere in there and
then I'm going to add it back into my
hot chocolate and hopefully that's going
to bring the temperature down to 86 ok
it's going to and that's going to create
the crystalline structure that we want
again the goal here is to have a couch
or a surface that shiny and has snap if
you were just to take one of these in
dip it right now it would take about an
hour to set up and when it did set up it
would look terrible it would have all
this hazy stuff on this the cocoa butter
would just rise right to the surface so
here we go this looks good I think this
is there again I'm not using a
thermometer I'm doing this old school I
never used the monitors in the kitchen
or very rarely I try to do it by sight
just because thermometers are a little
cumbersome and time-consuming but if
you're just starting out I would
recommend getting a nice probe
thermometer they're about 35 bucks and
the temperatures are very precise so
this is a seventy percent chocolate I'm
taking it down to 86 degrees if you're
using percentages of chocolate that are
lower like if you're tempering milk the
temperature that you're going to take
your take it to is going to be lower so
milk chocolate will temper at about 84
degrees white chocolate the lowest being
like 83 84 right in there so the higher
the percentage of cocoa butter the
higher the temperature is going to be in
order for it to be in temperate does
that make sense so if you're using an
eighty-five percent you'll you'll want
to take your chocolate to around 87 88
degrees okay and also in the book we do
talk a lot about chocolate baking yes
some of this technical information
because you know there's a lot it's a
lot it is you can see that Steve does
this naturally and is it
amazing chocolatier thank you but once
you have those principles it is really
it's not that hard to do and it's fun to
play with there's a fair amount with
right yeah definitely you just got to
understand the concept it's just like
you know like I was explaining like
peanut butter and things like that the
peanut oil likes to separate out like
the oils don't like to stay combined and
it's cooked chocolates no different it's
just the fat of the beam that's the
cocoa butter it wants to come out so you
have to control and manipulate it in
order to keep it in otherwise you're
going to have a gritty not very good
tasting couverture chocolate samples
earlier they're all like perfect squares
a city nationals in a mold or no they
don't well yeah actually that's true
they do go in a sort of a frame mold
it's not technically like a chocolate
mold it's a they're like stainless steel
frames and they're about an inch high so
that we can just kind of put the ganache
in and we use it like a scraping tool
and sweet and it's all the same height
you can do that at home you could take
instead of piping like we just did here
pour your ganache all into a tray taking
offset spatula and just kind of smooth
it all out and then cut them by hand
into whatever shape you like you could
even use cookie cutters and do different
shapes things like that you can do all I
mean the sky's the limit they're really
fun to watch in the kitchen windows
ganache may their put into a frame and
then there's a large with guitar which
are these very thin wires it cut it
exactly into the shapes it's fun this
chocolate is now in temper ok so now
great thank you I'm gonna bring some of
this down here I'm going to give a quick
little dipping demo if anybody would
like to try dipping I would highly
recommend it so now that my chocolate is
in temper it's going to set up once I
start coding these it'll set up very
quickly within 30 seconds to a minute ok
and a good way to test that just very
quickly so when I first started I should
have done this before but you can take a
little piece of parchment paper to test
to the temper dip it in there like that
and if your chocolate is really hot
it'll take hours to set up even that
little piece now that this isn't
Emperor's
set up within I would say 30 seconds
it's going to become rigid and solid
okay and that's a great test or you can
just kind of put it on your lips if it
feels cool on your lip chances are it's
good because your lip is like the
thinnest skin it's the most sensitive to
temperature right that's how the French
do it or you can just eat it and not
worry about it yeah that's true yeah so
yeah this this looks ready to go and
also you can kind of tell just by
looking at it the viscosity is a lot
lower meaning that it's just thicker
looking it just looks thicker yeah I'm
confident this is ready to go so what
we're going to do now is I have some
dipping forks up here and a few so you
can you guys can use I'm gonna put him
down here you do yet do a quick little
demo here take my little truffle my
little interior now you can you can mold
this into a different shape if you like
if you want it to be a little bit more
round you can just kind of do that
another fun thing that you can do is you
can buy like silicone ice tray mold you
know the silicone ones it a floppy and
you can pipe ganache into those to stick
them in the fridge and then you'll have
like perfectly round they have ones that
are like little round circles right and
they'll make them perfectly shape that's
a fun thing I do that in my classes at
Theo sometimes yeah this is setting up
already so I'm going to toss it in roll
it around a bit okay pull that out now
that exterior is going to set up pretty
quickly okay I mean really quick I mean
you know less than a minute like I said
and then it'll be ready to eat you know
I mean ideally you'd want it to sit for
a couple hours for the chocolate to
fully crystallize and there you go roll
it off with your finger you can decorate
it if you like you can you can put maybe
candy some mint leaves and sprinkle it
on there whatever you want to do you can
make little patterns with your dipping
fork sky's the limit um yeah that looks
good so if anyone would like to come up
do a little hand dipping how do you want
to set that up Steve right down here dry
put this down here sure and I'll be
right here too to help out
this is gonna be Messi's out okay we're
gonna get messy all right um yeah you
can just come up these are a little too
soft yet cookies back Oh everybody wants
to do it i hope we have enough joe just
toss it in I don't have a paper towel
there you go give it a little shake
there you go and just throw it right on
the tray
sure and I've got another one here can
use the same Fork wonderful let me see
your ax you see your dipping fork there
wipe that off nice
why are you including your page oh
that's a good point thank you for
bringing that up sometimes I take that
for granted so as you're dipping a wipe
off your fork each and every time after
you dip or all this chocolate is going
to start setting up on your dipping fork
and then the next one that you dip won't
come off it'll it'll adhere to that
chocolate so each and every time I wipe
it off required to reserve so something
we usually have engaged Oh Forks or two
just regular old fortress yeah they were
great all right it's setting up great
see that it's the first one that was
dipped is already starting to solidify
so they should be ready to eat in a few
minutes how are we doing on time good
okay got it Oh little two prong one demo
mode rushing to shut down the filming so
if we get to say thank you to Joe and
Steve all right got it thank you if you
set the dipping sauce on there don't be
afraid just yeah rip it off of there
