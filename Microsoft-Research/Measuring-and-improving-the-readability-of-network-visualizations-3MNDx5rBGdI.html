you
I'm pleased to introduce Cody done and
he's going to do my stock is graduating
in may from university of maryland's for
conventional men and doing lots of work
on his work this realization all right
thank you Natalie so my work is focused
on measuring and improving the
readability of network visualizations
now like it all sorts of different kinds
of visualizations but one kind of or
sorry if you take one thing away from
this talk it should be that network
visualization is hard but you get all
sorts of cool things you can do with it
and I'm going to present you quit you
have several ways so you can make your
life easier when you're doing network
visualization so just little background
I'm from the human-computer interaction
lab at the University of Maryland we do
a visualization we do all sorts of other
cool stuff like working with bio rescue
teams and on zombie social networking
and I've been involved in lots of
various Network visualizations projects
today I'm going to be talking with you
about node Excel up there in the top
left and graph trail which I developed
when I was here as an intern with
Natalie but I also looked at citation
networks and matrix visualizations and
actual computer network bandwidth
traffic so what are networks networks
are just people and their relationships
or arbitrary entities and the
relationships between them for example
we have Alice here who has a connection
to Bob and connection to Kathy and Kathy
reciprocates that connection and you can
show it as an edge list saying person a
is connected to person B or as an
adjacency matrix where you have a matrix
of all these connections either way
showing the exact same data here and
when you start looking at real world
networks like a Twitter scrape you can
see interesting patterns emerge you take
all of those edge lists and adjacency
matrices you render it in an old link
diagram and in this case from this
workshop there is two distinct groups of
people are brought together by the
workshop only a handful of individuals
in the middle that connected those two
groups and by using size coding and the
images we can start understanding who
those people are and what kinds of
things that they were involved in in the
network so who use an orc analysis it's
not just the social scientists a lot of
sociologists have been using it for
decades now to understand relationships
between groups of individuals but we can
also use it to understand relationships
within science that's one of nataly's
images there we can look use it to the
understand political discourse we have
an urban planner at the University of
Maryland oh I've been helped understand
innovation relationships in Maryland and
Pennsylvania and it's also used
extensively now in biology looking at
the relationships inside our bodies or
archaeology I'll show you an example of
later so currently we have lots of
different visualization tools generally
targeted to one specific domain for
example we have piatt for the social
scientists we have defi which is also a
little bit more general but also
targeted social science and site escape
a very popular tool among biologists
these are very powerful tools with all
sorts of wonderful algorithms in them
ways to understand those specific kinds
of data sets but we do have a problem
they're not very very generally
accessible they're very powerful tools
that's very hard to get started it's
very hard to get your data into it when
you're just learning network analysis so
part of what we've done is the social
media research foundation that I'm
involved with this nonprofit focused on
network science is bring a bunch of
people together from all sorts of
different groups around the United
States and start focusing on improving
this experience for novice users so
we've got these open source tools
primarily node excel and a bunch of data
importers call spigots for it let
collect data from all sorts of places on
internet from twitter from facebook all
these places that are interested in you
can crawl your own email network from
your outlook there on your computer and
it dumps it all in this open source tool
node Excel which is embedded inside
excel so it's very easy to munch your
data to manipulate it and to put your
data sets in it if one of our biggest
doesn't get you what you want so this is
a visualization of node Excel or a
picture of node Excel here on the left
side we have all of the workbooks and
Excel that tell you about your network
and on the right side we have a node
link diagram that shows the
relationships that you have coded there
we also have open data that we're trying
to put on the internet here once you
have your data in node excel once you've
done your analyses and visualizations
you can upload it to the node XL graph
gallery it puts an image there it has
statistics that are automatically
computed you can write a caption for it
and share it with the rest of the world
and eventually we hope to have enough
data sets that you can start doing
meta-analysis you know 11 hundred and
fifteen hundred node Twitter scrape it
can be interesting on its own but when
you have a thousand or ten
and Twitter scrapes you can start seeing
aggregate relationships there and one of
our people Mark Smith has over 250,000
networks that he's downloaded and
extracted from these things so we can
start getting some serious analytical
power we also are involved in various
tort orioles and workshops and helping
set these things up and lots of folks
are starting to use node excel in
academic publications to actually
understand their own networks the tools
easy enough that a social scientist can
get started and within a couple of weeks
start making some serious contributions
looking at their own data sets we got a
book that helps you get started on this
process the introduction do social
network analysis using node excel but we
still have a problem which is what my
dissertation aims to focus on when you
do an old like visualization you often
end up with something that looks like
this we have tons of nodes we have tons
of edges and just the inherent
complexity of the network makes it very
difficult to visualize so here we have a
you know somewhat beautiful drawing of I
think it's ten thousand nodes from the
chi conference all the relationships
between individuals and the papers
within them we don't see a whole lot
from that so what can we do to fix it we
can try better layout algorithms we have
the graph drying conference going on
right here today at Microsoft
unfortunately different layout
algorithms vastly different results
these are six different visualizations
of the same network and you have vastly
different results depend on the
heuristic you choose to lay them out
again here's another example six
different visualizations of the exact
same network vastly different results
now so that's one problem and there's
all sorts of good ways we can prove
layouts but that's not the only solution
we can try alternate visualizations
natalie's worked on matrix
visualizations and we have various ways
to cluster these matrices together and
we have one tool here graph trail which
i'll be showing you towards the end of
my talk that aggregates the nodes in a
different visualization but node lake
diagrams tend to prevail for specific
kinds of tasks especially topology based
tasks we still want to make those
diagrams better so what I've done is
part of my dissertation is first try to
understand what kinds of problems there
can be in the link visualization using a
set of what I called readability metrics
that
understand for the entire drawing or for
part of the drawing what kinds of things
are causing problems and then I've
developed a taxonomy of these metrics
for the particular tasks that optimizing
them would benefit so for example if you
want to improve pathfinding tasks in
your network you want to reduce the
number of edge crossings as well and
then a set of automatic layout aids to
help you improve your visualization by
leveraging these metrics i also have
motifs implications which i've just
submitted a chi paper on a way of
simplifying your network using the
common repeating patterns in it and a
set of metal layouts that allow you to
take known clusters or computed clusters
in your network and separate them out in
different parts of the screen to
understand the individual relationships
within the groups and the aggregate
relationships between them and of course
all sorts of evaluations both quantity
both algorithmic and user studies so
let's get started the readability
metrics why do we want to measure
readability it's because users don't
really have an inherent understanding of
readability and how to optimize it this
is a very small drawing here from a
published paper and you could actually
draw this without any edge crossings
whatsoever just by rotating a couple
things around if a academic author won't
take the time to optimize such a small
driving like this how can we expect a
novice user who doesn't have any
experience in the field to be able to
know what kinds of visualizations are
suitable well we can use simple rules or
heuristics we can try to educate them
unfortunately when we try to educate
then we end up with big tables that look
like this of all the kinds of things
they want to optimize this is from
sugiyama book and it's all sorts of
great recommendations but I can't even
remember all of them much less try to
optimize them in my visualization we can
start measuring user performance wait on
playing and Tony sorry um wait on Tony
Wang and Peter EADS have been doing all
sorts of studies on how users understand
visualizations but then Helen purchased
in 2002 developed these global
readability metrics she called them
aesthetic criteria though these
quantitative metrics for your tire
drawing how well is it doing on
particular things and I take that and go
a few steps further now in the global
readability metrics we say how
understandable is the drawing and a
journal for example
say I want if you publish a node like
visualization with me to have no no
dilution no nodes overlapping each other
very little edge tunneling and very
little edge crossings you can make these
recommendations of course not all
visualizations are going to match these
properties even good visualizations but
it's a point we can start on so what
I've done is part of my dissertation is
develop more metrics both for the entire
drawing but I've also focused on
individual nodes and edges I've extended
these metrics so that we can identify
where specifically in the drawing
problems occur and then we also have
that task by metric taxonomy to help you
to say if I want to optimize for these
tasks these are the metrics that I
should be looking at as an example this
is metric for node overlap we can
measure the amount of overlap any
particular node has with all of its
neighbors and by scaling these things
properly we can get a metric on a 0 to 1
scale that says that either your entire
drawing is good or your entire drawing
is bad or an individual node is good or
bad and once we have these metrics on a
0 to 1 scale we're going to take we can
apply color coding and automatic
approaches to try to improve those
properties so what I've done is taking a
subset of existing metrics that he'll
and purchase and others have developed
I've added a couple new global metrics
for understanding note overlap and group
overlap in the amount of drawing space
used and then several local
modifications to these industry metrics
and the new ones I've developed that
help show you exactly where the problems
are now that we have the metrics we can
actually show the user these problems
using color coding and the like to draw
their attention to the problem areas and
then they can get either manipulated
manually and we can give in real time
feedback with it with the color coding
so as you drag the node over to one side
it gets greener and greener as it
reduces edge crossings or if you move it
into a bad spot it gets redder and
redder so the user can see exactly how
they're affecting the readability of
their drawing now we can go a little bit
further I have a stepped a snap to
Maxima approach i'm currently working on
where as you move the node it will snap
to local Maxima of the metrics so rather
than hunting the entire search space if
you go into anywhere near this
agent here with that red node it will
snap to one of the points towards the
center of it that's that's better now
you might ask yourself why not take
those metrics feed it into a layout
algorithm and be done with it work
without requiring any user effort the
problem is that it's computationally
difficult to optimize these metrics
that's not to say that we shouldn't try
it and in fact I'm going to be using a
simulated annealing algorithm here
probably over the next three months or
so to take a user-defined set of metrics
based on the tech sauna me and the tasks
they're trying to optimize throw it into
the simulated annealing algorithm that
you will search the layout space and
will give a good visualization now I
expect that this is going to be very
expensive and time-consuming but we'll
be able to create automated
automatically good drawings if we're
willing to invest the time on it so the
takeaway of the metric part of my work
the goal is to raise user awareness of
these problems help them identify where
the problems are in their drone drawings
help them optimize it automatically or
interactively and also may help them
make recommendations for those specific
kinds of things that they want to
optimize now the next part of my dog
deals with motif simplification the work
I just submitted the Chi here the idea
behind motif simplification is if you
have a network like this which
represents wiki editors all these little
circles here and that wiki pages that
they edit there's all these common
patterns that occur that take up a whole
lot of screen space we've got these big
fans of individually connected nodes
these editors that only edit one we keep
age and we've got these connector groups
around the middle these are groups of
editors that are editing two pages
together or three pages or four pages or
more now these things take up a whole
lot of space or they don't really give
us much information back for it so we've
got these repeating patterns i call them
motifs in the network these motifs can
dominate the visualization space and
finally a lot of them are very
functionally equivalent we have all
those single editors doing the exact
same thing why do we need to draw all
the individual edges to them why do we
need to show all those editors can't we
just aggregate that information so my
about what other people have done with
this kind of approach graph
summarization is the idea that you can
take groups of functional equivalent
nodes and combine them into a meta node
and get a network that's much smaller
and easier to lay out now so in this
visualization we have this very highly
connected group there it's actually a
biologic protein interaction network and
we can take that highly connected group
and replace it with just a single meta
node and thats sized according to how
much it contains now that's a wonderful
way to reduce the amount of stuff you
have to lay out but a user isn't going
to know what's inside that note you can
expand it perhaps and actually see the
original notes that were part of it and
you can tell how many nodes there are
but you have no idea what the topology
is like you have no idea what their
attributes are like so this isn't
particularly suitable solution to help
and user get an overview of their
network motif simplification on the
other hand plans to take these repeating
motifs like a fan motif and replace it
with a glyph that represents that
underlined topology for each motif you
take the shape of the motif replace it
with a glyph that shows that this is
these are the underlying connections and
the user will be able to look at a
glance and see what those connections
are we also have a conectar motif here
we have all these functionally
equivalent span nodes they're doing the
exact same thing like those editors
editing to wiki pages they're just
connecting point A to point B and it can
replace these with the tapered diamond
glyph that indicates that kind of
bridging relationship when we use these
glyphs on the same network here we
automatically find those motifs and
replace them with the glyphs we end up
with a much simpler drawing we've gone
from 512 nodes down to 25 we've reduced
the number of edges substantially as
well and with correct color and size
coding we can help the user understand
exactly where all of the nodes win for
example we see this really big fan down
here in the bottom that says that that
is a lot of nodes compared to that tiny
one right there at the top that little
sliver that says there's not really much
here so when we design these glyphs we
want to be representative of the
topology like we like I mentioned we
want the representative the amount of
nodes they replace but also the
attributes that we have coded on those
node visualizations the glyphs of course
need to be easily distinguishable in
order to understand the differences
between them and they need to be
distinguishable from the regular node
shapes you're going to have in your
network we're going to be easily
comparable and we also want to allow
interesting overlaps
between the nodes for example in that
visualization we just saw we have the
fan motif that is actually the anchor of
this connector motif as well if you
allow interesting kinds of overlaps of
the motifs you can get to a much simpler
more understandable network so let's
look at these in a little bit more
detail here these are the three
different fans and their associated
glyphs so we see that we have if we have
a lot of notes like the fan on the top
would replace it with a fan-shaped glyph
with a very high arc we chose a default
of 120 degrees but if we have very few
nodes we replace it with a very narrow
glyph now for if we have a color coding
in this case it's an orange to purple
scale on the nodes we take the average
of all of those underlying node
attributes and apply that to the same
color scale went to figure out the color
for the glyph so we down in the bottom
we see that we have a whole lot of
purple in the underlying nodes in the
top one we see we have a whole lot of
orange in the underlying nodes so we're
able to retain some of that attribute
information when we're looking at the
connector motifs we also are able to
show the edge information see we still
have the node sizes which all have the
node colors encoded but now when we have
those meta edges on both sides that
replace all of those edges we can show
if they had high average weight for
example and even if there's an imbalance
in the meta edges and we chose for
connectors with more anchor nodes to use
the same glyph right rather than having
many different variants with say more
points and things like that we chose the
same glyphs of the user always knows
that this kind of group is doing the
exact same thing and you can trace the
number of edges to see how many things
it's connected to we also look at clicks
which are a common motif that a lot of
people have been interested for a long
time in computer science we take all of
these completely connected groups of
nodes replace them with glyphs size by
how many nodes they contain and again we
have the color coding and when you
combine these things if you define your
motifs so they can allow overlaps and
you define your glyphs so that they can
be connected to each other you can get
too much simpler more interesting
representations in terms of
interactivity showing just a big static
visualization isn't very useful it might
help you get an overview
but the real payoff comes with when a
user decides to investigate the contents
of something either interactively with a
tooltip to see how much is inside it and
what those things are or to expand to
the original version this is a
completely lossless representation right
you can always expand or collapse move
to any subset of the network that will
here's another example of the klique
motifs in action we have a network here
of Senate Co voting patterns in the
United States from 2007 and of course we
have the two large groups the Democrats
and the Republicans that are constantly
at odds in our political system in this
network we've taken that entire complete
graph of the similarity of voting
patterns of all networks and we filtered
down to only those sent only those
connections where they agree with each
other at least sixty-five percent of the
time when we do that and we use a
regular node link visualization we see
those two groups separate out we see
three people in the middle snow collins
inspector and if your call to two years
later 2009 specter switch sides to the
democrats so that's kind of a nice
little story there but then when we go
to the glyphs we can start seeing a
whole lot more inside the middle of the
network we could only see those three
nodes the rest are just too large chunks
but when we use the cliq motifs we see
that we have this giant completely
connected group of Democrats to
independence and actually one Republican
olympia snowe here we have 38
Republicans in one made main group but
then we have to moderate bridge people
as a group the people that vote on both
sides they're more tightly connected to
the Republicans of course that's what
the size of this meta edge shows you but
they vote with the Democrats a whole lot
too that's McCain and three other
senators that they have a whole lot of
power because of that central position
that they hold in the network and then
we have Coburn Coburn here is a staunch
Republican when it comes to vary when it
comes to very stringent political issues
but a lot of time you votes his heart so
he's a bit of a wild card so he's
sitting out there on his own a little
bit let's go on here this is the same
network when we go up to seventy percent
agreement we see a little bit more
separation a few less edges in the node
link visualization and we see more stuff
come out of the Republican
we see snow come out of the Democrats
and you see how tightly she was
connected with them before but now down
in the bottom left we have the known
wild cards of the Republican Party we
have one of itch and Vitter and Hagel
and Coburn like we saw before these are
the people that you really aren't going
to know what's going to happen and of
course here's Spector and Collins that
were along the middle of that original
graph at eighty percent agreement we see
the network get completely bisected the
Democrats finally start splintering a
little bit we have the extreme liberals
from the east coast in the top group on
the left side we have the moderate blue
dog democrat coalition and down here we
have nelson the pitah mille blue dog
democrat moderate democrat over on the
republican side we see still a
moderately sized click but then a whole
lot of other quakes come off we see the
people that were moderates in the
Republican Party float down to the
bottom and then we have Hagel here he's
the guy that broke I mean party lines
for the most stringent issues he voted
against Bush's Medicare reform policy he
vote against No Child Left Behind these
are the things that the Republican Party
lined up for but he's the one that
splintered away as we advance on to
higher thresholds we see more
splintering happen and finally when we
get up to 90 and then 95% we see that
there's only two Republican senators
left connected these are the senators
from Georgia that are together you see
that a lot in these networks the people
who are on the same committees together
the people from the same states are the
ones that remain tightly connected so
let's look at a bigger Network here here
we have a web crawl starting at a
particular website and moving out
farther and farther and farther now that
egocentric way this data set is
collected is the same way that so many
social scientists get their data stead
they start on the place on Facebook or
on Twitter and they grow and they grow
and grow until they reach some threshold
now because of this we always end up
with these massive fans on the periphery
all these things that we got to and then
decided not to go any further either
that or the people they're the people
that are just not very well connected to
the network now in this visualization of
about 4,000 nodes you might ask yourself
why do we need to improve this it looks
rather reasonable the reason is because
there's a lot of stuff that's hidden by
layout heuristic that we used when we
color by the fan motifs we see that
there's two large fans down here that
we're laid out on top of each other and
moreover there's this whole group in the
middle that aren't part of either of
them that we had no clue about because
of all that occlusion and all of our
layout algorithm moreover there's all
these little fans scattered throughout
the center of the network they looked
like core nodes to us so if we were
trying to estimate how big is the center
of the network we would have been way
off so let's take these throw the motif
simplification at it we have the fan
motifs simplified now into their little
fans and if you look closely you can
compare their sizes based on their arcs
but the whole go of goal of these motifs
simplifications is to reduce the
complexity you don't want to see them
really big all the time we've dropped
the amount of screen space required by
about two-thirds here we can expand and
see the core interesting parts of the
network like this large parallel group
that was hiding behind those fans and
when we colored by those connector
motifs we see that that whole group is
colored and when we simplify that away
now we have a network that's a tenth of
the size it's easier for you to
understand and it's easier for your
layout algorithm to understand and to
represent for you when we have color
codings on it such as eigenvector
centrality all those color codings are
reflected on the colors of the glyphs so
how do we quantify whether things these
things work well we can see how much it
reduces the size of the network we can
see how much it reduces things like know
it overlap those readability metrics
that we care about but we also want to
put it in front of people and see how
well they do for example when a user
looks at one of those original
visualizations they say wow I'm
overwhelmed it's like when those vision
tests at the eye doctor there's just so
much going on but when we do motifs
implication they say hey I can see the
central pages now I can do the pairwise
connections when there's 500 things on
the screen you can start comparing
individual pairs button there's 4,000
you can't very easily now we also did a
controlled experiment which is just in
our Chi paper so these statistics are
just one day old all right so i took
functions li bunch and lee's 2006
taxonomy of kinds of tasks people want
to do on graphs and networks and i
selected a group of tasks that i thought
would be representative of both things
that motifs implication would be good
for and bad for all
these kinds of tests that are the basis
for doing exploratory tests to network
such as how many nodes are there in the
network which node is the cut point
which one would you remove to disconnect
the most other stuff the largest motifs
of the various types which are related
to connectivity problems of course we
want to find individual nodes if they
have labels we want to find the shortest
paths between various nodes we want to
see how many neighbors people have how
many neighbors they share all those
questions are interesting things to
answer so in my experiment I took 36
individuals for the main experiment
there roughly half female half non
female half computer science and the
other half to spread across eight
different departments predominantly
graduate students I had two groups it
was a between-subjects test we had the
control group which had just a node like
visualization with interactions so that
they can move things around and
highlight the edges connected to any
individual nodes and then we had the
motif simplification grip which had the
same node like visualization plus
automatic motif simplification so when
they saw the first network it was
simplified and then they could expand or
collapse Explorer as that will and it
included those tooltips like you saw
before I had 31 questions across three
datasets a three datasets we were used
were the three that I've shown you the
Senate voting patterns the wiki edits
and the web crawl networks we feel that
both all three of those networks are
pretty representative of the kind of
tasks people want to do and each user
spent 45 minutes answering 31 questions
across these networks well actually it's
35 minutes answering those questions in
10 minutes of training after we ran all
of those subjects these are the
significant findings we had and I
apologize and I'm a pretty visualization
here again this is one day old
statistics okay the important stuff that
we found out is that for the motifs that
you simplify people can find them far
far easier point 01 p values here and
you can see that they can find queex in
less 20 seconds less fans the maximum
fans and eight seconds less the maximum
connectors in 17 seconds less but in
addition to being faster they're able to
identify it much more frequently and
with much less air in estimating how big
they are
in terms of estimating how many nodes
there are in the entire network we found
that it actually takes a little bit
longer to do that with motif
simplification in our test it was 21
seconds longer for two of the networks
one of the other networks wasn't
significant but they can do it with much
less air they underestimated by eight
percent instead of by forty seven
percent the size of the network if
you're trying to find a label it as that
label is not part of a motif you can
find it much faster and far far more
accurately but if it's if that label is
simplified as part of them with chief at
least on one of the networks we found
that it'll take you a little bit longer
to find that in terms of finding the cut
point of the network which won't know
did you remove to disconnect the most
other stuff we found that people were
far more accurate with the motif
simplification but that's I really
should have color-coded this for myself
as well but for some of these problems
we noticed a decrease in performance for
example finding the shortest path took
ten seconds longer the error on the
length of the shortest paths was better
in one case but it was worse in another
case and estimate finding how many
neighbors a thing has and which nodes
have more which pairs of nodes have more
neighbors those problems became harder
and less accurate as well as the problem
of finding the shared neighbors now a
lot of these problems we attribute to
the fact that 10 minutes 5 to 10 minutes
isn't very long to understand motifs and
the topology that are inside inside them
so we feel that as users become more
experienced with these techniques
they'll become better at these topology
based tasks but still that is a little
bit of a problem that we're working to
address so motifs implication is pretty
cool for reducing the complexity of your
network and understanding the larger
hidden relationships there but the
motifs you are interested in may not be
covered in the corpus that we simplify
and when you're designing this gliss
there's a lot of trade-offs we chose
very small glyphs that can that are not
obstructive that you can see at a
distance but you can't see the
distribution of the nodes inside them
you can't see the distribution of the
attributes so there's definitely
trade-offs when you're designing these
things that for more details I'd refer
to our tech report and hopefully in the
upcoming Chi paper right so how am i
doing
here okay so so next we have metal outs
metal outs are ways of taking
clusterings or groupings you know about
your network and using them to simplify
the visualization the idea is that you
take groupings so this is the senate
network and these are the these senators
are grouped according to that region of
the united states they represent you can
lay out these individual groupings in
boxes where each one has its own layout
algorithm in each box is sized according
to how many notes that it contains and
that is that you'll be able to see the
relationships within groups more clearly
and then if you show aggregate
connections between them you'll be able
to see those aggregate relationships
well too so if you have a big complex
network like this one representing
innovation networks in Pennsylvania and
you throw a clustering algorithm at it
and you put those clusters in the group
in the Box groups you can actually start
seeing some important things for example
in this network this is the stuff
getting rid of the smaller clusters
there we found that there's this large
pharmaceutical and medical research
group that was completely unknown to the
urban planner that had been using this
data set for years he saw all of these
groups that were around specific regions
in the state but then there's this cross
discipline boundary or cross region
boundary spanning group that he was
completely unaware of two main
innovators patch eating all sorts of
stuff related to pharmaceutical and
medical research so when we do a regular
clustering we generally show the colors
and the shapes on the nodes but in most
networks this is very difficult to
understand you can probably not make
much sense of this because of how
overlap how much overlap there is
between these clusters when we show it
in a group in the Box network the
clusters are mediately visible you can
see relationships within them so the
current metal outs like the ones I've
been shown you are pretty good for some
tasks but they don't show the
relationships between groups very well
right and so what I'm working on over
the next several months again is
different variants of these meadowlands
one is a donut layout rather than just
putting everything in a tree map we can
show the most connected thing in the
center and wrap stuff around it another
one takes a pure force directed layout
approach where you have the different
groups that the different clusters
representative
as just regular nodes in a force
directed layout but of course they're
weighted according to their connectivity
so we arranged these boxes on just like
we would if the normal force directed
lamp so we can see those relationships
and then after this apply a post
processing step to pack these things
together so we have the space filling
properties that we had with the original
tree map layout so I'll review of this
the metal ads are great for very large
high-density networks as long as you can
get good clusterings or groupings in
them because you can separate these
parts out and show a lot of those hidden
relationships and they can even be
recursively nested if you have a
hierarchical clustering algorithm now
we've talked about a lot of node like
visualization so let's go on to a
alternative to node link visualization
right so we've talked about these
various annealing visualizations we
still have some problems with large
complex networks so let's go beyond
graph trail is a tool developed with
Natalie and bonk shin and some other
folks here when I was working at
Microsoft Research and it leverages
aggregation of node attributes in order
to display a simpler representation of
the visualization it provides a
drag-and-drop interactions to filter the
subsets of the network and it also
integrates an exploration history that
shows you exactly where you came from as
part of the process so here's an
overview of graph trail and graph trail
you start with a single aggregating
chart like a bar chart right in this
case it's Kai publications grouped by
their manually assigned topic here we
have one bar highlighted for computers
forwarded collaborative work we see how
many papers are published in that area
and another bar highlighted for
information visualization an area close
to my heart we see that in this art
diagram at the bottom that going
counterclockwise we have a whole lot of
citations from infamous papers to
themselves and then down here at the
bottom we have a whole lot of cscw
papers citing the infamous papers going
counterclockwise again but that
reciprocal relationship is barely there
so that's one interesting finding just
from the initial visualization of the
network now if we have that initial
visualization we can then start
interacting with it we can instead of we
can pivot from these papers to all of
their connected authors this is a differ
node type in the network and so by doing
that we just we use that option it shows
all these authors here in a different
type in a different chart you see a
different color and then different label
there at the top showing what this chart
contains we have a whole lot of authors
that we don't know their state with
groups by state now but say we're
interested in HCI research in Georgia we
can go down and select the Georgia bar
and filter simply by pulling that
aggregate out to the canvas so when we
do that it will create a brand new chart
for us it shows us all of the authors
from the chi conference from the state
of Georgia we have a little query up
there at the top and we have a two thing
that we can mouse over here that shows
you the tooltip exactly what we did got
from Georgia and here it highlights the
Georgia state and all of the initial
papers that we took the authors from so
we can see exactly what we did for this
step instead of grouping by state looks
grouped by the affiliation so we see
where these authors are from within
Georgia and throw these things into a
tag cloud chart instead so we can start
reading them and we see this really big
tank we're georgia institute of
technology but if you scan this list
there's several other name variants
authors aren't very good at putting
consistent names on their papers so we
have georgia institute of technology but
we also have georgia institute of
technology a different one and george
institut teknologi atlanta georgia and
georgia tech all these variants we want
to consolidate these things so let's
first drag the main Georgia Tech out to
the canvas and create a new chart but
then let's go through all these named
variants and drop those name variants
into the chart too okay so we're going
to combine all these things to the union
of these subsets just with a simple
drag-and-drop interaction and builds up
the query there if we wanted to change
this into SQL it wouldn't be too
difficult it shows us a nice tool tip
showing the end of all of those
different things that we selected and
now we have an interesting subset of
authors so now that we have the authors
let's investigate who at Georgia Tech
are the most prolific individuals so
let's pivot from the authors to they're
connected papers again so this is all HR
researchers from Georgia from Georgia
Tech let's go to their papers and now we
have a chart showing which of these
authors are the most prolific so
right now the group by topic grouping by
the author name and we see that we have
this massive bar for Elizabeth mine at
she's the most prolific individual there
we can drag her off to the side to
create another chart that just shows her
information right so I see that's
Elizabeth my net and sorry we cloned
this chart and so this is the same data
set so we're just seeing the same
visualization in tag clouds with
Elizabeth my not here at grigor grigor
about is pretty big as well but now
let's just investigate Elizabeth if we
drag her bar down we have just her and
her co-authors on these papers okay and
then if we group by the topic that she
works on we can start seeing what what
kinds of stuff she likes to do grooving
by the topic we see a whole lot of
computer-supported collaborative work if
we're interested in that we can drag
that at the canvas and switch to a
detail chart and now that we've done
this we end up with a small table
showing just her papers when she was at
Georgia Tech on computer-supported
collaborative work if we zoom out we can
see the entire history of our
exploration we mouse over any one of
these parent links it'll show us that
our prop the provenance of the specific
data here we can remember exactly what
we did have confidence in our results
and more importantly we can share this
with somebody else and simply with these
interactions they can know exactly what
we did every step on the way and in the
studies that we did we found that not
only can they tell exactly what you did
along the way but they can infer ninety
percent of the time why you were doing
it and what findings you are making now
I think this way I'm running out of time
here so this might be a good place to
stop with the graph trail so the
takeaway messages of this talk note
Excel and my dissertation improvements
to it readability metrics motif
simplification and metal amps and help
you get started pretty quickly on
network visualization and show these
things more effectively with less
complexity and head road heterogeneous
networks with lots of different types
and all sorts of attributes we can
easily visualize and grab
Trail which lets us explore attributes
with drag-and-drop exploration and
remember our expert in history and if
that I'd like to open it up to any
questions you may have well actually the
stuff in my PhD I mean my committee
specifically said this can get very deep
just make sure you do what you promised
to do and don't go any deeper like so
with the motifs the motifs I've looked
at three but figuring out how to
simplify arbitrary motifs with still
having representative glyphs that's a
hard problem but in terms of general
network problems I think dynamic
networks are one of the major things
there's all sorts of tools and
approaches that have been suggested to
handle dynamic networks but none of them
is really that convincing they don't
move us very close to actually truly
understanding the evolution of these
things that's one big problem another is
still with heterogeneous networks of
lots of different node types and I slept
if you're showing that in a node link
visualization how would you show these
different know types effectively and how
do you show the overlapping edges in a
lot of cases will have several edges
between two points if they have
different types how do we show those
different groups and if they have
different attribute values how do we
show those distributions without taking
up again without taking up too much of
the screen space now those are that the
two top projects anyway I suggested to
our infovis class when they were looking
for their course projects for the year
question so what was the hardest I think
the hardest during my PhD was escaping
an RA I was unhappy with and getting
focused on my dissertation work I didn't
realize how much being unhappy and
unconvinced that what I was working on
was going to be helpful was affecting
the rest of my work like that was the
hardest thing that I faced once I
decided I mean well also there was just
a whole lot of getting experience with
the various real world networks to
figure out what kinds of things I wanted
to tackle once I decided that these are
the problems that I've noticed and these
are how I'm going to fix it things
became definitely not easier but a lot
faster and more specific on what I want
