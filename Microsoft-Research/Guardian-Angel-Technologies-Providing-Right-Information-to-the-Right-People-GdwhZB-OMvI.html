you
it's my great pleasure to welcome
professor was you ready from callaghan
mellon university to visit us he will
talk about the car the angels that would
be very exciting to many of us professor
what you ready is a pioneer in
artificial intelligence and robotics
speech recognition whoo-hoo achievement
without the need to have any
introduction and for many people who are
familiar with microsoft internet people
we know that the three managing
directors from our research lab in asia
starting from cali have rishon the
chevron hall well Rogers students and a
Kentucky man so without further ado
let's welcome Raja Reddy well thank you
it's a pleasure to be back here I used
to come here two three times a year as a
member of the technology at AB from 91
to 2006 finally I said I served enough
him stopped coming so I haven't been
here in the last three four years so
it's a pleasure to be back here ms arm
in the digital world of 21st century
every person on the planet should be
able to get timely warning about
potential dangers that might befall them
such as earthquakes or flooding your
typhoons or tornadoes so in this talk I
want to kind of give you an outline of
what a guardian angel technologies might
be like that will provide the right
information to the right people and
eliminate surprise and protect them from
unexpected problems so with that we'll
go to the first slide so 20 years ago my
colleague
carbonell who happens to be here we are
both of us a visiting Microsoft in
another context proposed a grand
challenge for computer science that
society should aspire to get the right
information to the right people at the
right time in the right language in the
right medium of text and multimedia at
the right level of detail this was you
know something with a clear vision 20
years ago but we didn't know how to do
it then it was not clear what we mean by
all of these at that time getting you to
the right language meant we had to solve
the translation problem we didn't know
how to do it then at least now it's
slightly better it could be
significantly better and text-to-speech
technologies and summarization
technologies are also making progress
but the right information to the right
people at the right time still continue
to be difficult ideas to grasp and kind
of get your hands around so before I you
know so what one of the interesting
things was that kind of caught my
attention when I heard it from Jaime was
he called it the digital Bill of Rights
those of you who are aware of the
Constitution of United States know that
there are the first ten amendments are
Bill of Rights so I said what
relationship is there between this
digital Bill of Rights and the regular
bill o rights this is the 30 human
rights from united nations which
includes the 10 digital Bill of Rights
that are in the Constitution of the
United States maybe not all of them
there's some overlap when most of them
are there other some things are not so
there is a statement in the original
bill of rights saying you cannot a
soldier cannot walk into somebody's
house and take it over I don't know
whether it is there in
that form but the right to own property
might be part of such a statement or
something but so anyway the the
interesting thing about the this
particular bill of rights is the the
original bill of rights came from the
17th century philosopher Asafa called
thought of John Locke and adopted by
Thomas Jefferson and James Madison that
people are naturally free and and equal
and are endowed with some unalienable
rights it's a very famous statement in
the in the Constitution now and I is it
the Declaration of Independence anyway
this is this is something i read about I
thought it was in a great statement that
until that time it was not clear that
every person had some rights if you are
in a in a kingdom King Kunar can order
your day ahead shall be chopped off and
you're gone but here it says they are
naturally free and equal and are endowed
with some inaudible bikes so from there
we went to the human rights in a digital
society by united nations which are kind
of interesting in there right there you
kind of find a set of you know rights
like unrestricted access right to be
connected all the time on right to
freedom of online expression security
and data protection and so on and and
again these are you know well deserving
rights but they are not necessarily
implemented or followed by countries in
the world and different there are sensor
ships and other kinds of things and
different countries when they see
something that they don't like like
turkey or Egypt they will immediately
turn off the whole internet if necessary
and so so the digital Bill of Rights we
are talking about here is much more
active it says if you can get the right
information to the right people in the
right language at the right time frame
then you can actually help the people in
ways that right other otherwise may not
be able to do so the question is can we
do that and what would it take and we
made a lot of progress on some of the
things summarization translation and so
on but not much progress in the first
three and so I just want to make sure
that we are all on the same wavelength
when it comes to what we mean by these
terms the right information is all
information impacting life liberty and
happiness in particular information
about safety security and well-being and
that means providing information about
natural emergencies and man-made
emergencies it's also information about
disruption of basic necessities of life
such as water electricity for food and
health transportation and it's also
about information about daily problems
traffic jam strikes school closings and
so on the missing science of what we
mean by right information is for any one
person the right information is the
relevant information most of the
information that is there in the news
and other sources is not of direct
interest secondly there's the scarcity
of human attention we don't have enough
time to look at everything that is there
so we need to somehow personalize the
technologies of information and the
right information is also kind of
getting that information in a form
that's easily accessible so if I'm
driving or if I'm you know in a meeting
or something you can't have a loud
banging noise on the phone saying
there's some emails that has come or
something has come and and so the
notification and alerts that you see on
cell phones I think are pretty pretty
reasonable
as a way of providing this information
and so given a known problem such as an
earthquake the the the big problem we
face is how do we identify who is going
to be affected by that event and then
once you identify the sphere of
influence then you say you need to say
who are all the people that are
currently there in that area that's not
currently known to most people but is
known to the service providers because
every tower knows what are all the
phones that are connected to that tower
that is required by law actually they
have to keep that information about
location information and and so then
once you identify who are the affected
people and what information to be sent
to them the next thing you want is tell
them that information is happening and
then prepare them for various
contingencies give them advice and how
they might you know kind of protect
themselves but the interesting part is
if you turn off the computer if you turn
off your cell phone or if you are
sleeping or under what conditions should
this alert be you know how will how will
you get the information what that means
is the current concept of turning off
the phone has to be modified there is
only one situation where even when the
computer is turned when the cell phone
is turned off you get an alert that is
if you set an alarm and go to sleep even
reverse computer is turned off it it
wakes up and rings the alarm right so
mechanisms are already there inside the
only requirement now is for an external
agent external software agent must be
able to do the same thing that that
essentially is a problem because an
alarm doesn't consume too much energy
because it's not sampling
the the cell tower continuously and that
consumes a lot of energy and so the
issue is are you willing to permit that
kind of waste of energy and I think
partial solutions are possible you don't
have to continuously sample you could do
it every five minutes at every two
minutes or whatever so that the amount
of energy consumed is like 1% of what it
currently consumed when it's always on
ready to receive a phone call anytime
that I call so the so the assuming
that's possible assuming that you NS are
external software agent can actually you
know send an alert and wake up the
computer and then provide appropriate
information then I think using push
technology for timely consumer
communication can be satisfied the
finally we you need a database of
personal profile of interests you know
basically a lot of people in the world
don't speak English so giving them an
english-language alert is not going to
help so you need to know what language
they're speaking in absence of having a
database your best bet is to simply use
the language of the location and you
already know the location information
from the cell tower so the idea is
people will not be very happy about your
tracking them any more than the
information that's already being tracked
by the cell tower and so that that's the
privacy issue will come to a little
later and and so the issue is they
cannot not only understand english
language they may not be able to read
any language so simply sending a text
alert may not be the adequate that's
where the issue of right medium comes in
so whatever message is being sent has to
be then converted from text to speech
and then spoken out so those are the
kind of what I call missing science of
what we need to do in order to provide
the right information
to the right people now we come to what
do we mean by the right people right and
the right people again is a very complex
issue and right people is anyone and
everyone in the world that may be
impacted by the daily events that's both
literate and illiterate and people in
you know industrialized world and also
developing economies in the most remote
areas and so I am saying every person
has the right to get the timely
information and that seven billion
people and unfortunately there are some
limitations to it the two biggest
limitations are that many of them don't
have a device that can receive an alert
right now it's estimated maybe about two
billion people out of the seven have a
device that can receive either a
smartphone-like message or a simple text
message on a feature phone but the
remaining five billion are you know
maybe three of those are expected to
join the digital revolution in the next
few years by 2020 and maybe two billion
will never have it unless there is a
specific attempt made to get all of them
access to the technology and later on
I'll make the case it is a right of
every individual to have the information
therefore the it's the right of every
individual to have a smartphone
therefore it's a right they can demand
you know if they if every in a civilized
society everybody should have a road and
electricity and and sewage systems and
water supply they should also have
information access that's the right to
the society and so we'll come back to
that
and but the right people then is
everybody on the planet at the right
time is very interesting also because
right time is just in time as I'm we
used to say if it's too soon we forget
if i send you a reminder of this meeting
a week ago you may or may not remember
it right and or if you send it one
minute you know before the meeting is
too late by the time and you may be far
away can't come and attend the meeting
so it has to be on the right time but
more importantly it is not something
it's not always something that you can
plan for there are extraneous events in
life that happened at the most
inopportune time it's not only the
natural emergencies and man-made
emergencies it's also personal
emergencies you know suddenly your
father is seriously ill and you have to
drop everything you're doing and fly
halfway around the world and that's what
you may have to do right and so the
issue now for a right time is very
important to kind of understand and deal
with it also it turns out time is money
in certain things there's a new book by
Michael Lewis called flash boys I think
it's called which is about the fact that
some of the hedge foreign traders built
as separate fiber line between newark
new jersey and chicago so that they
would get 5 millisecond advantage in
trading and make millions of dollars and
result in if you haven't read this book
is fun to read it reads like a detection
bowel so finally die time it turns out
you know in emergencies like traffic
emergencies and so on it is known in
medical literature that if you can get
an ambulance to the accident site in
less than 10 minutes you will save
eighty percent of the people that would
have otherwise died and i know this
firsthand
I was kind of on the board of a there
was no 911 for a long time in 2005 there
was it was set up by a thing called a
MRI emergency emergency research
institute and it turns out they had to
get a special number called 108 it was
not 911 technology of location-based
services and with their knew exactly
where the ambulance was and where the
accident was and they could find the
right one and route it unfortunately in
the United States we still are you know
kind of living with ancient 911 because
they're nine eleven months interstates
are run by counties and if you happen to
be in the neighboring County and there's
an ambulance right there that can get to
you within two minutes you don't get
that you have to get their ambulance you
know our way in in the county and so
that kind of location information is not
there in the US systems right now and
they might change but right now it's not
so coming going to the next topic the
right language right language is the
preferred in the language of preferred
mode of communication so that means we
are assuming that for we have a database
of for everybody that we know what their
language of preferred communication is
but because of privacy considerations
this information may not be available
however it is possible for us to create
a database of location-based language
you know so if you know where the person
is supposed to be at that particular
time from the service provider logs then
you can send them a message in the local
language it could be you know marathi or
Swahili or something else and and
you do that because you know where they
are and that i'm not sure that your
database exists if not we can i'm sure
create it and that should not be a big
problem secondly once you have the
information about the preferred language
of communication then we need to kind of
take the message from english or
whatever however we generated it and
translate it into the local language and
then once we translate it it may be it
may have to be converted by using
text-to-speech into local speech and and
then play it out and so the translation
systems are not that perfect they still
in a but well I don't know about
microsoft google claims they have a
d-plus pairs of a t squared language
translation that they can do at this
point and a speech-to-speech translation
is a little bit worse but i think people
are trying to get make progress and all
of them the right medium you know
basically we have two problems in the
world there is a problem of language
divide and literacy divide the language
divide is you know can translate from
one language to the other and if most
people four billion people don't read
English or Chinese or European languages
then text message in English is not
adequate the literacy divide is even
more serious problem there are about a
billion people that can't read anything
they are illiterate right so so to reach
every person on the planet then you know
messages may need to be sent in all
different media to all different devices
and now you're kind of swamp in the
system with all kinds of data client so
so the issue maybe if there is a
database which tells you what what kind
of information to send where but the you
know it turns out all of us live on
multiple devices sometimes we use a
laptop sometimes we use a cell phone
sometimes we
even even smaller devices perhaps and if
you knew which is the current unit that
i'm using then it's easy to send if you
didn't have it then you may have to send
it to owner to all of them so one of the
things i complain about is if you're
using cell phones there are
notifications you get right and but I
said why can't I get the same thing in
my email because I may not be looking at
my eye I think there's no reason today
why I can't get the same notification
that you know you're you just issued an
email or from somebody or a notification
about some news item but it could come
as a subject line a short message
subject line in email also but that
people have not gotten to that stage of
saying it should be device-independent
communication and so I think we'll get
there and finally the right level of
detail summarization is an active area
of research around the world I'm sure
there's a lot of work here at Microsoft
but what is not yet clear to me is there
are other kinds of summarization that we
may need to do summarization of speech
summarization music summarization of
images and video and art and movies
including you know three and half hour
football games where which can be
summarized to one hour half hour 15
minutes I believe this is being done it
is being done semi manually you know
basically what you do is all the key
whence you flag manually and then the
system looks around the video and then
flips appropriate parts but I think
ultimately we need to be there is no
reason why we shouldn't be able to do
all of that fully automatically so so
the the other difficult problem is
context-aware summarization you know
basically different summarization for
experts in
offices and summarization of movies for
young children which might leave out
some things whereas for adults so
basically there are lots of interesting
issues so all of that leads to what is
the nature what is the solution for this
problem of getting the right information
to the right people at the right time
frame in the right language in the right
level of detail granularity so we are
proposing to get the right information
to the right people that every person on
the planet will have access to a
smartphone with an embedded personal
guardian angel if it doesn't have an
embedded software that that is aware of
guardian angel requirements then it's
much harder to wake up this system and
then provide the right information so a
definition of a guardian angel you say
guardian angel is a virtual avatar that
provides future aware computation it
knows about things that you have no
reason to know and and it whispers in
your ear that a tornado is heading your
way so what we are envisioning is not
just one guardian angel in your phone
but a facebook of guardian angels
society or social network of guardian
angels all of whom are talking to each
other and know what each other knows
that means then they they not only know
what I should know but Delta this is
very important because if they can talk
to each other and share anonymized
information about what kinds of things
have affected other people and how they
they were able to resolve resolve them
then that becomes input to this guardian
angel and so this component is part of
what this size
sometimes called transfer learning where
if somebody knows the answer I know the
answer and I know the answer because the
person that knows the answer has similar
properties he's in the same location has
the same language or same age group or
same you know you know expectations or
whatever and based on the similarity of
of interests and personalities and
properties now these guardian angels can
share information this makes it
extremely powerful not only do I know
what I know not only do I know what my
my own agent can know now I'm saying I
know what you know and what your agents
now too much information no no but
that's where that's where the whole
issue I'll come to that in a minute but
you know basically you know hg wells you
know imagine such a world of
interconnected global brain and and i'll
tell you about what he said in a minute
so and these guardian angels their
social network is sharing anonymized
knowledge and and we understand how to
do that with publish-subscribe
mechanisms of social networking so that
the issue then is where you have too
much knowledge i as a person don't have
to look at seven billion pieces of
information all I'm looking for is
anything happening in my neighborhood
all anything happening to other people
like me and so on that's where we
already understand the solution search
called search technology you know i have
7 billion posts or something and I need
to only know the few that really impact
me and we understand how to do search a
very large databases of that kind right
exactly so I think this should be done
and it is and so you're sharing this
anonymous knowledge so getting the right
information is a big idea if and it's if
everybody has to get this information
there are lots of issues just the
question that was just asked or how do
we filter out all the data glut and only
get the right information how do we
determine what right information might
be for each person on the planet and I
am assuming if I have a guardian angel
it's taking care of my information not
yours and not anybody else's but taken
together I'm assuming there's a huge
amount of computation being expended
across all the planet in some sense and
so how do we know what is of interest to
each of them how do we communicate with
their you know each of these guardian
angels and so on so that there's a whole
set of design issues of that kind that
come up so what we imagine the guardian
angels to have have that like a nap
except they're on steroids if you want
to think of it and they're also not like
a nap in that they're always on the
residing on the cloud they're always
present in always working and their
lifelong you know you don't kind of turn
on and turn off and tap like a nap
they're always on there they're working
all the time and their autonomic and
non-intrusive their autonomic in the
sense you know you know just like your
heart is beating they're always kind of
doing the thing they're supposed to be
doing and more importantly they're not
intrusive we don't want them to
interrupt you all the time and saying
this thing is happening that thing is
happening for example I get alerts all
the time like stupid things like there's
a meeting reminder the meeting reminder
should not drink a bell or anything it
should appear on my screen perhaps where
and other than that is right now they go
out of the way to make a nuisance of
themselves for meeting event if there's
an emergency by all means I I need that
so there must be distinctions between
the nature of the interruption
the non-intrusive part is very central
to success of these things because
people will turn them off completely or
are not even carry them if if they
become a nuisance and they must always
learn continuously learning what things
are similar what things are not and
insofar as we're just talking about when
some error is made how does a person let
the guardian angel know the you didn't
do the right thing here and then how
does it figure out and learn from the
errors you know that turns out to be a
very central part in these kinds of
systems always learning and there must
be device independent if they should not
assume you know the information is being
sent to one kind of device if I'm
wearing have a cell phone or a watch
phone or a laptop I should get the
information in all of them and the only
issue is ideally if it knows exactly
which one I'm using it should only send
it to that if it doesn't know that
information can send it all of them but
as soon as it sees that I've used one of
them it should wipe out the other two so
the idea is to protect me from this data
glut all the time it is the problem that
so the question is these guardian angels
they monitor the activities all the time
what's that whatever is happening in the
world and then they analyze all that
data this is by searching for things
that are relevant to this location this
for you to be a person with this kind of
activity and then learn from that
experience I've learned from own
experience and experience of others and
share the knowledge with the community
of guardian angels so automated
discovery of data and information
information sources becomes one of the
requirements of these kinds of things
everything I'm saying here is a
non-trivial problem it hasn't been done
but they're doable they're not something
that we
shy away from so the next task is
functionality right of the guardian
angels the personal guardian angel must
continuously derive future courses of
actions from local observation their
facebook of guardian angels will be able
to know all the disruptive events that
might affect your life and your personal
guardian angel can also assist you in
day-to-day problem solving it doesn't
have to be a hurricane it can be what is
an alternative route it gets to an
accident and so on so that's the kind of
functionality we are imagining these
guardian angels might have as I said
earlier every guardian angel is always
on continuously monitoring and
accumulating large amount of episodic
knowledge right this data suitably
anonymized can be used to learn
appropriate responses for each possible
situation so that means the learning
technology that you have to build easier
to learn preferences by observing
devices learn task similarity and uses
similarity learn error correction learn
by error correction and simply learning
through clarification dialogue and all
of them are different kinds of learning
component that we need to build into
these systems and not everything is that
what do we mean by task similar I didn't
use the similarity learning how do you
learn from clarification dialogue when
the system makes an error or something
so there will be enough data in this
case is so that it probably will be the
one of the big and large big data
problems that the world will face
so the next set of issues that
implementation infrastructure issues one
is I am assuming by 2020 everyone and
the planet has an access to a smartphone
and global connectivity this may be a
tall order of this only 76 years from
now it may not happen but I think it can
be made to happen and i'll come back to
that issue of how can you force this to
happen but by what i mean by have access
to a smartphone if you're in a family
not everybody has to have one initially
even if every family has one that may be
enough but later on you know if you're
kind of rich and in a city maybe
everybody will have one but in you know
remote areas even having won the harder
problem is connectivity you know right
now large parts of the globe are not
connected and the three quarters
quarters the blow which is the oceans
are definitely not connected easily and
even the rest of the globe they're
talking about flying balloons and drones
and all kinds of things to get
connectivity I think there is no simple
solution and it's but if it's the cost
is limited and bounded the cost of
getting everybody connected is about two
hundred billion dollars and it's a
one-time cost and if you think about it
and you know the the gross national
product of us United States is like
about 20 trillion dollars the gross
world product is about a hundred
trillion dollars so we're talking about
connecting the whole world two hundred
billion dollars compared to 100 trillion
dollars is point two percent
and it's a one-time cost and it'll be
there for the next you know 100 years if
you're in the to it 200 billion dollars
is if you want to connect to the last
mile with Wi-Fi wimax white Phi in a one
that was done here at microsoft research
all of that that using all the
technologies you can get connected my
vision is everybody should be connected
at a gigabit there is absolutely no
reason not to do that even wireless
technologies will be there at a gigabit
if you know and we need to work towards
it but most of the people in cities and
towns and even some villages nearby
there on the main main route can get
gigabit connection directly through
fiber and the reason it's two hundred
billion dollars is the last mile
connectivity that's the expense and
otherwise you can do the whole global
connectivity for about twenty billion
dollars one tenth of the cost every
country and every major city will be
connected but that still leaves out a
lot of people that are not connected
once you get the device and connectivity
out of the way which are big problems
then you also need your own personal
computational resources and I am
assuming given the way things are going
with you know cloud computing and free
free free resources Microsoft is giving
everybody seven gigabytes for free on
the onedrive today so I immediately
signed up I have free free Beverly from
google revelry from Microsoft revenue
from Dropbox everybody and so I end up
having like 20 30 GB of online resources
for free and so I'm saying unlimited
computation unlimited memory and
unlimited bandwidth must be the goal and
i believe it's doable because every cell
phone if you look at it
the computation involved in the for
NVIDIA chips that are in the cell phone
is closely a supercomputer power of 10
15 years ago every second it already has
that so if we assume everybody has a
cell phone then maybe what I'm saying it
is not so unreasonable and so the issue
of you know cloud computing for
prediction and notification most of the
work is done on the cloud because
they're always on always working car
cognitive agents all that they you're
doing on the on the platform mobile
platform is the rendering of the result
so the programming on the mobile
platform becomes much more simpler
you're not and you program it once and
then only it in rendering is if you have
ten different devices and iPhones and
Android phones and windows mobile phones
it's not a big deal having all of them
work work smoothly so the next two
topics is one is cost and the other one
is privacy the cost if you know if you
assume there's seven billion people and
the cost of your device now is like 200
billion we are talking about two hundred
dollars we're talking about 140 billion
dollars I think we can reasonably assume
there will be down to about fifty
dollars may have been people like Eric
Schmidt talk about twenty dollars what
phones it'll happen but not immediately
but it may be somewhat brain-dead namely
may not have 16gb of memory or not
whatever but you know if it is fifty
dollars now we're talking about 350
billion dollars of cost now if you take
my number of 100 trillion dollar gross
world product the cost of 350 is only
like point three percent one-time costs
and if you do you know assume that
you'll use the phone for 45 years it is
less than 0.001% in point one percent so
we should not scare be scared away
there's another reason for it
we scared away the estimate is the
growth in economic activity by the
networking effect of seven billion
people interconnected if 1 billion
people are connected and then go to
seven you are talking about seven
squared impact you know 50 times more
activity and and the predictions are I
don't have exact numbers there will be
economic growth as a result of their
connected network effect of between ten
to thirty percent of gross world product
that means by investing 350 billion
dollars plus another 300 billion dollar
to hundred billion dollars in
connectivity you may be creating
economic activity of 30 trillion dollars
so it will kind of more or less pay for
itself in one month if not a one month
eight letter universe six months or a
year it's still worth it and it's worth
it even if it's black house more more
time than that the second one the second
big elephant is the privacy namely we're
assuming these guardian angels can share
information with each other the question
is what information are they sharing do
you want everybody to know where you are
or where you're sleeping that night
maybe not and so the question is I know
what what you have to assume you and
your guardian angel are one and the same
anything you know there it knows but
just because it knows it's like your
consciousness knowing knowing what you
know it doesn't mean your privacy is
violated the question is what
information can it genuinely share with
other social in the social network of
guardian angels so that others can also
benefit from it and so on that
anonymization research has not been done
fully we do an animation now but and
what I'm saying is at the worst case I
already know where every cell phone is
throughout because that information is
known to the cell provider service
providers it is logged
it can be found out by Anna subpoenaed
by the government's if you want in that
sense there are certain things that are
beyond your control but it may not know
precise GPS location where you're
sleeping that night but you know it
knows within one square mile mile
kilometer a few square kilometers where
you are that may be enough it's where
most of the events like tornadoes and
earthquakes and typhoons that may be
enough but it would be better if we can
get more crisper information and the
other thing I'm saying is there is no
breach of privacy since each guardian
angel only shares information already
known to to service providers and other
nearby agents you know whatever it's
happening to you it's also happening to
your neighbor and so it's not as though
the information that is being broadcast
or is personal information you know
saying who else is in bed with you kind
of thing that's not the issue here
unless of course there are two cell
phones in the same room and their
they're sharing that information even
then it's not clear that anybody else
needs to be in a told that information
so so there's not much i believe it's
it's an acceptable level of loss of
privacy that's already we are not doing
anything new it's already gone because
the government says everybody must the
location information must be kept and
logged that's part of the the current
system so this brings me to the end of
the talk basically there was a very you
know kind of visionary book by hg wells
about a hundred years ago maybe maybe
eight years ago no eight in the eighth
nineteen thirty i think it was something
where he imagined a global brain this
global brain he was a synthetic super
mind within the species of Homo sapiens
sapiens
and you know he envisioned the
superhuman intelligence is to represent
the ultimate unification of all
knowledge of all the memory and memory
of all the people I think the way we and
I the instantiation I think of is I
think now we can accomplish that by
connecting our guardian angels we don't
have to come back pretty I you know and
my electrodes in our brain we just
connect all the guardian angels into
your social network and they will be
able to monitor analyze and learn from
their own experience and experience with
the others and share anonymize knock
knowledge through publish-subscribe
mechanisms finally so the grand
challenge for the 21st century as I see
it he's the creation and deployment of
guardian angel technology for providing
the right information to every man woman
and child on the planet and this will be
a disruptive technology if we succeed in
the IT ecosystem because right now at
Microsoft everybody is thinking about
the billion people and what they can do
for the billion people nobody is
seriously saying if I have 7 billion
people answering service or by surveying
and they all have different needs they
are not the same needs as the the most
professional billion people that use the
technology today it's the same thing
that happened in the 60s we were you
having mainframes in the 70s we had
minis in the 80s we had pcs with 90s we
had networks and the and the 20 in 2010
we are having mobile systems now the
issue is as you go to this newer systems
the requirements of computation become
completely different and we need a
different mindset to think about what
will those people need and what can we
work on now that will actually be truly
revolutionary at the time so why my
prediction is given we are willing to
spend point one percent of the global
war product the
we will save fifty to eighty percent of
deaths every year and the number of
deaths accidental deaths globally are
about two to three million every year
large number of them are automotive
accidents I think the self-driving cars
will eliminate a lot of them already but
you know the I think even things like
earthquakes and other natural disasters
annual number of deaths are like ten
twenty thousand which you know by the
time you add up that's in the United
States you add up the whole world where
they don't have as good warning systems
the kind of accumulates so if we can
eliminate fifty to eighty percent of
those deaths accidental deaths that
would be fantastic and I think it is
worth doing and it's my view is
Microsoft should adopt this project and
do it okay thank you very much you talk
two pieces of government
hey al cumple yeah basically let's never
go back there for a minute so basically
what I said here was there is a way of
making it happen and as a you know there
are four stakeholders the government is
one of them the manufacturers of the
phones is the second one they know whoa
Nokia and all of them the telecom
service providers will arise in and AT&amp;amp;T
and china mobile and Airtel and so on
are they and finally Microsoft's and
Google's of the world that would benefit
from having all this infrastructure I'm
saying each of them should kick in one
quarter of the cost to the South
smartphone which is nothing and and
because you're saying I'm going to give
it away my proposal is don't give it
away rent it away or simply say we'll
give you a free phone a starter kit
after a year you are now more
sophisticated you want something better
one will sell it to you for for a small
increment in cause now you recycle the
old one to somebody else who doesn't
have one yet and so the as you're
creating a market space where this whole
thing can be done connect connectivity
is a different matter that requires all
the governments to come together there
is was a thing called Intel sad that was
created in the 60s I don't know if you
remember it this Facebook eats doing
this two guys they're buying the drones
they bought a drawn company or something
or and no no it's basically Google and
Facebook and everybody's struggling to
find a solution to the global
connectivity problem they all see this
is coming they all see that the
smartphones are going to go from two
hundred three hundred dollars to fifty
dollars to twenty dollars and they all
see that whole market will open up
instead of just 1 billion or 1.5 billion
people now connected it will go eat very
quickly by 2022 45 billion by 20 30 50
I under cleaner all of them whether we
do anything or not whether we do
guardian angel technology said not and
they're kind of saying what is that
market what do we need to do how do we
connect up all of them and that's why
you know facebook is willing to pay you
know 17 billion dollars for whatsapp
because it gets them connected to a lot
of people that don't have smartphones
they just use a messaging investment
some of that you do we don't have that
costs include kind of concealer from
here the teacher what site do if you can
reach some brilliant it was popular
people habit an activity you can really
actually make that copy angeles i'm
guessing that even if you connect to 100
million it will be useful so you can
begin UD in a prototyping and testing
the technologies right away the all i'm
saying is if if everybody is connected
then there is this networking effort you
basically even if i don't have
information about what what you know
your own situation if I know everything
happening in the neighbors then i can
assume you also have going to be
affected by the same thing and notify
you too and and so they say there's a
whole set of related issues of how to
scale up the thing but another important
challenge that you mentioned early on
other people know is become power your
loss so rightly that's not obvious how
to do that one he records kind of
intelligent to figure out what Pablo
usefully and that's the really reason it
don't ignore it doesn't have to be
useful all I'm saying is if you know a
hot stock market in a you want to
interested tell me about it to Iran
interest but the issue is you may not
want me to know you know you know
something said some because of insider
trading loss some people's trading you
know things have to be public but the
rest of us don't have to be told you
know be and so there are things that you
may or may not want to know
but what I'm amazed that surprised that
is what's the so called Facebook effect
rightly people seem to want to share you
in the darkest secrets it over with
everybody else you know I don't
understand that but that seems to be the
new ethos in the system you know and I'm
surprised young people so natural
liberal they want you know to shock
shock value maybe but I have no interest
at all in sharing what I'm doing and not
doing not me not because I there's some
secrets in there I don't think it's
interesting to anybody else why wouldn't
it why would they know that is true that
is true interesting i I'm told the
reason why so many people spend so much
time on the facebook is this wire ism
effect namely they want to know what is
everybody else is doing you know it's
just the curiosity of what do you want
everybody outside it seems that an
interesting ability won't be differences
that's I hopefully be human
so this entire personal an angel thing
is really nice but I have one slight
doubt in my head about it when I think
and it's that it's very good to address
so if you just take the needs of every
person on the planet all right it's
going to be a very heavy air
distribution and for me when I think
about it it's a very good infrastructure
to actually address just the commonality
part it's not the more personalization
of the more heavy day part and I think
getting to that is where actually it
becomes really feasible and becomes
really really more challenging just
getting with this particular part just
alerting me about disasters of these
sort of things it's fine but there is
there are just certain things which a
very very few set of people just get
back in there addressing that becomes a
huge issue what you're saying is where
it so that's how the current IT market
is behaving basically you look at what
Google now does all that they do is they
will tell me about some restaurant or
something you know the things that they
think everybody wants to know my view is
the long-term f you know benefit is
heavy personalization mass customization
of everything so that every person is
able to get personalized knowledge and
solutions to their problems and I
believe we are at a stage we can begin
to think about it now what you're saying
is that tail maybe you know but it's
only if a human being has to program it
becomes a big deal if I can invent
autonomic in a system that learn with
experience and share that experience
then it may not be so bad even if only
the it's like the usenet you know people
the community is that 50 people with a
common interest get together from all
over the world in the usenet because
that they are interested in that small
topic and in that sense I think we you
know is both an opportunity and a need
to kind of serve this the tail and if we
can figure out how to say I serve the
tail without requiring lots of people
sitting and coding the stuff then I
think we'll get there
okay okay thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
