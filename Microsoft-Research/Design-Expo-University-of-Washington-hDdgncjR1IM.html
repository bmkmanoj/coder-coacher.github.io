you
so next up we've got our local
university you dove and they're going to
be talking to you about five the smart
band that keeps young people safe on
their nights out okay great thanks for
staying with us everybody we're almost
at the end we're students from
University of Washington and we're so
pleased to introduce you to vive the
smart band that uses sensor technology
to keep young people safe while they're
out partying sexual assault is a really
big problem in America every two minutes
there's a new victim eighty percent of
these victims are under the age of 30
and disturbingly one in five female
undergraduate students has experienced
attempted or actual sexual assault since
entering college our research shows us
that this is a really complicated
problem space many factors can
contribute to sexual assaults for both
perpetrators and victims these include
amongst many others psychological issues
childhood trauma or abuse and gender
stereotypes substance abuse also plays a
role we spoke with a representative of
the sexual assault activists the
University of Washington and she
highlighted to us the close relationship
specifically of alcohol with sexual
assault so we dug deeper here and it
turns out four to five college students
drink many many of them binge drink this
behavior determined our target audience
and our design direction we saw an
opportunity for technology to intervene
with college-age drinkers who go out and
party now there's a cultural phenomenon
amongst this age group of yolo or you
only live once where safety might be
perceived as a buzzkill so our aim here
was to intervene in high-risk
alcohol-fueled social situations to
reduce the occurrence of sexual assault
and keep young people safe without
killing their fun and now we're very
aware of how difficult this is so our
challenge became designing a Trojan
horse where the safe was inserted into
the young people's scene without feeling
overbearing and so we present to you
vibe vibe is a smart wristband with
integrated sensors that monitors users
biometrics related to alcohol
consumption and keep them synced up to
their designated party groups so their
friends are alerted if things start to
get out of control
interactions of five are simple you put
it on touch it to your phone and a
vibration lets you know you've synced
with your facebook profile joining your
band to utter your friends bands creates
your party group you're synched with
them for the rest of the night the band
senses your alcohol consumption and
dehydration level which has a relation
to alcohol consumption once five senses
you're drinking it starts to check in
with vibrations that remind you to be
aware of yourself and your surroundings
a squeeze tells by your fine if you
don't dismiss a check-in or your band is
removed without your authorization your
friends will be alerted you can also
manually alert your friends at any time
with an extended squeeze and hold we
talked about a Trojan horse of safety
that doesn't kill the fun vibe is about
connections not only connecting you to
your party group but also meeting new
people as well physically touching your
band to another band since friend
requests to each other up in the fun
factor now that you're familiar with 5
we'd like to show you how it has the
potential to intervene in the party
scene and keep young people safe hey
it's Alex's birthday to celebrate
shortenin Kate surprised Alex for the
night out to see their favorite DJ
Rosie the rhythm
I've heard the club tickets with by this
not banned that keeps friends connected
and up to the fun factor
add the venue the girls exchanged it
tickets for fives to gain entry they
quickly link the band's to their
Facebook profiles sync up with each
other to phone their potty group and
into the crowd but it's no fun to watch
DJ Rosie without a tree point to as the
night goes on go 510 to their alcohol
and dehydration the fan fibrates at
intervals prompting them to self check
their surroundings and their mental and
physical state a simple squeeze of the
band indicates they're having fun and
are in control the bills used by to
connect with people they meet throughout
the night it's a devoted
so what happens when you're not in
control five has been monitoring Alex's
drunkenness and when she fails to
dismiss its latest chicken vive alerts
her party group
looking around they spot Alex and
quickly remove her from the high-risk
situation
as the guys five checks in he realizes
that perhaps he's had too much to drink
vibe has intervened and kept both
parties out of a bad situation the girls
and Alex returned to celebrating her
birthday they're having so much fun Alex
jumps on stage to connect with Rosie
herself
over 2 a.m. bugger to cure the drunk
munchies the girls review ol aha and not
so hot people they connected with at the
show they head home after a fun and safe
birthday celebration thanks to buy so
now as you saw in the video vibe
leverages some already existing social
technological networks when you go out
with a group of friends you're looking
out for each other in five simply
enhances the social contract now each
Orson's body processes alcohol
differently and because of this Vybez
multiple sensor safeguards in place the
first of which is a transdermal alcohol
sensor this measures ethanol levels that
excrete it to your skin another sensor
monitors your dehydration if either your
dehydration or day or alcohol levels are
at dangerous levels then your party
group is automatically alerted another
set of sensors are a gyroscope and
accelerometer this is used to sense a
total lack of motion if our examples
users passed out for connectivity
Bluetooth 4.0 and store their bands and
bands to the phone from the phone we get
gps and Wi-Fi triangulation to provide
locations of friends in need this is
only activated if an alert goes off
there's a larger picture of sexual
assault we want to make it clear we're
not naive about this and we're not
claiming that vibe can prevent all
sexual assaults alcohol does play a role
here however and once an individual has
been severed from the safety of her or
his social network and they encounter a
predator there sadly very little that
can be done to help so with vibe were
intervening at that point of increased
vulnerability with regular check-ins for
initial market entry we envision vive
replacing wristbands at ticketed events
like raves and concerts just like 3d
glasses the bands can be returned to
venues at the end of the night wiped
charged and reused to keep costs down
eventually we see vive having the
potential to become autonomous a
ubiquitous party accessory don't leave
home without just like your ID and
finally in terms of feasibility what we
propose is possible today at the moment
by vis a concept the conversation with
an expert at the University of
Washington tells us integrating sensors
into the band now wouldn't make it
overly bulky and with the
miniaturization of technology we
envisioned by having the potential to be
a sleek attractive and powerful tool in
the near future thank you so much for
your time
I can't believe Liz didn't get up and
dance like I'm going to get a banana
that was amazing that I mean that blows
away every policy my Dean or president
has ever come up with for for drinking I
think you've just you nailed it in terms
of getting that it had to be fun yeah
and people want to do it I loved your
language around tapping people at the
moments of vulnerability I thought that
was brilliant and beautiful i love your
careful construction of how this is
actually going to play out that this
replaces the wristband it did make me
because you're so good i'm going to push
you on this it to make me ask the
question of many bad things happen after
you leave the bar so once you return the
band what happens so our premise with
this concept is really that we're trying
to even just with a visible wristband
create some extra level of awareness you
know my friends are looking out for me
and I'm being watched and making people
more aware of their decisions as they
progress through the night and so our
space is this initial social scene and
we're not trying to solve all sexual
assault and so of course once the band
is off you know other mechanisms already
in play need to come in but but we feel
that again with that extra level of
awareness we hope that some of those
ensenes are already prevented somewhere
along the way before it gets to a nasty
situation just quickly it's a marker of
success if somebody says why can't this
be everywhere that's effectively what
I'm asking that question the other part
two is that it's the idea of like a
neighborhood watch where you start
seeing all those signs that come up you
know there is research has been done
into it that it does lower activity
there just because you don't know if
it's the people are actually watching or
if there is some
in place so something like that was what
we were kind of thinking about with it
so so um first of all wonderful job
again just haven't spent too much time
around film making uh that film could be
a feature film quality I the editing the
shooting the scripting the acting was
that method acting or did you ever re hi
far beyond pretty slushy during it but
yeah those real my roommates so yeah so
so none of its its it was to the point
and what I want to just back off and
generally think about this is why this
is not what I love doing this because
it's it's not going to generalize over
the all things that the standard of
video and presentations has been
outstanding and yet notice the
difference in the visual language of the
film's each one had its own language
which is appropriate for the thing and I
think that that that says that not only
have great technique but but you have
great choice of choosing which language
and vocabulary to use for this
particular project and that that's again
comes back to what's the appropriate
representation for the message you're
trying to communicate and you absolutely
got that right now that the other part I
just want to say is that there's this
other generalization and it actually why
design is always about multiples it's
not about single thanks and then then
unfortunate things you'll get to talk
about you don't get to show your
prototype somewhere you didn't go what
you went down but we get luckily we get
that because of the juxtaposition of the
other presentations so you can take back
to the the big day care the children's
thing earlier there's the same wristband
well guess what when you're out leave
the bar you still got it because you had
it since kindergarten and and and and
but what's even fascinating is that you
had much of the same language in terms
of it has to be fun UK it's not about
putting a criminal's bracelet so you can
track them much so the house can find it
it's got to be fun and do that you came
and exactly same questions exactly the
same approach but you had a very
different rendering if you will in terms
of what the nature the fun was or that
but also it wasn't just what they're
similar there in the technology but
what's fascinating is the underlying
social network on which it's based it
was different with the kids
it's a star fanning out from the teacher
out in a arcs going out from a central
hub if you will where's in yours it's a
it's a it's an ad-hoc network amongst a
self-organizing the social network and
and and the things involved you can
imagine now going to the third one for
agent people at where for health
monitors and and so on but you can
actually see that from this this kind of
concept they all look physically similar
but by actually doing these probes of
these types of exercises you can do at a
level of a class project you can start
to get larger picture and actually step
back go meta and figure out what the
what are the consistent issues that go
arpan across the whole thing and which
are the ones that let you tailor it for
the specific instances but that already
helps you start to think about the space
and so individually did great and and
actually this is just for you know man
Lillian gang for putting this together
let's let's us all get inside some time
and it's it's really really interesting
you can't just deal what you can't just
do one thing echo everything they said
but I want to touch on one thing i want
to touch on the moment when you got me
and it's a moment that every researcher
in this building in this campus needs to
hear about it's the moment when you
point it out that the reason this works
is because of intentionality this is not
just yet another accelerometer band
tracker if there's zillions of those the
reason i would invest in this and not
all of those is because of this because
it relies on me a human being to make a
gesture and that gesture says to my
friends I'm okay you allowed the human
being to be part of the system and that
is brilliant and that is not the unit of
things that is good that is good design
keep doing good design thank you
are there any other questions from the
audience I really love the presentation
but I think you guys have another
selling point here that you guys didn't
even touch upon because it's really
great that you know the friends are
constantly checking in and you have the
person being able to check in as well
but the person just by wearing the
wristband is marked they are there is an
entire team of people watching that
person and they are immediately safer
because of it and i think that would
only add the the amazing product you
have going here and i guess that's all i
have using a mobile devices to increase
you know the quality of sex life and and
that's what the first brief was and then
it was really interesting how this whole
thing shifted to you know safety in the
end higher quality meeting people which
is the essence of you know being a life
in a sense so awesome congrats
and that was Axl Rose but Professor that
worked with this close to pick y'all
