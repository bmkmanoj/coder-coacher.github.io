hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
okay so now next up we have Richard
Anderson I've known Richard for many
years I think I met him when I was a
grad student I think so Richard I think
a lot how many people have heard of
classroom presenter or refused yeah so
most people here know Richard pretty
well if not personally at least by his
work which has made a huge impact so
Richard got his PhD from Stanford but
ever since then he's basically been at
Washington maybe a one-year break in
between but has been at Washington
University making a huge splash in the
world of Penn &amp;amp; Pitt computing his
classroom presenter he started you know
well combining with Microsoft and
University of Washington so he's always
had a really close relationship with
Washington we're very lucky to have him
because he is just down the street
essentially so quite exciting and
classroom presenter as i said before has
made a huge impact I know in my research
it was stuff that inspired a lot of what
we've done in my lab for many years
after its it is a work that inspired
probably many of you and many of you
have used in the classroom as high
school teachers and whatnot so it's
affected the lives of thousands tens of
thousands of students instructors maybe
even hundreds of thousands at this point
who knows over the years I think that
might be a reasonable number so we're
very excited he's going to talk about
the reflections on that and we're going
to try to encourage him to bring it back
out alive probably at the end because it
has made such a huge impact and it still
is making an impact people are still
using it in their research so without
further ado okay thank you very much but
that it's a tremendous tremendous honor
to be speaking here and I've certainly
touched when I got the invitation and
kind of the opportunity to kind of talk
about this and this is a very honest
talk in the sense that i really did
reflect about classroom presenter when i
put it together and kind of dredging
through old notes and old powerpoint and
old email you're discovering that a lot
of things happened around classroom
presenter and there was you know a
tremendous number of different inputs
and ideas and yo a very very strong
community that what i'm talking about it
even if i do talk about things in the
first person that classroom presenter
represents work by a lot of different
people that i think there's a ton of
very good ideas in classroom presenter
because they came from my students they
came from collaborators they came from
random emails from elementary school
teachers around the world so this really
is very broad a lot of a lot of inputs i
made this happen that when i used to
talk about give talks on educational
technology I would often start by this
slide with this slide and this is
something that one of my graduate
students Steve Wolfman found somewhere
so Samuel may was a obscure historical
figure and in his memoirs he has this
great quote that in 1813 he attended a
mathematical school came across this
incredible technology a blackboard and I
think this is a fantastic quote because
it captures so many important things
that one thing that it captures is we
don't think of a
blackboard is being technology as
educational technology because it's so
successful the other thing I think is
amazing about this quote and thinking
about it with respect to education is
why is a blackboard so important for
lecture and education that what does it
provide that the blackboard compared to
not having one is first a place that you
can write information for a shared
perspective on information it's a way of
providing an extended memory it's a way
of emphasizing it's a way of stepping
through a diagram and animating so it
provides the teacher a lot of
affordances that were not available
otherwise and that's kind of what
motivated us in our technology work is
thinking of how do we provide new
technologies to use in the classroom so
classroom presenter is is a very very
simple tool and idea that what it is is
it's a way of putting ink on PowerPoint
slides that that it has a couple views
it has an instructor view a presentation
view it has a set of ink based controls
to make it easier for the instructor we
found the filmstrip view was a nice way
of making slide slides available giving
instructor control one idea that I was
suggested to us is why don't we put
notes only available to the instructor
on the slides so little cheat sheet
little cheat notes for the instructor
you're some fact some proof something
only appears to the instructor a
reminder on a point to make so only
appear for the instructor don't appear
on on the public display that in
classroom presenter we had three main
scenarios for use of the tool first as
an it first for the instructor giving a
lecture just writing on the slides
second as a tool for a distributed
classroom so I'm lecturing here my
slides are simultaneously shown in a
classroom at say university of
washington and a final scenario of
integration of student devices with the
instructors device so for for class or
presenter I actually have a very very
clear memory of where it came up came
about and you'll really understand the
whole genesis of the idea so 2001 I had
a sabbatical from University of
Washington I had the opportunity to join
the learning science technology group
here at microsoft in redmond in a
distributed classroom project and so the
idea was to create a classroom that
would link together multiple
universities for computer science
courses that i had also been supervising
our distance program at university of
washington computer science and had to
deal with the instructors and my
colleagues just hated to teach the
distance courses and so as formative
work for my clap for the distributed
classroom project i sat down with
colleagues looked at their lectures
talked with them and john zawahri an
really articulated the problem of
teaching the distance classes with the
critique that it wasn't the distance
class it was the overly structured class
that came about from having
strict PowerPoint lecture and then I
looked as that in some of our classes we
had an electronic whiteboard set up
along with the slides and notice that
whenever someone used the electronic
whiteboard it was in the context of the
slide that was being used and so you
based on that it just seemed let's try
to integrate the slides with writing and
so it was a very very clear genesis of
the idea for classroom presenter as
building a tool to use in a distributed
classroom allow the instructor to write
on his or her PowerPoint slides to
create flexibility in giving the lecture
that when i was at microsoft in 2001
this was when the tablet pc project at
microsoft was still under wraps that
there was a group inside one of the
buildings at microsoft that had started
the tablet pc that they had some initial
hardware that it was actually very very
hard even to get a prototype device
inside of Microsoft that we were very
very we felt very happy that we were
able to get a single one of the tablets
that we could work on for the project
pre-release so in terms of hardware
available that it was the initial acer
machines that were the first of the
tablets that some of the older people in
the room might remember devices such as
the HP what was the number on this that
TC 1100
and both the battery powered one and the
one with the active screen so so right
in kind of when I first heard about the
tablet pc at Microsoft that you know the
idea just immediately came came that we
really should be having better
experiences for inking on top of slides
so that led to the development of
classroom presenter developed inside a
inside the distributed classroom project
that the first version of classroom
presenter which demonstrates my UI
design skills and actually demonstrate
some of my programming skills as well I
so we launched classroom presenter as
part of conference XP for the
distributed classroom that I spent a
full year at Microsoft that at my end a
fee end of the year at Microsoft I moved
back to University of Washington to
continue it as computer in the computer
science department Microsoft did
something very very honorable at the end
of my year that of course when I signed
on to do a sabbatical at Microsoft I
signed away everything for six
generations and Microsoft had absolutely
no obligation to let classroom presenter
outside of its organization but when i
left the code for classroom presenter
was released to the public and in
particular it was released to me so
so yeah I've always appreciated that
Microsoft did make kind of the
appropriate step of of making it
possible to continue this this project
by your supporting it and also the legal
steps that back at University of
Washington we continued development of
classroom presenter that there were
versions two and three that and stepping
between versions two and three that
there were a lot of under the hood
changes to get to version 3 that there
were also quite a few things just in
terms of usability and workflow that
turned out to be very important even
though they weren't significant from a
technical standpoint so for example in
the initial version of classroom
presenter we had this deck builder tool
so the workflow was you took your
powerpoint you ran it through deck
builder you got a CSV file you loaded
the CSD file into classroom presenter
and just the step of bringing deck
builder inside of classroom presenter so
you were loading a PowerPoint was a
significant change in the workflow that
really removed a big barrier for
operation of course in the computer
science department I couldn't really say
Mairi major research contribution this
quarter has been moving deck builder
inside of classroom presenters so he can
load a dot PBT but it is the type of
very very significant change that was
necessary just to move classroom
presenter into something that was usable
so you know I learned a tremendous
amount in engineering and leading the
project for quite a few years and a lot
of it has certainly things that the P
who are developing products people who
take a user-centered design in
developing software understand and it
just can't be underestimated how much
kind of the simple workflow was
essential to getting getting classroom
presenter to work you know I think there
were a lot of good ideas in classroom
presenter and I can comfortably say this
because most of these ideas came from
other people and yeah I has actually
been frustrated that some of the ideas
haven't been just picked up and you run
with by other products so one that I
just loved and I maybe Beth Simon
suggested that Beth gave a lot of good
ideas to this project instructor notes
and our implementation of instructor
notes was inside a PowerPoint to provide
a macro that would allow you to tag
regions as instructor only and so then
when slides were displayed if you were
an instructor mode you could see them if
it's student mode or presentation mode
they would not show up and I've got some
colleagues who just relied on them
extensively for putting cheat notes on
on their slides that I found it really
very useful of from going from one
instructor to another to be able to make
these type of notes and make them
visible we're visible on the slide
another idea that turned out to be very
successful is the idea of being able to
shrink the slide to provide some extra
writing space so so this is an example
of the display of a slide that's big
shrunk so the top part would initially
display as a full slide a button and
presenter shrinks it by
by 33-percent providing this boundary to
write on and this is something that just
fits with instructor practice that you
start writing on a slide you need some
extra space and shrinking it keeping the
context providing the extra writing that
we tried many more complicated ideas
extra space but this simple idea has
been just a very very good match and
separating their instructor view from
the display with easy-to-use ink
controls that I've always been
flabbergast at the difficulty of using
the pen in PowerPoint and the challenge
of changing the color of the pen in
PowerPoint that boggles my mind but I
slide previews that inside the film
strip I'm moving the pan on on top of
the slides to get a blow-up view of what
the slide is just for facilitating
looking ahead that I this is something
we were able to get to work in a way
that it's fairly smooth and does not
trigger accidental slide transitions
another final idea which has been very
very helpful as just to have a simple
way of exporting all of the slides and
ink in HTML so after a lecture it takes
me just a couple minutes to slow put up
my inked slides on the web so you can
review where the writing was on the
slides I remember quite often getting
the comment of if you post your slides
with ink why will students come to
lecture and
I always thought that was kind of a
ridiculous comment to make as if the
incremental value of coming to lecture
was to see the ink going on the slides
and second looking at the ink is only
really useful if you were there that
almost all was the ink put on the slides
is really pretty incoherent it might
have been useful at the time seeing it
will trigger what was going on in the
classroom but just seeing the ink is not
value not that valuable outside of the
entire contact so I see this type of
archiving is really enhancing and
strengthening experienced the people who
are present as opposed to this view that
there's kind of a magical capture of the
class that will short-circuit the
process there were also some bad ideas
in classroom presenter and the baddest
idea the mall is one that I pushed for a
long time and thought was brilliant at
the time and it was really what was I
thinking idea so in version one of
classroom presenter we had this idea of
scrollable mylar inspired by the
overhead transparencies and so as an
instructor I would spit I'd spent a long
time lecturing with to write on this
role of transparencies and then you
would gradually you turn the crank and
move the writing up and create space
below and so the implementation in
classroom was presenter was fairly easy
in that we just attach to scroll a
scroll bar to the ink window so that you
could move this role barb down to move
the ink up and I thought you'd keep some
of it in the context of the slide and
you would make
more space any reactions as to why this
idea might stink so so it certainly kind
of violated how people use the ink yeah
right so right right the scrolling
didn't fit that that when you swarmed up
ink over it would no longer a line it
wouldn't fit I that there were also
usability things that it was never clear
whether you should scroll down to move
the Inca or scroll up to move the ink up
the real disaster was just with respect
to pen controls and seeing a lot of
people having accidentally scrolling the
ink so the scroll feature was something
that might be valuable in 2% of the
instances but it misfired far more often
than that so it's kind of an edge case
that weakened the core scenarios so this
was dropped from for the second version
of classroom presenter another idea that
we pursued was for integrating with
student devices to be able to have
students highlight areas of the slide of
interest or make direct comments on the
slides to draw attention to particular
areas and then this might be a way of
making it easier for students to
describe where they were having trouble
what points needed to be emphasized that
in classroom experiments this also did
not work particularly well on that that
one problem was just very very hard for
the instructor to react
to this information I and then there was
just the concern that it would be abused
or distracting that on the technical
side that one of the things that we
struggled with for a long long time was
just the distribution of slides to
student devices and multicast we use
multicast networking which was not
reliable and spent tremendous time
trying to get it to work another idea
that I'm negative on you can certainly
disagree with this is that we initially
looked at integrating student
note-taking with the classroom
presentation so students would have the
slides on their devices could take their
notes on on the slides and after having
experimented with it developed it that
the linking the note-taking with the
instructor did not seem to provide that
much value in my opinion one of the
things that we were very successful in
in classroom presenter and I've Ruth
who's in the audience Ruth I really
helped on promoting the idea of student
submissions so we had various ideas of
how do we get information back from the
students into the presentation and I'm
very very proud of what the mechanism
eventually turned into and there were a
lot of internal discussions around the
mechanics of this so the broad idea is
that we want to be able to have the
students do active learning exercises in
the classroom and we want to get them
back to the instructor and the
instructor to be able to then react to
that in the class so the way that
student submissions works is instructor
goes to a slide and the slide appears on
all of the student devices the students
then solve the exercise they hit a
submit button which sends their solution
to a film's to a slide deck on the
instructor machine the instructor then
will receive all of the student
submissions and then can review the
student submissions visually and decide
which ones to put on the public display
so first talk about the square then talk
about the circle and in doing this we
did have this very structured way we
thought of incorporating student devices
into the classroom and so it was around
having active learning exercises built
into the lecture so give students time
to reflect get the information back to
the instructor so the instructor can
analyze and assess and then give the
instructor the ability to share the the
results and discuss them with the
students so this kind of three-part
process that that from this there were a
wide number of faculty around the world
that utilize this in the classroom that
here a set of activities that I use in a
senior algorithms class so for example
in talking about topological sort
I give an example of the graph a graph
and ask the students to number though
the nodes in topological order and this
is this hat is designed so that it
actually is one that they cannot find a
topological order because it has a cycle
so there's a discovery process in the
exercise they discover it's impossible
and for example this particular student
identified the problem and turn that in
with their submission another type of
exercise was to give a somewhat
challenging problem to solve so that
students could kind of compete to see
who can find the best minimum cut in
this graph that these exercises do take
a moderate amount of work to come up
with of just hitting the right level of
difficulty so that it's not too hard not
too easy so there's advanced work in in
preparation that we have a fairly big
archive of different classes different
approaches different settings that have
used the in class act activities for
classroom presenter so one of the things
that we recognized quite early about
classroom presenter is that we were
actually going against the grain in a
lot of the discussions of Education and
pedagogy and you know it's doing
something basically reactionary so I've
been to many education conferences and
set sat through big talks presented in
PowerPoint about how awful lectures are
as a pedagogical approach and
proposing flipped classrooms and many
many learner-centered approaches of
dismissing the lecture as just being a
outmoded evil useless reactionary plot
yet lectures have quite a bit of
resilience and so we were really trying
to make the lecture of lectures better
so so thinking about how do we improve
the lecture and our view was improving
the lecture give the instructor more
flexibility during the class give the
instructor structured ways of
interacting with students and so really
thinking about how to improve the slide
based lecture another thing that put us
with odds with a lot of people is we
really did embrace PowerPoint as a tool
and think about the really important
positive aspects of PowerPoint and slide
based lectures and in particular
PowerPoint is very significant because
it provides a structured representation
of of a lecture something that can be
refined and iterated and we're very
excited about thinking about how do we
put better content and better mechanisms
for presentation in a setting into
PowerPoint really viewing the slide
artifact as a significant representation
of educational content so there were of
course many challenges
in the classroom presenter project and
challenges that led to a lot of time
being spent quite unproductive Lee that
the the biggest technical challenge that
we faced was we had this vision of
distributing slides to 30 or 40 laptops
in the classroom and this was years ago
with 802 11 B and if you just multiplied
the size of the slide deck times the
number of students and / the bandwidth
you would see that you might or might
not get everything to everybody by the
end of the hour and so so it was you're
just this challenge of how do you get
the bits to everybody in and spent a
long time we used multicast where
instead of sending one at a time to
people with error correction you would
send the bit simultaneously to everybody
but in the wireless environment some
slides some data would be lost so slides
would appear at different periodicity
Stu people and they would have this kind
of blank slide that eventually content
might or might not appear that the
frustrating thing was just how much time
we spent on this and I guess this is
kind of an example of a problem if you
wait long enough it goes away that for
the robust versions of classroom
presenter 3 it was just setting up
point-to-point communication between the
instructors machine and each of the
students too so individually sending the
slides to each each student worked out
another pain point was keeping up with
office and I guess just as kind of what
Java t
of classroom presenter of the versions
of office so each change of office would
lead to some require changes of
classroom presenter key thing and
classroom presenters we had to export
the office content into an image and
send the images to the mission different
machines there was one of these versions
of office added a whole bunch of new
fancy shadow fonts and glitter that was
completely useless but when these were
exported even something that just had a
simple banner turned into a hundred
megabyte slide image so these type of
things had to be fixed at each level you
know there were bugs introduced that the
instructor notes actually stopped
working with one of the versions and and
we were never able to resurrect them
which was very sorry about so challenges
in the software that there are some
challenges have to be recognized about
using something like classroom presenter
in the classroom and one is just this
issue of cognitive load while lecturing
that it's well known that your IQ drops
by 50% when standing up in front of
people
and and just kind of the simple
affordances such as keeping track of
what color the ink is on the pen and the
slides that I've seen interesting things
such as people who have one slide which
will be let's say dark blue background
and so they've chosen a yellow to be
writing on advanced to the next slide
which actually has a white background
and keep writing on yellow and yellow
and white is not the best inking style
I've seen this go on for kind of
multiple slides before it's observed or
noticed and so just the cognitive issues
that I think we've been quite successful
in your having the big colored buttons
and simple interface but complicated
things to do in an interface while
lecturing or are dangerous I another
thing that I've found to be really
tragic is watching some people give a
lecture from a tablet pc and the lecture
is given like this with heads down
facing the tablet and so focusing on the
writing no I content no eye contact and
I felt really guilty when I've watched
people who sacrifice the audience
interaction to just focus on the heads
down writing white boy or a black boys
with you back to the class yes I've
certainly had instructors who I didn't
see their eyes for three long proofs yes
yes a point taken Andy thanks that
another lecture environment challenge is
there's often this picture of some some
guy in a nice suit lecturing in front of
a large lecture
holding a tablet pc kind of writing
neatly on the slides as he's walking
across audience that you know I I'm
often kind of shaky enough and nervous
enough in class that the last thing I
want to be doing is holding my laptop
and just the fear fear of dropping it so
so kind of the physical affordances are
certainly an issue that come up that in
the course of classroom presenter that
we did lots of different things with the
tool though one of the things that was
really fun was spent a tremendous amount
of time just studying the ink people
wrote on slides and I've watched many
many lectures that in our master's
program we would record our lectures so
I would have both the lecture as well as
the ink and stepping through them that
one of the key things about how people
use a inking classes its integrated into
the slides that you often if you see the
ink and the slides and weren't there you
know what our church bullion's that
during the lecture the ink is very
important for identifying that where the
attention is making key points
emphasizing points but it is a very
transitory experience that we did a lot
of analysis of diagrams done in lecture
and very often a diagram would have a
series of phases so draw a little make a
point draw more make a point and so we
started to experiment with ways of
representing this and if you're going to
show an archive of the ink I've come up
with appropriate snapshots of when the
inking when the different pictures occur
that it actually seemed to be quite easy
just based on timing to figure out how
to phase and draw the diagram
you know we spent lots of time
understanding how different tick marks
were used and for where things are
sometimes kind of linking to show things
are connected and have this theory of
different annotation marks another thing
that is going to shock nobody but there
are a lot of mistakes on slides and so
just looking at the ink and classroom
presenter and seeing where people
correct mistakes on their slides and you
know seeing the number of these that I
thought a very useful tool and for an
instructor would be just something that
would allow an instructor to quickly
review the slides after lecture to then
make updates to the slides for the next
time the course was offered that I think
it's a good bet for all six of these
mistakes next time the course is offered
they're going to be there again and you
also thinking about how the inking can
actually feed back into instructor
review another kind of cool play thing
that we did is experimented with
different varieties of digital ink that
we never put these into the production
versions of classroom presenter here's
an ink that Craig prints developed that
allowed an illustration of how fast the
pen was moving here's an effect that's
that Craig developed which you allows
you to see overlap and layering of the
ink just with a simple trick of having
the main solid ink with a slight border
and detection effect you see in the clat
on the chalkboard where you can see
braun new chalk on top of old truck that
another boundary case that wasn't that
important but was fun to play with was
that if you're having multiple people
right from different tablets displaying
them on a common screen
do you overlap the ink so if I'm drawing
with a red pen jonathan is drawing with
a blue pen that we're drawing at the
same time and trying to overlap them
appropriately and there are just funny
things come up if you start it's natural
to draw link it ink in layers so it's
whatever layer is drawn on top wins and
so how do you get shared inking to do
the right thing ok so for classroom
presenter it was developed at University
of Washington over quite a few years
started with work at Microsoft large
number of student developers both
undergrads and graduate students that I
really do have to call out Fred videon
he is a staff program or at University
of Washington who has provided some
continued maintenance on classroom
presenter and for example he's the one
that fixes classroom presenter when a
new version of office comes out and a
new build needs to be made so having him
available for staff support I here's
something that I think is really cool
I'm how many people can read this how
many people can see that they can't read
it so this was just sits as open source
and you know having random people saying
I'm teaching in Greece can I localize it
and we actually had done the right
Microsoft localization methodology so
it's just putting together a translation
file so there's a French version of
Portuguese version of Greek version a
Taiwanese version a mandarin version and
so outside software developers
you know the community around classroom
presenter has always been you know very
very significant in lots of ways of just
the people that have picked it up around
the world your people got very excited
about tablets and using classroom
presenter as one of the ways of using
tablets that I adhere from people who
had made extensions around the world
many different places certainly a few a
number of very key advocates for the
project we had a number of workshops at
University of Washington and Microsoft
to bring together a classroom presenter
tablet pc community that yo for me it
was actually incredibly valuable in
getting and working with people at a
very wide range of educational
institutes around classroom presenter
that kind of in the research community
there's this kind of are one community
but a tremendous amount of exciting
innovation were happening at smaller
schools community colleges and so your
personally is very enriching just the
variety of educational institutions you
probably can't read this email right up
up at the top that I started to
communicate with someone at the
University of Jos in Nigeria and somehow
he had ended up with the donation of HP
tablets and a university and
northcentral nigeria and even in
2012-2013 he was still using the tablets
and yet for me it seemed like yeah this
guy he's one of last people still using
these tablets I've got to go see him and
I actually had a visit to Nigeria and
had arranged to visit their University
unfortunately got mail when I was in
Nigeria saying
I'm sorry universities on strike not
safe to come so I missed out my
opportunity to see what was going on in
this university of nigeria with
classroom presenter and tablets but
you're just exciting to see kind of the
range of adoption of Technology oh one
thing that has been just essential for
this type of enterprise has been the
support that it's received and this is
not the obligatory kind of comment at
the end of a talk supported by blah blah
and blah that in this type of work there
is kind of an issue that it only happens
if resources are made available and
there was a very substantial investment
by Microsoft and Microsoft Research in
tablets in tablets in education and in
me that yo one cannot employ graduate
students without money to pay for them
so it was the resources that HP also for
years had a very generous tablet pc
promotion program so you know this type
of work does not happen without the
right financial structures and so that
just has to be has to be recognized
another thing that I'm incredibly proud
of is how other people have taken
advantage of classroom presenter taken
the early codebase even some people in
this room and have done amazing
innovations on top of the codebase that
best Simon is someone who I got to know
a round classroom presenter that she
really wanted to take classroom
presenter and make it into a web base
stool via ubiquitous presenter and did
amazing things a set of innovations that
Kim blur Kimberly's work I think it's
just amazing in going way beyond what we
thought of rich interaction on the
student side and then tying it into a
review cycle and really understanding
how tablets captures people's actions
and thinking and gives can have
mechanisms for instructors understanding
what's going going on so it's you know
I'm just very proud to see of kind of
other people's innovation I think that
points to kind of the right way to think
of technology in education of how it
allows innovative things that are going
to strengthen the student instructor
interaction okay so I stopped doing
classroom presenter about 2008 that's
that we had a abortive effort to start
classroom presenter for in 2009 I kind
of started writing some code but did not
follow follow through on that and you
know certainly very mixed feelings
because very exciting work in classroom
presenter you know we were doing a lot
of interesting things you're kind of my
one sentence description of why moved on
was difficulty of doing of continuing to
do this work as part of a research
enterprise and you know one of the
things that's been great about classroom
presenter is a set of great graduate
students that have done theses around
classroom presenter that Steve Wolfman
Craig prints
Ruth Anderson that they all did
interesting things with the technology
and edgy and education but there's also
a tremendous amount of the project of
getting classroom presenter to work for
office 2016 that's not going to be a PhD
thesis we hope so so so there are just
inherent challenges in continuing this
work under the guise of a research
Enterprise at a university that I would
certainly cut tremendous lack at
University of Washington to do
non-traditional research and it was
fortunately respected at University of
Washington but that is just a limitation
of you know how the university setting
is hard to do it but in this kind of
semi open source community project it
also doesn't fit with a commercial
enterprise as well so there are
challenges in getting the model right in
2008-2009 Microsoft's commitment the
enterprise was at best unclear and then
there were also resource problems that I
was facing for keeping us off set of
software developers working on the
project your I freely admit that I
underestimated the importance of
low-cost tablets that I yeah I did not
think that you know these low-cost
tablets would be so successful as
personally owned devices so the 2003
vision for the project was that students
would come to class the or the vision
was the instructor would be lecturing
from a tablet slide debts i lecture rich
features to lecture with digital ink
but then all the students would have a
range of personally owned wireless
devices where they could interact with a
lecture in different ways that when we
did the work around student submissions
that we had this cart of HP tablets we
would take them to class early get all
the slides transfer to the tablets pass
out the tablets students would do one or
two or three exercises during class
using these special tablets on their
desktops but that was not sustainable at
all that it was good for experimentation
but certainly not the overhead that some
schools had mandate of uniform devices
for all students which maybe could make
it work but we really felt that you know
the way it's going to work is that if
people have these devices that they want
to keep charged because they really want
to to be texting to their friends and
incidentally they can use them for
participating in the class so we really
wanted it to be based on student devices
we wanted the devices to be ubiquitous
ubiquitous we didn't want to have a
single device used we wanted to have a
situation where we could count on
content being distributed across the
class seamlessly and that was kind of a
crazy vision in 2003 but absolutely
feasible right now so there's kind of
the irony that you know the vision for
classroom presenter could be implemented
in 2015 and I've actually been kind of
surprised that you know some of the
ideas have not been picked up by
classroom presenter and that there have
not been kind of commercial alternatives
that put classroom presenter out of
business that you throughout the project
I'd kind of anticipated that there would
be
a clear yo commercial product that would
pick up and you'll fill in the space and
you know it kind of surprised me that
when I'm going to teach a class you know
pulling out classroom presenter is still
what I want to do and so just to
conclude yo this is a partial list of
people who have been involved and
supported the project but you know this
has been an exciting enterprise just
because of the wide number of people
that have contributed this vision so
thanks very much for giving me an
opportunity to one question we can we
can ask a bit one single question your
first I win so so more than a comment
than a question I'm from Cincinnati
Country Day School we were tablet pc at
50 12th grade we did use classrooms
presented when you had it and multicast
did kill us but we switch to Dino Dino
found us so so your vision we've been
doing that for the last 10 years I want
to let you know that it does exist and
you had a right right now I certainly
give tons of credit credit for Dino but
they've always been I guess I had
friends I just want make sure you knew
that do you have a huge I mean I'm a
classroom t had a computer science math
you absolutely transformed the way that
we're able to interact with kids and
we've been spreading the message for 10
years to but it's still obscure
unfortunate I'll go back thank your
speaker once again
