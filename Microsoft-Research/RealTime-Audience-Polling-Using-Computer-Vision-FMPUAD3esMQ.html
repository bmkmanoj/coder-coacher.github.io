hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
our next speaker is Bill tease I'm not
sure I should give him a give background
about him again because this morning
actually uh nandan already talked about
him this is the last talk and we have
Andrew cross also supporting him on one
of the projects they're going to demo or
you know also ask you to participate in
this I hope all of you are still having
the cue cards with you not throwing it
away you all have it okay very good
so bill this is a researcher in the
India lab and he is part of the
technology for emerging market research
group his focus is on ICT D and his
focus his work encompasses
human-computer interaction online
education mobile health crowdsourcing
and other areas previously he worked on
programming languages and compilers
for multi multi Co processes as well as
microfluidic chips he got his PhD from
MIT and I will come bill and Andrew to
come up on stage thank you good
afternoon
all riots everyone is still awake and
engaged I'm very excited to be here
today and I'm very grateful
Andrew Kraus is doing all of the hard
work behind the scenes so today we will
be having a new opportunity together
it's possible within the next few
minutes we will set the world record for
the largest interactive presentation
without the use of any special hardware
all of you should have received yes
all of you should have received what we
call a cue card there are two cards you
received this morning if you still have
them you could find them and put them on
your lap in just a few minutes we'll
start using these but first I want to
tell you why are we interested in
interactive presentations it all boils
down to engagement why is engagement
important there's more and more research
that shows that engaging in what you are
doing is one of the most important
things in life if that's engaging with
your teacher engaging with your doctor
engaging with what you're doing in the
moment there was recently a study from
Daniel Gilbert's group at Harvard
University that deployed a phone
application to five thousand people
across 80 countries in the world
and this application would interrupt
them in their daily routine and it would
ask three questions what are you doing
what are you thinking about and how
happy are you at that time it gathered
250,000 responses and what they found
was surprising to them they found lots
of people are not thinking about what
they're doing and also the people that
are the most happy are the ones that are
thinking about what they are doing in
fact the title of their science paper is
a wandering mind is unhappy so how can
we engage how can two people how can
multiple groups of people engage with
each other well I know there are more
than a thousand college students in the
room when I say the word engagement
maybe you think of something like this
this happens to be a picture of me ah
the reason that I mentioned it here is
that the beautiful bride is not only the
bride but she is also a researcher in
our group so we have two people that are
researchers and in fact this is not the
first there have been three people in
our group three separate couples over
the past ten years that have met gotten
engaged and married so I think you heard
earlier that people can bring you into
research research can also bring you
into people I think this is uh this is
the real reason to do research is you
have very deep relationships pursuing
problems that you found to be profoundly
meaningful in the real world and so I'd
encourage you as well to explore
research and explore these relationships
now what did I do before I got engaged
well there's something else you can
engage with I think you might know what
it is there's the computer and indeed
computers can have very engaging
experiences and very engaging
educational experiences how many of you
have sometimes stayed up all night long
working on a programming assignment or
playing a game more often okay I see
lots of hands excellent one limitation
of computers though there aren't
computers everywhere yet we do a lot of
work in rural India where you see lots
of students and a small number of
computers so what if there's more than
one student per computer you walk into
any rural school most often you see
something like this lots of students few
computers sometimes arching to see the
computer sometimes there's some
athletics involved to interact with the
computer is there a solution to this can
we use technology to amplify engagement
of humans with each other and with
technology our research group before I
joined invented a very creative solution
to this problem it's called multi-point
Mouse very simple idea you have one
computer multiple children why not give
each of them a mouse that connects to
the same computer turns out you can do
this with off-the-shelf hardware
but you need small modifications to your
software so now every child has their
own cursor that they can see they can
move around the screen and it can either
collaborate or compete with each other
using educational software and what we
found was this makes them very engaged
as you can see before multi-point
athletics after multi-point smiling
faces that's what we like to see smiling
faces and in fact even the dominant
child that previously was controlling
the computer is now more engaged with
its peers
turns out girls are much more
collaborative when it comes to sharing a
computer with multi points they'll work
together boys can sometimes get a little
bit competitive they click very quickly
but overall there's new interactions
enabled and we saw similar learning
benefits with language games with other
kinds of learning activities sharing one
computer
okay we've amplified engagement a bit
how can we go further these are a few
students what happens if you have many
more students and by the way one way to
reach many more students is to make this
the product so in fact this started as
an idea in research now it's a open SDK
and API with hundreds of thousands of
downloads all around the world so this
is something that became real just from
looking at the situation to having many
people about Mars many different
countries using multi points but how do
you get even more people what if more
than five students want to share a
computer so they took it to the next
level they said okay we have more than
just a monitor maybe we have a projected
display like a PowerPoint presentation
and we give a mouse to each child in the
classroom now you still have lots of
cursors on the screen and you can each
move your own cursor and you can do
things like manipulate shapes you can
modify math you have a way of engaging
with the speaker bigger than you could
do with a single computer this is called
Mouse mischief it's already released as
a freely available PowerPoint plugin and
has had a lot of success building
interactive classrooms all around the
world another success story from
research to thousands of users
why stop there what if you have hundreds
of students it's a little difficult to
track hundreds of cursors on the screen
so maybe you're not going to have
real-time visualization of each
electronic device but you can engage
with students in a different way you can
ask them multiple-choice questions so
how many people have ever seen a clicker
or used a clicker
a few of you in the United States these
are sometimes quite common
it's a electronic device that every
student can hold and it has four buttons
a B C and D the teacher can ask a
multiple-choice question just like I
just asked a question of you each
student presses the corresponding button
and it's automatically aggregated and
displayed to the teacher to enable a
more interactive class now there have
been rigorous scientific studies that
have shown clickers have pedagogical
benefits so for example the teacher can
customize their lesson depending on the
understanding of students they can
choose to go into more depth or to cover
different subjects that are appropriate
for that class it checks the students
understanding it improves the
attentiveness of students because
they're really engaged with each thing
the teacher is saying it also bolsters
peer learning because now if your person
sitting next to you answer differently
than you you could discuss between
yourselves come to a consensus before
going back and answering again it's also
anonymous there's no more curser that
everyone is watching and you can track
each person's progress so over time you
can see what did an individual answer
are they learning am i tailoring my
teaching style to that person so
clickers are a kind of a celebrated
capability of technology but they still
have very serious limitations in
particular the top three limitations are
they're expensive expensive and they're
expensive so if you want to suit a room
of just 25 students it costs about
50,000 rupees and so in this auditorium
it would be very expensive
for every one of you to
have a clicker we could probably all go
on a nice vacation instead of having
clickers together here they're all so
hard to maintain
so sometimes batteries wear out
difficult to fix and so on so we saw
this as an opportunity can we go into a
rural classroom with hundreds of
students and engage each individual
student the same way as clickers but
without spending nearly as much money
and let me show you what we came up with
this is Andrew and I working together
here's an illustration of a class that
uses our solution which is called cue
cards for low-cost audience polling
instead of giving active electronics to
each student in the room we just give
them a printed piece of paper something
every school can make for themselves if
it ever gets lost or damaged the teacher
asks a multiple-choice question students
respond by rotating that paper into one
of four orientations a B C and D on the
front of the sheet of paper is printed a
unique barcode that identifies that
student so you can track a student's
progress over time now at the front of
the room you have a camera in this case
it was a web camera just an
off-the-shelf very inexpensive web
camera
we're also porting it to a mobile phone
so what happens is the teacher asks a
question students hold the cards and the
teacher can automatically scan the class
and using computer vision can analyze
what each student is responding what the
class understands and what each
individual student is learning over time
I'll give you a sense of how the
technology works under the hood so we
start with the barcodes we need to
binarize the image so we set a threshold
depending on the detected contrast in
the room we get black and white pieces
around the room next we detect connected
components so that's a single set of
black pixels or area which is all
connected and what we're looking for our
series of black and white components
that are concentric that means the
center point of those regions is in the
same place and it turns out that in
nature you see lots of black and white
pieces
but very rarely are they centered in
exactly the same place so those can be
our anchors so we look at these anchors
you that you see in the top left we see
that their anchors and we associate them
with each other based on the relative
distance that lets us find the fourth
quadrants of the cue card which holds
the student ID and we can read out the
bits to see what is the student ID we've
actually used this in many schools and
we've had a very positive reception and
a very positive performance relative to
clickers so we actually did a controlled
trial and we looked at clickers how do
they perform relative to cue cards and
in fact cue cards are sometimes more
accurate it's a surprise but clickers
lose battery they have other
malfunctions piece of paper is very
robust and also very quickly aggregated
at the same time it's much much cheaper
so about 15 times cheaper to use cue
cards than using clickers for just a
classroom of 25 students or 30 students
we've also tried a few larger audiences
so here at the whist conference this is
a top conference in human-computer
interaction we had about 270 people that
answered questions with cue cards and we
captured 90% of those people and got the
right answer for actually compared to a
manual inspection that we did later 98%
of our decoded responses were correct so
it might not be you know foolproof if
you're doing a banking transaction or if
you're grading someone for admission to
a college but if you want to sense the
temperature of the room this is a very
inexpensive and very effective way to do
it so like I said hundreds of people
what about thousands of people we have
never had the opportunity to try cue
cards with 1800 people the number of
people that are here today in this
audience this is a enormous ly exciting
opportunity it's also a scary
opportunity you'll get to see in
research how not everything necessarily
works the first time that you try it I
can tell you what we've done to maximize
the chance of success so since it's the
first time that we're trying this we
decided to take
about the student ID and just have a
answer key for you so we won't track
your individual progress but we will
have a reading on each person in the
room whether you are answering yes or no
so these are the two sheets that you
received one is for yes the other is for
no and now I'm going to give you a quick
tutorial on how to use the cue cards
this is very important for us to succeed
so please here's how they're used you
have two sheets of paper we're going to
ask you a series of questions you can
choose your response yes or no make sure
the other cue card which you're not
using is placed facedown on your lap or
on on a desk on the chair take your
response and hold it in a way which is
visible to the camera so andrew will be
manning the camera one went good way to
do this is to look at the camera with
your own eyes if your eyes can see the
camera put the cue card close to your
eyes and be careful that you're not
blocking other people's view so if
you're holding it really high
you're probably blocking the view behind
you so we have lots of people we need to
work together to make this work also
very important it may sound simple but
show the code to the camera sometimes in
the conference some top PhD researchers
are putting the code towards themselves
difficult to analyze difficult to
analyze so point the code towards the
camera very good we're ready to do our
first poll could I please have the
lights on in the room
you have the same card aha aha
interesting is there any card which is
the opposite I see everything in the
front is only one of the cards does
anyone have a black outline around the
outside no interesting
does anyone have a magic marker doesn't
you want to have a good idea on how to
use the same card you could use the back
this is your chance it hangs in the
lurch you could opposite things
yeah so we could analyze the resolution
later in fact we can do one test we can
tell you how many people we can
recognize in fact yeah we can do to
gloat so basically instead of voting in
binary we can vote in unary we'll have
once show your card if your answer is
yes
we'll stop show your card again if your
answer is no does that make sense all
right still alive still alive the dream
is alive so now you might ask what about
my anonymity I am being I'm raising my
card and everyone can see me do that
please hold that question we will come
back and we will make your response
completely anonymous another little
trick so I think we're ready why don't
we first just test how many people we
can detect in this audience I see
there's some areas with very limited
lighting any more lights would always be
helpful perhaps those of you who have a
well I will not suggest using your torch
then we have differential lighting
Andrew would you like to do the honors
okay please raise your card face towards
Andrew and make sure that he can see
your card I see lots of good cards lots
of cards remember if you can see Andrew
at face level there's no reason to raise
your card I know in the very back there
might be some office keishon but
hopefully everyone can come together
five hundred and eighty-six cards are
recognized and 97% of those
9 congratulations that is a record that
is a record 97% of those are yes
so that means 3% of the cases were
detecting some noise so that's the noise
of our measurement technique is that
will be accurate roughly plus or minus
3% when we do a poll very good let's
move on to the first question here we go
regard you done hold up yes hold up no
is the same thing all right so now what
can you do what can you do now that you
have the ability to pull the audience
you can do lots of very fun and
interesting things
so we'll start very simple you can
measure the demographics of the room
okay so let's let's take a simple
example we can ask for example or you
are you male this should be a simple
question if it's not a simple question
you might ask the person next to you in
fact notice we're not asking what you're
not so if you're not male you can be
anything there's no judgment here
the males the males in the audience
please hold it steady please pointed
towards Andrew I see lots of cards lots
of cards
results
251 participants so that's good we have
a good gender balance it's about half
the audience assuming we have about 600
responses that we're gathering because
perhaps not everyone has a card I don't
think we're seeing a full 1,800 cards so
that's the kind of power that we have
then we'll go on just doing one so we'll
just we'll just query you for now when
the answer is yes and later on it'll be
important to measure yes and no so I'll
show you that difference this is a
technology question so this is a survey
which we often do in our research we're
curious how many of you have ever copied
a video onto your mobile phone using
Bluetooth or using an SD card I'm not
talking about downloading off of mobile
internet connection I'm talking about
offline sharing a video please show your
cards if this is you Wow lots of people
I don't think I have to focus look at
the results
excellent so almost everyone has shared
their charity video the reason I asked
this we actually did a research project
in Bangalore that tracked this behavior
especially amongst lower-income
respondents so many of you may see that
things like security yards drivers and
so on are often watching a video but
they don't want to pay for that
bandwidth so there's a huge network an
ecosystem of sharing these videos
offline this graph represents one
network that we mapped out manually
we're only a few nodes the ones in
yellow have internet connectivity so in
our research we're trying to understand
how can we enable offline sharing a
video in ways that has never been done
before next question so as if it wasn't
enough to set one record we're going to
do another new experiment and this is
around anonymity so using cards is
relatively anonymous at least when you
have more than one card but in this case
you might feel uncomfortable right
because you're the only person raising a
card everyone can see if your answer was
yes or no and so what we're going to do
is we're going to ask you two questions
that are maybe a little bit more
uncomfortable to see how you feel about
anonymity and then I'll show you a trick
in which you can make your responses
anonymous and we're going to compare
both how you felt and what the answers
look like between the anonymous response
and the non of anonymous response so if
you for any reason you don't want to
answer these questions you can abstain
this way we're going to ask them both
the yes in the nose so that we can count
people who are abstaining from the
results first question next slide
have you ever used pirated software
I hear laughter
I seek hard
do you like to show
this time I will ask the other way as
well
have you not used pirated software as
anyone never used one person please
someone that works for Microsoft No
okay we have a very honest crowd I
should have made my questions more
uncomfortable you may need to fix that
okay good thank you thank you one more
question now this question was
uncomfortable because maybe there was
some illicit activity the next question
is uncomfortable because most people
like to be polite when they're
interacting with the speaker am I
sometimes hard to understand due to my
American accent triki triki what you
should answer yes those of you who think
yes please
I take no personal offense I am working
on my Indian accent as well as my Indic
languages but not negate Kannada swap
Aswath ago - very good - okay please
show your card if the answer is yes some
brave individuals are raising their card
you're being measured please hold your
cards steady please taste it towards the
camera what do we have here
263
for some duplicate there okay and they
often yes
isn't that cure people raising their
yeah okay
we'll ask the other one how many people
are not have never misunderstood a
single word I've said due to any accents
in the accents
remember you can abstain you can abstain
the poll is underway I see lots of cards
if cumulative okay so the count is
accumulative account we should reset the
count yeah
reset between yes and done yeah yeah
next time we'll reset the count good so
let's say I was asking even other
questions maybe you don't want to answer
maybe you're doing a sensitive survey
you'd like to do as a group is it
possible to have an anonymous response
this is an interesting brain teaser I
have one card let's pretend you have one
card is it possible for my response to
be anonymous something to think about
it's not obvious but you can do it let
me show you how you can do it so you can
do it with a third party that both you
trust and I trust but one which does not
reveal your identity to me and what that
party does is it splits you into three
groups it says a given individual you
will behave in one of three ways when I
asked the next question either you will
respond yes no matter what the question
is
or you will respond no no matter what
the question is
or you will respond truthfully so that
means only some people in the audience
are responding truthfully the others
have been told in advance which answer
they should select now why does this
work that's what we can do then is if
these assignments are made with some
known probabilities that means that I as
a presenter I know the approximate total
number of people in each group so I can
basically subtract out in the aggregate
the number of people that likely
answered yes because they had to and the
people that answered yes because they
were being truthful
but the key interesting thing is that
for an given individual I have no idea
if your answer was truthful or or if you
were coerced by our third party to
answer yes so in other words your
individual anonymity is maintained or at
least maintained with high probability
while the aggregates feeling is still
conveyed to the speaker so it's an
interesting trick in case you didn't get
it I'll show you an example let's say we
have a hundred people and
someone comes from outside and says
thirty people will always respond yes
these thirty people these two other
thirty people will always respond no and
the last forty people left over will
respond truthfully to my question let's
say just for example that I will observe
the following responses
I observed sixty percent of you saying
yes and forty percent saying no now I
don't know what any individual said but
I know that in aggregate there were
thirty people that were instructed to
say yes so I can subtract and I can find
the actual truthful responses are thirty
additional people that were not told to
say yes whereas ten people actually said
no truthfully that's thirty less than
the total number that said no and so an
aggregate seventy-five percent of the
room thinks that the answer is yes so
let's try it I'll show you how we can
try it we're going to assign each of you
a random digit this is a digit that you
are the only person who knows this digit
so do not share it with your friends
don't share it with me but we need you
to select this digit in a pretty random
way to make sure I know how many of each
kind of digit there is so one thing that
we thought of and this is not perfect
but probably it's good enough please
think of a phone number a phone number
that you know by memory but which is not
your personal phone number this might be
the phone number of your parents phone
number of Airtel customer service and
phone number of variety of other
institutions think of a phone number
everyone got got a phone number
hopefully hopefully kids these days
still know at least one phone number I
don't know next your group ID will be
the last digit of that phone number so
look at the last digit and that is your
secret number so just to make it obvious
here's one phone number phone number
where I grew up it's in the United
States the last digit is six my group ID
is six that's my secret number okay so
now in all of your heads you have a
secret number between zero and nine and
I don't know what it is but probably you
have equal numbers of secret numbers
across those space so now let's do a
poll I'll show you how it'll work let's
revisit
a question which is protect potentially
a contentious question so this one I
think we should skip actually because so
few of you have not used pirated
software but let's skip to this one this
might be interesting
am I sometimes hard to understand due to
my American accents now before you reply
here is how I'm going to tell you to
reply if your secret digit is 0-3 or 6 I
want you to answer yes if your secret
digit is 1 4 or 7 I want you to answer
no otherwise if your secret digit is 2 5
8 or 9 I want you to respond truthfully
does it make sense we're going to do two
rounds of polling one for yes 1 / no who
thinks the answer is yes please show
your card by the way one card per person
please those of you who are very
exuberant Andrews conducting the poll
very good thank you
you need some time to aggregate Jane
will go ahead
so this is 379 now keep in mind 379
includes people who were instructed to
say yes so actually to get the real
probability we subtract well the
percentage of the total audience so if
is 30 percent of 200 people
that's like 180 people we're subtracting
so actually that means there are math
here that's basically 220 it's like 80 -
it's 220 people out of a potential Oh
times a 2 point 5 to 20 that's going to
be 510 people will come back and show
you how this math is done okay now let's
do the other one please respond if your
answer is No
288 versus the first was 360 okay so can
we go to the next slide we wanted to
tabulate for you if we got any different
answers see if some people were voting
differently when they're anonymous then
when they're exposing their answer and
you'll find whenever you're onstage your
IQ is about half of what it usually is I
don't remember the numbers were you
writing them down Andrew okay
how about this we will we will crunch
these numbers and it will be available
for you to inquire immediately after the
talk so if you're interested in this
question if you want to know did the
room respond differently if there were
an anonymous interface to asking you a
question than if it was public please
come and see us after the talk we
weren't prepared for the unary voting
situation that's the little footnotes
surprise has always happen so I'm out of
time but let me just say interactive
polling can enable interactive tutors
that actually electronic tutors that
cater to a big class using polls it can
enable earning money as a big group by
asking valuable consumer research
questions to a large group you could
walk out having raised money for a big
organization it can enable real-time
political engagement and in fact Bing
pulse from Microsoft is a system that is
pulled almost thirteen million people in
their homes using an expanded form of
electronic voting so that I will close
and I will thank you for helping us with
this very interesting experiment and
we'll look forward to telling you more
