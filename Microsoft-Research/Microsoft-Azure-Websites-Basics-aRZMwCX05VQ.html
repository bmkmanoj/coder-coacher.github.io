of using Azure websites feature in
particular we'll take a look at how you
can publish and configure auto scaling
of sites we'll also look at the gallery
of web applications that are available
for us to easily use and then we'll walk
through a couple of examples creating a
simple WordPress blog and then a more
sophisticated example that plots
earthquake data using Bing Maps to recap
things we covered in the azure overview
video Windows Azure websites allows you
to build great websites using some of
those popular frameworks in just seconds
and a few mouse clicks you can use a
free tier of service and build and host
a website at no cost using just a basic
Azure account as you want to scale up
you can pay for more compute resources
as necessary there are many different
ways to code for and deploy onto as your
web sites you can use Windows Mac OS 10
or different flavors of Linux as your
development environment and seamlessly
deploy your site into Azure using the
azure portal web interface it's
extremely easy to provision configure
and debug your website furthermore there
are many great performance monitoring
features built right into the azure
portal dashboard there are a variety of
different ways to manage your as your
website's codebase ranging from simple
FTP to Dropbox integration or deeper
integration with source control systems
like Team Foundation server and get
there are also ways to integrate hosted
source control providers like github
CodePlex and bitbucket
with as your website so that your
deployment is tied to check-ins into
those systems as your website's supports
a number of web frameworks the ones
shown here work out-of-the-box classic
ASP asp.net PHP node.js and pythons
django web framework however you can
also host a custom fast cgi handler
which can then interface with many other
kinds of web frameworks one of the key
features of using Azure websites is that
it provides painless and even automatic
scaling as your web traffic load
fluctuates
well now look at the scaling
capabilities in more detail there are
three tiers
free shared and standard the free and
shared tears are both multi-tenant and
are shown in green this means that your
website and its associated code runs on
a machine that is also hosting many
other websites the other so-called
tenants that share a machine with you do
not affect your code or the appearance
of your website in any way however
sudden changes in their load could cause
temporary resource strain on the system
which would then also lead to temporary
impacts to your website performance
because of the shared machine there are
daily resource usage quotas on the free
and shared instances these quotas apply
to CPU time both per minute and per day
memory used and bandwidth the standard
tier provides your site with its own
dedicated virtual machine which better
isolates your site from potential
resource contention by other sites note
that this does not mean that you are
suddenly burdened with managing the
virtual machine itself that is still
handled by Asher for you and you are
still just coding up the website however
because you get the entire virtual
machine your resource utilization is
limited to the capability of the virtual
machine and there's no daily quota on
your usage with Azure scaling you can
start with a single free instance on a
shared multi-tenant machine then as your
web traffic increases you can tell a
juror to start more instances of your
website those will still live in a
multi-tenant machine but your website
will be able to handle more load as your
website continues to grow in popularity
if you find that the baseline amount of
traffic to your site requires more
compute power and you're running into
quota limits then you can move to using
a standard instance this gives you your
own virtual machine and only your site
will run on it with a standard instance
you scale your website in response to
traffic and load by allocating an entire
new virtual machine and firing up your
website there with standard instances
you can also run multiple as your
website's on a single virtual machine
that is dedicated to just your instances
since you might have an image gallery
for your research results a blog and a
private content management system for
your research team you can put all three
websites into the same virtual machine
this gives you more control and
visibility into website performance
since only your own sites will affect
each other and you can look at them all
via the azure management portal when you
choose to put multiple standard instance
websites into a shared virtual machine
you can still scale up with a simple
slider in the azure portal all of your
websites will be able to access and use
new virtual machines as they're added
azure can automatically scale your
website up and down with CPU utilization
this is a really nice feature that lets
you tell Azure when to turn on more
instances as existing ones get too
bogged down with load when the load
subsides Azure can then turn off the new
instances this auto scaling as it's
called is a good example of how a
platform like Azure can help you get
more bang for your buck by building your
website on top of well-established web
frameworks as you can automatically
deploy and remove properly configured
servers for you you then have a much
more direct connection between your
computer and the dollars you need to
spend on computing infrastructure you
might think that this is not that big of
a deal for something like a simple blog
or photo gallery but the same pay only
for what you use principle plays out
across all of the Azure services and
features as your web sites includes a
large number of open source web
application frameworks and templates
piece range from blogs and discussion
board software to very powerful content
management systems which can power an
entire business or labs knowledge
management needs web frameworks like
Django and nodejs
are extremely open-ended and flexible
and can be used to build very powerful
data dashboards and web applications now
let's take a look at a couple of
examples of using as your web sites
first we'll look at creating a wordpress
site in this process we'll see how easy
it is to provision and configure a new
open source web application in this case
WordPress using the azure portal if you
want to follow along with this video
you'll need to have created an azure
account already
we'll start by logging into
windows azure comm we need to click the
portal button here or we can type manage
dot windows azure comm after typing in
your credentials you will be taken to
the management dashboard this shows all
of the windows azure resources that
we've currently provisioned don't worry
if your list is empty in the bottom left
corner you'll find a new button that
allows us to begin using Windows Azure
services clicking this button brings up
a window which allows us to select the
type of azure service we'd like to use
in our case we want a new website so we
go to compute and then website then we
select from gallery in this window will
choose blogs and then select WordPress
now we click the next arrow in the
bottom right corner of the window on
this next screen we can configure our
new WordPress app we enter a URL name of
our choice
Azure will check to make sure that our
name is unique and not already taken by
some other website hosted at as your
website's net we will keep this option
to create a new my sequel database and
here in the region drop-down will leave
it as West us if you're following along
with this video you'll want to pick one
that's closest to wherever you're
located now we click the next button and
we just create an arbitrary name for our
my sequel database it doesn't really
matter and the auto-generated one will
work just fine
however the region it's in should be the
same as the region that we created the
website in here we also have to click
the check box to agree to license terms
to use my sequel now we click the check
box and azure will go and create a
website for us we can see here that the
provisioning of the server and the
configuration of WordPress is happening
for us automatically if we give this a
little bit of time the status will
change from creating to running great
now our website is running the next step
is to configure our blog itself through
the WordPress interface to do this we
should just navigate to our website if
you've forgotten the URL for your
website you can click here and then
click the dashboard scrolling down a
little bit we can see the URL of the
site
we can just click this link and I'll
take us to our website because this is a
default WordPress install it starts up
now with the configuration page for
WordPress we'll enter some basic title
will create the admin username we like
to use to administer this blog and now
we create a password for it as I enter
my password you notice that there is a
password strength indicator that changes
to reflect the strength of the password
I've entered because this is simply a
demonstration I've picked a fairly
simple password if you're creating a
wordpress site for your own use you
should pick something that it's more
secure here I will enter my email
address so I can receive updates and
notifications from WordPress and here I
can choose whether or not to allow
search engines to index the site and
just like that I'm all set I can click
install WordPress and WordPress will
finalize the installation now I can
login after logging in I can create a
new post I'll save the draft and with
one click I can publish it if I click
here I can view my post and this is what
my blog page looks like if we go back to
the WordPress configuration page we can
change the appearance of our site very
easily here I'll select a new theme I'll
click activate and now when I visit my
site I have a new theme one of the
differences in using Azure to host our
WordPress site versus using a hosted in
the cloud service like WordPress com is
that this is a full installation of
WordPress and we can add plugins and do
much more customization with this
website then is possible on WordPress
com now we'll do a more complex example
using Django a Python web framework and
Bing Maps our web app will monitor the
last 20 earthquakes and plot them on a
Bing map to manage the web site we will
be using an FTP client so if you're
following along with this video you'll
need to already have a Windows Azure
account additionally you'll need to FTP
client like FileZilla or winscp
to get started we'll go
to our Windows Azure management portal
after logging in you'll see the
management dashboard of Windows Azure
it'll list all of your Windows Azure
resources that you've currently
provisioned don't worry if there's
nothing there now will click websites
and this shows all the websites we've
created in my case there are none to
create a new Django site we'll click
this new button then we'll go to compute
website from gallery here we have
different types of websites we can
provision Django is a app framework so
we'll go there and select Django we'll
click the next arrow and now we can
enter a URL for a website this has to be
unique name under the azure website's
net top-level domain it's possible to
later on map other domain names to your
site but Microsoft provides this domain
for all web sites created using Azure
I'm going to pick my Django 99 for the
region drop-down I'm going to keep it at
West US but again if you're following
along you should pick one that's closest
to you now we'll click the check mark
and we'll wait a little while for our
website to get created we can see on the
dashboard that our website status is now
running we'll click on this it'll take
us to the website dashboard now we're
ready to code up our site and upload it
to a sure to do this we'll use FTP but
before we can use FTP we need to
configure the deployment credentials to
do that we'll go to dashboard and then
click set up deployment credentials now
we enter a new username and password
these are not our as your credentials
this is a new one we'll use just for
using FTP to access this website great
diploma credentials were set now if
you're following along you should
probably write down that username and
password on a sheet of paper so you
don't forget it or store it using some
kind of password keeper software if you
ever do forget it you can always click
the reset deployment credentials and
that will allow you to reset the
username and password now we're going to
go to FileZilla and check out the code
on our website for the hostname we'll
just paste in our FTP s the secure FTP
hostname for a username now this is very
important it's not just the short
username we typed in but rather this
entire deployment FTP user and the
password is the one that we just created
great we've connected to our site and
under site then W W root this is the
source code for our django application
one thing we can also do is click the
Browse button and that will open up a
new tab letting us see the basic default
Django site that's been created so this
Web site is being generated by the code
stored in this directory as you may be
aware this video and the related videos
are based on the azure for research
training courses that microsoft teaches
around the world the code for this
example can be found in the complete
course zip file that is available on
this website
inside here under day one section two as
your web sites you'll find the code that
I'm using if we're to actually take one
of these courses in person you would
take the contents of the begin folder
inside exercise to begin and you would
modify these in accord with the step by
step instructions for this hands-on
learning exercise however for the sake
of clarity and brevity in this video
I'll just walk us through the final
result in the end folder so you can see
inside the end folder there's a managed
py that's used by Django to run a
variety of utility commands and inside
here there's a subdirectory called
Django application this is where the
bulk of the logic lies there's five
files inside here and then a
subdirectory templates and there's one
more file inside there the underscore
underscore init py file is an empty
initialization file that tells python
that this subdirectory this folder is
actually a Python package settings dot
py contains the settings and
for this Django project let's take a
look at that real quick inside here the
only things we had to modify are the
template ders and here we've written
some code to tell Django to look inside
our templates subdirectory for
additional view templates next we'll
look at view P this is a new file that
was created during the exercise let's
walk through the code it contains a
single function called earthquake this
function first loads a CSV file from the
USGS and then it writes it to a
temporary location then using this csv
module in Python we read the csv file
line-by-line and break it up at every
line we convert the geographic
coordinates into floating point values
and we store all of these values inside
a list called data then we load the
earthquake HTML template inside the
templates directory and then we render
this template replacing its contents
with the list of floating point tuples
representing geographic coordinates
inside the variable named data finally
our earthquake function returns an HTTP
response object which is then returned
by django and served up as a web page
next we'll look at urls pi this is a
file that django uses to map urls to
actual functions in this case we add the
line here that map's
any URL that starts with earthquake and
then has a slash to the earthquake
function we just implemented in views py
that earthquake function is imported up
here at the top the WSGI GUI file or
whiskey as is pronounced in the Python
world is just a boilerplate file that
django uses to interface with the
underlying web server system it does not
need to be modified for this example
let's look at our template this is the
HTML web page that is ultimately served
up it's a template because inside this
web page certain things like
this particular template variable will
be replaced by Django with the values
that we've created and passed into the
template one thing you will note here in
this template is that the function get
map which actually uses the Microsoft
being Maps JavaScript classes has a
placeholder for their credentials these
credentials are used by our JavaScript
code to connect to the Bing servers and
retrieve the map data so we need to go
to this URL and get some credentials to
sign in to the Bing Maps account Center
we can just use our same as your account
credentials now we can go here to create
or view keys we'll enter earthquake for
the application name the URL should be
the URL of our app the key type should
be basic application type we'll set as
education now we enter the characters
for our CAPTCHA this one's a little hard
to read so I'll get a new image much
easier the application URL needs to
include HTTP and now we have a key now
we'll go back to our file editor and
paste in that key value file save now
we'll go back to FileZilla and we'll
upload this code
great the file transfer has completed
now we'll go back to our website note
the earthquake at the end of the URL and
we see it's an interactive being map if
we click the show earthquake button now
we get the pins for the 20 most recent
earthquakes so what we've seen here is
that we were able to very easily have as
your provision a new Django web server
for us and we were able to upload our
website code and have the changes go
live now downloading a CSV file and
processing it is a fairly
straightforward example but these kinds
of tasks are very common in scientific
analysis and I hope that in this video
you've seen just how easy it can be to
use Azure to create new web apps and
services in support of your research
again for more information you can
always visit the windows azure for
research training site and get technical
papers as well as look at the training
schedule of courses that are held around
the world thanks for watching this video
on Azure websites we looked at what the
as your website's feature is all about
the various tiers of service and scaling
and we built some example sites I hope
you're now encouraged and excited to
create your own sites using Windows
Azure
each year Microsoft Research hosts
hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
