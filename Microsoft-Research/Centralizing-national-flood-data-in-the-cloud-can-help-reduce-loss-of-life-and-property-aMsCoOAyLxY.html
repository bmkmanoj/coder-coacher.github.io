thirtieth several miles to the south and
to the west of the onion creek area in
The Onion Creek Watershed there was
about 12 to 14 inch rainfall there and
that will that rainfall that water began
to move through the watershed and into
austin so we didn't anticipate it we
didn't know that was coming and it
really did catch us by surprise
what we found in in the 2013 halloween
flood in Onion Creek was that there's
still areas where we can improve and
that that has to do with the predictive
analysis and other words being able to
accurately predict what the threat is
before it gets on top of our residents
and our citizens and in some cases our
first responders flooding is the largest
natural disaster that people face it
costs more money and it takes more lives
than any other form of natural disaster
that's faced in the United States or
elsewhere the National Flood
interoperability experiment is designed
to develop the next generation of flood
forecasting system for the United States
that's connecting the national flood
forecasting system with local emergency
response what we're trying to do is to
build up the actionable intelligence
that can be created at that time and
perhaps even forecast floods before the
rain starts to fall we want to first of
all simulate the flow on all the streams
and rivers of the nation simultaneously
and that means a continuously
functioning hydrology model over the
hulk continental United States that'll
be continuously running and continuously
being updated initially we get the flow
levels that are coming out of the model
and then we visualize them through the
web browser so that people can see what
the flows are and what their predicted
to be the technology enables us to have
something very complex running on Azure
in the cloud in the background while the
person in front is sitting there using
whatever it is that they're comfortable
working with we have programmers on the
team who have been doing the work with
Microsoft Azure they took a two day
training program and they were pretty
pleased that i'm able to get repeat
going which is the stream flow model
that will work
and they'll be able to scale that up as
we need different virtual machines in
the future that's what we really love
about the cloud is that we can bring
them in and send them away as we need
them and when we're going to be having a
flood situation developing you've got to
be able to have that superfast
capability bring in lots of virtual
machines and then let them go when we're
done what's really unique about this is
we're bringing together the big data
sets of the geospatial information but
also the weather information and then
computing on that to give the answers
out really quickly and this hasn't been
done before in a real real time scenario
there's a lot of work that's been done
after the fact looking at how the
modeling could happen but applying it so
that users and users can be prepared
ahead of time is a really unique
situation and that's what the power of
not only technology and the cloud
actually enables and it's in seen in
this situation here in academia we teach
we do our clever things for research and
so on but we're not often called upon to
do things for the nation but this is a
chance for the academic community to
show not simply what we think but what
we can do and we have tremendous
resources in the academic community and
with their partners such as Microsoft
Research to be able to create a new
future for the country dr. Mehmet calls
it an experiment I call her
proof-of-concept putting them together
using the knowledge in the science along
with the boots on the ground first
responder capability says a synergistic
effect though that one will be a force
multiplier for the other and so if we
can work on on this experiment this
proof-of-concept and develop a template
that that any agency across the nation
could use
to to lay that over there threat and
risk analysis for their community and
better prepare themselves we're all much
better off
