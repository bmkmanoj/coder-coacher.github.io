demoing the work that I do here at
microsoft research on predictive models
of forest dynamics so let's put that in
a little bit of context for is a really
important in a number of ways they
Harbor two-thirds of global biodiversity
they are the only source of fuel wood
for two billion people on the planet but
also trees are made of wood wood is made
of carbon the world's forests are
actually a huge store of carbon the
store as much carbon as is currently in
the atmosphere so the way trees grow and
suck carbon down from the atmosphere and
then die and release that carbon back
into the atmosphere is actually huge
important for the future of the global
carbon cycle and hence climate change
your tactics that current leave a single
largest source of uncertainty in the
future of the Earth's climate so how do
we go about building a predictive model
of forest dynamics you know we need we
need those predictive models in order
that we can anticipate the effects of
our actions in the way we manage forests
and we to predict the future of the
forest carbon cycle of global scales and
really the answer to that question how
do we build those predictive models is
in there is in the question which which
is that we need to think about forests
as a collection of trees and if we can
only understand how those trees grow and
how they died there we can understand
how the forest as a whole develops so
what we do with the first thing we do is
we go back to the forestry literature
and we find that foresters have done an
incredible amount of work identifying
what determines how trees grow and die
we now know that trees in the understory
of the forest are driven by the amount
of light that is incident on those small
understory trees and we know the way
that canopy trees grow and die is
determined by how much space they
capture from the canopy and so what we
need then is the ability to predict the
incident light level on small trees and
the exposed crown area that is the kind
of space captured in the canopy for
large trees and then we can then in turn
predict growth and mortality and off we
go and we have our model and that's what
we have this sir have a model called the
PPA have a couple of slides here briefly
because if you can just see that very
briefly a PPA takes a limiting
assumption that makes trees infinitely
intelligent and paradoxically when we
make trees infinitely intelligent
everything gets very simple and we left
the model that predicts eca and very
very quickly and rapidly and we find
that the that model fits observations
extremely well and so I'm just going to
very briefly show you a visualization of
that model here what we're looking at
here is the dynamics of a forest left to
its own devices as we start this is a
young forest age of five years or so
over 100 years you see as the trees are
larger what we're seeing this so cozy
star move up with seeing the build up of
an understory and if we look especially
top down we can see we start with a
large number of small trees these trees
grow to be kind of small number of large
trees and we see changes in species
composition here so initially all the
species do equally well those who go
forward through time we identified clear
set of winners or losers called
ecological succession and so in a
nutshell what we have is a model that
seems to work and is useful for guiding
management and addressing forest carbon
forest biodiversity me up to the
silviculture mugging thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
