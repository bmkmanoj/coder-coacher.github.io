thanks to my on thank you thanks Deirdre
and thanks to everybody for having me I
i thought you know I'm coming to
Microsoft I really need to do something
other than just like stand here with my
book open and read words I've already
written so I so I put together a little
prezzie just with some of the kind of
the main ideas of the book and some of
the kind of a stranger places that goes
I did a lot of it at like four in the
morning in kind of a I'm coming from the
east coast so I in kind of a time
shifting haze so this is actually the
first time I'm really going through this
so bear with me I think it'll make sense
so as user said I'm Greg cowboy cover
education for USA Today and I got
interested in this in this topic a
couple years ago when I actually had a
conversation with one of my daughter's
about her relationship to books and what
I found was that she did not have a
relationship to books she was a
straight-a student who didn't like to
read and I thought this is a puzzle I
need to look into this so I actually
started investigating essentially what
which you might call sort of the the
media ecology of her generation and what
I found very quickly was that the one
piece of media that really was becoming
sure more powerful and more central to
young people's lives and anything else
was video games and as soon as I started
talking to teachers who are using games
and game designers who are using games
took for education I went down this
complete rabbit hole a place that I'd
never been before talking about stuff
that I'd never seen the thing I tell
people is that when you're an education
writer people invite you into their
school and the
the invitation goes like this please
come to our school this is the coolest
thing you will ever see and you go into
the school and five minutes into it
you're looking at your watch saying get
me out of here it's the worst ever but
when I started looking at games I was
just amazed again and again and again
every time I went in to check out a
classroom or check out a game design
studio that was doing something with
education I was just amazed so that's
kind of the genesis of the book and this
is the cover of the book if you don't
have it in there for sale for ten
dollars in the back so the Riyadh three
reactions to this book basically so the
first reaction is this one which is yeah
I get it great go for it let's talk okay
people some people get it and they're
very excited about it the other reaction
I get is kind of total mystification
they don't know what the hell I'm
talking about and can't imagine how this
would work and then the third reaction
is you must be joking and this is the
reaction i want to talk about today
people who for one reason or another
feel like we've just given up the ship
by matching games with learning so you
know this is like most people's idea of
game of kids and games right they're
just like they're just insane they're
jumping on the furniture they're out of
control or they're totally zoned out
right or even worse they're like
borderline psychotic okay and so these
are like you know even like even like
people who should know better this is
their idea about kids and games okay and
one of the things i wanted to do with
this book is just kind of present
another frame of reference for people so
you know when you look at a picture like
this you know
lot of people will look at this and say
you know we've really just like we've
given in to the things that kids love in
kind of this awful way you know why are
we giving kids iPads why does technology
have to be in the classroom you know
what is the point you know I didn't
learn this way why do they need to learn
this way you know and what I've decided
is like it's a problem we adults have
with buttons we do not trust buttons
right you know we think people who press
buttons in a rapid fashion are just like
losers and slackers with nothing to show
for it at the end and you know like our
culture I think really kind of gives us
that role model again and again and
again right so it's kind of a hard sell
in some ways you know the UM the phrase
I are using the book um one observer you
know was looking at sort of the way kids
get when they're playing games in the
use of phrase blinking lizards you know
they just kind of like totally mindless
but there's like this other there's just
other point of view about games and I'm
sure some of you are familiar with this
but if you're not I want to kind of
introduce you to this so it's anybody
familiar with this guy yes / you'll he's
a game theorists game designer has
written some really interesting books
and he was one of the people that I that
I discovered while researching the book
and really he really changed my mind
about about the essential thing that's
happening when kids play games i want
anybody when you when we all play games
and here's his he's got two main points
both of them i think are really equally
important so the first one is that
failure is key when you're playing a
game you expect to fail you may not like
it but you expect to fail and that's
like the key part of the game right so
you may not like it while you're failing
but if you don't fail it's not a game
right
there are experiences that basically are
fair they give you a fair chance even
when the rest of the world isn't okay
when you think about the games that you
love like there's a there's a kind of
like a basic fairness about them that if
you just like keep up with it if you
keep persevering you know it's kind of
like the ultimate meritocracy right you
will succeed it may take a long time you
may fail again and again and again but
you can keep hitting that reset button
until you succeed and he's you know I
mean this is not he's not the only one
saying things like you know that good
games are easy to use an incredibly
difficult but this is the idea that i
like is almost as much as anything that
for something to be a good game and to
be a game at all we expect resistance we
expect it to kind of fight back right we
wanted to fight back in it as a matter
of fact that if it doesn't fight back
we're like well what's the point right
so his um okay so his is the way of the
way of expressing this idea in in one of
his books he says imagine the game where
you couldn't fail at the game okay this
would be it right you'd open your phone
or your tablet or your computer and to
be a button and the button would say
press button to complete game you
couldn't fail out this game right so
like there's no child on earth that
would play this game right this is like
the stupidest game ever this is the
second idea which I think I want to
spend it submit it on this and make sure
you understand because I think this is
actually even more important idea so we
are not necessarily disappointed if we
find it easy to learn to drive a car but
we are disappointed if a game is too
easy so I would wager and somebody can
push back on this if you want i mean i
would say that video games may be the
only thing in our lives where we're
disappointed if they're too easy did
oh you okay yeah if you're playing if
you're playing a kid who's just learned
how to play chess that's not a very fun
game right yeah you could win in three
moves okay but I think I think it so
your point would I think be true here no
okay good point so let's say a good game
forget video game so our kids like get
this right our kids get that a good
games got to be difficult got to push
back it's they're disappointed if if the
game is too easy I just picked on these
two kids because I love their
expressions but like in school this is
not the case like in school they have
not discovered this yet and obviously
I'm making a generalization but there's
a lot of research that shows that for
many many kids school is kind of too
easy so Indiana University does this
survey for a couple of years with high
schoolers and they found in the latest
one that sixty-five percent of students
were bored at least every day in class
and sixteen percent are bored in every
class another report it's kind of old by
now but it's about dropouts and it found
that eight and ten high school dropout
said they did less than an hour of
homework the night and two-thirds said
they would have worked harder if more
I'd been demanded of them if you read a
really interesting book came out a year
or two ago Amanda Ripley's book the
smartest kids in the world one of the
things she did was she followed a bunch
of foreign exchange students who came to
America and a bunch of American exchange
students who went to other countries and
what they found was that when she
surveyed them nine out of ten of these
kids said classes here were easier than
at home and seven of the ten Americans
agreed classes here or easier than they
are on these other places so and this is
her kind of take away that school in
America was many things but
not generally speaking all that
challenging the evidence suggests that
we've been systematically under
estimating what our kids can handle
especially in math and science these
kids are like bored they're like waiting
for something to happen sorry I was
picking on those two so here's another
pair of kids with who are equally bored
so it's as if we're asking them like to
like press that button right you know
that that when they show up on Monday I
you know I would wager that most of them
like if they were if they got the option
on Monday morning to press this button
and be done I think they do it there's
like another way um that they're
experiencing the world and there you
know so many of them are gamers now
right you know and they have this
experience that we've been talking about
you know I just love this t-shirt if you
haven't seen this before it's a great
teacher I wish I had thought of that I
would have been um so is anybody how
many people are familiar with this term
anybody seen this term we rejected like
just talking about earlier raise your
hand high if you know this term okay so
hard fun so this is an actual game
design term and essentially i mean i'm
going to you know i will i will bungle
it but essentially the basic meaning of
it is that things like video games are
not fun because they're easy they're fun
because they're hard and they're often
the most fun when they're hard they're
challenging you bit by bit by bit
getting harder and harder and harder and
giving you challenges that sort of step
up little by little by little and this
you know this is something kids are
familiar with from a very young age
right it's another word for like hard
fun is kindergarten right you know if
left to their own devices kids you know
in situations like this you know they'll
challenge themselves they'll do hard
things they'll build towers no higher
than the one they built yesterday you
know Friedrich Froebel you know the
the father of kindergarten right this
was his kind of famous quote right play
is the work of children Nicole Lazaro
you know we play to unlock our future
selves play is sort of this natural way
that we learn um I'd like to think about
like the way the way that kids learn
when they're doing things like this you
know is they've got the hardware and
they've got the software and they're
sort of making it work right is anybody
familiar with Alan Kay so really
interesting guy um you know he was
thinking about these things 30 40 years
ago and one of the things that he
decided we needed was something like
this so this is 1972 he came up with
something he called the dynabook and it
was in his words a personal computer for
children of all ages and this by the way
in a in an era when like computers like
this was the punch card era right this
was this was way before anything even
resembling you know something like that
so but the key to me this the key to
what alan kay was thinking of is that
you know he had this idea that like a
computer a good computer that a kid
would you'd hand a kid would be almost
like a like a piano and I think it just
sort of noodle and play and figure stuff
out you know whether it's math or
language they could play with their
schoolwork and of course his longer
quote than I needed to put up there but
um you know we need to give kids like
something you know enjoyable to do on
the way to mastering this stuff he
understood that a long long time ago and
one of the reasons I think he understood
that was because he liked a lot of
people in this era you know this is sort
of like the the I think the folks who
kind of brought us the personal computer
I can't believe I'm standing at
Microsoft talking about like the burden
of the porcelain computer as if I have
something to tell you you know these
guys played a ton so you know he was one
of the key people in this in this you
know space you know
one of the first personal computers but
he also by then for 10 years have been
playing this how many familiar space war
anybody okay so this was I mean some
people say this is the first video game
others would dispute that but it was one
of the first video games um and his his
great line was at space war blossoms
spontaneously wherever there is a
graphics display connected to a computer
back in 1972 so another guy whose name
may be familiar to you Nolan Bushnell I
interviewed him a couple years ago and i
asked him because he actually writes and
talks about space war and how space war
was the thing that got him interested in
computers and what he said this was his
quote there was no question again okay
this is the time when like you know
you're running processes and waiting for
them to happen you know there was no
question that when you push the rotate
button the ship would rotate and when
you fired a missile it would fire and
when observe the laws of physics and
when you thrust the rocket ship would
speed up and if you wanted to slow it
down you had to turn the rocket ship
around this will buy weighs like a 72
year old man and reverse thrust wow that
was just magical okay so he of course is
the guy who came up with this again you
know more than 40 years ago um so these
guys were like playing at the same time
they were working right and I I think
that that's a key piece of this pie that
like a lot of people don't appreciate so
I started the book thinking in those
terms like you know how can play work
alongside work and how can you know how
can playing trying to make kids lives a
more serious place and the other thing
that I came upon was well I love this
does anybody get the joke here okay you
get the joke say may not get the joke
so ten years ago this would have been
you see someone drowning save them right
this is a drowning person and now if you
see someone drowning laugh out loud
right LOL so you know I I mean one of
the things to let Jimmy you know held
like this incredible promise was the
idea of Moore's law and again I can't
believe I'm standing here talking about
Moore's law to to a group of engineers
so you know what Moore's Law is but you
know I heard about this for years and I
didn't quite understand it like I didn't
quite get why it was so important so
while i was doing the research for the
book i came across some writing by edge
lisowski at the university of washington
and it was the most amazing thing you
know he i emailed him and I said you
know I've written you know written or
read your writing about this but it's a
couple of years old by then it was about
maybe 15 20 years old he actually
testified in front of Congress about
Moore's law of all things and you know
why it was important to kind of think
about where it had taken us I said if
you updated this research at all like do
you have any like new ways to help us
understand like you know going from like
the 70s to now like what it really means
to like your your your civilian and he
wrote me back the next day and said well
actually I just crunched the numbers
with a couple of colleagues and here's
what we found and I had asked him I said
please don't like give me just the
numbers please like can you can you give
me an out and analogy that people will
understand you said yeah I can do that
so um so here are the numbers right you
know it's much more dense well by the
way it's these so these are the two
chips he's comparing okay at the top and
I think it was the the second one is it
like 2012 or sat right 2012 okay so may
even actually be even greater by now so
all these you know incredible increases
in density speed
efficiency and cost effectiveness so
they're there faster smaller cheaper and
more efficient okay here's here's what
he found he said let's let's think about
if you had a car in 1971 okay your
beloved Camaro okay so you know what
this thing could do in 1971 let's let's
like take it up to 2012 so it can now go
6 million miles an hour same car it can
get you to the earth to the moon and
back in five minutes it can get you from
new york to san francisco on a half a
cup of gas that's how efficient it is
it's cheaper now it costs nine dollars
and my favorite one it's as big as the
head of a match okay so like like things
have changed like in this incredibly
important way well well not while you
weren't looking but while the rest of us
weren't looking like this world has
really into create tools for the
classroom forget tools for everybody
else how about just so focused on tools
to the classroom so the gate the video
game industry has responded right so
we've got oh by the way he says the
other comparison was was a house he says
you could buy a house for the price of a
nice bottle of wine okay that was great
so the like the video game industry has
responded right and they produce these
incredible experiences that if you've if
you've played them you know how vivid
and how wonderful they are and how just
like engrossing ok so there's Bioshock I
mean these are just three random
examples that's you may or may not be
familiar with does anybody ever played
trials it's incredible talk about hard
fun I so this is a this is a in a way
it's kind of a stupid game all it is is
you're just doing motorcycle time trials
you just racing against the clock and
the talk about talk about
mailing I at one point after I bought
this version I'd failed so many times on
one of the levels that I went back and
looked at the analytics and it could
tell you how many times you've done a
certain track and how many times you
restarted it and that's one track I had
restarted in a couple of days I had we
started at eighteen hundred times hug
it's like okay and like there was no
comment from the game the game didn't
say like you loser you know gone to
another track so didn't know judgment at
all so so you know so go gate schools
you know in the meantime you know they
they're kind of getting it in a way
somebody's getting the message right
that computers are important that we
need more of them that they could be a
valuable tool and that's a pretty
breathtaking change there and the
question is you know like if you bring
all these computers into school we've
got these people who worked and played
we've got these tools that are just
getting more and more powerful could it
could get these things make school like
a harder more rigorous more serious more
fun place right and the answer is kind
of like know the answer is that it they
haven't really done much of anything you
know these are nape reading scores you
know if you look there's 1971 right
they've been fairly flat and actually we
just got the newest scores a couple of
days ago and they are actually still
flat and down in some cases um even
though we've got these amazing amazing
tools and one of the reasons that I kind
of theorized that we're not getting the
results we want from these amazing tools
is that like teachers like to be in
control my teachers you know they like
buy a new tool but but they don't want
it to like interfere with their control
they want to be the one who's in control
and they're like worried that
they're worried that a tool like this is
going to help them lose is going to make
them lose control so is anybody familiar
with photo math somebody know that that
term photo math to actually an app it's
a smartphone app I'm hoping this video
will work I think it should this is just
their like their little YouTube promo 30
second video I'm going to ask you to
watch this and think about if you're
like a seventh grade algebra teacher
seeing this the site of this what it
would mean to you okay so just think
about that for a second imagine you're a
seventh grade algebra teacher okay let's
cross our fingers and hope it plays and
the sound maybe there's some music on it
if we can turn the sound down while
we're playing it so it doesn't blow out
the speakers the music is meaningless
ready okay okay see
bingo solve the problem x equals 8x
equals however to watch this ready this
seemed better it shows your work you can
buy this today you can pull your phone
while you're sitting here watching me
and I think it's actually free not after
they've seen this I showed that to to
the when the book came out last spring I
showed that video to the national
association of state technology
directors so these are the guys who like
by technology for the public schools the
whole country and there and they wanted
to see it again really like we watched
it twice anyway so like the game is up
like like to me like teachers have to
figure out a new way to to not only like
interact with their students but they
need to I love that these people on
their smartphones I think they're all
like buying this lamp here um like they
have to figure out like what their what
their role in life is at this point I
mean I'm glad I'm not a teacher in some
ways because I think it's your teacher
out on the one in a very exciting time
but also at a kind of a hazardous time I
mean your role is just sort of exploding
in front of you so so the last thing I
want to do here is just give you a
little taste of a couple of the the
tools that I talk about in the book and
then I might if there's time and if
there's even a desire I might read a
little bit about one of them so these
are people like I said you know at the
beginning you know I've met these folks
and found it what they were doing and
what just sort of amazed that they're
thinking about school in so many
different ways so this is a tool called
interstellar this was designed by a guy
who was a former rowing coach and he
found that when students were doing like
they're in then when they were in the
gym doing like
well you know like the push-ups and
pull-ups and you know all the all the
warm-up exercises that they you know
they were pushing each other to get
their personal best you know yesterday
did 50 pushups this week do 60 and when
he came up with was a piece of software
that allows the teacher or a school or a
school district to pit kids against kids
doing you know whatever it is math
science spelling whatever content you
want and have basically a live
competition okay so you can do like a
ten problem math quiz you can get like
one class in a school doing it against
the other class and everybody's got a
scoreboard and the scoreboard moves in
real time and they're they're actually
doing if you look them up they're
actually now going through there and
this I think your third year of doing
like NCAA style like brackets they've
got schools competing against one
another fantasy geopolitics so this is a
Minnesota social studies teacher who
realized that his kids didn't know where
any countries were in the world and
didn't really give a damn so he invited
them using like the the mechanics of
fantasy football to pick a team of
countries totally unrelated you know you
can pick you know Ethiopia Mexico and
Iceland and depending on how much they
got in in the news of the world that day
they're ranked went up or down and his
funny story is that the first country
that everybody wanted was Djibouti Wow
and then they realized that Djibouti
didn't make any news but essentially
what he was doing was sort of gamifying
reading the news right because the kid
who comes in the morning you know that
there's a you know an earthquake in
Chile or a you know a revolution in Mali
you know can grab that country and pull
ahead really interesting he's doing
really well actually with this game and
people are just adopting it I'm like mad
this you guys ought a lot of warm your
hearts um this is a music instructor at
Virginia Tech who got a group of high
school-aged boys together a year and a
half ago and they started composing an
original opera in Minecraft you can
actually you can go they built the set
her problem was that she couldn't afford
a set so she said to one of her
colleagues there's got to be like some
way we can do this virtually right and
he's like well yeah there's this thing
called minecraft and so they actually
built the set totally by the way
remotely they were all at their own
houses building it together and come and
they used on Mozart Arya's and they
basically just like rewrote the lyrics
and created this original opera and they
performed it you can go on YouTube and
see them do the first act is really
interesting they basically basically
like opera karaoke because they had the
characters mouthing the lyrics and
moving to the music and but they also
had real singers on the side of the
stage so you're watching the action take
place on on a screen with the with the
singers on either side really
fascinating this is actually a kid who
was who went to digipen which is not too
far away from here so this is a kid I
met young game designer who grew up with
a DD and wanted to get off the drugs
that you take to control it and so he
came up with this headband well he
adapted a headband that other game
designers had been using to control your
focus and your calm and the more focused
and calm you are the more powerful you
become in the game and basic gist of the
game is that he found that nobody was
really interested in like just being
calm and focused on a screen what they
wanted to do with their comb and focus
was kill the other player so so it's a
multiplayer game where you're basically
throwing
junk at the other guy but but but the
only way to do it is to be like Zen calm
that's really fascinating I've played
this game and it works absolutely works
he tells this great story of developing
and he was in the he's um he graduate
from digipen a couple years ago and he
moved down to palo alto and he was
sitting in philz coffee if you're
familiar with philz coffee and he would
just be sitting there coding this game
for you know with this crazy headband on
his head and he would turn every once in
a while to like the guy next to him and
he would say excuse me sir would you
like to throw trucks with your mind and
as he reports like everybody wanted to
throw trucks with their mind like you
know who doesn't so that's a where he
came up with the name of a game you can
see this actually on youtube too and you
can buy the game in the headband for I
think it's like 60 bucks now and as he
says it's cheaper than a bottle of
Ritalin class craft you may have heard
of this one this is by a Canadian
developer he and his brother really
interesting story they he's a physics
teacher and what he decided was that you
know so you're a physics teacher like
you have the top kids in the school
right because you don't get to be taking
physics and unless you're pretty good
student and what he decided was even his
top students even the kids who like
doing well in school grades to them ABCD
grades were totally meaningless so he
came up with this kind of alternate like
shadow government if you will where the
only thing that matters is your your
ability to keep you and your guild
members alive that he plays it in groups
of four or five and everybody's got a
different role and their little mini
guilt so if this were a class now you
guys would be a guild you would be a
guild you would be a guild you're not so
much fighting against each other as just
trying to stay alive so if you know if
you don't bring in your homework one day
you know she can rescue you or you know
if you're you you know you do really
well in something
and want to share the wealth you can
share it with everybody else and this is
this again is another product that's
going really great guns on people are
absolutely hungry for stuff like this
and then the final one which is to me
kind of the most amazing is tracy
fullerton at USC a game designer who you
guys may may already know is working on
and i've been is about to release i
think maybe this spring or summer her
version 3d interactive first person
totally accurate photorealistic
thoreau's walden and you basically play
the game as the row in walden and
there's no real like win state there's
no way to lose the game you just
essentially see if you can play as kind
of close see if you can live life as
close to zero as you can and if you if
you don't want to that's fine if you
want to she says you know there are
opportunities to like be a businessman
and be like you know like a Walden
millionaire if you want to and that's
fine too you just it'll just come up
with a different outcome this game is
taken years taking like seven or eight
years to develop really beautiful they
use the Rose sketches they used his
surveying um calculations their sound
designer my favorite detail about this
game is there sound designer lives up
there lives up near concord
massachusetts and wasn't satisfied just
having like canned sounds like you know
you know can't birds or wind or rain or
whatever he actually has spent two maybe
now even three years recording the
sounds of walden and the funny story he
told me was that he he really wanted to
get it right so he took his recordings
of birdsong to the local birding group
in concord and he played it for them and
they said their Cardinals you can't have
Cardinals and so why not they're their
Cardinals on my tape they said well yeah
but they weren't there in 18
45 so get rid of them so this and this
is like actually one of my favorite
coats of all and i think this sort of
awake sort of encapsulates the the kind
of a different way I think to think
about what you're doing in this space um
so Jodi as well Clark is um scientist
who's leading this group that's
developing a bunch of math and science
games and what she said is we're not
trying to try trying to turn your
students and the gamers we're trying to
turn your gamers into students and i
really think that like that is like once
people get that I think they get what's
going on in this world and I think we're
done leave you with these guys I can if
you want I can take questions now I can
read there's a chunk of a chapter I
wanted to read you just describing one
of the math games that i really like i
can do either one who wants to hear the
chapter with the math games and who
wants to ask me some questions all right
in that game he said okay if I keep
these two on the board that all right so
the reason I wanted to read this and
it's just a just like two chunky
paragraphs or is because people like
don't quite believe it when I describe
some of these when I describe some of
these games and when I talk about kind
of how they're built and what they do so
there's this one game that's actually
you may have even heard of it you may
even if your parents bought it for your
kids it's a game called dragon box is
that name familiar anybody okay um well
then why don't you hear about this so
there's this French French game designer
and educator named Jean Baptiste win and
he actually wanted to develop games for
for his children he's got three young
kids and his wife who's a child
psychiatrist said no screens are bad I
don't want my kids on screens you know
electronic games are
terrible there they're melting our kids
brains she had all these sort of you
know ideas about this world and she was
the wife of a game designer okay and so
he's the story he tells us like he
pleaded with her to let him do this and
he said listen I'll tell you what we'll
make a deal if you let me do this I will
make this game go by very very fast that
you won't have to play this game very
long before you get to the end and get
the concepts and she said all right go
ahead and he NE created this game called
dragon box I've actually been three or
four and he actually just came out with
a new one just the other day which is
just absolutely mind-blowing if you've
ever seen it it's called um dragon box
numbers and I teaches number since two
very young children in a very weird
creative way so I'm going to reduce the
description that I that I end the
chapter on math games with the
description of dragon box we make sure
we're doing okay on time we okay a few
minutes okay this will go this will go
fast so so I described basically the
chapter where I described these math
games I described three games and it's
called math without words and what these
three games all have in common that I
did I talked about in the chapter is
that they essentially try to teach
complicated math concepts with almost no
words at all and they do it and they do
it pretty well um so this is my just
this is my description of how dragon box
works imagine you have an iPad or some
sort of tablets your tablet game and
you've downloaded this
dragon box has undergone several
modifications and expansions since it
first appeared a new version which
tackles geometry came out in the spring
of 2014 but it's still lovely mysterious
and a bit off-center one critic forbes
games writer Jordan Shapiro praised it
as quote praised its avatars that were
simultaneously sweet and a little
twisted the game presents players with
an odd little scenario a mysterious box
arrives for no apparent reason with a
wide eyed omnivorous baby dragon inside
packed and straw also for no apparent
reason the dragon wants to be alone he
must be alone before he'll eat don't ask
just play the game board is divided into
two sides with your little dragon in a
box on one on both sides are cards and
quotation works random images of lizards
horn beetles deep-sea fish and angry
tomatoes again don't ask to win each
level you must touch and tap and drag
the cards to get rid of all those on the
Dragons side once you do he noisily eats
everything that remains on the other
side and the level is done the box is
alone the game declares the game is
strange but you keep playing certain
you're soon you're encountering night
cards in quotes with darkened versions
of the creatures that you will learn
will soon stand in for negative numbers
pretty soon your strategizing which
cards to get rid of first order of
operations anyone on level 12 one of the
animal cards has mysteriously been
replaced by a little black a five levels
later there's the sea finally on level
18 the little wooden dragon box is
momentarily replaced by a floating
letter X you're doing proto algebra and
it's been about 3 minutes since you
downloaded the game the strange
procession continued through a hundred
levels with no explanation or
elaboration addition multiplication
division fractions all of them appear
fanfare or explanation you play 60
levels before an equals sign appears
between the two sides of the board by
games end at level 100 you've moved
seamlessly baby step by baby step from a
cute baby dragon eating a spiky
two-headed lizard to this 2 over X plus
d / e equals B over X which you solve
fearless Lee and perhaps even a bit
impatiently in exactly 14 steps you are
four years old so that's kind of a small
taste of what's possible in this world
and you know I think it doesn't do
everything you know a game like dragon
box it's not going to explain to a four
year older or a 12 year old for that
matter like why algebra is important
where you'll use it how you'll apply it
but it does get them thinking
algebraically and what I think is a
pretty remarkable way um so anyway
that's a a little bit little taste of it
I'm happy to take questions now I could
take comments yeah okay Sarah like a
microphone or do we should we just
between we've got one here if you want
all right do we need we need to i would
say who they are is that not matter okay
so you don't have to say yours this is
totally anonymous right I'm anonymous so
I have friends who are teachers in
elementary and they try to stay away
from student on student competition as
much as possible because for the winners
it works well but for people who lose a
lot it it has a negative side effect
right yeah so how would you could you
talk a little bit about how bringing
games into the classroom has an effect
on I guess the competition within it and
I think that's a really good question
and you know and there's a way in which
like school is kind of like allergic to
competition I think I mean we're you
know we're taught I think from a very
young age that like people's feelings
are important you know
i crush the other guy into the dirt I
think to me like the class craft example
is a really good one you know and
actually and also the other the other
example I think this really good one is
is the math tournaments you know like
kid against kids school against school I
mean what's built into it is is a
support structure so that even if you do
badly you know there are other your
classmates or helping you out you know
so that so that you don't do is badly
next time I mean in the example of the
the class or not the class graph the
interstellar and one of the things that
he found was that if you if you pit
school against school it's a much
healthier kind of competition because
you've got people rooting for you
because they want their school to do
well right so even if you do badly
people aren't going to say you know oh
you know you blew for us you know
they're going to say how can we do
better next time I I guess to me like
competition I mean it's like failure
like if the failure is not the important
part it's how you react to it right so
if you react to it with you know will do
will do it again will do it better next
time I think that I think that can solve
like a lot of our sort of importance to
competition um I don't know is that I
mean is that a like a helpful way to
think about it or I guess another way to
think about it is if you're playing
games at home and then you lose then you
try again right but in a classroom which
is really much more structured and it's
sort of time limited as well if you're
giving a sort of game especially a
competition as a task brand and you lose
and then you're done right that's sort
of a different different different i
wouldn't recommend that Everett I mean
my prince it's like a spelling bee I
think of spelling bees are like the most
caustic destructive things that ever
happened in school right i mean it's
like that's like how most students
experience competition in class right
you know i mean you can understand why
spelling these
right because like one mistake and
you're out and I mean I think there are
there there better ways to structure the
competition so if you only have let's
say you're a teacher if you only have 40
minutes to do that competition maybe you
don't want maybe you don't want it to
run like a typical competition maybe you
wanna I don't know you know make it so
that you know the the complications over
a larger period of time maybe two or
three class periods so you're not like
out and done and sitting there watching
the rest of your classmates for the
whole time now I really think it's it's
it's in how teachers like manage manage
the failure that I think really makes a
big difference but it's but it's a huge
it's a huge issue and I think if we
don't I come to terms with I don't think
I don't think people are going to like
find a good way to incorporate stuff
like this into the class I mean like the
class craft thing with the Guild's I
mean that that's a essentially a game
that takes place over an entire school
year that's huge you know so if you're
down one day you may be up the next so
any other questions yeah way in the back
hi is wondering if you could speak more
about maybe some of the differences
between genders about how girls
approached gaming vs boys approaching
gaming because what we found is with
minecraft we're finding that boys and
girls both love minecraft but they play
it very differently the boys are very
enthusiastic about survivor mode mm-hmm
and the girls the girls that I've
interviewed tend to like just the
creating part and throughout the
survivor mode so how do I cooperate in
that into other games and learning that
you found I mean III think I to me I
think what you're finding is what a lot
of people are finding that I mean in it
and I hate to be like steer typical
about it but um well a lot of people
that I've talked to have found is that
girls like the social aspect of the
games a lot of these games better than
the competition aspect of it it's not a
hard-and-fast thing but it's generally
generally tends to be coded that's how
it breaks down I mean actually I can I
turn this around like what else have you
found
and with with like gender &amp;amp; minecraft I
mean yeah I have a very small sample
size so I can't say it's definitively
that way but where I'm mostly curious
about how do we make learning and games
approachable for girls and four boys
mm-hmm so I mean those are just simple
observations that we've had so far but
yeah i'm still looking for more yeah i
mean i mean the reporting that i did was
basically like it you know kind of like
the whole the example of like failure in
the classroom like you know how you
frame how you frame the meaning of the
game i think is really important you
know one of the things that the t'me who
is were like really exciting to see was
that you know i mean like a lot of
things you know you'd go into a
classroom and there would be some
teachers who would be sitting there
saying you know every kid's got their
tablet or their computer you know it's
like eyes forward you know you you know
you focus on what you're doing and don't
worry about what the other guys doing
there are actually some schools that
have like like build like the cardboard
I'm like plywood partitions between the
the desks so that what you're doing is
what you're doing what the other guy is
doing is what he's doing or what she's
doing and you're not to like look at
what they're doing to me I think that's
can be dangerous when I've been in
classrooms and seeing games at work to
me the most exciting moments or when
kids are like looking over to see what
the other guys doing and just you know
collaborating is kind of a funny word I
mean they're just they're just curious
about each other right they just want to
see what's happening you know did you
get this I couldn't get this can you
help me with this um I think I mean I
think that's a behavior I think that we
I think a lot of schools are our kind of
suspicious of that but i think in games
i mean if you're gamers you know that
like that's how gamers behave right help
me with this can you help me get through
this level i keep getting killed here
can you help me do this sound I think
teachers have to learn that
just just like everybody else the
question up front here Deirdre didn't
know she was going to be like the Oprah
Oprah moment hi so my kids are 12 and
they have recently become totally
addicted system shooting homes is there
anything redeeming I mean they do they
do play as teams and they do have on
headphone there listening to earbuds and
heads it so they're talking to other
Rumple so there's some interaction
collaboration but I don't know that the
ratio matches that's a pretty low
benefit uh-huh so what's what's the can
I ask you CS co what's up csgo it's
called it was cat oh ok ok
counter-strike yeah okay I've always
forget what is there talking in code so
you doing um I actually I mean I have a
I have a answer that I like to give to
that I and I'm not cheating here but you
know so you said an interesting thing
you said like is there basically like a
like a benefit to all this mayhem are
like destructiveness or I don't actually
I don't even think you used a noun in
there you just you kind of left it
implicit well I cuz it's a huge time
sink and its really an addiction and you
know you I would disagree with that word
by the way okay but that's okay um but
let me I want to do two things first of
all I want to see is there anybody in
the audience who has an answer to that
in the back cuz cuz I mean I do have a
very strong opinion in it and I thought
about this but i want to see I'm the
thing I should have said at the very top
is that I am not like a huge gamer I
don't have a headset I mean I play some
of these games very very badly but but
but but I want somebody who can answer
at least part of that question with real
experience so good you know I was gonna
have an answer for this right yeah I
never tell with some great research from
a neuroscientist named Daphne baval yay
who's analyzed using fMRI machines the
effect of action game specifically games
like Call of Duty on the effects of the
brain and one of the things that she's
found that I think is really fascinating
is
at people who play a lot of action games
are much better at distinguishing
multiple objects moving around
simultaneously so they're the ability
for their retina related multitasking
systems in the brain to operate
efficiently is much higher and this has
a bunch of interesting knock-on effects
into working memory and multitasking
broadly it's super fascinating research
i highly recommend it so so when you
think call of duty and counters do i go
just think about multitasking and things
like this researchers name is Daphne
Duvalier and it's great stuff I mean
thanks and anybody else have other
actual gamers want to add something to
that yeah go ahead you know I grew up
playing lots of video games and my
parents always hated it and so I kind of
bring it up to them now like hey I'm a
patent attorney at Microsoft you know
like in your face mom yeah you know i
just i think that the kids are gonna do
something like the summons right yeah
exactly um I don't think it's all wasted
time I think you could probably push
them to to broaden the games that they
play and try and work on different
skills but ultimately I feel like it led
me to the path that I'm at now and and I
think that's positive yeah that's great
night I mean I hear stories like and I
don't mean to like you know put you in a
bell jar here but I hear stories like
that all the time wherever I go where
the skills people learn the kind of the
attitudes the kind of the reference
points you know we're these skills are
just huge um later in life so somebody
else Eddie come I was going to say in
particular as it pertains to multiplayer
shooters like that and also to like mmos
and basically any any sort of game where
you're playing with a team I don't have
researchers names on off the top of my
head but I most of us don't yeah but I
can I bet I can definitely say that
there has been research about the the
collaborative aspect of it so I mean in
a sense yeah they're shooting people in
the face but at least they're not doing
it alone because the the things the
things that they learn in terms of the
cooperation of the teamwork and
particularly in terms of strategizing
about breaking down a proud
those things do apply outside and so in
particular when they end up doing like
craft projects together or things
outside of the cs go space like that
they will take away that sort of
collaborative yeah i mean that's it's
one of the benefits to the gaming that
we have now versus the gaming that we
had when a lot of us were younger that
was you know we didn't have networked
computers as much like it was primarily
a more isolated space a lot of the
gamers that are growing up now in these
massively connected spaces are you know
much less isolated I mean I would say to
add to that I mean that a lot of gamers
I've talked to that's why they play the
game I mean all the rest is just kind of
details you had a question or comment
about this and then somebody else wanted
to talk about it but yeah I think I went
on proximity I was going to say that i'm
not i'm not a gamer either my son's a
gamer and he does play a lot of
first-person shooter games and other and
multiplayer shooter games as well and
I've never dissuaded him because I see
in learning strategy I see him learning
how to control something that's new and
he can walk into a different game and
pick that up too like I wonder if we
tried to teach the kids a language made
out entirely out of swear words it would
be bad but they could learn French a lot
more easily after they learned that
right so there's like some transferable
skills and the other thing the other
thing about that is like a lot of the a
lot of the things that we sort of
project is really just fear on the part
of parents like we don't worry that
people who take kick kick boxing classes
are going to go out and beat people up
we worry about people shooting a
pixelated weapon are gonna go pick up a
weapon anybody or they're playing
country music's gonna like make you
break your heart yes I'm like that but I
guess the biggest reason is always like
as a parent I don't want to tell them
what notch Dukas helps do that more and
this is actually seems like a good
gateway to other things he can do in a
networked way online that are good for
him educational actually yeah I
appreciate that and there's one comment
in the lady in purple back here and then
and then I have one thing I want to say
about that and then we'll move on good
just a brief comment one of the things
that I noticed with my son when he
started getting into video games which
was fairly late cold he's almost 13 he's
only started in the last couple of years
failure is a lot more comfortable for
him in general you mean
raw or before he would get very
frustrated even when he was
experimenting with Legos that if it
didn't go his way it was just an
emotional kind of a thing and with the
video games it seems like oh well
there's another game there's another
game I can do that and so that that
repeated failure like you mentioned
before feels much more comfortable
comfortable to him yeah no I think
that's right and I mean and I appreciate
all these remarks I mean one of the
things that I thought that my one like
real insight into the first person
shooter game I played a lot of Bioshock
about a year and a half ago I was I was
deep in their reporting and basically
procrastinating and not wanting to write
the book and one of the things that
taught me it was the strangest thing I
swear to God I was braver as a result of
this playing this stupid game well
shouldn't say it's us to be concerned a
really remarkable game I was a braver
person because I would have to go
repeatedly into these crazy you know the
doors open and there's seven people and
they all want to kill you right at that
very moment and there are zombies and
they're monsters and they've got guns
and they've got claws and they just look
like having at you from the moment you
walk in the room and like after a while
I just felt myself being like okay like
I'm good with this there's no
consequences i'm not really dying you
know I I can just like take the damage
and just come back again and it really
made me feel like a braver person on
account of it I want to say one thing
about the violence so the stupid thing I
say when parents and you I mean you have
I think a pretty nuanced understanding
of this yeah okay yeah okay
twice Oh interesting oh nice Wow yeah
that's great good okay if you had asked
me about the violence thing this is what
I would have said and it's a stupid
observation but I'll say it anyway that
when parents saying oh my god these
games are so violent my kid is shooting
you know he's going to become Ted
Kaczynski or whatever what I say is
we're focusing on only half the bullets
like because you're when you're playing
one of these games you're not walking
through the world just shooting
everything that moves you know let me
sort of like you know harmless
defenseless creatures it's not like you
know like Bambi you know on every level
like they're people shooting at you so
in a sense it's sort of like a
self-defense sort of hunting game in a
lot of a lot of situations so if you if
you're only focusing on those bullets
your kid is shooting you're missing half
the point of the game but I but you know
I never heard that the self-advocacy
thing is I think it's really really
interesting I mean that's like a real
life skill you know even though like the
thing they were getting back was like
the digital artifact right I mean that's
really interesting um so great I think
we need to actually close close the
conversation now so we have a little
time for book signing so thank you so
much for coming sure thank you you guys
have been great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
