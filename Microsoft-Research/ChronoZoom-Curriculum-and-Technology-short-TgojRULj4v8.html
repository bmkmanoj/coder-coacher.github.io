teaching history to understanding the
past is the ability to reanimate things
that have already happened and to be
able to see those those trends and those
changes in those perspectives 15 years
ago that meant having access to the
puzzle pieces of the past the primary
sources the documents the archives the
things that professionals only had
access to technology is an amplifier of
what happens in the classroom if it's
used well it amplifies the educational
process that's used poorly it amplifies
the distraction and amplifies the
problems that are going on but good
teachers using good technology can do
amazing things there's definitely a gap
between what students do in the class
with papers and books and then
technology you need to bridge that gap
some houses that it flows in some sort
of cohesive manner the most valuable
litmus test for technology in the
classroom is whether or not it allows
teachers to do something they couldn't
do otherwise i am not a techie person i
am one computer in my classroom we have
computer labs but they're very hard to
get to I was able to implement chrono
zoom very well in my classroom because
of its simplicity how easy it is to use
and because it speaks for itself in
terms of what it shows what it presents
and wants students get out of it getting
Chronos arm up and running as really as
easy as opening a browser because it's a
web-based application there's no nothing
to install there is no question of
hardware compatibility it's a
presentational tool they can be used
very quickly as by a teacher to present
it can also be used by students to
develop their own presentations but it
also is one of those kind of tools that
is scalable when I saw krona zoom I
couldn't wait to have my students build
timelines I designed a project in which
they had to research a world religion or
philosophy conduct research create a
storyboard on a OneNote notebook and
then build a timeline in kronos
in my world history class right now I'm
using it to present about the
austro-hungarian Empire and so I just
created a tour that I'm going to be
presenting my whole class the importance
of chrono zoom is tying the subject at
hand to a date so tying the political
structure of the austro-hungarian Empire
to a specific date has really helped me
learn about it better because I've had
to connect it with a certain point in
history when I first saw it and saw the
zoom from the view of the whole cosmos
down down down down down down into the
view of humanity I realized right then
it was a magnificent tool for giving
perspective in a way that you can't see
otherwise about the temporal
relationship between things so Kronos
ooh what it does is he teaches
chronology allow students to visualize
history and it also teaches cousin
effect one thing I always tell my
students is that history is messy and
chaotic what Chronos room does is it
allows me to visually show my students
history and it shows them that mess but
in an organized manner usually in my
regular history classes we would just
learn this happened in this heaven then
this happened but with chrono zoom and
massagers she shows us that each event
doesn't just happen like that events
actually overlap and one thing might
happen at the same time this thing is
happen chrono zoom gave me the
opportunity to place timelines into the
hands of students that they not only got
to see the progression of things
changing and staying the same but they
also got to interact with history you
can zoom in into different boxing it's
just like different layers that you can
go into by doing this in our school in
our school setting I think that you can
not only learn from yourself and what
you can do with technology but you can
also learn what other people can use and
do with technology this is the future of
technology in the classroom natural
interfaces like pen and touch
collaborative software like OneNote
innovative software like chronosync that
allows you to do presentations and put
information together in ways you
couldn't in the past
