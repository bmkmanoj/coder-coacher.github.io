live webcast is celebrating your
research with Windows Azure Kenji you
now have the floor thank you very much
so thank you everybody for coming if you
can all hear me
let's know if you can't I'm Kenji
together I'm in Microsoft research
connections team based here in Cambridge
in the UK and our team is actually
working with the research community to
look at how cloud computing can help you
with your research we have a social
media stream so hashtag as your research
and handle that agile for research so
it's so to get onto Twitter and tell
your friends what's happening here so
what I want to do is talk about grab
control here so I want to talk about how
cloud computing can be used why you
might want to consider it for your own
research so there's a lot of talk about
how computing and Microsoft's platform
is called Windows Azure and and that's
what we'll be talking about today so we
will talk about agile specifically but
we're going to actually talk about cloud
computing in their more sort of broader
sense in terms of how you know it's
applicable to your your research it's
great to have so many of you here so to
start out really if we think about sort
of research and scientific discovery
it's gone through several phases from
experiment to theory and mathematical
equations through to computation and I
don't know how many of you are sort of
high performance computing super
computing people but that's that's my
background my background is actually in
aerospace engineering and doing
computational fluid dynamics and you
know the Middle's box here is called the
navier-stokes equations and I basically
used to spend my time trying to solve
that equation which is pretty much
impossible for interesting problems so
we would move to computers to model that
and the picture here shows for instance
the climate model on a supercomputer to
try solve those problems so that I think
is a framework for how we do research in
terms
experiment observation theory and
computation and as we're moving forwards
with you know bigger computers more
sensors more advanced theories we're
actually moving into a world where data
is very critical to what we do so this
idea of data intensive research which
Jim Gray won over our researchers at
Microsoft Research coin this is the
fourth paradigm of data insensitive
scientific discovery and the fourth
paradigm to all day you can download the
book which explains and has some essays
about how this new way of thinking about
science is really sort of changing the
way we do things and you know we think
about the scientific process the
research process where we might acquire
some data we might work with our
colleagues before we do some analysis
and then we also you know have to share
those results and then publish an
archive and preserve those things so
that's sort of a fairly linear process
that I think a lot of us are familiar
with but what's interesting is that if
we take that data and we share that data
anybody can actually tap into that so
the human genome project in this field
example of that the Large Hadron
Collider is a good example of that and I
think that's what we mean by this fourth
paradigm really is it sort of unlocks
lots of new ways of doing research and
with our scientific discoveries so so
that's the sort of world I think we're
moving to and I think you know in pretty
much every every discipline you know we
think about particle physics we think
about environmental science and climate
change but it's very interesting in sort
of social science and the advent of
social media and the internet and
gathering data that way that again this
model is emerging within those sorts of
disciplines so a lot of people find that
difficult it's quite a shift in the way
that researchers are trained and so we
imagine a world world where what we do
at our desks and in our labs
you know we do that with our lab
notebooks and our laptops and our
computers and increasingly things like
tablets
even stones that actually we want an
extension of our desktop a sort of magic
back-end that helps us with our
problem-solving some examples of you
know a spreadsheet for instance that
would just allows to run genomic
analysis on hundreds of servers the
ability to write a simple script in for
instance of Python or MATLAB and it
would just automatically go and run
analytics across thousands of images
whether they're MRI or x-ray images from
you know a CT machine or actually
pulling data from a remote instruments
and you can see in there in the top top
right corner here actually an ocean
observatory off the Pacific Northwest
where again you know they have on the
seabed high-definition cameras and
sensors and pulling that and analyzing
that from the desktop and so this is a
sort of Nirvana relief for scientists
and research if we could do if we could
only do this you know this would create
a real revolution in what we can do and
I think that's where you know we see
cloud computing as one of the enablers
not the only one but a key part of
enabling this new capability for
everyone across lots of disciplines and
that's really kind of what we're talking
about today in terms of you know how we
can apply that and also specifically
about how you would go about doing that
and this is the first of a series of
webinars I'm really to try and
understand in this case what our
computing is good for and then in the
follow-on webinars actually getting
hands-on and looking at that in more
detail so I want to talk a little bit
about cloud computing and cloud
computing over the last few years you
know it's been talked about quite a lot
and I think it's really matured and
that's something where there are
definitions appearing and missed for
instance has a definition which is a
very precise definition here I'm
actually going to take those definitions
and put them more in the context of sort
of research and researches so a way of
thinking of this is providing on-demand
services delivered over the network and
cloud computing now backs so much of
what we do with our smartphones we're
out
since our email if I take a picture on
my phone that picture gets uploaded into
the cloud so I can look at that on my
tablet or my my PC and so the ability
for these services to be delivered over
a network connection be that wide or a
Wi-Fi or a 3G or 4G connection is really
sort of the essence of cloud computing
again we can get into more detail about
the exact definition of sort of you know
protocols and things but but I think
this this sums up what cloud computing
means particularly in that in the
research space I'm so - you know I am
your questions in and I'm happy to sort
of take questions as we go along so that
is in context here so do feel free to
chip in so what's that good for what it
means really is that you can have what
you want whether that's compute or data
or you need to pull data in from devices
or you need to distribute data out to
many people getting what you need and
you can do that today and with a lot of
IT infrastructure that is possible but a
critical part with cloud computing is
that you get it when you need it
sometimes there's the resources are
there but you can't have it you know at
your fingertips when you need it and
again that's one of the features of
cloud computing that's unique really is
that you don't have to wait you said you
have access to what you need whenever
you need it and that's one of the nice
things about cloud computing we'll talk
about some specific scenarios in a
minute what that means is that you can
focus on your research you don't have to
worry about oh I've got that paper
deadline coming up oh in two months I
better put in a request to get some
compute or data resources because you
know you're busy doing our experiments
you're busy you know writing your code
and debugging your code and so you know
what you really want to be able to do is
focus on your research at the time
that's right for you the particular part
of what you're doing and not have to
worry about you know pre reserving what
you need you just kind of want it when
you need it and I think that's one of
the real beauties of cloud computing and
so I just want to sort of tell a story
so younger I'll use at Seoul National
University but this is a picture of here
my name is at Berkeley
doing his research as a grad student and
you can see there in red you know that's
his PC and I think you know certainly my
office used to look like this I had when
I was researcher with paper everywhere
and my machine and and you know needing
to do lots of computations so he
actually is an environmental scientist
and so NASA provides some remote sensing
day for this modis dataset which it it
makes freely available to researchers
around the world which is a fabulous
resource and young where I had to run
calculations against his face said this
is gigabytes of data and actually his
problem was they just downloading that
dataset was a huge problem and then
computing it because his PC was not
powerful enough to do that and so cloud
computing here is really what sort of
unlocked you know what he could do and
snow so the young girl is really a great
example of where a scientist you know in
his lab really had a task to do and he
was really constrained by what he had
available to him and there are obviously
great resources for researchers and
scientists with supercomputer sensors
national data centers and it's wonderful
and cloud computing fits into that that
ecosystem and for a lot of Sciences
they're actually you know I think some
of you might be able to relate to this
sort of situation certainly when I was a
grad student and I had access to
supercomputers but still found myself in
this situation for a lot of a lot of the
time so cloud computing makes a
difference because it allows you to go
beyond your PC or laptop so again you
know earlier we talked about that sort
of Nirvana of having access to compute
and data and this is one tower computing
is one way of doing that and again this
is on demand not having to wait in the
queue you know not having to submit your
job wait for a day before it runs find
out that actually it couldn't get the
license it needed or it cracked and it
core dumped and having to wait another
day you know you can just keep iterating
and submit the job it fails the job
again debug and get to the answers the
other thing is the ability to scale out
as with young rel to do these big data
conversations with gigabytes terabytes
even getting into pet
by some data which would just come not
possible so new capability for
researchers the other thing the cloud is
very good at sharing your data in the
same way that things like SkyDrive allow
you to share photos and files with your
friends and family you know the cloud
allows you to share data with your local
team your university your collaborators
than more globally and then powerfully
we can build services on top of that and
we'll talk about that in a minute
and the other thing with cloud computing
is it allows you to pay for what you
need you know you get what you need when
you you know when you need it but again
you pay for it you know just for what
you need it's not the only way you can
you can pay upfront for you know
resources that you know you're going to
need over a period of one to three five
years but also you can pay on demand as
well so it gives you that flexibility in
a similar way so for instance or mobile
phone type of arrangement and so that
that I think sums up what cloud
computing can do for researchers and
what I want to talk about now quickly is
then what sort of patterns when is cloud
really applicable and so I'm just going
to go through some of these scenarios of
different computing data scenarios these
four key scenarios for cloud computing
so one of them is what we call sort of
an on/off workload so this is where I'm
sort of maybe writing some code
experimenting you know experimenting my
theory doing debugging locally and then
I want to run a big job and so that
could be a batch of so this is typically
how we might use a supercomputer where
we you know we fire off batch jobs we
get the results back we spend a little
while analyzing or a long time analyzing
those results before we then fire off
another batch job and so what we find is
we need a lot of compute for a period of
time and then we can do everything
locally and then we want to you know
have some more compute again and so this
is the one of the problems is having to
queue where you might have a provider
you know they provide you access to the
system but you're competing for those
resources and with the cloud because we
provide the cloud it's sort of a very
global scale essentially we don't have
- queue and you can just switch on the
computer when you need it it switches
off when you're done and that's really
good in it is hard to handle
conventionally at a local research group
level at a university level and the
cloud provides a lot of flexibility to
do that so an example of that is this
piece of work on stratospheric research
so environmental scientists and
engineers at the University of
Southampton where I used to work you can
see here in the in the the bottom corner
here they have a balloon like a weather
helium weather balloon and they happen
to attach actually a sensing device in
this case it happens to be a Windows
Phone that has various environmental
sensors on it it has GPS and this is
taken out about 6070 thousand feet in
the stratosphere and then as the
balloons going up is collecting data on
its trajectory here and then it's
running actual trajectory calculation in
the cloud beaming it to a phone app so
that they can go and recover the balloon
and this is an example of an experiment
where they spent a long time planning of
the experiment and then they need that
cloud compute you know for the duration
of about a day and then they don't need
it for another month until they need to
run another experiment so you know you
could do this with the server under your
desk but you know that server would be
doing nothing for foot of nineteen
ninety nine percent of the time so the
clouds very good for this on/off sort of
scenario of running these experiments
another scenario is where you're growing
fast and you need to scale quickly and
this is again all of these scenarios
equivalent for both compute and also
data if you're generating data and it's
quite difficult for providers you know
again for a university level or even at
national level or a research group level
to provision hardware fast enough to do
this because often there are lead times
you don't know how quickly you're going
to scale and this is where the clouds
very good but I can provision a hundred
servers literally if I started
provisioning some servers now by the end
of the webinar I could have a hundred or
a thousand servers up and running if I
had to do that actually provision
hardware that could take d8 days weeks
or months to do that so the ability to
ramp up quickly is fantastic
with flair computing so an example of
that is with some of our researchers at
Microsoft Research under David Heckman
who looked at analyzing some genomic
data this is a very large data set which
is actually on what we call our actual
marketplace they have an algorithm
called faster ll a LM m which allows
them to do what's called gene I'm
genome-wide Association studies this is
interesting because this is fast LM M is
actually a linear algorithm with the
previous state of the artists order N
squared order n cubed emit in memory and
compute so the algorithm means that they
can they can do much bigger computations
but combining that with 27,000 cores on
Windows actual it meant they could do
1,000 compute years of work in about two
weeks and so again it shows the power of
the cloud when they spend a long time
developing the algorithms but when they
needed it they could burst out on some
thousands of course you know run those
results and then you know ultimately
publish those results and they're going
to go around that loop again so it's a
good example where they needed a massive
amount of compute 27 7000 cause there
are bigger machines in the world but the
ability to spin those up when you need
them you know it is hugely valuable so
that's an example that of of scaling up
scaling out those computations another
pattern is unpredictable verse you're
doing some work and all of a sudden you
need some compute you didn't know you'd
needed it but but all of a sudden you
need it in the Oh one of those things
has paper deadlines you know you're
working on your paper you get to Friday
you debug everything you think I'll
actually I need just a hundred machines
for a day hit my deadline Sunday night
you know the IT departments closed you
know you might have to queue for more
than a day when he queue you don't know
if you're gonna get what you need with
the cloud you can log in fire up the
machines running computations write up
the results submit your paper to meet
your deadlines this is you know again
shows the power of the cloud where you
know we don't always know what's around
the corner even if we know that paper
deadline is there we're often doing
things right after the last minute and
so the ability to spin things up in the
cloud is very very valuable
and so this again I think certainly when
harmonized the researcher you know this
sort of mode of operation was not
unusual for my group and other groups
within the university and so one example
here actually is weather forecasting as
a service where we've built and we've
taken some know weather forecasting code
one of the the open weather forecasting
codes deployed it on to the cloud so you
can literally click on on the map and
run on-demand weather forecasts so here
you can see some weather forecasts when
you click on the map you can run a run a
simulation and it will go and run on the
cloud and you can then browse your
results through the web browser so
weather forecasting on demand through a
web browser back-ended by the cloud and
again you can run hundreds of these
simulations at a time because the cloud
just scales out so again it's an example
of this unpredictable burst and
sometimes we have predictable
characteristics so we know when we need
the capacity this could be daily it
could be weekly it could be when we run
an experiment we know the run experiment
runs for a couple of hours and we need
to do some processing then we do the
acquisition for a couple of hours so
there's sort of periodic behavior is
very hard to accommodate if you're
trying to provide this type of computer
data infrastructure for the cloud allows
us to sort of match our resources with
what we need and an example there is it
was space space junk simulation where
it's a real problem
so it's Sandra Bullock and George
Clooney have discovered this with the
film gravity in the film gravity you'll
see this that the space debris junk
orbiting around the earth is a real
problem but what happens actually is
that NASA publishes twice a day they're
essentially radar returns for all the
space debris that that's currently
orbiting and so again my team has set
hands to realize they'd built this
pipeline on annual that twice a day
takes in the data and then processes
through our Shore and then put it out
into the visualization into a tool
called world wide telescope that we've
developed Microsoft Research so again
this happens twice a day so so twice a
day we enjoy
the data we spin up hundreds of cores
run those cores for a couple of hours
they spin down and then and then you
know we do that again after 12 hours so
the ability to spin up lots of compute
run about your Monte Carlo simulations
spin them down again and do that twice a
day again it's a really good scenario
for for cloud computing so so those are
sort of four of the key scenarios I
think that show you this ability to
scale with sustainable scalability and
again sharing data through the cloud to
allow us to collaborate and again if
there are multiple teams that all want
to share the same data putting it in the
cloud is a good place for everybody to
do that it means we don't have to have
multiple copies because the cloud
actually doesn't anyway and we get this
economy of scale and we can do sort of
pay-as-you-go so that hopefully explains
a little bit about what cloud computing
can do do for research so this webinar
is part of our program at myself'
research which we call Windows Azure for
a research where we're trying to again
work with you in the community to figure
out where cloud computing could help you
and we've been running some training
courses around the world so we've been
in Switzerland and France recently been
in career we've been in China we're
going around the world and if you go to
the website agile for research comm
you'll see our training course program
you know you can actually email us and
say hey we'd really love to host a
course for you you know can you come
talk to us and also we have an actual
research awards program where we are
giving out chunks of actual resources in
terms of computing data for people to
work for 12 months on you know good size
projects to allow them to prototype and
develop on a cure we'll talk about that
a bit more towards the end
we've also very recently published just
this week some technical white papers a
lot of the things I'll talk about here
today if you go to the website you'll
see a half a dozen white papers that go
into much more detail and walk you
through a lot of things I'm talking
today and then research community
engagements on LinkedIn
we have a group which I think I hope
some of you you know heard out heard
about this through the LinkedIn group
and then on Twitter as well sort of that
that conversation on Twitter that we're
having as well so please do join in with
all of those things so that I think was
sort of the first half really of the
session I wanted to take you through
where cloud computing could be used and
some of those different use cases where
how computer really makes a lot of sense
so you know if you've got questions on
that you know far away and ping those in
actually have a question for you as well
so I think we should have a poll here
Stephanie on the different uses of
clouds and I wanted to ask you you know
I've gone through some of those
scenarios sort of you know what sort of
things do you think you would think
about using using cloud computing for
and so you know dive in there and again
dive in with any questions on that but I
think you can see and again you know
after this section we'll go through
Windows Azure in a bit more detail
because it's not just about storage
entropy there's lots and lots of other
scenarios here here as well so so yeah
do vote and I get if you're not sure
that's fine you know hopefully by the
end of this webinar you'll have a better
idea
but but I think you know cloud computing
can be used in lots of different ways
and I think one of the things that apart
of our agile for research program is
giving you the ability to explore with
Windows Azure so that you can you know
discover for yourselves how you can use
using the cloud so I want to sort not
for too long but just to give you a bit
of a flavor for what windows azure is
and you know there are other cloud
computing platforms out there Microsoft
has probably one of three what we would
call global public clouds where we have
data sensors and these data sensors that
are large they're the size of sort of
ten football fields and we have millions
of servers across the globe in in Europe
here in the US over here we're just
opening up in China so we have our big
data centers here in blue and then have
what are called edge data centers which
get
closer to some of the some of our users
and this is all connected by our own
private network so that we can guarantee
other connections between the datasets
and that's very important in terms of
allowing resilience and sharing of data
and because we operate at this scale we
can do a lot of our own R&amp;amp;D and so you
know when we think about service and
datacenter we think about racks of
servers I think most people would be
familiar with a sort of racks of servers
most universities and research also
probably this is how you would deploy
you know tens or hundreds of servers but
when we get to the scale of global cloud
we started to think about shipping
containers you know sort of 40-foot
standard shipping containers as as ways
of putting in servers essentially having
three connections out of eg container
which would be basically power network
and cooling okay so three connectors and
we plug that container in plug in those
three connectors and we have suddenly
hundreds of thousands of servers online
and so that's worked well in some of our
you know Chicago and Dublin datacenters
but we've moved beyond that so what we
call IT pack where we've custom designed
what that container looks like so we
don't even have to put up a building we
just put one of these what we call an IT
pack we put a little covered walkway in
between in case it's raining plug that
in and we can get a datacenter with
hundreds of thousands of servers up in a
matter of a few weeks if you're
interested in this aspect do have a look
at what we call global foundation
services because they run Microsoft's
data infrastructure across the world so
for instance with the new kind of Xbox
all lost my xbox one this week you know
one of the things is the Xbox is backed
by these service 300,000 servers of
dedicated Xbox one in these data centers
around the world
office 365 runs out of these data
centers being Maps runs out of these
data centers being runs out of these
data centers and so global foundation
services can actually do the R&amp;amp;D that
you're now doing a fuel cell powered
container as well so really kind of get
these data centers very very efficient
and green as well
you know we do spend a lot of time and
there are very few companies that can
can do this at this scale and we're very
fortunate to be one of those companies
and so there are different flavors of
cloud computing what we call is sort of
infrastructure as a service platform as
a service and software as a service so
you can think of this in terms of
hosting machines and virtual machines
building out services and then consuming
services and so that's how we often
think about cloud and when you read
about how computing you'll see these
acronyms come up and so Microsoft we
support all three models and this is a
way of thinking about it if you think
about software running on your own
machines you're responsible everything
from the networking stack all the way up
to the application okay and if I run you
know think about my laptop or I think
about a server
well we think about infrastructure as a
service we virtualized that okay and so
we don't have to worry about the
hardware level we worry about everything
from the operating system up and then we
can go to a higher level of abstraction
which is what we call platform as a
service this is a little bit more like
your mobile phone if you think about how
you use your smart phone
you worry about your applications you
worry about your data so with my smart
phone I had a problem with my smart
phone and I had to get a replacement
smart phone and that was fine because
again on my applications and data were
backed up in the cloud irie synced my
smart phone and I was up and running
within you know 20 minutes and I didn't
have to rebuild all of this lower in the
stack because that's taken care of by my
session provider which is you know the
smart phone hardware and my network
operator and then we can go beyond that
a software as a service and if we think
about things like email and outlook comm
you know the other email services that's
really software service and so if you
think about this in terms of research
terms and what you do as a researcher
the job of a researcher is not
necessarily you know managing this whole
stack the job of a researcher is really
to delivering a service we actually talk
about now in
research research as a service you know
can we build things on top of the cloud
that really provide you know things like
you to think about email and that the
the ability for me to access my email
from the smartphone from a web browser
from a tablet from a PC from anywhere
think about research services and we'll
actually talk about that let's talk
about that next
and so Windows Azure is about sort of
virtual machines cloud services and
websites and actually to go into a bit
more detail for some of the some of you
who know about these things you know we
have essentially compute compute data
and networking at the bottom here we
support Big Data and things like Hadoop
importantly I think is that we support
multiple runtimes and languages so
things like a Python Java and we're very
open and so all of our SDKs are
available open source on github so again
it's an open platform you know bring
whatever you've got and we can run that
on our or and that's that's something
you know real take-home really is that
when you play around with a show don't
be afraid of it just you know come in
with what you have and I'm sure we can
support that for you as I really want to
go through a do to do pitch in with any
more questions on that side as well so I
want to talk about some real examples
research applications on Azure and I
want to go back to young real friend you
rail and so he had this problem with
with with with NASA Modi's data and
doing that so it was so we actually
helped him to create a pipeline in the
cloud that allowed it to download the
data actually in the cloud process it in
the cloud reduce that data using his
scientific algorithms so that he could
do his science and it you know it's
quite a team because this was quite you
know groundbreaking work with folks at
MSR University of Virginia Berkeley
Stanford and so a great great team of
researchers and software engineers to do
this and so this is the pipeline so nASA
has all the data and the idea was to
pull that data from NASA into the cloud
so not previously you would have to
download this locally onto your machine
gigabytes of data
but actually we keep it in the in the
cloud and essentially we have this data
processing pipeline where we do map free
projection and then we're doing actually
our scientific derivation and an
analysis reduction stage and then this
was running on hundreds of nodes on the
cloud and then actually your young girl
could download his data locally so all
of the heavy lifting was done in the
cloud and then he could download the
data locally so we extended this project
just this year with a tool called fetch
climate which we've developed here at
Microsoft Research in okay which lab
here which is a cloud-based service
where we host tens of terabytes of data
on the backend and you can actually
query that data using this Bing Maps
interface to my control box to say okay
draw box show me the temperature in
Africa you know between 1990 and 2000
fetch and so this is this is a tool
we've been developing it to make it much
easier to get climate data climate
information from lots of what are
otherwise freely available datasets
anyway but they're often locked away
behind portals which non-experts find it
difficult to use and what we did is
we've worked with young rail now to take
his Asheville processing pipeline and
rather than have young rel download
those results to his local machine where
only he can benefit from that we push it
into our fetch climate system so that
any researcher around the world can
benefit from that work that young rels
been doing so very much what we call
sort of science 2.0 you know how do we
do the analysis in the cloud scale app
that allows to share those results so
again you know and young rel we
presented this in Beijing at our annual
East science conference and young girls
just over the moon that we've actually
gone that extra mile with the cloud not
just doing the processing for being able
to share that that data so that's just
one example in environmental science
another example we have something called
the aerial marketplace where you can
publish data and in the UK the Met
Office you supply all of the weather
forecasts for the UK both the civilian
for TV weather forecast radio but also
to the military as well they've made
those forecasts open so you can go to
the actual marketplace and you can get
the daily forecasts 5 days for
for three early forecasts and the
observations data so if you do a web
search on Bing or other search engines
go to open weather data actually you'll
come up with this and you can actually
query and get that data it's a great
example of where the UK Met Office a
national organization how to publish
that data and make it open and they used
Windows Azure to do that and this you
know this is servicing something like
half a million downloads every month
half a million requests for the state
every mother very very important dataset
another example is where we need to do
this computation so we worked on a
project called Venus in European Union
project on cloud computing with a team
in Newcastle University and Cancer
Research UK they had to do these drug
toxicity calculations so essentially
calculating the safe dosage of the drug
and trying to do that in silicon in the
computer this they used to run on a
single server which would take about
five years to do the calculation but
they scaled this out onto Windows Azure
and they could then do it in less than a
day half a day so it's a great example
of taking that workload taking that
calculation which basically you just
wouldn't think about doing cuz it would
take too long in five years and it
changes the way they think about they do
the way they do their research and so
again it's an application you know sort
of off the cloud and this is a great
piece and if you look on the Microsoft
research connections blog we literally
just published a couple of days ago and
is again trying to rethink how we do
genomics and it's a way of using the
cloud to run queries against against
this data so what they've created the
team at UCSD and MSR have created what
they call gql genomic query language so
like SQL but for genomes and they're
using Azure or to be able to run those
queries superfast so that then
researchers can either run their
conversations and Azure or download the
results of those queries you know
accessing you know sort of you know
around a hundred gigabytes of data but
just making it so much easier for
researchers to do that again the cloud
is a is a platform for that so this is
of the press just this week in fact the
paper on this is available on the
Microsoft Research website another
example is a tour we called bio model
analyzer and so this is actually a model
of cells is that this could be actually
a layer of skin and bio model analyzer
allows us to run analysis that shows
where the cells essentially will reach
equilibrium or not and this is key for
example at looking at things like skin
cancer and so this is actually about
using actually using formal methods that
we use in programming languages but
applying it in the biomedical domain but
what's interesting here is you see a web
browser but all of these computations
are running in actual again so it's a
very nice interface very much this idea
of devices and services but putting out
into into the cloud so building out
those services can take some time and
again you know our training courses and
technical papers I try to to help you do
that but a very quick way of getting on
to the cloud is if you have a virtual
machine and those can be windows or they
can be limits we have something called
VM Depot where you can put your Linux
virtual machines we work with the
community for instance to put the bio
Linux virtual machine which is very
widely used in the bio informatics
community onto a draw
and then other machines we've put up
there so sea-can is an open source open
data portal used by a lot of open
government data projects but also being
used increasingly by universities for
that for their research data portals
again you can deploy that onto a show
just with a few mouse clicks you know
otherwise you would have to spin up you
know go and buy some servers or spin
those up virtually locally and get those
up but literally through the management
portal with a few mouse clicks you can
spin up these these virtual machines and
we've just published actually one that
we use on our training which is what we
call our data science core which is a
Python numpy side PI scikit-learn with
machine learning PI tables as a Linux VM
again that you can spin up very quickly
and so those are some things if you just
go to VM Depot you can get up and
running very very quickly on on on
Windows as well so that really hopefully
shows you how Windows Azure can be used
across lots of different domains in some
of those different modes infrastructure
as a service through virtual machines
through cloud services and websites
showing how we can scale out scale up
share data and all those different
patterns that we talked about at the
start so hopefully that's that's giving
you a bit of insight into how cloud
computing might be applicable in your
work and so again just as part of our
actual for research program the Azure
awards we awarded 35 Awards worldwide in
these these areas so in urban science
urban computing smart cities essentially
in machine learning machine learning the
cloud is fantastic for machine learning
because you can put large data sets up
there and then you can crank these big
you know learning algorithms against
them and then you know share those
results with people
environmental science that we've seen
some examples with young rel with fetch
climates and we're doing work in
hydrology for instance we're doing work
around climate change and some of
actually the data that's used for the
IPCC assessment report that was recently
published and working on scaling that
out onto the cloud life sciences we've
seen some great examples on life
sciences in biomedical with medical
imaging with genomics in computer
science so we've got a great project on
recomputation with the in Genesis and
Andrews and trying to create
reproducible computer science research
papers so you can click and rerun the
analysis of what somebody's done and
again in engineering and doing working
in mechanical engineering and
quantitative finance for instance so it
shows I think the broad applicability
where some of these design patents can
be applied you know across many many
domains and so again you know those are
some examples of the awards we've run
these awards deadlines every couple of
months so do go on to the website do
talk to us do submit because we're
really keen to see
your ideas were really keen the idea
with those awards is to realize some of
your ideas get you prototyping
developing deploying on Windows Azure or
so that you can really benefit from the
cloud for your research to help that we
are running these training courses and
again you know we are running those
worldwide across every continent except
Antarctica but if there are people in
Antarctica who really want to run a
course you know we can discuss that
worldwide and the webinars here you know
thank you very much for joining the
webinar live so do you know ping ask
your questions live but these will be
available on demand afterwards as well
so there's another resource for you to
work on and please share these with your
colleagues and as I said the technical
reports are online now just this week so
do jump on the website have a look at
those they're very detailed some of them
are high-level some of them are very
nitty-gritty click here click here get
your virtual machine up share your
virtual machine on VM demos so a broad
range of resources for you there we will
be running some research community
events and we have like with our e
science workshop and again on the
website you'll see some of those events
LinkedIn is a primary mechanism that
we're using to disseminate so again
please for those of you who haven't
joined the group please do join the
group and do invite your friends along
as well and again with Twitter the such
a vibrant community around cloud
computing research you know we're part
of the research data Alliance you know
open access all of those conversations
tie into cloud computing and so very
much want to engage with the community
globally around that as well
so that's really the program and this
webinar is the first in the series and
we're running a few now we'd love to get
your feedback on other webinars that you
would like to see and we have one on
Linux virtual machines and again going
into detail on how to spin those up and
we've got another one around
environmental science where we've got
some of the researchers we've got Tonya
burger wolf at University of Chicago
he's doing some very exciting work and
Kenya tracking animals looking
social interactions of animals and using
the cloud to do that citizen science for
instance with people taking pictures of
zebras in safari parks uploading those
into the cloud identifying the Zebras
from their stripes fantastic piece of
work with panda burger wolf that we're
working on and also with our colleagues
in Chile working on a project called
live and ease around conserving
endangered species and Chile and using
the cloud again to go out in the field
capture the data and use the cloud to
disseminate it collaborate so those are
some webinars that we've got coming up
over the next few weeks and so please do
join us join us for those so so with
that I think thank you very much for
joining the call if you've got any
questions to sort of fire those in to us
over I am so thank you very much all
