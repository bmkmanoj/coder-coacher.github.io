hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
so it's an honor today to have Steven
Pinker with us Steven is an experimental
psychologist and perhaps the world's
foremost writer on language thinking and
human nature as you can pick up very
easily from his writings over the last
20 years he's interested in all aspects
of language and mind steven is currently
Johnstone family professor of psychology
at Harvard University I was looking over
his history this morning preparing this
introduction and for many of us at
Microsoft Research I find his his
academic and life history interesting he
earned a bachelor's degree in
Experimental Psychology at McGill and
then moved to Cambridge Massachusetts in
1976 where he spent time as he says
bouncing back and forth between Harvard
and MIT most most of his initial
research working with Steven kosslyn and
others was in visual cognition including
the ability to imagine shapes recognize
faces in object objects and to direct
attention within a visual field he
earned his doctorate at Harvard in 1979
he did a postdoc at MIT and then a year
as an assistant professor at Harvard in
1982 he moved back to MIT where he
stayed until 2003 when he returned to
Harvard University
so almost to the month 20 years ago he
published started publishing the first
of several wonderful books written for
general audiences and this was the start
of a string of hits these include the
language instinct how the mind works
words and rules the blank slate the
stuff of thought and recently the better
angels of our nature his latest book
which we'll talk about today which I
can't wait to read is the sense of style
the thinking persons guide to writing in
the 21st century now we ought to listen
very carefully to him today beyond
general interest
steven has chaired the usage panel of
the American Heritage Dictionary so know
if he's talking about here he's helping
to define the dictionary here and in
terms of usage
and he's been also served as editor for
various groups that we all respect the
NSF triple-a s and the APA before
starting I'd like to sort of mention a
little bit about the human side of
Steven I am last April he and I would
did an event together
in Arizona called the origins meeting
and I dragged my son along with me
because the deal was for the organizer
Lawrence Krauss that my son had to come
with me because this is a college tour
I'll show up and do this event but my
son must must come with me so so Zachary
hung out with me at this meeting and and
this is Steven and Zachary hanging on
already said at a reception here McKenna
advance the slide here that's okay
I'll just uh here we go but just I
caught them at a reception and just uh
Steven was so engaged with Zachary
exactly a lots of questions he was 11th
grader then about cognition and the mind
and you see how seriously Steven takes
Zachary's thoughts he's very interested
in people and how they think and in the
individuals and it's great to see how
engaged he can be with people of all
ages so let's give a warm welcome here
to Steven Pinker
thank you very much Eric
why is so much writing so bad and how
can we make it better why do we have to
put so much effort into deciphering a
legal contract such such as the
revocation by these regulations of a
provision previously revoked subject to
savings does not effect the continued
operations why is it so hard to
penetrate a typical academic article
such as it is the moment of
non-construction
disclosing the absent ation of actuality
from the concept in part through its
invitation to emphasize in reading the
helplessness of its fall into
conceptuality why is it so hard to set
the time on a digital alarm clock well
there's no shortage of theories out
there and probably the most popular one
is captured in this cartoon in which a
boss says to the to the tech writer good
start needs more gibberish in other
words that bad writing is a deliberate
choice but bureaucrats insist on
gibberish to evade responsibility
it's the Revenge of the Nerds if
pasty-faced tech writers get their
revenge on their girls who turned them
down on dates in high school or the
jocks are kicked sand in their faces
pseudo-intellectuals try to bamboozle
their readers with highfalutin
gobbledygook disguising the fact that
they have nothing to say well I have no
doubt that the bamboozlement theory is
true for some writers some of the time
but it's also true that good people can
write bad prose I know many scientists
who have plenty to say they do
groundbreaking research on important
topics they have no need to impress
nothing to hide but still they're
writing stinks are they there's another
theory which I'm sure many of you are
familiar with which is that it's digital
media that are ruining the language
Google is making us stupid the digital
age stupefies young americans and
jeopardizes our future Twitter forces us
to write and therefore think in 140
characters
well I think there's a problem with the
dumbest generation theory as well which
is that it makes an empirical prediction
namely that it was all better before the
digital age that is and you remember
what life was like many of you were old
enough before instant messaging and
email back in the 1980s those were the
days in which teenagers spoke in fluid
power graphs bureaucrats wrote in clear
English and every academic article was a
masterpiece in the art of the essay
remember those days or was it the 1970s
well maybe you have to go back even
further like the 1960s well in those
days they were saying things like recent
graduates including those with
university degrees seem to have no
mastery of the language at all well
maybe you have to go back before the
invention of TV and radio say to 1917
well in those days you would hear from
every college in the country goes up the
cry our freshmen can't spell can't
punctuate every high school is in
disrepair because its pupils are so
ignorant of the merest rudiments well
maybe we have to go back even further to
the age of the Enlightenment for example
they said our language is degenerating
very fast I begin to fear that it will
be impossible to check it and then there
are the ancient grammar police who said
Oh for crying out loud you never end a
sentence with a little birdie
the thing is that writing bad writing
has burdened readers in every time in
every generation and my favorite theory
begins with an observation from Charles
Darwin that man has an instinctive
tendency to speak as we see in the
babble of our young children whereas no
child has an instinctive tendency to
bake brew or write speech is instinctive
but writing is and always has been hard
the your reader is unknown invisible
inscrutable they exist only in the
writers imagination they can't react to
prose in real time or break in or ask
for clarification and so writing is an
act of pretense and writing is an act of
craftsmanship so what can we do to
improve the craft of writing well for
many decades there was a single answer
to this question namely you give
students or aspiring writers this the
iconic elements of style by William
Strunk junior and professor at Cornell
and his student EB white the beloved
author of Charlotte's Web and Stuart
Little and a longtime New Yorker
essayist note by the way that the junior
member of this pair was born before the
turn of the century that is before the
turn of the 20th century now there's
plenty of good sense in the elements of
style and it is it is worth reading
today they have little gems of advice
like use definite specific concrete
language right with nouns and verbs put
the emphatic words at the end and my
favorite their prime directive omit
needless words which is a excellent
example of itself no needless words
there on the other hand for all its fame
I think the elements of style can't be
the basis for writing advice in the 20th
century for one thing it is filled with
baffling advice such as the word people
is not to be used with words of number
in place of persons that is you may not
say 3 people or 10 people or 20 people
why
well if of 6 people 5 went away how many
people would be left
answer one people did you get that by
the same logic you should never say I
have three children or 32 teeth it just
makes no sense to contact is vague and
self-important do not contact people get
in touch with them look them up phone
them find them or meet them well what
happens if you don't care whether
someone in phones another person or
meets them or messages them or emails
them or tweets them to contact happen to
be a neologism in the day of professor
Strunk and to his ear it sounded like
faddish business jargon since then the
word has passed into common usage
precisely because it's so useful namely
there are times where you don't care how
one person is going to get in touch with
someone else as long as they do so and
so the contact has been become
completely unexceptionable note that the
word clever means one thing when applied
to people another one apply to horses a
clever horse is a good-natured one not
an ingenious one
the problem with traditional style
advice is that it consists of an
arbitrary list of do's and dont's based
on the tastes and P's of the author's it
is not grounded in a principled
understanding of how language works and
as a result users have no way of
understanding and assimilating the
advice and as I will try to show you
much of the advice is just plain wrong I
think we can do better today we can base
advice on the science and scholarship of
language on modern grammatical theory
which provides ways of just talking
about syntax that are more suitable than
the old grammars based on Latin in
evidence-based dictionaries and grammars
research from cognitive science on what
makes sentence is easy or hard to read
and historical and critical studies of
usage and that's what I've tried to do
in the sense of style it all begins with
a model of effective prose as I've
mentioned writing is an unnatural act
good style requires above all some
coherent mental model of the
communication scenario what the writer
is trying to accomplish my favorite of
these models comes from a book called
clear and simple as the truth from the
illiterate literary scholars from C Noel
Toma and Mark Turner and they call it
classic style the model behind classic
style is that prose is a window onto the
world
the writer sees something in the world
he positions the reader so that she can
see it with her own eyes the reader and
writer are equals the goal is to help
the readers see an objective reality and
the stylist conversation well that all
sounds pretty obvious so what's what's
the alternative well it turns out
there's a range of alternative styles
such as what they call contemplative
style or ocular style practical style'
the one that many of us are familiar
with from academia is what they call
postmodern or self-conscious style in
which the writers chief if unstated
concern is to escape being convicted of
philosophical naivete about his own
and as Toma and Turner explain when we
open a cookbook we completely put aside
and expect the author to put aside the
kind of question that leads to the heart
of certain philosophical traditions is
it possible to talk about cooking do
eggs really exist is food something
about which knowledge is possible can
anyone ever tell us anything true about
cooking classic style similarly puts
aside as inappropriate philosophical
questions about its enterprise if it
took those questions up it could never
get around to treating its subject and
its purpose is exclusively to treat its
subject and since the whole idea behind
classic prose is you show the reader
something in the world I would be
hypocritical if I didn't at least give
you an example of classic prose the
example that I picked comes from an
article in Newsweek magazine by the
physicist Brian Greene on the theory of
inflationary cosmology and one of its
possible implications namely multiple
universes or the multiverse so green one
little excerpt from this article he
writes if space is now expanding then at
even or ever earlier times the universe
must have been ever smaller at some
moment in the distant past everything we
now see the ingredients responsible for
every planet every star every galaxy
even space itself must have been
compressed to an infinitesimal speck
that then swelled outward evolving into
the universe as we know it the Big Bang
Theory was born yet scientists were
aware that the Big Big Bang Theory
suffered from a significant shortcoming
of all things it leaves out the bang
Einstein's equations do a wonderful job
of describing how the universe evolved
from a split second after the bang but
the equations break down similar to the
error message returned by a calculator
when you try to divide one by zero when
applied to the extreme environment of
the universe's earliest moment the Big
Bang thus provides no insight into what
might have powered the bang itself now
Green does not pause to apologize about
how terribly complicated and abstract
the various equations are he presents
the reader with an image that they can
see for themselves if you can imagine
space expanding
you can run the mental movie backward
and realize that it must have all begun
with a spec that then expanded outward
also the Farrelly abstruse concept of
mathematical equations breaking down
which a typical reader of Newsweek might
have trouble appreciating he illustrates
with a an exact example namely if you
pull out your calculator and you put 1
divided by 0 you get an error message
you can see it for yourself or for that
matter you can even just contemplate the
paradox or the conceptual difficulty of
dividing the number 1 into 0 parts
either way the reader can appreciate for
himself or herself the what the concept
have an equation breaking down is many
examples of writing advice are
implications of the model behind classic
prose number one in classic prose the
focus is on the thing being shown not
the activity of studying yet namely the
writer's job peer group daily activities
and other professional concerns but let
me give you a somewhat contrived example
of the opening of a typical review
article that I might have to endure in
reading the professional literature in
my own field in recent years an
increasing number of researchers have
turned their attention to the problem of
child language acquisition in this
article recent theories of this process
will be reviewed no offense but very few
people are really interested in how
professors spend their time a more
classic way of opening the same article
might have been all children acquire the
ability to speak and understand a
language without explicit lessons how do
they accomplish this feat a corollary of
this advice is to minimize the kind of
apologizing that seems mandatory in
academic prose again I'll give you a
somewhat but only somewhat contrived
example the problem of language
acquisition is extremely complex it is
difficult to give precise definitions of
the concept of language and the concept
of acquisition in the concept of
children there is much uncertainty about
the interpretation of experimental data
and a great deal of controversy
surrounding the theories more research
needs to be done well this is the kind
of paragraph that could be deleted
without
los classic prose gives the reader
credit for knowing that many concepts
are hard to define and many
controversies are hard to resolve the
reader is there to see what the writer
will do about it another corollary is to
minimize the reflexive hedging that you
see in many kinds of professional ease
the almost robotic use of fluffy little
words that are jammed into prose to make
it seem as if the writer doesn't really
mean what he's saying somewhat fairly
nearly seemingly in part relatively
comparatively predominantly to some
extent so to speak presumably and the
similar device of the use of shutter
quotes to make it seem as if the the
writer doesn't actually mean words in
their literal senses I'll just give you
an example this is from a letter of
recommendation that I received for I got
it
she is a quick study and has been able
to educate herself in virtually any area
that interests her well are we supposed
to interpret this as saying that this
young woman is a quick study or that she
is a quick study mainly someone who is
rumored or alleged to be a quick study
but maybe isn't and the virtually does
this mean that there are some areas that
she's interested in that she just hasn't
bothered to educate herself in the
unthinking use of hedges was brought
home to me when I met a colleague at a
conference and I asked her how she was
doing and she pulled out a picture of
her four-year-old daughter and she said
we virtually adore her
why the compulsive hedging well in many
bureaucracies there is a well-known
abbreviation cya cover your anatomy but
there is an alternative so sue me
it is often better to be clear and
possibly wrong than fuzzy and not even
wrong ah also a good writer counts on
the cooperative nature of ordinary
conversation conversation could not
proceed unless there was a certain
amount of charity between reader and
writer
if someone says these days in the recent
years Americans are getting fatter you
don't interpret that as meaning as every
last member of the 300 million American
population has been getting fatter you
automatically interpret it as meaning on
average or more or less without
explicitly having to say so a second
feature of classic prose is they the
writer has to keep up the illusion that
the reader is seeing a world rather than
just listening to verbiage and as a
result is a classic piece of advice for
writers avoid cliches like the plague
and we're all familiar with the writer
who says things like we needed to keep
the ball rolling in our search for the
Holy Grail but found that it was neither
a magic bullet nor a slam dunk so he
rolled with the punches and let the
chips fall where they may while seeing
the glass of as half-full it's a no
brainer if you simply ladle out one
cliche after another the reader is
forced to turn off their visual cortex
and just process it as la blah blah if
the reader then does pay attention a
cliche monger is likely to inadvertently
produce ludicrous images in the form of
mixed metaphors like it's also from a
letter of recommendation Jeff is a
Renaissance man drilling down to the
core issues and pushing the envelope
you can do both or no one has yet
invented a condom that will knock
people's socks off and again if you use
words without being mindful of the
images they convey you will be eligible
for membership in awful Americans who
figuratively use literally so it's
perfectly fine to say she literally
blushed it is not as good to say she
literally exploded and it's very very
bad to say she literally emasculated him
you classic prose is about the world
it's not about the conceptual tools with
which we understand the world and so it
calls for avoiding meta concepts that is
concepts about concepts that are all too
familiar in professional pros like
approach assumption concept condition
context framework issue level model
perspective process rules strategy
tendency variable all of which are
almost always completely dispensable
from pros so instead of this for example
is by a legal scholar in the New York
Times who writes I have serious doubts
that trying to amend the Constitution
would work on an actual level on the
aspirational level however a
constitutional amendment strategy may be
more valuable which could just as easily
but have been stated as I doubt that
trying to amend the Constitution would
actually succeed but it may be valuable
to aspire to it or it's important to
approach the subject from a variety of
strategies including mental health
assistance but also from the law
enforcement perspective that is when
dealing with an unstable person we must
consult psychiatrists but we may also
have to inform the police finally
classic prose narrates ongoing events we
see agents performing actions that
affect objects non classic prose tends
to thing off' i events and then refer to
the event using a dangerous tool of
English grammar called nominalization
turning something into a noun there are
a variety of ways in which English
allows you to take a perfectly spry verb
and by adding a suffix like Asian or IO
n or or mint you can embalm it as a
lifeless noun so instead of competing
you engage in competition instead of
organizing something you bring about the
organization of it
Helen sword a an English scholar or 1st
of them as zombie nouns because they
kind of lumber across the scene without
any conscious agent actually directing
an action and they can turn prose into a
Night of the Living Dead prevention of
neurogenesis diminished social avoidance
meaning when we prevented New Year
neurons from forming they mice no longer
avoided other mice or subjects were
tested under conditions of good -
excellent acoustic isolation to wit we
tested the students in a quiet room so
characteristic of academic prose is the
use of meta concepts and nominalizations
that we all can recognize the humor
behind this old editorial cartoon in
which you have a bearded active academic
explaining the reason verbal SAT scores
are at an all-time low
in complete implementation of
strategized programmatics designated to
maximise acquisition of awareness and
utilization of communication skills
personal into standardized review and
assessment of language and old
development any interrogatory
verbalizations it's not just academics
who fall into the habit of thing affine
actions politicians do it as well such
as Texas Governor Rick Perry who when a
storm threatened the Republic Republican
National Convention said right now there
is not any anticipation that there will
be a cancellation that is right now we
don't anticipate that we will have to
cancel it and corporate consultants a
young man explaining to a reporter what
he did for a living said I made digital
and social media strategist I deliver
programs products and strategies to our
corporate clients across the spectrum of
communications functions and when the
reporter pressed him about what he
really did he finally broke down and
said I teach big companies how to use
and our product engineers portable
generators used to carry the following
warning mild exposure to CEO can result
in accumulated damage over time extreme
exposure to CEO may rapidly be fatal
without producing significant warning
symptoms yeah yeah and as a result
several hundred Americans every year
would asphyxiate themselves and their
families by running portable generators
indoors more recently the if you buy a
portable generator it will have this on
its sticker using a generator indoors
can kill you in minutes
classic pros so classic pros can
literally be a matter of life and death
yes literally okay well I promise that a
better understanding of language can
lead to better writing advice and let me
give you an example another notorious
contributor to zombie pros is the
passive voice the difference between the
dog bit the man an active sentence and
the man was bitten by the dog a passive
sentence it has long been observed that
the passive voice is overused by
academics on the basis of the analysis
which was made of the data which were
collected it is suggested that the null
hypothesis can be rejected and lawyers
if the outstanding balises is pre paid
in full the unearned finance charge will
be refunded and of course political
officials you might recognize this
person Julia Pierson the recently former
director of The Secret Service when
called upon to explain how it is that a
man with a knife managed to vault over
the White House fence run across the
lawn into the White House and get near
the Oval the president's bedroom all the
time with a with a knife and not I'll be
stopped until someone finally tackled
him she explained mistakes were made
Ivy what linguist sometimes call the
evasive passive
and so all the classic guides warn
writers from using the passive voice
such as Strunk and white they say use
the active voice the active voice is
usually more direct and vigorous than
the passive many a tame sentence can be
made lively and emphatic by substituting
a transitive in the active voice for
some such perfunctory expression as
there is or could be heard well I heard
some scattered titters through the room
I'm coming from people who realize that
in fact this passage warns against the
passive using the passive the other
obligatory reading for every college
freshman in a writing class is the
classic essay by George Orwell politics
in the English language in which he too
notes that mixture of vagueness and
sheer incompetence is the most marked
characteristic of modern English prose
modern by the way being late 1940s I
list below various of the tricks by
means of which the work of prose
construction is habitually dodged the
passive voice is wherever possible used
in preference to the active a passage
that has not one but two instances of
the passive voice warning readers never
to use the passive voice so what's going
on well the passive could not have
survived in the English language for
1500 years if it did not serve some
purpose and so why can't we do without
it it comes down to the very design of
language you can think of language as an
African vertigo web of knowledge into a
string of words the writers knowledge
can be modeled as a semantic network
that's the way cognitive psychologists
and many AI researchers as you all know
have done done for 50 or 60 years that
is a person's knowledge to a first
approximation can be thought of as a
number of concepts that are interlinked
by various conceptual and logical
relationships about doer done to is it
looks like and so on well what happens
when you have to take a portion of this
network and transmit it from one mind to
another well you have to code it into a
sentence which is a linear string a word
in by the way she's mentioned sorry that
this fragment of a semantic network
might be a crude approximation of a
person's knowledge of the tragic events
of Oedipus Rex as brought to life by
Sophocles in his play of that name but
when we convey it that some of those
thoughts to others we have to linearize
it in sy in Sophocles play Oedipus
married his mother and killed his father
one word after another that means that
there is an inherent problem in the
design of language namely that the order
of words in a sentence has to do two
things at once on the one hand it serves
as a code for meaning it indicates who
did what to whom but necessarily it
presents some bits of information to the
reader before others and therefore it
effects how the information is absorbed
by the reader in real-time in general
the earlier material in the sentence
looks backward it is the topic it's the
what the reader is looking at the later
material in the sentence is the focus
the new information that is being added
what the reader should now notice and
prose that violates these principles of
linear ordering will feel choppy or
disjointed or incoherent this brings us
to what the passive is good for namely
it allows the writer to convey the same
semantic information as the active
namely who did what to whom but in a
different surface order one that allows
the writer to start with the done two
rather than the doer so avoid the
passive is bad advice if it's offered
across the board the passive is the
better construction when the done to is
currently the focus of the readers
mental gaze and again let me give you an
example I'm gonna read a little passage
from the Wikipedia plot summary of
Oedipus Rex
spoiler alert from the epiphany the
climactic scene in which the tragic
backstory of Oedipus is gradually
revealed a messenger arrives from
Corinth it emerges that he was formerly
a shepherd on Mount
and during that time he was given a baby
the baby says was given to him by
another Shepherd from the layest
household who had been told to get rid
of the child now notice that this
passage has three passives in a row the
passage begins a messenger arrives from
Corinth so we are all now looking at the
messenger he has entered the stage well
it's natural to use a passive he was
given a baby we're already looking at
him
well now we're looking at the baby and
so the next sentence ought to begin with
the baby and the passive voice makes
that possible the baby was given to the
messenger by another Shepherd
well now another Shepherd is on the
stage our eyes are on the other Shepherd
and so it's natural to begin the next
sentence with that and again the passive
voice makes that possible the other
Shepherd had been told to get rid of the
child perfectly coherent now let's say
you followed the advice to convert
passives to actives the passage would
read the messenger arrives it emerges
that he was formerly a shepherd on Mount
Catherine and that during that time
someone gave him a baby
another shepherd from the last household
he says whom someone had told to get rid
of a child gave the baby to him now I
submit that this is not an improvement
because it violates the orderly
progression of the readers attention
from one entity to another a writer is a
bit like a cinematographer who has to be
careful as to where the camera is
pointing more generally English syntax
provides writers with constructions that
vary order in the string while
preserving meaning Oedipus killed Laius
Laius was killed by Oedipus it was Laius
whom Oedipus killed it was Oedipus who
killed Laius and so on and writers must
choose the construction that introduces
ideas to the reader in the order in
which he can absorb them well this then
does bring us back to the initial
question if the passive is so
indispensable why is it so common in bad
writing well it's because good writers
narrate a story advanced by protagonists
who make things happen bad writers work
backwards from their own knowledge
writing down ideas in the order in which
they occur to them they begin with the
outcome of an event because they know
how it turned out and then they throw in
the cause
and afterthought and the passive makes
that all too easy okay this brings me to
part three is why do writers do that why
is it so hard for writers to use the
resources of language to convey ideas
effectively my favorite explanation is
called the curse of knowledge the aspect
of our psychology in which it's hard to
imagine what it's like for someone else
not to know something that you do know
psychologists also call it mind
blindness ego centrism or the hindsight
bias and a lovely illustration comes
from a classic experiment known to every
intro psych student where sometimes
called the false belief task a child
comes into the lab you hand him a box of
candy say a box of M&amp;amp;Ms he opens it and
he's surprised to find that inside it
there isn't candies but rather ribbons
so he put the ribbons back in the box
close it back up again you say well now
another little boy is gonna come to the
lab Jason what does he think is in the
box and the child will say ribbons even
though of course Jason would have no eye
no way of knowing if the child knows
that he can't imagine what it's like for
someone not to know it fact if you ask
the first child what did you think was
in the box when you came into the room
the child will say ribbons he can no
longer recover the state at which he did
not know that that the box had been
tampered with
well we adults outgrow this stage a
little because many studies have shown
that there are versions of the curse of
knowledge that apply to grownups we
attribute our own vocabulary to others
our own factual knowledge our own
technical skill the more experienced
someone has had with a gadget like a
cell phone the less time they think it
will take for someone else to learn how
to use it I believe that the curse of
knowledge is the chief contributor to
opaque writing and for that matter
opaque product design instructions and
so on software interfaces etc it just
doesn't occur to the writer that readers
haven't learned their jargon don't know
the intermediate steps that seem too
obvious to mention can visualize a scene
that is currently in the writers mind's
eye and so the writer doesn't bother to
explain the jargon or spell out the
logic or supply the concrete details and
again I'm going to give you an example
many professionals and academics excuse
themselves from bad writing by saying
well I'm writing for my peers and they
know all of the concepts so it would
only insult them if I were to spell them
out that is patently untrue a I'm sure
many of you repeatedly find yourself
baffled by prose that is actually
written for specifically for you and
I'll give you an example of an article
on consciousness from a journal called
trends in cognitive science which is
written for people like me and here's
how it goes the slow and integrative
nature of conscious perception is
confirmed behaviorally by observations
such as the rabbit illusion and its and
its variants where the way in which a
stimulus is ultimately perceived is
influenced by post stimulus events
arising several hundreds of milliseconds
after the original stimulus well I read
that and I processed the verbiage but I
really did not know what it meant
beginning with the fact that the writer
just assumed that everyone would know
what the rabbit illusion was I've been
in this business for 35 years
I teach undergraduates I teach the
perception I never heard of the rabbit
illusion so I went to the books and
indeed I found there's something called
a cutaneous rabbit illusion that works
as follows if a person closes their eyes
and then the experimenter taps them
three times on the wrist and then three
times on the elbow and then three times
in the shoulder the person will
experience it as a series of taps
running up the length of their arm like
a hopping rabbit and okay that's
interesting because it means that where
you perceive the earlier taps depends on
the location of the later taps so
consciousness does not track sensation
in real time but it's kind of edited
after the fact to make a continuous
experience so why didn't I say that the
expression tap on the wrist is no less
scientific than stimulus and tap on the
elbow is no more precise than post
stimulus event indeed not only is it no
less scientific it's more science
because now a pure scientist can
evaluate the argument and decide whether
that really does show that conscious
perception is slow or integrative as
opposed to some alternative explanation
my favorite way of summing up the curse
of knowledge comes from an old joke
where a man is visiting a Catskills
resort and walks into the dining room
and he comes across a bunch of retired
borscht belt comedians talking around a
table
he sits himself down and one of them
says 37 and the others break on the top
Laureus laughter no this is 112 and
again general hilarity you can't you
know figure out what's going on so you
ask the guy next to him what what's
happening here guy says well you know
these old-timers have been together for
so long that they all know each other's
jokes so to save time they've given
every joke a number now all they have to
do is recite the number guy says that's
ingenious I'll try it
see he calls up 44 stony silence 87
everyone stared at him and no one
laughed sort of sank down into his chair
and he asked his companion what happened
what did I do wrong I said oh it's all
in the way you tell it how do you
exercise the curse of knowledge well the
traditional solution is always keep in
mind the reader over your shoulder
that is empathize put yourself in their
shoes walk a mile in their moccasins
feel their pain and so on well that's ok
as far as it goes but the problem is
that none of us has extrasensory
perception and we're actually not very
good at guessing other people's
knowledge even when we try but it is a
start so for what it's worth I will
share with you the advice your readers
your users no less than you think you do
and unless you at least try to imagine
what it's like to be them you're
guaranteed to confuse them a better
solution is to close the loop and show a
draft to a representative reader or user
and you'll often be surprised to find
that what's obvious to you is not
obvious to anyone
else or ignition show draft to yourself
after some time has passed and it's no
longer familiar if you're like me you'll
find yourself thinking what did I mean
by that that doesn't follow and all too
often who wrote this crap and then
rewrite ideally several times with a
single goal
just making the prose understandable to
the reader finally how should we think
about correct usage which is the aspect
of writing that by far gets the most
attention now there are some usages that
are clearly wrong when a Cookie Monster
says me want cookie the reason that even
a preschooler will laugh is that the
preschooler knows that Cookie Monster
has made a grammatical error likewise
there would be no humor such as it is in
law cats such as I Can Has Cheezburger
unless we sense that this is violates
the rules of English grammar is our
children learning even george w bush
acknowledged that this was a grammatical
error in a self-deprecating speech he
gave a year later on the other hand
there are other alleged errors of usage
that are not so clear and just to be
nonpartisan I will show you a democratic
president Bill Clinton who when running
for office in 1992 had the catchphrase
give Al Gore and I a chance to bring
America back which some purists would
say contains a grammatical error this is
also known as the between you and I
error another Democratic president
barack obama recently said no American
should ever live under a cloud of
suspicion just because of what they look
like which some English teachers would
say contains a error in number agreement
the plural pronoun they is being forced
into agreement with the singular
antecedent no American sometimes called
the singular of a construction
to boldly go where no man has gone
before
the famous split infinitive you think
you lost your love well I saw her
yesterday eh it's you she's thinking of
and she told me what to say eh
ending a sentence with a preposition and
then some of you may have heard of the
suave urbane articulate 1970s talk-show
host Dick Cavett who in a recent article
in The Times reminiscing about a college
reunion said checking into the hotel it
was nice to see a few of my old
classmates in the lobby anyone see spot
the grammatical error in that sentence
dangling modifier yes indeed
well this these kind of disputed usages
have given rise to something some call
the language war between the so called
prescriptivists and descriptivists now
according to this construction the
prescriptivists are those who prescribe
how language how people ought to speak
their position they're also known as the
purists ticklers peasants fever snobs
snoots nit pickers traditionalists
language police usage nannies grammar
nazis and gotcha gang according to whom
the rules of usage are objectively
correct to obey them is to uphold
standards of excellence to float them is
to dumb down literate culture degrade
the language and hasten the decline of
civilization then on the other side
there are the descriptivists those who
describe howling how people do speak who
believe that the rules of usage are
nothing more than the secret handshake
of the ruling class the people should be
liberated to write however they please
well the reasons to think that this is a
really a pseudo controversy and false
dichotomy if it were really true then
prescriptivists would insist that the
lyrics - she loves you should have been
it's you of whom she's thinking and
descriptivists would say that there is
nothing wrong with I Can Has Cheezburger
which can't be right otherwise it
wouldn't even have a claim to being
funny so I think we need a more
sophisticated way of thinking about
usage than this false dichotomy that
Benj end up by various journalists well
what are rules of usage they're
certainly not an objective fact about
the world that you could go out and
measure with an instrument like a
physical scientist they are not a
theorem of logic that you could prove
nor contrary to popular opinion are they
officially regulated by dictionaries
it's not as if they're every year the
dictionaries get around a table and
legislate on what is correct or
incorrect in English I can speak with
some authority here because I'm the
chair of the usage panel of the American
Heritage Dictionary when I first joined
I asked the editors so how do you guys
decide what goes into the dictionary and
they said we pay attention to the way
people use language in other words when
it comes to what's correct in English
there's no one in charge the the
lunatics are running the asylum so what
are rules of usage they are tacit
evolving conventions convention is a way
of doing something that has no inherent
advantage other than the fact that
everyone else is doing it the same way
paper currency is a classic example
there's nothing valuable about a green
piece of paper other than the fact that
everyone else treats it as valuable or
driving on the right there is no
inherent reason to drive on the right as
opposed to the left but on the other
hand there's a very good reason to do it
the same way everyone else is doing it
as illustrated in a joke in which a man
is driving to work and he gets a cell
phone call from his wife and his wife
says oh be careful honey I've been
listening to the radio and they say that
there is a maniac out there driving in
the wrong direction on the freeway and
he says what maniac
there are hundreds of them
unlike traffic rules though the
conventions of language are tacit don't
ever decides they emerge as a rough
consensus within a community of careful
writers without explicit deliberation
agreement or legislation and they're
evolving the consensus may indeed does
change over time to contact starts out
life as a bit of business jargon it then
becomes a standard so should writers
follow these rules and the answer is it
depends there are some rules that just
extend the logic of everyday grammar to
more complicated cases is our children
learning how do we know that that's an
error why did george w bush
good-naturedly concede that it's an
error
well because it's simply a version of
our children is learning and everyone
agrees that our children is learning is
an error therefore the inverted version
must also be an error I think you guys
have all seen this thing here lean green
wiggly line in my experience most of the
Microsoft grammar checker green wiggly
lines flag errors of agreement and
actually do so quite well likewise
here's another appearance of the green
wiggly line the impact of the cuts have
not been felt yet this too when you
think about it actually is does violate
a rule of English grammar because the it
should be the impact of the cuts has not
been felt the problem is that the writer
was distracted by the adjacent word cuts
in the plural sitting right next to the
verb the verb should agree with the
subject of the sentence not with the
noun adjacent to it as you can see if
you simply leave out the subordinate
prepositional phrase and if you say the
impact have not been felt yet that just
pops out as an error and that is why we
all agree that the impact of the cuts
have not been felt is likewise an error
another case is that many rules make
important semantic distinctions if you
thank someone for the fulsome
introduction they gave you you are not
complimenting either the introducer or
yourself because Folsom does not mean
full complete rich it means
insincere excessively unctuous or or
necessarily flattering
likewise if something is if you call
something simplistic as a way of
complimenting it you will make a similar
blunder simplistic clearly means overly
simple or naive and if something is has
much merit you should not call it
meretricious look it up you'll see why
not in general it is a good idea when
choosing a word not to simply assume
that if if it's a familiar word with
some fancy schmancy suffix at the end
it's a posh or hoity-toity way to refer
to the same thing in general words with
different endings mean different things
and you will get yourself in trouble if
you use them in a way that your readers
will not expect at the same time hope
yes so you will be in danger of courting
the response that inigo montoya gave to
wit see me in the Princess Bride after
Vizzini repeatedly used the word
inconceivable for things that just
happened
I said you keep using that word I do not
think it means what you think it means
at the same time not every pet peeve bit
of grammatical folklore or dimly
remembered lesson from miss thistle
bottoms English classroom is a
legitimate rule of usage and when
scholars track down these rules they
find many of them violate grammatical
logic are routinely flouted by the best
writers and have always been floated by
the best writers a nice example being
singular they a recently a language
grump wrote that this is a part of a
conspiracy by feminists to violate the
English language to give people a way to
refer to people of indeterminate gender
and that we should all go back to the
crystalline prose of Jane Austen whoops
in an essay called everyone loves their
Jane Austen a literary scholar notes
that she used singular they no fewer
than 87 times in her prose such as
everybody began to have their vexation
you think you shouldn't end a sentence
with a preposition well maybe then you
could improve on Shakespeare's prose
when he wrote we are such stuff as
dreams are made on and the same is true
of
infinitives dangling participles between
you and I and many other alleged errors
indeed it's not just that you shouldn't
bother to obey bogus rules if you obey
them you can make your prose worse take
this sentence from a press release from
Harvard University
my employer David Rockefeller has
pledged 100 million dollars to increase
dramatically learning opportunities for
Harvard undergraduates now I don't know
what language that is it ain't English
what happened was the writer wet twisted
himself into a pretzel to avoid the
split infinitive to dramatically
increase learning opportunities and in
obeying this completely bogus rule
turned his own sentence into word salad
and it gets even worse because obeying
bogus rules can actually lead to a
crisis of governance literally in 2009
Chief Justice John Roberts who is a
famous stickler for grammar torturing
his law clerks and associates by sending
back everything they wrote with lots of
grammatical errors circled he was in
charge of administering the oath of
office to Barack Obama inaugurating him
as president and what he the wording he
should have used as stipulated by the
Constitution were I Barack Obama do
solemnly swear that I will faithfully
execute the office of President of the
United States
Roberts abandoned his strict
constructionism unilaterally amended the
Constitution unsplit a split verb and
have him say I Barack Obama do solemnly
swear that I will execute the office of
President to the United States
faithfully now not only is this not a
stylistic improvement over the what the
framers originally framed but it led to
possible questions about the legitimacy
of the transition of power and to avoid
kind of birthers on steroids question
being whether he really was president
they had to repeat the oath of office in
a private ceremony later that afternoon
so how should a careful writer
distinguish the legitimate rules of
usage from the bogus ones and the answer
is unbelievably simple look them up
if you look up split infinitive in
Merriam Webster's unabridged dictionary
what it will say is it's alright to
split an infinitive in the interest of
clarity
since clarity is the usual reason for
splitting this advice means merely then
you can split them whenever you need to
and you'll get the same advice from the
American Heritage Dictionary the Encarta
world English Dictionary the Random
House dictionary and so on contrary to
most people's beliefs modern
dictionaries and style manuals do not
ratify pet peeves grammatical folklore
or bogus rules they will not settle
barroom bets in favor of the pendant or
stickler because they are based on
evidence on how great writers write when
there are marginal cases they will be
explicitly discussed in usage notes
indicating what the controversy is and
what a reader can expect so they are not
a kind of backup for smartypants
one-upmanship while also correct usage
should be kept in perspective though I
think it is well worth knowing what the
prescriptively
ordain rules are they're the least
important part of good writing they pale
in significance behind classic style
overcoming the curse of knowledge to say
nothing of factual diligence and
coherent ideas and arguments and not
even the most irksome errors are signs
of the decline of language and this is
beautifully illustrated by Randall
Munroe in an xkcd cartoon in which a
purist is visited by a ghost in his
sleep who brings a cautionary vision of
things to come this is the future and
this is the future if you give up the
fight over the word literally as you can
see they are exactly the same so to sum
up modern linguistics and cognitive
science I argue provide better ways of
enhancing our prose a model of prose
communication specifically classic style
language used as a window onto the world
an understanding of the way language
works in particular that language has to
convert a web of thoughts into a string
of words a diagnosis of why good prose
is so hard to write namely the curse of
knowledge and a way to make sense of
rules
correct usage namely as tacit evolving
conventions thank you very much any
interrogatory verbalizing she's thinking
a really petty detail you seem to care
about subject for a number of free men
but pronoun a decedent agreement because
I'm worried about where you're just
saying no yes the subject agreement is a
process of grammar it's within a single
clause pronoun antecedent agreement is
much more fluid and moreover it's
actually I think it's actually a mistake
to call they in and everywhere you know
yeah so called singular they
construction a plural pronoun it is a so
if you say everyone returned to their
seats or no American should be under a
cloud of suspicion because of what they
look like they is not referring to a
group of individuals they is basically a
bound variable everyone return to their
seats means for all X everyone returned
to X's seat of X return to exit seat and
that's really what it's doing and so I
think it's actually a bit of a misnomer
even to call it a failure of agreement
of number it doesn't really have a
number in the classic sense and I have a
discussion in the book of how a large
number of usage controversies come from
the fact that from a kind of bug in the
design of English namely English forces
you to dichotomize all entities all
things you ever want to refer to into
the two categories one and more than one
and logically speaking there are many
many things that you might want to talk
about for which that isn't if there's no
answer to that question like zero is
zero so for none there's some people say
that none has to be used in a singular
none of them is coming as opposed to
none of them are coming well none refers
to zero is zero one or zero more than
one there's no answer to that or
likewise a bound variable if
is X singing refer to one thing or too
many things well neither it just is a
way of carrying over reference to
something in a logical expression and a
huge number
probably 25 different usage
controversies come over the fact that
that semantically the world doesn't come
in two in one in more than one but many
English constructions seem to force you
in that direction yes Oh writings been
going on for a very long time and I'm
wondering what the whether on balance
you think that writing is getting better
and secondly how much do you think your
book is going to move the needle it's
hard to answer that question just
because there's no one thing called
writing because there's everything from
you know note scrawled on a napkin that
you leave for your roommate to State of
the Union address or a funeral oration I
don't think that in that in general
writing is declined there's no reason to
think that it that it has more people
are writing more things than ever before
this has occurred in several pulses both
with the expansion of literacy it used
to be
75 years ago that a large percentage of
the population never entered high school
and they were functionally illiterate
fewer and fewer people are functionally
illiterate surveys of student turn
papers have shown that there has been no
decline of quality in terms of note
number of errors per page the and
there's a lot of good prose around its
I'm often even though there's a lot of
bad prose around I mean there's a lot of
you know ranting of by trolls of below
the comment line known and you read a
typical product review on Amazon or
Wikipedia entry and it's it's pretty
clear and surprisingly few errors of
grammar spelling punctuation I think one
possible change is that it's I haven't
seen a quantitative study of this but
often the best language seems to be more
colorless and lip than some of the
language of you know a century or a
couple of centuries ago you read you
know Adam Smith or David Hume or Edmund
work granted you're picking kind of the
greatest hits of that era but there's a
car there's a vividness willingness to
use metaphor and literary flourishes
that you are less likely to see today I
think my hunch is so you know you might
refer to the a particle of the dove
needed into our bosom together with the
elements of the world wolf and the
serpent and now we would say something
like you know humans have some
pro-social tendencies together with you
know aggression it may be because we
have so many technical terms available
to us that we don't reach for the
metaphor and that will drain prose of
some of its vitality even though it kind
of makes it more less effortful to
convey abstract ideas yes
what do you favorite examples of my
writing my favorite examples of modern
writing I think there's a lot of good
writing and um but I certainly I think
that we're in a golden age of science
writing just to give one example and I
think we've got you know great writers
like Richard Dawkins and Robert Sapolsky
and Matt popularizers of mathematics
like Steven Strogatz and Jordan elenberg
and John Allan Paulus Brian Greene who I
quoted doesn't use you know kind of
flowery ornate language but the I
consider the ability to convey abstruse
concepts without dumbing down the
content to be a quality of good writing
and philosophers who have affiliate
themselves with the sciences like Daniel
Dennett like Colin McGinn are also I
think they're quite effective writers so
I don't want to say that's that's the
only kind of good writing out there but
that's one example where I don't think
anyone can complain about the the
quality of writing yes
your two most recent works the sense of
style and better angels yeah it seems
that the germs for the idea were based
in how many misconceptions hmm and my
question is if that's true is that just
a coincidence or is that a method you
used to find subjects that you find book
worthy yeah well oh look were the only
in the sense that if it was already
believed why do you believe then there
wouldn't be a wouldn't be any value in
saying something new I don't like the
style of journalism of writing of
everything you know is wrong that has
become kind of gimmick or a hook that
that I think as you know well past its
it's a used by date so but you know I
wanted there to be you know something
that is is newsworthy or or of interest
another common thread between the better
angels of our nature and the sense of
style is that both cases I go against
the current that says that everything's
getting worse
whether it be violence in one case or
the quality of prose and another I think
there is a cognitive illusion that we
are prone to that that things are
getting worse that comes from a number
of sources one of them is as you get
older you start to notice certain things
they start to bother you more and we
have a tendency to externalize that
change and assume that it's the world
that's getting worse rather than our
cells becoming more perceptive also as
Thomas Hobbes noted there's a widespread
habit among writers and intellectuals to
say that things are getting worse
because if you say that things are bad
now you're implicitly putting down your
competitors your rivals because as you
put it we compete with the living not
with the dead
so things used to be better and I'm
noticing it it means I'm better than you
guys because you are an example of the
bad stuff I'm writing about and I think
that is a pernicious
of pundits and commentators and social
critics and maybe there is some
annoyance with that kind of one at
one-upmanship that motivated me to write
these books so to what extent do you
think what you sent over here apply to
the scientists who's what we English the
second language
how would it apply to use of English in
the second language well a lot of things
we just carry over such as being
concrete visual being vivid looking
looking things up all the more so for
English as a second language so I think
a lot would carry over yeah I'm sorry I
forgot to answer the question do I think
that I will move the needle who knows I
really yeah I like to think so but it
would be presumptuous to predict that I
will yes so do you observe a drastic
change in the usage of English language
with the growing number of international
English speakers in terms of slings and
accents yeah not really the question is
is there has there been a noticeable
change in the English language from the
fact that basically English has gone
global
there are many English's there's Indian
English and Singapore English and and so
on I think you would see that in local
media but I don't think that it I don't
see a lot of signs of it kind of
propagating back to the the mothership
to say New York Times or the the
Guardian or forums in the English
mainstream and in jet which is not to
say that there aren't some innovations
because languages especially English are
always scooping up new terms borrowing
from their neighbors and from various
specialties and walks of life there are
terms that have entered the English
mainstream from horse-racing you know
but to jockey from sailing take a new
tack and it's inevitable that there will
be ones both from the world of tech and
from other dialects of English
just because English has always been
collecting and opportunistic but but I
don't see much evidence of say common
expressions of say Indian English or
Singapore English going and swimming
upstream and changing American English I
mean maybe one or two but it's not a big
process as far as I can tell
