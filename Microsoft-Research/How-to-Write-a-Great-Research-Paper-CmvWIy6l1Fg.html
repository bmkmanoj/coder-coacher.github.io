hear this here's the plan
we all have to write like the big part
of the fabric of doing research is
writing papers and if you look at papers
you'll find that lots of them a bit and
complex a little bit hard to make sense
of and what I wanted to suggest you is
seven simple things that you can do that
will raise you know your own game and
make your papers that are easier to
easier to understand and more populist
publishable which is all good now this
is something about which people nobody
has a monopoly on truth so I'm gonna
tell you what works for me may not work
for you but also some of you will have
written papers already or will have some
experience of your own and I'd like to
encourage you not to sit very passively
and politely until the end before you
know the marks officers would rather to
engage in some kind of dialogue as we go
so you can ask questions
you just make comments and say you know
so this you know I I do something
different here you know and because my
field is different another thing that
can be different is the different fields
have different conventions so you know
bioinformatics might be rather different
and climate modeling like we've all the
difference too and my field of computer
science so but the principal target that
I'm going to address is the framework
and a kind of 12 page conference paper
in ACM you know two column format so but
most of what I say will apply to any
paper that you might write but but
that's that's my sort of primary target
I think it's easy to focus on one thing
to begin with okay so you ready seven
things so here's number one when we
might papers we often think that we
should sort of do our research from like
this you first of all have some kind of
idea and then you do a research into
your PhD and towards the end you think
right now I've worked everything out I
can write the paper it seems only seemed
sensible I'd do the work then like the
paper this is utterly wrong but I nobody
should do this this is what you should
do right first of all you have some kind
of microscopic idea then you start to
write the paper and that tells you the
research that you need to do so the act
of articulating something in writing
even if only for yourself is incredibly
helpful in crystallizing your ideas and
sort of making forcing you to write them
clearly enough so that you know whether
they they make sense or not
and it's it's not uncommon to if you do
if you follow on this model it's not
uncommon to get to the end right be
writing the paper you know it's only six
weeks before the conference deadline and
you discover there's a whole pile of
work that you haven't done that you
should have done to write this paper and
there's a whole pile of work that you
did do that was irrelevant for this
paper like so this plan makes it much
more task focused you sort of start to
focus on on writing a paper and then
it's like that lazy evaluation in for
functional programmers like you you sort
of have to work on the bits that are
needed to deliver the results does that
make sense right so the other really
good thing about writing early is that
it it gives you something you can talk
to other people about so when you
interact with other people research is a
sort of community effort is not really
conducted by monks in their cells each
working individually for years
occasionally yes occasionally but not
typically it's more of a community thing
and this is the mechanism of
communication in a community now if you
write some kind of draft of a paper
that's not finished yet then okay you're
not going to publish it in a journal but
you might share it with a few of your
research colleagues to say here's what
I'm thinking about you know does this
make sense er it gives you something so
much more concrete to discuss with your
colleagues okay so it's pretty simple
idea really just start writing early so
like you know you have to have something
to write about but but don't wait very
long you know a month or two is long
enough before you can start writing
something it doesn't have to be for a
journal or for a conference it can just
be something to help you get your idea
straight so I just want to articulate
the idea that the act of writing is not
a kind of output of the research it's
part of the fabric of doing research
it's the main forcing function that I
use so I think it casts your writing in
a different frame when you think about
in this play so far so good that's
pretty simple right that's number one
yeah in the case that you're wrecking
the paper and nothing comes out
it might seem like a waste of written
waste of time why it's so writing maybe
hard right and your point is that if it
turns out that nothing comes out of it
then it was a waste I don't think it's a
waste fight so I would suggest for
example you might spend six months
working on that dead end and then
discover that it was a dead end as if
you've spent a month starting to write
you might have discovered it earlier
right to the the writing forces to the
surface the fact that maybe this is not
very productive line so I don't know I
can't deny that writing is sometimes
difficult but in my heart I think it's
really worth it that you know that if
the trade-off is a good one yeah right
in so the questions been couldn't you
write a PowerPoint presentation instead
of writing paper that's fine too yes you
tend to be a bit less detailed so
there's a more the danger that you might
skate over the the dodgy bits right and
deceive yourself we have great great
capacity for self-delusion right say oh
yeah I understand that when you like the
baby to feel you don't understand it so
there's a bit more danger of that but
yeah anything to articulate it so that
both you and other people in appreciate
it yes
an introduction mode question evaluation
set of headings great yeah then I put in
a couple of dot points gas is counting
what I'm thinking but the nice thing
about using a shareable whatever and
they can comment something and this
helps firstly it's kind of the skeleton
which the paper is going to eventually
like and then it also means that
immediately we're feeding back against
each other and when I say I think we can
evaluate it this way they say that's a
terrible idea because it will never work
yeah that's really early on in the
process I haven't looked at building
anything good so you see you know you're
slightly different mechanism for
articulating ideas and sharing them and
by making them concrete invisible yet
that's all good yes okay so number one
here's number two all right which is
here I said this what about this idea
but at the beginning so it's very
important in a paper to know what the
idea is at least by the time you've
finished so what is the purpose of
writing a paper here is the purpose it
is to convey a reusable insight or idea
from your brain into the mind of what's
your name Matt right so from my brain
into Matt's brain so my my paper is kind
of like a virus that is carrying this
infectious idea out of my brain and it's
going to infect match neurons and soon
he's going to be able to think of
nothing else and then he can tell his
friends and they'll tell their friends
or - my idea is going to infected the
world right so so the it's a it's a that
the paper is a way of conveying ideas
that's its primary mechanism I using
Mozart as my example here because
Mozart's ideas were so incredibly
seductive and compelling that hundreds
of years after he's died think we go to
concert halls to hear people read his
papers alright so so so so long after we
are dust long after the artifacts that
we build a dust and in computer science
is no constructive engineering kind of
subject as well as a scientific one so
we build things but long after the
things we build are dust the ideas that
we develop will hopefully still live on
in some way
actually yeah the kind of reuse and I
stress reusable because
because novelty of itself is of little
value in computer science right simply
that for something to be new is not
important it's going to be new and so
how useful could be this answered like a
a fact ah it's like a snowflake
everywhere you study ramifies ahead of
you so it's easy to find you territory
right but you just invent it out of thin
air but it's new territory which is
great interest to you and maybe no
interest to anybody else so it must have
some utility unlike say physics where if
you discover something new that is a
fact about the world so it is of
interest to other people and this last
point is just that however clever you
are however brilliant you are if you sit
in a windowless black box and generate
great ideas but don't tell anybody you
might as well not have done it right
you're just generating heat sort of
increasing entropy in the universe so it
it's a worth you need you actually need
to communicate because otherwise is here
you might well not to bother now so once
you've got this idea even then they need
to know sort of what it is
when you finish writing your but when
you begin writing your paper it may be a
bit hard to articulate exactly what your
key idea is but by the time you've
finished you should be in no doubt and
you should leave your readers in no
doubt as well I can't tell you how many
reviews that I've written a papers as a
reviewer I've written in the review I
believe that the key insight of this
paper is bla bla bla bla bla a reviewer
should never have to write that the
author should say the key insight of
this paper is bla bla bla bla so do sign
post very clearly when you when you have
you know when you get to your key idea
and if you have lots of ideas don't try
to slam them into a single paper so then
it becomes like you know like sort of
concentrated high vitamin diet all
squished together with a wither with a
clamp right then it's very indigestion
if you have lots of idea that's cool
right lots of papers alright so don't
don't don't don't try to overpack a
particular paper so and this is oh sorry
just you're just saying that this is
about signposting make sure that you
know and you'll readers know what the
idea is so this is the
good litmus test to apply to your paper
at a late-ish stage we compiled at every
stage but you don't be too hard on
yourself to begin with right
but also apply to papers that you read
when you read a paper think to yourself
what is the key idea in this paper what
do I take away a sort of reusable
insight most papers are jammed full of
detail and Greek symbols and technical
complexity and tables of measurement and
who knows what kind of carry-on right
but when you read the paper if it's a
really good paper you'll come away with
something that's a clever idea wish I'd
thought of that so you can apply that
discipline to yourself when you read
papers and then that will give you a
greater sense of what other readers
would like to find in your papers when
you like them does that make sense but
so if you read a paper and you think
I've got a clue what the key idea is
that's not your fault
that's the author sport okay though
knowing what key idea is very very
important is sort of dominate everything
else one other thing about the key idea
yes for combinations well then so then
maybe I do have to put more than one
thing in but then perhaps the key idea
is the combination that these two does
more than you would expect you know so
and that perhaps that's a bit surprising
somehow so you know a plus B isn't the
one plus one is more than two that's
kind of what you're suggesting here so
say that two don't just lay them out one
two three oh ho hum like they say oh one
two three amazing seven highlight it
yeah yeah
which is you know it it is new but it is
very very tiny kind of addition yes it
seems like too little oh very good
question you said we right into this
thing right so you have an idea but it
seems like a a very tiny idea you read
other people's papers they have good
ideas right oh they're full of inciting
you think wow how amazing what brain
they must have brains the size of small
asteroids I'm a mere pitiful worm and my
ideas are pitiful and insignificant and
nobody would possibly be interested in
them right everybody feels this even the
people whose papers you are reading and
it seems so impressive they felt like
that to begin with at least if they're
in the sort of the 90th percentile so
self-confident they don't have a moment
of this self-doubt but believe me they
are in the minority so the truth is that
what you must do is you must start to
write about any idea no matter how we D
and pitiful it may seem now sometimes it
will turn out that it is indeed we
didn't pitiful
in which case writing the paper won't
take very long and you haven't lost much
but my consistent experience which I'm
just feedback too for what it's worth is
that much much more often you take
something that seems to be fairly
straightforward and you start to work
out the details and think about
interactions with other things and it
turns out to be more complicated than
you thought it turns out to be worth 12
pages of two column format not two pages
of that maybe not a book berth and a
conference paper size idea so that
happened to me fairly recent you know
like only nine months ago I was writing
a paper with an intern it was kind of we
thought oh this will be the warm-up
project for this intern it pretty easy
we'll knock it off in a couple of weeks
you know eleven weeks later we were
still going and we did end up writing a
paper about it
initially I thought oh well you know we
better document this it's not very hard
but then it turned out there's no
complicating we thought ended up in the
one of the top programming languages
conferences so and it's oh this is still
happening to me right after I were going
to tell you how many years of doing
computer science you sort of start with
something weedy and you end up with
something interesting I can't give you
that confident you'll build that sense
of confidence after you've done it for a
while just let me encourage you to
believe for a moment that it is
worth writing even about insignificant
ideas sometimes it won't work sometimes
they'll turn out being significant and
then you just leave it as an unpublished
note on your home page right you don't
have to publish everything that's fine
right you just say here's here's
something a little something I did it's
not very big but it's but I did write
about it and here it is okay so so much
about the idea then I suggest repeating
so two things right early and identify
your key idea okay so the third thing I
wanted to talk about was to do what you
want what to do once you've starting to
write your paper so and let's see this
in on Thursday you can have a talk from
what's-his-name David David Newman if
you leave you talked about presentation
skills and he is going to tell you tell
stories now he's going to tell you about
telling stories about sort of and it
notes about people this is a different
kind of story that I'd like to tell
here's the story that I tried to tell in
my papers I like to say you know my
model is if I take a friend what's your
what's your name not good if I take
Marco and so about my ours which are not
very good and I say I've got five
minutes with you I want to sort of tell
you a bit about what I'm doing then what
am I going to do I'm going to walk up to
a white board and I'm going to a sort of
sketch a quick you know a couple of
examples of something and say look
here's an interesting problem and here's
the kind of web tackling it I'm not
going to give you theorems I'm not going
to write definitions and things I'm
going to do this kind of thing here's a
problem it's an interesting problem it's
an unsolved problem and here is some
intuition about my idea right so I'm
going to and if I do this to you in
person you can think about the kind of
storyline that you would do or those of
you are presenting posters you've been
thinking about how to do a kind of you
know a five minute capsule summary of
this your story about what you're up to
and you try to put that on your poster
and you'll and doubtless over lunch be
explaining it to people as you go I want
you to think about your paper in the
same way just a slightly greater length
so here is you know your story line you
what you want your reader to think is on
page one they think well I can see
that's a problem and oh I have the
vaguest idea about how they're solving
it but it certainly you know if they
could deliver on these claims that would
be
maybe I'll turn the page and read page
two and then you say oh it's a bit more
detail about the idea I kind of see how
that might work but there's a lot of
details I'm not sure that maybe a little
bit further - you still don't - you're
joining them in bit by bit rather than
hitting them with them with difficult
stuff right away and then of course the
my idea worked details and data stuff
that's the bulk of your paper to be sure
this is not you know word counts here
and then a bit about related work
without more to say about there so this
is my overall plan for a story for a
paper and here's how it kind of breaks
down in size for me size and leadership
so the title is read by a lot of people
the abstract by rather fewer the first
page by rather fewer and the rest of it
by virtually nobody know so and
proportionately so what does this tell
you this tells you should invest a lot
in your first page now a title title is
a bit tongue-in-cheek right so don't
over invest in making snazzy titles but
do try to make your titles informative
enough so that somebody flicking through
the proceedings is going to think it's
going to realise when it's about
something that they're interested in so
but the the introduct this first page
thing I think is really important I want
to say quite a bit more about what to
write on your first page because your
leadership drops off very sharply after
the first page I think a lot of people
take a look at the beginning of a paper
and then move on quickly so when someone
says a little bit about some of these
pieces but I think starting with the
introduction and so the introduction
here this pages can be very plain most
people what's going to be in the
introduction well it's going to say
something about what the problem is and
why it's important and something about
what the contributions of your paper are
so this fourth point is about
identifying your contributions so the on
your first page you have to say
something about the problem you're
trying to solve otherwise your
contributions to it wouldn't be at all
clear so you do have to set the scene
somehow but you do you want to fit all
of this on a on a page but you know
journal with tiny pages you can't hope
to do this on a page but it's sort of
the a4 size conference format you can
get a lot on the first page and it's
worth really trying to do that and I
want to say a bit about what I mean by
contributions because that's the sort of
key
part here so I'm here's an example of a
paper that I vote is my first couple of
paragraphs they're describing the
problem and I'm not describing the
problem in general terms I'm describing
a particular concrete instance of a
problem oh I beg your pardon so I have
I've misled myself I want to talk about
contributions but I want to say a little
bit about this describe the problem bit
because this is a place where people
often go wrong and this is the way in
which they go wrong they describe an
over-ambitious problem all right so
suppose you come across an ant and the
ant says to you here is you know my
life's work I'm going to climb Mount
Everest alright and so and you think ant
you are never going to climb Mount
Everest it may be a good goal many
people are working on it but there's no
point in really reading your paper about
climbing Mount Everest because most
you're going to get up is you know a
tiny boulder or two on the way so here's
an example of a you know the kind of
introduction you sometimes see in papers
the outlines some vast research area
that is occupied hundreds of researchers
for thousands of man years I would say
that's what this paper is about so when
you read this kind of stuff like the
many programs have bugs and it's
important to eliminate them and does
that make the blood pulsing your veins
do you think yes this is the paper that
I want to read in this proceedings it's
an it your knee isn't it your honor sir
okay yeah sure I know that like that
motherhood and apple pie nobody could
possibly disagree with this claim but if
you have a more focused claim like here
is a particular program that has an
interesting bug in it and you say I'm
going to show you how to detect not just
this bug but a whole class of similar
bugs and you can kind of perhaps
informally characterize what that class
is now you're you're encouraging your
reader to believe that you have an
achievable goal here one that you might
actually deliver in the skin the scale
of this paper does that make sense so
that's why I say mole hills not
mountains if you describe a mountain
people will yawn if you describe you
know a sugar cube they may yawn as what
you want to describe something in the
middle that seems achievable on page one
okay so don't
waste page one writing down motherhood
and apple pie statements that nobody
could disagree with their page one words
are your sort of golden words where you
have you know you have your big
readership don't waste those words okay
alright so then I wanted to go back let
me go back to contribution sense you've
described your idea and you've given
some idea that it might be achievable
and now you're going to say what this
paper delivers now most papers do
something like this a surprisingly large
minority fail to state their
contributions explicitly at all they
just say introduction they treat it as a
kind of general introduction to the area
and you're expected by the time you
finish reading the paper you might have
figured out what its contributions are
but know on page one you must I think
state the payload you take what is the
reader going to get if they read this
paper right so it's kind of like a
specification and the rest of the paper
is like the implementation so what
you're trying to do is to make the
reader think oh if you know the author
could deliver on her promises that she
makes on page one then this would be a
paper well worth reading and that at
least encourages you to to go on write
go on and reading so I always use
bullets for this so this is just my
style but I like this because it forces
me as an author to be completely
explicit about what my contributions are
so you know it's and blah blah blah
introduction state problems and then
finally I say and now we're going to get
to the contributions I may say
contributions and they say some sentence
like this from the basis and then I'll
list out you know plain one think of
them as claims first claim second claim
third claim just list them out you must
not leave your reader to guess what
these claims are going to be you must
make the claim okay and when you're
making claims try to make them refutable
claims in science it's not very
interesting to study hypotheses that
cannot be refuted or that are obviously
true so here's an example you know and
your contribution say we
going to describe a type system and
we're going to study its properties of
course you're going to study its
properties right what has the reader
learnt from those precious words on the
front page nothing this is not a claim
that could possibly be refuted well as
if you state you know I'm going to prove
that its sound and type checking is
decidable these are admitted by an
abandon are using some more technical
language but you know the people in that
area will know what you mean and they
said okay so he's going to prove some
refutable facts about the type system
that he's produced and I've got a couple
of other examples here just that the
kind of things that you often see on
page one and the kind of things I would
prefer to see so think of it like celery
rather than overcooked spaghetti celery
has crunch while you bite it in a glass
right right
so you want a crunchy first page not a
soggy first page all right yes desires
if you have just achieved well the fact
that even the very fact that you have it
you're saying if you've achieved
something that everybody wants what okay
so but but so you might say so this is
this is I have verified a C compiler
well that's a very that's a sort of
overarching kind of statement I mean it
does actually describe a road you know
ten or twelve year research project
conducted by dozens of people but
nevertheless so in a paper you might say
specifically we have you know a machine
supported proof of a compiler for you
know sub dialect of C that you know all
the way from the the ASCII source code
to the you know machine code you could
be a bit more specific about what it is
and you could say we have you know the
Machine supported proof goes from front
to back
so now you've articulated the claim in
rather more detail and almost certainly
there's there's sub detail in there that
you could articulate you know one but
you might say improving the you know the
chance for the the optimizer we had to
invent a completely new proof technique
that nobody we have never really seen
before it's described in section three
and it works roughly like this so you've
almost certainly got you know sub
achievements that you might
want to identify with in which you're
over so try to identify the the pieces
yeah so the fact that it's a goal that
everybody would like to achieve that's
good right that doesn't make it a non
refutable claim your claim is that you
you know you might not have done it
quite as thoroughly as or reproducibly
as you claim we do yeah yeah how many
bullets should you have so I varies a
lot so some of my papers I have you know
two or three some it's more like 708 I
would seldom have 10 or 12 that kind of
yeah yes yes yes so so there's a good
question so how can you have many
contributions but only one idea right so
I think often it's you like there's some
gray I think I think what you find is
that there's a there's typically there's
a sort of motivating force or factor and
the idea but to say this idea really
works often requires you know little
contributions of one kind or another I
don't think you'll find that's difficult
in practice but I do think that let's
see this is sometimes what you find at
the end of the section at the beginning
right at the end of the introduction you
have a paragraph that says the rest of
this paper is structured as follows do
you love reading those paragraphs when
you get to that point in the paper do
you think haha what do you do you skip
it where is this paragraph on page one
so you're inflicting this paragraph
which everybody is going to skip on your
maximal readership why are you doing
this this is a self-inflicted injury
that many papers make now of course it
seems sensible right to give your
readership a road map but actually there
are better ways to do it like I've shown
you some here so I make my list of
contributions have forward references
right sofa
we claim this is really what I want to
say each claim forward references the
evidence for that claim right so when I
here
I claim that touches that I say section
four that's what if you if you the
reader want to verify that I've
delivered on this promise go look at
section four
and now the list of contributions serves
and you can see another example here
not necessarily in order section four
five and six and seven and so you know
it's not the sections that necessarily
appear in order but there's some kind of
narrative story for these contributions
that inter alia you know among other
things gives you a roadmap for the paper
pass that make sense that it's a great
way of subliminally giving this
structure without actually doing this
kind of nonsense which is a total waste
of space this is a fully explicit about
that yes but is it ever useful to you as
a reader honestly well you can write it
then there's commented out later or
sometimes on long journal papers I mean
I sometimes do find long journal papers
sometimes come with a pictorial vote map
they say section three you know there's
an arrow to section seven you know you
must read section three before section
seven there's sort of complex
interdependencies among a larger piece
of work or perhaps a thesis right you
might have some interesting
interdependencies so then and that
really is looks like a map right with
spatially laid out that can be quite
useful but in a smaller smaller compass
i don't think that's so so important
that's my opinion so mate there's there
probably occasions when this you should
ignore this rule but i encourage but
because it's so much the norm to do this
I'm encouraging you to question that
norm seriously I only do it if it's
really paying its way yes
what haha to helps you to helps you to
find a bit that you need yeah so I think
so too my my claim is that you can more
or less do that purpose with your
contributions bullets right and moreover
because they because this section always
seemed feels like a bit of an overhead
it's usually too short to do you know
each section is described very briefly
it's it's hard to know if that's a
section was in a list of contributions
here you could you've got a few more
words so it's easy so I think that's a
that's the place to do for my money ok
so the question was the key insights so
I would say I would say try to figure
out what you think the contributions are
right and write down those don't just
plot them out with more to make it make
you look good just figure out what you
think your contributions are agree write
the narrative and hang the contents on
that if you can so so for example if I
have a related work section I don't put
that in the list you know one of my
contributions is that I have the lazy
work no I don't do that I tend to just I
do add a little notes often after the
contributions bit to say very briefly
you know one line I say we discuss
related work
innate kind of is not contribution but I
just mentioned it shows to so the
readers going to know we're going to
find that that kind of thing so try to I
think don't think of it it primarily as
a content list think of it primarily as
a list of contributions and hang however
many forward references you can offer
that that's all I can say another good
thing about the doing this is that if
you find a section that is not
referenced at all you might question
whether it belongs there at all often it
does you need some background work or
some mathematical notation or something
but not always sometimes it can be like
dead code elimination right as a whole
section you wrote that turns out not to
be delivering the payload of the paper
fine take it out put in another paper
when it is contributing yeah quite a bit
too yeah it's easy to sort of scan
through and see the large bold letters
yeah paper without me to read them and
so even if you don't list all of your
sections maybe other contributions
points you know having a big related
work title at the end is pretty explicit
right so you're saying that the titles
themselves form a roadmap that's pretty
easy to find flicking through yes I
actually thought it's always easier to
find than this very dense little
paragraph like this yeah okay yeah by
the way here at the back what they did
as I said who is an interesting problem
all of the existing solutions suffer
from the following things one two three
and then they said our system whatever
is much better and it has the following
properties one two three four word
references to the thing and that was the
first page essentially but the really
nice thing about it was it it was in
itself a summary of the entire paper it
was kind of the related work although it
was only three sentences and it was kind
of all of the contributions although it
was only three sentences and from just
reading that front page you've got the
entire paper crammed in more or less you
know in a very neat way having seen that
I mean it only really applies to places
where you have this
kind of big body of background work that
is all all contributing to the same sort
of problem but it it's similar to this
but it was the nicest format that I've
seen in any paper I've read and when I
read it I went oh great I get I get
exactly what you guys have done and the
rest of the PI paper sort of followed
directly from that so I just thought I'd
add that as a nice about doing things
thank you and do do do you think about
what you want to do is if have a first
page which somebody gets something from
all by itself
it's not just some flannel which they
have to wade through to get to your
paper what you'd like is for your reader
to even if they stop at the end of page
one you'd like them to take something
away with them that's a good metric to
apply to papers wherever somebody leaves
the train do they take something useful
away with them or do they only get to
them the juice the payload you know if
they wade through mountains of that
swamp
oceans of swamp okay I want to mention
one other thing that papers often do
write not not just this that's even
worse related work so it seems that good
scholarship right you you're about to
undertake some some you've identified a
problem and the first thing you should
do is to say we stand on the shoulders
of giants and you should describe in in
detail all the work that has gone before
it's a disaster when you have somebody
in front of a whiteboard and you you say
you know you're my friend I want to tell
you know I've got Marco in front of my
whiteboard right do I begin by giving
him a five-minute lecture on related
work before I get to the stuff of course
not
so it's damaging in all sorts of ways
one thing is that you don't have enough
intellectual scaffolding to understand
it yet because they haven't read the
paper right so experts may understand
this kind of gibberish that you often
find in related work sections but the
bulk of your readership will not and the
paper isn't you know you want to address
more than just the the core experts in
your paper you'd like to convey this
idea to people although not already
experts in this particular field the
other thing is that because it feels as
if it's getting in the way of getting to
the payload related work sections often
start you know two and a half pages
and then a process of squishing takes
place which every alternate word is
omitted and sentences are crafted to be
shorter and more cryptic until you have
this sort of dense incomprehensible
gibberish that nobody can understand
even the experts so the bad thing is
that what it doesn't do your readers any
good right it makes them feel stupid
because they read this stuff and they
think this is only page two I'm supposed
to be understanding this and I have no
clue what is going on right and also if
they do take the trouble to try to
figure it out
they feel tired so they're exhausted
before they get to the main idea so in
effect what you've done is you place a
sort of concrete wall between your
reader and the main payload of your
paper which is your idea so what to do
because after all what we cannot do is
to pretend that there is no related work
no no so what you want to do is to just
put it at the end right so by the time
you get to the end you have a lot more
intellectual scaffolding you've
introduced examples you've introduced
intuitions you've described something
about your work you have much much more
background to work with when you're
describing moreover in introducing
related work there you can compare it
with your own whether at the beginning
you can't because you haven't introduced
your own yet and I have read related
work sections at the beginning that
attempt to do a comparison with the not
yet presented idea of though it's just a
disaster so now this is not to say that
the two things this is not saying the
first is it's not saying do not have any
references to anybody else until you get
to the end as you present stuff you
should make references to other people's
work you know we you know so you could
say you know in developing this idea we
followed the ideas of you know of green
and white black at sea section eight in
doing this so what you give the expert
reader says huh I knew that you know the
green and white had this had this are
something an idea like this but I see
he's going to address that little later
that's fine right so you've given a
forward reference that reassures the
expert reader that they will be covered
without distracting then
expert leader who thinks that's fine I
don't care about green and white I just
care about the payload okay
the other thing that it's not saying is
that sometimes in order to get to your
idea you need to present some background
material I like to sort of lead them up
to it like so when I'm with Marko on my
white board in order to get Marko to the
to the point at which is able to
contemplate the full glory of my idea I
have to help them a little bit by giving
a sort of tutorial to you know in the
background that gets up to the point but
the goal there is I'm giving the
tutorial to Marko it's not to enumerate
all the related work now in giving a
tutorial of course you should mention
Innes you know in site site all the
people whose work you are in effect
describing and again your forward
references to section eight work will be
discussed in more detail or compared but
your goal is the tutorial with side
references to a later book does that
make sense and this is flatly
contradictory to at least some common
practice and even to some explicit
guidance from some of your advisors and
supervisors I suspect right so you may
have to fight on this one and in the end
you will have to do what your advisor
says but you can fight hard right right
hard yeah Oh what is the reason that
this is common practice I think there
are I mean the reason is I suppose just
that it seems that good scholarship
doesn't it first you describe neither
the status quo and then you describe you
ain't comment on it it's just and you
are going to by the time you finish the
paper you are going to have done that so
this is purely a presentational thing so
I think the the the fact that it's
common practice presentational e I don't
think really does have a good
justification no in my humble and
entirely unbiased opinion yeah yeah I
think that's fine but the purpose of
background is not to enumerate
everything that's gone before the
purpose of background is to set that we
do up so that they can appreciate your
idea end of story that's the purpose of
background okay that's all you've got to
remember
because you're trying to lead them to
that point by the shortest possible path
somebody else sir yeah disconnect
between writing papers our guests for
people to read their own writing papers
that reviewers will like because they
could see whether the reason through it
first is no this really is novel don't
spend the rest of the paper so to
thinking there's nothing to it when
tagging it to the end of the paper you
discovered of a bitter taste in your
mouth no I think you couldn't so I think
you can make claims to novelty right
there in the contributions right and in
your background section you can make
claims to you know here's you know some
unsolved problems so you make those
claims with forward references again you
know to avoid distraction but make the
claim so I don't that you need to
amplify that claim to novelty too early
just make it yeah introductions I would
never put Malaysia work in the
introduction whoa so that would be kind
of like remember the introduction is my
precious single page I don't wanna use
my single page on this right it's it's
it's the good scholarship bit that isn't
key to understanding the idea but is key
to understanding how it fits in the
content the landscape of computer
science all right
reasonable people can differ about this
but I feel it quite strongly so I'll
just presented to you and you can make
of it what you were and I'm in this
whole talk I am erring on the side of
being more opinionated to then know you
know just to make it more fun but but
this one I do actually believe here is
one other thing about related work in a
related work section some people think
that their goal is to make other
people's work look bad right so they can
make their work look good right you know
green and white did this work it was
completely useless right aware so much
better are faster were smaller better in
every respect they were idiots really
right
but the truth is that it's not only is
that not good scholarship because it's
almost certainly false right but also
it's like um it's like that the credit
is not it's not like money so so so it's
alright so if I um if I have 100 pounds
and I give you 50 pounds how much do I
have left 50 right so so I'm poorer and
Sarah is richer but if I have some love
and I give you some love
do I have less love no not infinitely
divisible resource in fact it grows the
more you give it away is now wonderful
come it's like what's not to like
so credit is like that too right so so
giving credit to other people just to
diminish the credit that your paper will
get you'll be judged on your new
contributions saying nice things about
other people does not mean that your
contributions will be just less good go
actually the to the country right so
don't be sick of Fanta Q no don't sort
of but do do you know take a moment to
say not just antiseptic pros say you
know in Sara's inspiring paper of you
know 2006 she says this and you know I
would like our work relation in that way
and just by adding a couple of
adjectives for things that have
genuinely illuminated or inspired you
know given you insights you you make the
world a better place and you give other
people a signpost to say actually that
paper of service is really worth a read
right which also makes the world a
better place with n people Tina's like
recommending systems they tend to bubble
up the the rankings so don't do not
stint in your praise about other people
because actually we do stand on the
shoulders of giants it's actually true
the other thing is it can be the
scientists because it has this
multi-dimensional subject it's very
seldom you do a piece of work that is
better than the competition in all
dimensions you know you may be faster
and smaller but you're less secure you
know you're better on X or Y and Zed but
not on P and Q right if you only mention
X &amp;amp; Y and Zed and you simply fail to
mention P and Q what are you inviting
your readers to do your reviewers to do
you are inviting your reviewers to say
what about
P and Q that White's work is actually
rather better in that sphere you know
for if the transactions are small you
know everything's going to go to Europe
you're fine for big transactions but
when you're lots of lots of small
read-only transactions your system is
going to be absolutely terrible right
now you don't mention that that's a very
bad thing to allow a reviewer to say if
you say it it's quite disarming to a
viewer they cannot complain that as a
criticism they may say overall the
contribution is not big enough what they
can't say is they didn't appear to be
aware of this problem right so if
knowledge your weaknesses and the
related work section is a good place to
do that because it's part of saying
actually you know who 98 is really
rather good in this dimension you should
go read it okay this is an easy lesson
to deal with because it's you know it's
all it's all joy right how we doing we
have ten minutes and two points oh yes
so you want to say something yes before
you go on yeah yeah this
multi-dimensional thing I've found in a
couple of the papers I've read and
written having a table that has all of
the related work and all of the
dimensions and how and and that just
puts in the beginning of related work
section it gives you this really fast
reference where you go oh okay they're
good on these dimensions and not so good
on these dimensions and they are aware
of all of the other people and how they
fit into that space and it's really
compact and really easy to read table
with sort of rows and columns is very
cool if you could if your subject is
well enough sliced and diced to do that
it isn't always something to avoid
though is I've often we've related work
sections it simply has one sentence for
other citations it just simply says you
know foo and white did X I mean you know
brown and green did Y anything oh so I
would know no is there's no evaluative
or value judgment stuff for comparison
stuff done at all that's a real shame so
simply listing related work is not very
cool but that's that's quite separate to
your point which is if you can do a
table that's brilliant
yeah and sometimes very powerful yes
which witnesses in your in your approach
and I felt from some senior researchers
that it actually can be the reason for
rejection of your paper if you really
honestly honestly acknowledge on ah so
so the question is if you acknowledge
the weaknesses might and that lead to
your paper being rejected
oh no so if it's well reviewed then the
reviewers should spot those weaknesses
and it's worse if they identify them
than if you do so in your best case then
you would have poor reviewers who don't
spot the weaknesses in your paper would
slide into being published anyway and
that may be good for you personally but
it's not good for the field so I'm not
conscious of papers being rejected
because they acknowledge their
weaknesses sometimes it may be because
having now having a clear understanding
of what the contributions are and what
they're not to say the contributions
developing on your net contribution is
not big enough to justify publication in
this journal in this conference that can
happen undoubtedly so I think that's
life no go for getting up to go for a
less glamorous venue yeah yes yes it's
like this can happen so often with
related work you also say and here are
some things that I'm planning on doing
sir so we're actually not very good on
small transactions but we have six good
ideas for how to do it and we're working
away hard on it that's that's what
that's a often a good positive spin to
busy but it's probably even true
additional merit of papers I think you
can be massively enthusiastic about the
thing that you have spent your last you
know six months or maybe three years of
your life working on while being
realistic about the fact that it's not
going to cure world hunger you know I
don't think these are incompatible
you can be enthusiast about things that
are not yet perfect that's fine that
that's called being human oh yeah yes a
lot of scientific writing steer you away
from from writing just in a descriptive
way you know he gets this and I've been
inspired by so and so it's not
considered and makes this letter look
like you're sucking up to someone you
know saying that you know I'm inspired
oh you mean they could be very wealthy
or viewers or you wouldn't know so so it
indeed often the assumption is that
scientific writing should be somehow
very what's the word passive and
unemotional indeed people often
sometimes say you should write in the
passive voice an experiment was
performed rather than I performed this
experiment I always write in the first
person this experiment was performed it
just makes you want to lose the will to
live so but as far as this this kind of
stuff is I would err on the side I mean
obviously you don't just want to suck up
to people right but so you'd have to say
I did find it inspiring it's true right
if you're just saying it to be nice to
the review don't do that right so just
say it how it is in your heart I think
if it's if you're speak with your own
voice and you're speaking the truth in
love then you'll get a long way so just
realize it's only five minutes I know I
know serve over quickly fast forward
right two more points which are we will
we will finish by noon absolutely
without without that no no we will not
no very bad practice as I'm about to
tell you in Thursday's talk putting them
leaders first what does this mean so
here is what many people do when they
present that when they finally get to
the payload of their paper they start
with something like this you know that
they draw a deep breath and say consider
a bifurcated semi-lattice and such a
thing doesn't exist because what they've
done is they've done a lot of work that
work through examples and so forth and
then they pull some general idea and
they present the general idea first this
is that right this feels like good
scholarship again but it's very poor
presentation right so you've got to just
remember that when you're talking about
your readers you want
convey the intuition first when I was
within Marco with my white board I did
not write up this right I said here's an
example right I said and I I sort of
tried to convey tin the intuition so
again the initial stages of your paper
should be to convey the intuition
leaving the formality in the details and
all the Greek symbols for a little bit
later in the paper so I would always
start with examples and move on to
generality and almost never start with
generality and then illustrate with
examples that's my suggestion to you on
it yeah and here's an example of me
doing just that in a paper that I wrote
a little while ago so this is part of
the background section I'm trying to set
the scene this isn't my idea yet I'm
setting the scene but I set the scene by
starting with an example program right
away the other thing about putting your
readers first is that when you are
writing a paper about that the result of
quite a lot of work you have been
through many blind alleys right so your
temptation is to carry your readers down
the blind alleys because they are
drenched in your blood right you spent
hours down that blind alley so you take
your reader down and I I've just done
that very often but I have read papers
which I have struggled through two pages
of technical material and overview of
light so if you'll have to read it and
at the end of the two pages of technical
material I get to the point of which he
says this turned out to be not a good
idea in the next section we present a
much but I think give me a break right
you sort of tortured me for two pages
and now you tell me it was all for
nothing
you're wrong as an author is to point
out the effort to say there is a very
big painful place don't go there right
and lead me swiftly past the only
exception to this is when there is a
place that is so obvious about you in a
maze and you're leading the the reader
through the maze and there's a big door
that says exit right and you lead them
straight past and I think that's bad for
your readers to you have to say look
this door here marked exit is just does
it turns out not to work well so you may
have to make a brief digression but only
for things that are so obvious that
they'll be distracting if you don't
though it is very concentrate on your
readers all or always and
to the to the end last thing in the last
120 seconds listen to your readers by
which I mean get people to read your
paper and get feedback from them so
particularly your friends right so your
friends are like guinea pigs so what you
watch your name right most so it
supposing most is a good friend of mine
then he's I'm going to inoculate him
with the drug that is my paper and I'm
gonna listen for what kind of squeaking
noises he makes and how quickly he dies
right
but you have to tell your friends what
you're going to do like you don't want
if you left to themselves they will tell
you about spelling mistakes and grammar
this is not what you want to know what
you want to know is I got lost on page
three right
they will not tell you this unless they
are told very explicitly that's what you
want because they will get two page view
they will get lost nothing I'm just too
stupid you know sounds very clever
fellow most things so you know this
paper obviously wasn't for me well done
Simon great paper you know you miss
spelt this thing on page two it's very
important to tell your friends what you
want to know is where you got lost and
then you then you eyeball them you like
you use most comes to my office or I go
to Moses office more likely and I said
where did you get lost on page three and
he says what got lost and then I say oh
but it's like this and then mo says ah
now I understand and then I just have to
remember what I said we put that in the
paper right so it's a feedback loop that
you must do repeatedly you can read this
slide about getting expert help but um
like suppose you want to say one thing
about reading reviews so when you get
reviews back for your rejected paper you
will think those bastards they have no
clue those referees they have no idea
about this subject they're ignorant and
and so you'll you'll bleed right you
should set them aside a week later you
come back and you have to try to read
the review in such a way you want to say
how could I rephrase this paper so that
not even the stupidest reviewer could
make that mistake that's your goal is to
be so clear that even stupid people
could not make that mistake and the
other half of it is to remember that the
reviewer has done something really
amazing but they have given for you
something that is not like love a
completely non-functional commodity
their own personal
time they have spent an hour that they
will never ever get back in your service
don't think that's quite amazing a
stranger who you may never meet or
certainly you know you may never know
who they are
they have given you an hour that they
will never recover
and they've devoted it purely to you
don't think about that when you read the
review think about it in that way and
you know if you ever meet our viewer
regardless of what they said thank them
if you do get to meet them say you know
how could you know could you help me
write this bet bet better you know you
get the idea
you've gotta it's really hard to do it's
very very hard to do because they really
have gotten the wrong end of the stick
but nevertheless you must do this it's
the key to getting constructive
information from your reviews and then
we are seven things that's all you got
to do and then your pick so the good
news is that I think if you do just
these seven things you'll make a marked
improvement if your paper that will
you'll put them above the herd rather
than below the herd and that's always
good right because then you get
published as well but most of these
things are things that are good for the
world too but they communicate more
clearly and more accurately and spread
love so there you are
so willya simon again on Thursday
afternoon when you talk about research
talks it's probably time for a couple of
quick questions otherwise I'm sure
there'd be opportunity in the course of
the week to ask her Simon when he
hopefully attends some of our lunch
sessions for lunch today
okay any sort of quick questions
in microphone yeah there are some papers
who have discussion section
do you like discussion section
discussion section what's it discussing
you mean discussing related work or just
call it discussion and they they usually
say the weaknesses of their systems and
it's kind of discussion together session
might be sort of okay so now we've seen
the idea let's stand back a bit and see
compare with alternative approaches and
how am I fit into so it's a bit like
related work that's a bit more broadly
so that can be good right so because
that at that stage you're thinking well
okay so presented you one specific right
so now you've got a bit more
intellectual scaffolding but there are
many variations of this that we might
have chosen but didn't so often it fits
in with the related work section so yes
if it makes sense to do it yeah you know
if you'd like to read it if you were
read over the paper then go for it yeah
yes DeVos most-most yes oh yes right in
the first person is do you take aisle we
I usually say we and it's easy because I
almost invariably co-author papers even
with a single author paper I think we is
a bit less sort of drawing attention to
myself even though it's sort of
techniques like the voice the Royal we
the Queen does it and single authored
paper sometimes do it but also sometimes
you mean what you mean meat mean we
meaning myself and you the reader you
know we are now going to look at
together you know we're standing
alongside the reader
that's a good thing to convey again yeah
knowing that it will be rejected just to
get reviews to improve it should you
ever submit a paper that you know will
be rejected just to get reviews well I
think so reviewing is an expensive
process right - which as I've been
referring the reviewers are devoting
their you know most precious commodity
so I would be very cautious about
submitting papers that you know have
deficiencies that you could fix and want
to fix if you had a bit more time so I
think that's kind of gaming the system
I'd encourage you not to do that wait
until you've got a paper that you're
actually proud of it'll be perfect you
know because there's all you can always
make it better so it's a bit of a
continuum here but don't do something
that you know has major deficiencies
that's a bit naughty because you know
you're polar viewers what do you want
them to do you're burning up their
cycles nobody will nobody will ever call
you on it but you shouldn't do it having
ok time to close the session nothing
