months ago and the most feared science
professor told me he wanted to move the
faster growing data from a package of
sulfur to the cloud but his students his
graduate students did not have the skill
to do that about the same time a
computer science professor told me he
wanted to offer a pic data course while
the computer science department had no
big for the students to work on so C at
one side the big data from local PD
scale at the other side with lot of
computing skill but no beta and
sometimes we find it difficult that they
can talk to each other so we have a
train that some day students of all
scientific disciplines may have the
skills in computing as good as in
mathematics or in language now someday
the students of computer science
departments men have the knowledge and
easy access to the data of all
disciplines in size computing in science
is the theme of this summit we have to
pay no discussions in the morning the
topic is how to faster interdisciplinary
talents is more on education and in the
afternoon will be on interdisciplinary
research so now let me introduce the
first panelist professor pom-pom is an
ecologist he is the director of the
Center for Earth System science Ching
hai University and a professor at the
department of environmental science at
UC Berkeley he will remark on how does
computer change all disciplines in
science
let's welcome professor Paul
well good morning everyone it's honored
to be here to comment about the
interdisciplinary science and
collaboration using computer science I'd
like to start with just a couple
introduction remarks about our
organization my research unit it's a
newly founded research units on the chin
wah campus specializing on global
changes that is basically global
environmental change so in order to do
that we house just like what the earlier
presentation are promoting we house
interdisciplinary group of faculty
members in the same Center we have
people who work on climate change work
on Earth Observation who work on
economics who work on geography global
ecology and computer science so we do
have in in our 27 faculty members we
have five faculty members who has PhDs
from computer science and they are
recruited faculty are all recruited from
all over the world so that's basically
how interdisciplinary we are and I
really advocate that you know yada to
promote this even at Berkeley we dreamed
to be able to for environmental
scientist to work with computer
scientists for example it's actually
very hard we are separated from
different end of the campus and here we
are all on the same floor of the
building this has brought us
amanda's advantages for people to
exchange ideas and to quickly act on
problems that we are facing to solve so
I like to take this basic to expand a
little bit about computational thinking
to took to say that in under our roof we
talk about spatial and temporal things
we're facing with a problem that are so
complicated we are asking questions
basically that will help us to map into
the future so mapping has been talked
about and you see maps that are static
on the screen and we are indeed facing
with problems just like tim has been
raising that people climate modelers
have produced such a huge amount of data
but how are we going to automatically
analyze them you know to make efficient
use of the data so we we have exactly
those kind of problems but to frame
these questions I think it will be
helpful for this audience to think about
to kind of big questions we have in our
field so we try to ask questions related
to what would the future climate be in
the next few weeks in the next few
decades in the next century we also want
to ask questions which is even bigger
such as what we sustain on earth do we
need to migrate to Mars or other planets
so those are the kind of questions that
are related to my colleagues so in order
to do that two approaches we we try to
take it's obviously simulation simulate
some of the pro pass and also to be able
to predict
and project into the future so
simulation prediction projection none of
them can go without the engagement of
computer science so we are all familiar
with this kind of general paradigm of
from data we need to observe collect to
computing and then to new data or
information or knowledge so this is
basically general Surrey stage in
scientific research I don't have to
exemplify or generalize or gave you
specific examples you know pretty
speakers have already made so many
examples so but to just in size in this
you can imagine so kind of data we are
going to use in our Earth's related
scientific questions are not only
natural physical world quite the data
you know the climate the vegetation the
soil the kind of water we face but also
the population population grows economic
development you know there are
globalization and human behavior so all
of those data need to be collected as
assembled in a certain way and pass that
into computing to give us new data new
information new knowledge eventually to
support us to do decision so that's
basically in in our field we computer
sighs computer technology computing
computational thinking plays a critical
role in our research so in a sense in
today we are really lucky we have
so many sensors including our mobile
phones we could click the images we
could get so many data so much of that
for now but if we we go back for 50
years if we go back to 100 years if we
go back for 1,000 years or human earlier
we don't have so much data so we really
need to work in in a way like what
Jeanette had been arguing you know yes
if we have representative data we have
representative feel polling we have
represented sampling that's great if we
don't we have to live with now
representative data in precise and
certain sources of information so how
would we make you I think this is
challenge for future computing
computational science how would we make
use of thoughts in precise and certain
basically you are leaving in void you
don't have sufficient amount of data and
try to come up with the solid science
accurate to knowledge so that's one big
challenge I think for us that requires
interdisciplinary efforts to do that so
take climate change as an example in our
field you see some of the curves already
by people predicting the trend of a
climate say take temperature as one
variable when you project it into the
future there's a big envelope that means
you don't have certain trend for the
future when you try to recast that from
the past you have a big
love because you don't have data so the
old envelope narrows only when the you
know the time is at relatively recent
you know or up to date so this this is
because we don't have data for we have
any experience for the future we don't
have enough data for the past so how do
we shrink its own load it's basically
the kind of question I'd like to pose to
our colleagues today and the reason for
that and why we need interdisciplinary
effort is climate change right now the
global warming there are argument and
there's even people arguing that for the
past 15 years that we don't observe a
global warming actually we have cooling
for those of you who are not in this
field I have to argue that there's a
genuine long trend is that we are going
to experience a warming so there are
natural rhythms that are slowing down
this whole process or making it look
appears like there's no warming for the
past period of time maybe that this
trend will continue for another 10 to 15
years but eventually the whole general
trend is increasing why are we facing
with that problem there are like what I
said there there is a natural rhythm of
climate system so there are natural
factors related to the sound related to
the Earth's self rotation and there's
also another component which is human to
big factors that we have there's a
continuous trend of our power fuel use
nah bow feel I'm sorry at fossil fuel
use you know what we call the carbon
emissions into the atmosphere there's
another factor which is basically our
gigantic change of the Earth's surface
we call and use the change of landing
both of them contribute in various ways
very complicated ways to the computer
system a system and we need the computer
size to help us to better predict the
climate system use this as Y example in
their systems which requires good
prediction or projection of the human
activities in order to help us to reduce
the uncertainty or error and look on in
the past and also in the future so
that's basically my point I'd like to
make thank you okay Thank You professor
cone and our next step panelist
professor David Rosen blonde is a
professor of computer science and dean
of the school of computing at the
National University of Singapore where
he also directs the felicitous computing
Institute's as a computer scientist he
will remarked on how is computer science
changed by other disciplines let's
welcome professor Rosen block
okay good morning everyone and thank you
Tim for that introduction I'll try to
keep my remarks brief so that we can get
to the panel discussion here and so as
Tim mentioned I was asked to comment on
this question how is computer science
changed by other disciplines okay and I
guess to be honest and it's probably not
too much of a surprise as a computer
scientist my first reaction was to say
well doesn't that influence go the other
way around isn't it really computer
science that's really changing the world
it's almost a clichÃ© now to to make
that observation and to talk about how
much computer science is changing so
many other disciplines and you don't
really have to look very far you can
just look at some of the names of some
of these areas of specialization that
are emerging in other disciplines we
talk about various kinds of
computational sub-disciplines
computational finance computational
biology computational social science and
other things like digital humanities and
robotic surgery business analytics cyber
security so it's it's certainly the case
and I don't think anybody would argue
that computer science is having this
kind of influence on other disciplines
but is that influence also being felt in
the other direction and I would argue
that I would argue that it is but
perhaps the explanation or the effects
are a little bit more subtle and
indirect so a lot of things that are
happening in computer science are
happening because of interesting
problems that are arising in other
disciplines and these other problems are
giving inspiration to computer
scientists and creating opportunities
for new lines of research and these new
lines of research probably wouldn't even
arise if it hadn't been for these
problems in the first place now earlier
on Ginette had mentioned some of the
successes that have been enjoyed with
the z3 smt solver and z3 arguably was
developed to solve a purely computer
science problem and now it's enjoying
widespread application and many other
different disciplines in that
application in these other disciplines
as she mentioned probably hadn't even
been anticipated at the time
III was developed but I would argue that
there are probably other lines of
research that we could identify in
computer science that arose purely
because of problems that came about in
in some other discipline and to give
just one example I have an example up
here on the slide of an area where I do
some of my own research in mobile
computing so if you look at the history
of telecommunications for example
telecommunications certainly predates
the era of computer science it's had a
long and honorable more than a century
history of many important advances for
for human society and that history
evolved to a point where it was possible
at some point for people to start
walking around with mobile handsets that
would allow them to make telephone calls
anywhere in the world at any place that
they happen to be out and about and it
was just really a matter of time before
those mobile telephones evolved to such
an extent that it was desirable to have
computational capabilities on those
devices and once we started thinking
about putting computational capabilities
on these devices and turning them into
true smartphones well this gave rise to
new computer science problems that
people hadn't really I did I would argue
that people hadn't really been thinking
about very much before gave rise to the
development for example of power aware
communication protocols new kinds of
algorithms that would function
efficiently in the kind of peculiar
resource constrained environments that
exist on smartphones new power
performance profiling techniques for
software applications that are meant to
run on mobile devices and new
architectural approaches to allocating
functionality between client devices and
powerful servers that might exist in the
cloud leading to mobile services that
are deployed in clouds so I you know I
personally believe that the influences
do go both ways and that a lot of these
influences kind of parallel many of the
many of the influences that may have
been observed over the history of
mathematics where new problems arise in
other fields there's a need to provide
new and more rigorous ways of explain
phenomena in these other fields and that
leads to the development of new branches
of mathematics or new mathematical
techniques to deal with these other
problems in these in these other fields
so the V you know the this direction of
influence certainly I would say is
bi-directional and irrespective of which
way the influence goes the opportunities
for interdisciplinary research for other
disciplines to have impact on computer
science and vice versa these
opportunities are increasing by the day
and so for me in particular as Tim
mentioned I'm the Dean of the School of
Computing at national university of
singapore so for me in particular an
interesting question is to try to
identify what the challenges are that
hinder some of these opportunities from
coming about and finding ways of
addressing these challenges and removing
the barrier so that these kinds of
fruitful interdisciplinary interactions
can take place and these these
challenges are there are many of these
kinds of challenges many of these
challenges are institutional in nature
it was very refreshing to hear president
Jeong mentioning a while ago about how
the there's a very strong institutional
mission to promote interdisciplinary
interdisciplinarity at Yonsei University
that's not that kind of enlightenment is
not something that you find at every
institution and the kinds of
institutional and cultural barriers that
that exist that prevented
interdisciplinary work are many and they
manifest themselves and in a variety of
ways and to give you just one example
suppose a computer science professor is
collaborating with somebody in a medical
faculty and they collaborate on a
project and they produce a publication
that's published in a top-ranked medical
journal well as that computer science
professor going to be suitably rewarded
for that publication even though it was
outside his or her particular area
traditional area of discipline or are
they going is that publication going to
be ignored or even worse are they going
to be penalized for having quote wasted
their time publishing that paper outside
they're their area of expertise well in
an enlightened institution that computer
scientists would be rewarded for having
that kind of interdisciplinary impact
other kinds of challenges that arise or
perhaps a bit more pragmatic in nature
and nowadays it's we're seeing
increasing numbers of PhD graduates who
have very strong interdisciplinary
training not just in computer science
but in some related field where they do
there where they do their thesis
research and these people are very much
a hot commodity everybody wants to hire
them so it's very challenging to be able
to just build up ranks of faculty with
people that are qualified or have the
capability or the inclination to to do
an interdisciplinary work so the final
challenge that's mentioned up here is
one that you hear computer scientists
complain about a lot this is the worry
or the claim that computer science
oftentimes just operates as a service
discipline for these for these other
more glamorous disciplines that we're
doing the programming for the scientists
or the ecologists or the social
scientists or whoever it might be and I
think this is a personal I things is a
pretty narrow-minded view certainly
there going to be some interdisciplinary
collaborations that have that kind of
flavor to them worthy where the computer
scientist is just providing the basic
capability and the real research
breakthroughs are coming in the other
discipline but in in my own experience
and certainly an experience that I've
observed in a lot of other people that I
know you can always learn something from
an interdisciplinary collaboration you
can learn a lot of interesting things
about other disciplines but it can also
give you very new and fresh perspectives
on the work that you do in your own
discipline if you're a computer
scientist and that experience and
understanding will will change the way
and eventually bring fruitful fruitful
research research outcomes research
results research breakthroughs in
computer science and so I think people
that say this kind of thing that they
worry about computer science being a
service discipline to other
or people that probably aren't so
inclined to begin with to to look for
opportunities to do interdisciplinary
work and instead of just trying to find
excuses so nevertheless there are
challenges that have to be addressed in
trying to foster any kind of
interdisciplinary work and I've focused
here on research primarily but the
challenges arise also in education so I
think at this point I'll stop and and
say thank you Thank You professor
Rosenblum and now i want to invite dr.
wing and present john come back to stage
okay in order to leave more time for the
professor's to ask questions that give
comments and have some interactions with
a panelist I will simply ask a couple of
very simple questions and then we'll
open the mic to all the audience okay
the first question I'm really curious is
that we all agree that
interdisciplinarity is very important
okay any universities okay but probably
is also typical so I can see some shall
I call that a quick fix that is in in
some top universities there are
interdisciplinary schools or
interdisciplinary programs for example
like your Institute which is a
interdisciplinary Institute but it seems
to me that sometimes I see those fool
want to have this kind of process
putting programs or schools to be a seed
so that in the future there will be more
interdisciplinary collaboration
happening to the whole university but
what we observe is that those
interdisciplinary schools or Institute's
becomes itself and isolated is the
institution that means they are isolated
although they drew professors from
different schools and students but later
it becomes isolated
Castle again what do you think it is
this is a right approach to to form this
kind of interdisciplinary programs our
schools is this right approach I I think
naturally and let me try to generalize
over campuses universities and colleges
but it's very hard to generalize but i
will try anyway you're going to have
strong disciplines departments
representing each of the disciplines and
it's very natural to create centers and
institutes and so on that overlay across
the different disciplines and and I
think that's its natural and we should
embrace it and then we should just let
upper management you know figure out how
to ensure that a faculty member who's
part of a disciplinary faculty and an
interdisciplinary institute really does
service to both entities now I spoke as
if a single faculty member could belong
to two different entities again
different campuses treat approach that
in different ways but that would be wine
model to to foster where you do have a
faculty member in a particular
discipline or a unit participating in an
interdisciplinary Institute Johnson
universe has some experience of
operating interdisciplinary education
for instance greatest club information
was founded in two thousand and that the
greatest goal we host Business Economics
industrial engineering computer science
a tool so to take this initiative I
think the most difficult thing is to
find out faculty members who has
open-minded who has commitment who has
take a big challenge to overcome all the
barriers I think that is the important
thing and maybe finally leadership
university also very important and if I
add one more things if we have some time
then I like to share five-minute video
how university can provide more
interdisciplinary environment to the
student and how computer science or
computational thinking you mentioned we
can change conventional library to the
information sharing to foster or this
kind of a collaborative research and
interdisciplinary education for the
student and researchers can you prepare
about bay maybe we can do that to you
the lunchtime yeah okay yeah certainly
label all right thank you very much
could I also add to that a little bit
with the previous two explanations about
that and I think the very critical thing
is whether or not you don't take it just
like a fashion or trend to take it real
in order to engage into a real
interdisciplinary research sometimes you
know from top down sometimes it's easy
to get into all there are different
people from different disciplines let's
support them but then they will bring
the resources back and do their own
stuff in their own unit so how do you
measure success is actually a very or
success oriented to the manic management
I think that's my observation or advice
and turn there's also a very important
aspect is from bottom up you know
whether or not we are really you know
the strongest from different field see
have the two desire to solve a real
problem that requires interdisciplinary
skills that's really where the hope is
actually for for the future and in
general this is a trend
we can't stop it we need to recognize it
and promote it we should respect
traditional ways of doing scientific or
academic research in their only
individual specialized fuel but we
should promote more people that are
targeted toward complicated problem
solving that requires interdisciplinary
collaboration so when I first heard your
question I immediately thought of one
particular unit within nus that's very
strongly promoting interdisciplinarity
and this unit exhibits many of the
positive things you mentioned and
perhaps a few of the negative things as
well this is the NUS graduate school for
integrative sciences and engineering and
NGS as it's called and NGS is
responsible for it runs a program a PhD
program for students who are interested
in doing an interdisciplinary ph.d
program so from the outset they you know
express interest and trying to find
problems that cross disciplines and work
on problems that have some significant
interdisciplinary impact there's you
know the unit does operate pretty much
in isolation from other faculties on
campus it's very successful at reducing
PhD graduates that have this
interdisciplinary character to them
where it's perhaps less successful is in
establishing links between the faculty
members that are doing the supervising
of the students and sometimes also it's
for this particular unit the students
that come in may have interdisciplinary
intentions but then they still end up
gravitating toward one particular
discipline and it's sometimes difficult
to identify interesting problems for the
students to work on that really have
have have a strong basis in multiple
institutions okay there's a one very
quick follow-up question specifically
for Jeanette is that I know you have a
very long academic background but you
are now working in industry okay so if
there's someone's submit their resume to
you and you see this purse
graduated from cross-disciplinary school
and you are working with Microsoft and
they look into this resume would you
think that this guy or this lady is not
so good in computer science no I
wouldn't think that at all I don't
actually I don't know first of all I
would like to remind people that this
notion of interdisciplinarity is not new
many fields that we know and think of as
disciplines today came out from the very
past from different fields for instance
computer science so I not sure I'm not
sure perhaps we're making more out of
this than really necessary I when Ivy I
still remember at Carnegie Mellon when
we were trying to start computational
biology on campus and it was a real
struggle because you had the biologists
here in the computer scientists here and
they all you know say they wanted to
hire a computational biology faculty
member and they have different cultures
and different evaluation criteria but
eventually it had to happen and the two
sets of faculty had to get together
because that's where the science was
going and the science required the two
disciplines the people into two
different disciplines to start working
together and collaborating so when I
will look at a resume I'm going to look
at not what the person majored in I'm
going to look at the qualities of the
person what kinds of problem-solving
skills that this person learned and
interdisciplinary could actually be a
benefit so I wouldn't say oh this person
has a PhD in say computational biology
he must not know computer science I
wouldn't say that at all okay thank you
know
I think of course job placement is the
most important important indicator
performance of interdisciplinary
occasion well already the leading
companies begin to recruit the student
with the interdisciplinary background
for example samsung you know the leading
company last year hired about 300
student background with lee bharat to
make programa right computer program so
the new employees does do not have any
background on computer science they have
only background and deeper odd but
university had not followed the trend of
this change so the leading company at
first they recruit people at the student
and educate train at the gate company
and they lose the right awesome so I
think you know in any country university
is a very traditional they have tendency
not to change at all or so the leading
company go first thank you thank you for
your sharing ok now we want to move a
shifter gear from the very high to very
practical that is how to teach a course
ok general mention about committed and
thinking in all k to 12 things like that
you know in China it is actually a
required course for all the freshmen
year which is the computer fundamental I
hope I'm not exaggerating it but what I
heard is probably one of the most of our
own courses to the students ok a part of
is is that a student feel that computing
has nothing to do with them ok they
choose for example history major ok what
is computing to do with them ok what we
have been talking about is more like in
the research type of universities assume
that you are in a very ordinary
university and there
question specifically for professor
rosenblum challenging you if you have to
teach a history major students in this
in their freshman year this computer
fundamental okay and we reminded this
students are very diversified in terms
of their knowledge about computing some
of their computer geeks because of the
hobby some of them probably know nothing
about a computer and not interested at
all if you have to teach a class like
that what would you do well let's see so
first of all I would say NUS is no
ordinary University it's just a childish
impression about that yes I mean this is
this is certainly a problem that arises
and actually it's a very germane
question for us at nus right now at nus
in the school of computing we're very
interested in developing a cybersecurity
minor that potentially students from a
very wide variety of other faculties
might be interested in signing up for
and these would be students not just
from kind of the usual suspects
engineering perhaps or maybe business
but also potentially law or public
policy students from a wide variety of
faculties and a big challenge for us in
thinking about how to achieve this is
just in order to get to the point where
we can start to educate the students in
the interesting aspects of cybersecurity
they still need a lot of computer
science background programming and data
structures algorithms just to be able to
understand some of the basic concepts in
cyber security so it's not an easy thing
to do I mean certainly you can tailor
the technical depth of content to orient
a you know an introductory computer
science course more towards technical
majors or non-technical majors certainly
a lot of people are able to do that
successfully and to make computer
science appealing for those people in
the less technical subject areas but in
order to have a
you know a richard curricular initiative
of some kind like a minor for example in
cyber security i think the challenges
are much greater yes sure we i have a
very specific example to answer Tim's
question it again at Carnegie Mellon it
by the way it doesn't have to anyway we
invented a new course that would be for
non-majors that would teach
computational thinking or computational
fundamental computer science afternoon
collimating fundamentals of computer
science because before then the course
was programming in Java and all students
at Carnegie Mellon are required to take
this course so you have artists
historians musicians electrical
engineers they all have to take this
course the only major that's exempt from
this requirement are the drama majors ok
so they get is an exception but in any
case every other student has to take
this course and we in computer science
we're teaching this new course and we
recognized very early on after the first
semester that we had to do what you just
said Paul we had to teach a version that
was for the very technical people like
the engineer electrical engineers who
already knew how we're very advanced in
their reasoning skills and their
programming skills and the non-technical
the more the arts majors and so on and
what you do is you make the homework
examples the homework problems and the
problem sets in the projects appealing
to non computer scientists that could be
very well the questions could be posed
in these non computer science terms in a
setting that makes sense and it's
motivating for these non computer
scientists and I know that for instance
that Brown University there's a course
called computational thinking for
humanities and Social Sciences and if
you look at all the problem sets the
homeworks that are given it stopped by a
computer science professor they're all
about
questions that humanities or social
scientists would be interested in
answering asking and answering and then
they learn along the way the
computational techniques to answer the
questions okay thank you okay now one
last of follow-up questions especially
for your professor Gong and then we'll
open the mic for all the professor's
there are questions that is I know your
I know your school because we have a
collaborative project together I'm
really amazed by the capability
computing capability that your Institute
have so I know a lot of your students
are not computer science major and
probably a lot of them has nothing to do
with computing at all how would you
encourage them to know computer science
and especially for yourself I I know you
probably don't do not have copy the size
of fish or training how comes you are
interested in this and push yourself to
to learn well actually this is a very
natural you know I could comment a
little bit about today we are we are
making such a strong evidence and the
argument that computer science is
everywhere its effects everybody's life
now that means in academic ecosystem
it's really high up there so I'm also
job mark you know one people with skills
with computer and then some specialized
skills in Earth's size it's a bonus to
everyone so it's not really hard for us
to proceed our student to to learn more
about computing in in our field as a
matter of fact actually in atmospheric
science for example I'm wearing a PI
from Princeton professor who visited us
from the gfdl geophysics fluid dynamics
lab they are amount of first
I as early as in the 1940s when the
computers are just about to be getting
wider and wider recognition for you know
the high end not not in the general
public that the practiced ocean general
circulation modeling in in the hope that
to study and understand whether so
computer science is deeply rooted in
earth science in that way so so we don't
have a lot of difficulties in proceeding
or student to learn computer thank you
okay now is the question from the
professor's yes
is there might want a lucky to be
involved in collaboration with Microsoft
or more than 10 years but I see
computing is a very important science
and it will be more important in the
future but a current issues current
problem is not that you have multiple
disciplines scientists work together to
sit there to solve the problem the
university is the most comprehensive
University in that in China we have
different professors work together but
we cannot serve the problem I think the
most challenge for Microsoft the number
one leading software in the world we
need to find what with Microsoft where
to develop some new technology no new
software you towards to can predict the
very complicated situation system of
Earth's future the future of Earth the
compressed society of the sort of the
future and that complicate human
behavior human disease now we are
involved with some emails prepared by
Microsoft several years ago but still
down there is no solution so the problem
is the society the human is too
complicated it's very company's system
it's a chain variously so now there is
no tour for computation can predict the
future everywhere no way so I think
Microsoft it worked with scientists
together to provide some software some
subroutine some power tools to do that I
don't think that education into the
elementary school in very poor choice
competition a part of but it went also
challenge in the future so I would like
to answer that in fact Microsoft does
have a cloud platform court as your and
it is a platform that scientists can use
to do large to do analysis over large
data to do simulations and so on so I I
think the question you're asking is so
Microsoft provides software platforms
and so on so that scientists can use
these sorts of tools to to do their
science the question you're asking I
hope is not you know Microsoft should
solve the earth science quad a problem I
mean in fact there are scientists in
Microsoft Research who are environmental
and ecological scientist who are
amassing massive amounts of data and
building models for predictive power and
in fact serving this on and as your
platform it's called fetch climate you
can actually go to it and you can do
some what if scenarios and you can do
some possible predictions but it's just
a step towards the grander scientific
challenge in terms of climate change and
an understanding environment let alone
bringing in the human aspect I mean
you're talking about a huge complex
system that you would like to model and
then run under different initial
conditions lots of scenarios what if
scenarios for prediction for predictive
power this is not this is not
Microsoft's line of business actually
but Microsoft line of business is to
provide the software platforms and tools
that can enable the scientist to do the
sort of work could I since you brought
Earth's future health problems and human
behavior are so complicated
hard to predict I just want to further a
little bit of this argument first of all
I think there's definitely not enough
you're saying that it's not important
for less important you wish a software
company or a computer giant will be able
to have a one sweet solution for
everyone that's that's going to be in
the long way maybe in many years to come
I want to emphasize that I actually
fully agree with genetic genet on making
establishing computational thinking as
early as possible because that's the
only way we educate more people we have
more thoughts for the whole world to
think computationally and we could
advance and make better use of computing
for human society on the other hand in
in our field actually I see the
necessity of having people in different
disciplinary to sit together I give you
one example that are uncoupled stupid
for those of you who don't know encar
encar stands for National Center for
Atmospheric Research it's backed by 70
first grade metrology department called
you car University Center for
Atmospheric Research these supported by
human but I soul to this particular
organization and car NSF BOE support by
money to put together that make this one
thousand people organization working
since the 1960s trying to solve you know
earth modeling problems basically climb
assist model so it's only one part of
that climb assist model but by working
with our people 11 module of that
particular
program when we have we bring the
computer science from chinua to work
with us to improve optimize algorithm we
increased one big component of that by
17 times so z have several hundred
engineers they have lots of scientists
but they don't have those kind of you
know you know I catchers to debug that
particular part to make the program more
optimal and efficient so we need more of
that kind of successful stamp examples
okay thank you I think ID other
questions yes there's one over there how
about we take that on edit back first
and then here thank you thank you well
first of all I would like to state my my
my viewpoint I think that the the
multi-discipline interdisciplinary
education very important but from all of
you guys tomy multidisciplinary is not
the innovation is happens long time
before and Samsung start they will hire
them other discipline our discipline
guys naturally so it seems that
everything happened naturally so why do
we want to emphasize now we have to
start the interdisciplinary education
now at why now this does that mean that
our come just nice to hit a dead end so
we need to find a new direction I don't
know I want somebody acts now help me to
answer my question thank you okay let me
come and first the reason we are talking
about this this a staging time is i
think is probably because of a big data
so the big data kind of making this
issue more serious right so big data
makes all the disciplines kind of
getting together so i think that's the
reason we have
topic at this at this moment good I well
I see this differently I think that
indeed the availability of data has come
to a point that helps to bring us
together but also it's been a long dream
for people to make powerful computing to
solve different problems you need
efficiency you need the Packers you need
precision you know all of that in the
past actually are not that desirable
possible so people think about this
maybe they drop the problem because the
tools and platforms are not there so now
it is time that there are lots of things
that are possible beta are available
there speed is there and so people are
coming together to re-read them some of
the issues that might have been thought
well many you know years ago but I think
it's time for us to act thank you
there's a question here yes
so I'm profit i'm professor comic relief
from seoul national university so you
know it's very good to be here it's my
first time here however some confusion
or I picture i already had this
confusion the meaning of
interdisciplinary talents doesn't mean
you like to have a expert in many areas
or would like to have an expert in one
area with the some understandings
because it's not easy to be expert in
many areas advanced so maybe it's better
to teach students the expert in one area
with some understanding in other areas
so what do you think about it I think
for the purposes of this panel the
meaning of interdisciplinary is someone
who is an expert in two or more areas
that's my assumption here and there is a
bias in this room that one of those
areas be computer science but that may
not be I do want to remind everyone that
in terms of research you don't if you
have a problem that that naturally needs
people from different disciplines it
doesn't mean you need to hire someone
who is well-versed in all those
disciplines you get a team of people
together like an institute and bring in
experts from the different disciplines
sit them together and get them excited
about solving that problem that requires
the multiple expertise over time of
course the next generation the graduate
students they produce will be well
versed in two or more of those areas or
in terms of education I think the
undergrad level they should be educated
in multilateral subject because science
is changing very fast and the social
problems are you sure
a very multi-dimensional if they are
educated at the only one major the
future society they will pace with the
very difficult multi-dimensional
problems so they can absorb it so at
under great labor I like the strong
emphasize the education should be
multilateral into this panini with the
strong emphasis on river rat and then at
the great grade level maybe we can
educate some specialists with a couple
of meters or the whole newest soul mates
then they can collaborate with other
mages now I add one more dimension to
this is that we we hear diversity the
word a lot this morning I think we faced
with a very diverse world there are
specialists who could go deeper and
deeper we love that great no they are
expert there are also journalists who
could actually shift from one field to
the other you know we should also
advocate we are society needs those kind
of people so here education nurse or
university to the role of universities
should be able to empower poles okay
there's a way I consider that as the
final question all right thank you very
much thank you and I really have a
question about the way of performing
interdisciplinary and a way of fostering
collapsed or collaboratory research my
personal observation is that for
whichever studies beginning from
computational okay computational ecology
computer earth science or whatever I see
the computer science are very brave and
there are very good learning new things
and new concepts and new ideas from
atmosphere science ecological remote
sensing I see the kind of way of you
know collaborating it's kind of that
domain experts are striving
understanding the principles while
computer sends
having their hands dirty and
manipulating with the data all the day
and all the way so in terms of Education
do using this way need to be changed or
or not is it a good way about company in
the early days of a collaboration
between a computer scientists and a non
computer scientist there tends to be
this service component and Paul talked
about it before but the ideal
collaboration is when the two let's just
say it's too as strack ting from the
many learn from each other and this is
what Paul's point was computer science
certainly is influencing other
disciplines but when we collaborate with
people in other disciplines we want to
advance computer science as well so we
want to push the state of the art in our
field in computer science as well but
sometimes in like in any collaboration
there's a little give and take and maybe
in the beginning the computer science
gives a little more than takes but over
time the hope is that it's symmetric
okay due to the time limit we ended the
piÃ±atas discussion this morning session
here and in this afternoon there will be
another panel discussion more on
interdisciplinary research and we can
continue with that so thank you very
much and thank you all the panelists</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
