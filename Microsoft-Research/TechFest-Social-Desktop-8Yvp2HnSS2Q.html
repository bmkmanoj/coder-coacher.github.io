McConnell and Tom's going to show
something called social desktop which is
as an application a program software it
is a web service combined with software
that is running on the desktop and
explain to us what it is ok well social
desktop in his essence is a prototype
that we're doing in Microsoft Research
which tries to marry the web with the
desktop the way that the web has evolved
with document sharing is different from
the way the desktop works and so we're
trying to figure out how can we make the
to work more seamlessly together so I've
read a little bit about it essentially I
can pick whatever is on my desktop and
give it its own URL right for sharing
yes so what we built is a service which
creates a URL for every file on your
your system across all of your devices
so you're able to privately browse
across any of your files just like
folder share does but in addition we've
created a backing social page which
allows you to have a social experience
around any of the files on your desktop
so you can share your documents by just
clicking on a document and sending a
link to somebody they can look at it in
any browser they can comment on it and
tag on it and use delicious and all that
sort of thing but you don't have to
upload or worry about where it goes it's
basically just seamlessly part of the
desktop experience then we can all of
that in all of that technology merged it
back into the desktop to create a
seamless experience on the desktop so
it's just an innate part of the desktop
system no is this is this a free service
because most websites I mean someone has
to pay for the hosting well right now
this is just purely a prototype we're
just investigating what are the
paradigms around sharing what's the
right security model there's a balance
between public and easy and very private
and hard and finding the right knobs and
experience around all that stuff we know
that people do very insecure ways of
sharing with you think about people
resort to email attachments all the time
to share documents and you have no
control over where the document goes
it's usually a file size limit to is
there a social desktop have besides
levels social desktop right in its
current incarnation actually can use
test your data directly off of your
system and in theory we can do things
like you know do smart cashing in the
cloud based on demand based on up time
of your system and all that sort of
thing the point is you shouldn't have to
worry or care about that we're trying to
build that sort of stuff into the system
that's for us to worry about exactly
let's take a look at it show me what it
can do okay well so what we're going to
start with right here is this is just a
normal windows browser experience and
this document here there's a new verb
here which allows you to look at the
social page for this document so it
launches you into a browser and and
that's a public URL anyone in the world
can access that this this URL is a
public URL if you notice it's kind of an
obfuscated addur l so it's not a raw you
RL allows you to go and browse the hard
drive on my system it's the public
facing version what you think tinyurl
right so the you can't want people
browsing my system yeah exactly so we
have a preview that one of the key ideas
is you shouldn't have to have this
software installed to look at it you
should be able to just look at a preview
and it should just work so we got a nice
little Silverlight app lets you look at
the preview of this document you can see
there's a comment here there's some
social verb sorry I have to log in here
so I can show the next step so once I've
logged in we have some additional things
where I can add a comment we've got
various verbs which are appropriate in a
web sharing environment such as I want
to email this to somebody I want to
download it I want to share it through
an existing service so we got facebook
twitter what else you have going on
flickr well yeah right now the only some
of these icons work you know to be to be
truthful right now we got we got Twitter
hooked up and so this is just a quick
little will just type in a quick little
note here that we're doing a demo on
Twitter and that just made sure that
this was shared make sure that it's
accessible on the internet and has
posted to my Twitter account so I've
just essentially said I already trust
everyone on my Twitter network I'm just
gonna let my twitter friends see this
document so there's kind of an inherent
trust relationship with that subset of
people people are going to be randomly
typing in goods and stuff like that
right so this this allows someone who's
on Twitter my social network to view
that so I'm gonna switch over to this
Mac here what
yeah I know and if I could figure out
how to do a refresh I'm not that much of
a macro file so here we go we got the
demo link that just came through as a
tiny URL and so when I click on this
we're going to get the same social
experience that we had over there on
this other machine over here we get the
previews we get the comments and if we
log in this case I'm going to log in as
my son and I'm going to add a comment
hopefully once it comes up I'm going to
say cool dad and we'll save that just to
show that the system is actually working
now we can come back over here and
refresh this guy oops and is there is
there a time limit with these things
live you know forever on you are else I
mean it's you know the metadata is
actually pretty cheap the idea is that
you should be able to easily search over
the metadata so we cache certain
metadata up in the clouds that we can
index over it so we can say search for
related documents if there's a topic if
there's tags you can search and related
to you know things that my social
network has shared so ultimately I want
to be able to say my friends have common
interests search over all the public
documents of all my friends I should
just be able to do that okay so showing
look cool dead so we got the cool thing
but let's actually take that a step
further and we're going to come back to
windows here one of the features of
Windows 7 is this cool search capability
so I'm gonna say hey I want to look for
some documents that have been tagged by
Lily so we got a bunch of documents here
you can see we're getting smart search
results across to all of the metadata
that's been published on by all the
comments and documents that have been
done but not only that when I click on
this and expand out the preview pane we
actually get the social experience right
there in the document space so you don't
have to go and say well where is it do i
have to switch the web mode or desktop
mode it all just kind of seamlessly
works together bringing that back full
circle if we come back here and go into
a document here again in the shell when
the preview pane is there we've taken
over the preview pane and we show the
social experience right there embedded
in the shell and so there's no decision
that has to be made it's just a seamless
experience and so that's why we call it
social desktop it's universal access and
browsing of your private data sharing
your your data in
public with your social network and
seamlessly integrating it into the
desktop and when are we going to have it
when can I have social desktop very very
early prototype we got a lot of things
we need to figure out as far as you know
permissions and all that sort of thing
so no no plans for release we're just
exploring exploring the space very
exciting i love the idea is there any
where people can go to online to learn
more about it keep up with you guys
there is a link on the tech fest page to
the social desktop project and it's been
posted on channel 10 and TechCrunch and
other places like that well thank you
very much called social desktop I like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
