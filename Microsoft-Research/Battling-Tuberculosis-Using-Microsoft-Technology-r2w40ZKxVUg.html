this could be a real disaster in public
health so it's everyone's business to
understand and combat tuberculosis there
are basically two types of tuberculosis
one is pulmonary tuberculosis TB of the
lungs and the others extra pulmonary
which can affect any part of the body
when tuberculosis affects the lungs then
every breath you take every time you
exhale you are bringing out tuberculosis
bacteria TB is caused by a bacteria is
it's an infection as we know that any
patient who does not take treatment he
can in fact 10 to 15 people with TB so
this leads to continuous transmission
the single biggest risk factor to
contracting tuberculosis is breathing in
wherever people travel and wherever they
cough they're going to give it to other
people
countries with great migration or
transit of populations say in the UK for
a classic example you will find a
greater proportion of tuberculosis
happening so also in border regions of
the United States often 9 to 10 million
people that contract TB closest annually
every year around the globe about 2
million happen in India of these 1/4
million or so died India contributes
quite a significant proportion we can
and we do have the resources today to
diagnose tuberculosis fairly early
enough and it's a very treatable
condition it's simply a bacterial
infection it can be cured fully and no
one need to suffer a diet of TB and no
one need to infect others
operation Asha is running a fantastic
program where health workers deliver
medication to patients but the tragedy
and the threats in India is that that
delivery breaks down because they're
running a very large geographically
distributed system where you have lots
of medication in very remote places
being delivered to patients so patients
for various reasons fall off the course
of medication and don't finish the full
six month course of antibiotics and
that's when you get drug-resistant
tuberculosis for somebody who is full
drug-resistant tuberculosis definitely
becomes a death sentence
it's extremely expensive and difficult
to treat and this represents the threat
of really pandemic because
drug-resistant TB is also contagious and
so if this strain of TB actually spreads
it represents a threat to everyone
because I get a marketing about s of T

Manisha came to operation Asha two years
ago and at that time she had developed
lymph nodes so we sent her to the public
hospital taking care of this particular
area and she was diagnosed as a case of
extrapulmonary tuberculosis don't worry
when I want my shelter
he was vaisakhi applicati hibachi kelly
key but Yakima cellular art aha Konoha
had for nine months she has been on
treatment for the lymph nodes that wound
has not healed in spite of treatment so
what is wrong my guess is that Manisha
has got drug-resistant
Gary Prasad was diagnosed as a case of
pulmonary tuberculosis
he had bacteria in the breath so he had
to take all precautions so that he
doesn't infect his own family members

so I work in a group called technologies
for emerging markets at Microsoft
Research India and we look at kind of
the role of Technology in low-income
communities in India and around the
world so sometimes that means inventing
a new technology sometimes it means
taking an existing technology off the
shelf and applying it in a novel way
that has a bigger impact for communities
that are in need
so we talked in detail with operation
Asha our field partner about
understanding what are the challenges in
delivering healthcare it's a kind of the
most inaccessible communities when
you're walking to the clinic you know
it's a very lively place there's lots of
energy and very vibrant except it's very
challenging as well
various livestock wandering through the
streets you know it's a small and
cramped environment can barely fix you
know six or seven people it's hot
there's no running water lots of
background noise and that's the also the
place where technology has to work the
biggest challenge in TB treatment is
that it's a long duration of treatment
and when patients default and miss the
medication they develop drug resistance
and our solution is a simple terminal
that uses a biometric fingerprinting
scanner to actually take the
identification of patients and health
workers every time a dose of medication
is delivered and those logs are stored
in the terminal and uploaded via a cell
phone via SMS messaging so people in the
office can see exactly where the
medication is going and follow-up in the
case of any challenges it is ensure that
patient has visited typically and we can
suppose that patient was given
supervised medicine if the things an
example where Microsoft Research is
extending the state of the arts to
combine technologies that have never
been combined in this way
this is a Hindu temple but the centers
exist in shops and temples and nobody
would know that TB treatment is going on
from a temple nobody would even think of
it because a patient would not like to
go to a place that says here
tuberculosis treatment is going on but
the importance of technology is that it
ensures every dose taken it prevents
fudging of data it ensures accuracy of
Records it ensures that our counselors
are coming on time going on time
treatment has to be simple effective
inexpensive and convenient for the
patients especially when we are dealing
with something as challenging as
tuberculosis
it's important to extend healthcare
right to the doorsteps of the most
inaccessible patients you know they're
working very long hours they are
constrained with housework and so they
don't have time to travel a long
distance to a hospital or it's a big
public health centers that are often
located in wealthy neighborhoods and
other locations so in our research group
we spend a lot of time thinking about
how to design computer interfaces for a
novice or low literate users you need to
have lots of graphics in your interface
audio cues multilingual content and so
that's a really important thing to
design for as well not just a user but
the whole environment where the
technology lives
we're active in 28 centers now about 13
health workers are working with the
technology and we've logged over 2,500
patients and monitored 50,000 doses so
this isn't a project where we aspire to
scale up the solution ourselves we think
if we demonstrate rigorous impacts other
people will also adopt it and that's
what we're seeing already across
multiple continents with of technology
we plan to implement Microsoft
technology using biometric terminals in
a forthcoming project which will be
implemented through operation Asha and
we'll be focusing on mines where migrant
laborers they are predisposed for
tuberculosis infection very soon we'll
be working in Uganda with another
nonprofit we will be implementing the
same biometrics and HIV treatment
centers and providing technology they
should succumb to a temple to pray that
they don't just pray for themselves or
their families
they also pray for a cure the key mmm

it's really about the people at the end
of the day if you connect to that level
and understand what are the human steps
that it takes to overcome those
challenges I think that's really kind of
