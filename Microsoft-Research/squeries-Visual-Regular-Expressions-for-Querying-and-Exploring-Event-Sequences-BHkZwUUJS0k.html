in this video will highlight some of
squeeze key aspect by walking through a
fictional use case Adam our user is a
data scientist at a big e commerce firm
the users queries to analyze user logs
from a smartphone application Adam
starts off by double tapping the
background to create an unconstraint
node this node represents a pattern that
matches just one single event but of any
type by opening up the visualization
view of this node Adam finds out what
actions the dataset contains as well as
how often they occurred he is interested
in sessions where people successfully
checked out so he drags out that item to
create a second pattern instantly he
sees that 14.2 percent of the sessions
contain a check out event pretty good
number he thinks but what actions to the
user take immediately before checking
out he links the two notes together the
visualization updates NEC said adding
product to the cart is the most common
action before checking out this confirms
what Adam expected and what about after
checking out Adam switches the order of
the two nodes
while most people close the app there
were a psalm that ended up adding
something else your shopping cart this
seems weird Adam besides and he taps
that item to further constrain his
pattern to just those cases he closed
the visualization of that pattern part
he opens up the visualization view again
but this time of the entire pattern
instead of a specific pattern part after
switching to the product attribute he
see said the only product that people
added after checking out was a free gift
he looks at the geographic location of
users that matched his pattern and
recalls that the company was running a
special promotion in those states Adam
goes back to all successful checkouts
this time he is interested to see if
people use the search functionality of
the app to find the products they raman
he creates a second known and contains
it to search
adam links the two nodes and c said none
of the sessions contains this pattern
this is probably because nobody went
straight from search to check out Adam
inserts an unconstraint know that can
match zero or more events by adding
another such node at the beginning Adam
make sure his pattern capture sessions
from start to check out the whole
pattern now reads as find sessions that
had at least one search in it and that
resulted in a check out adding and
connecting another node allows Adam to
compare between check out sessions with
and without search by inspecting
different parts of his pattern Adam for
example sees what the most prominent
search terms were what websites referred
customers that did not use search or he
can use a sliding gesture to look at
different time dependent visualizations
of those sessions sweary supports even
more complicated pattern constructs Adam
was curious to see what products might
have been mistakenly added to the card
or projects where users changed their
mind before buying them if he uses this
query he finds all cases where people
added a product to their cart and then
subsequently removed any product from
the card Adam inspects those cases he
selects cases where people added the
blue bottle to their cart and sees what
products they subsequently removed this
is probably not what he wants since he
wants to find instances where people
added and removed the same product Adam
can achieve this by making sure the
products in those two notes pawn to the
same thing he opens up the first note
and drags the link icon to the second
note now the two histograms are
identical
