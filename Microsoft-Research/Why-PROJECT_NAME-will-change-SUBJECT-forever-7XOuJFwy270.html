hundreds of influential speakers from

lectures freely available
you
right well let's go ahead and get
started here welcome everybody in the
room and those of you online my name is
Alex Wade with MSR outreach and it's my
pleasure to welcome today our fun Smith
arfin is has had a very interesting
career going from being a research
scientist actually getting into to
github where he is now but prior to that
he was involved in the Zooniverse
platform and was one of the leaders in
in sort of the crowd source software
space and now asserting his attention
more fully to how software can be used
really within the research community so
it's my pleasure to welcome him here
today and thank you orphan thanks thanks
for having me here today um also I need
to apologize immediately for those
stupid talk title ever it seemed
brilliant when I wrote it but I only
probably means something to me so the
idea being that these are variables that
you could substitute so we'll do that a
bit later on anyway um yeah so yeah so
my background is is research I I have a
PhD in astrophysics I very quickly
realized what's that oh really awesome
all right good all right um but it turns
out I'm a terrible astronomer so I then
had a year in a group writing software
and bioinformatics institute which was
fun and then yes as Alex said was doing
stuff with Zooniverse so I guess all
through my career I've been writing
software for research domains initially
for myself during a PhD but then more
later more for for you know to
facilitate the research of others and so
a lot of what can talk about today is
sort of I guess influenced by those
experiences I'm so yeah my name is
almost myth you can find me online as
album on github and elsewhere on the web
but I work for this company called
github which I think most of you
probably know about but if you don't
it's the I pretty much the largest
source of open source software on the
web and so it's you know when I try and
explain what github is the people this
is I too have got a bunch of versions
and I've just had a meeting with half of
you in the room so you guys are probably
the least in need of explaining this but
it's this distributed version control
would only spend a couple of slides on
it that that helps with versioning stuff
this is how I explain github to my mum
or to somebody non-technical because
we've all done this even though even
though track changes exists for some for
some reason and I realize I'm Redmond
campus now so I'm going to keep my
rhetoric down like track changes has
never worked for me beyond about three
authors like I just like people turn it
off or ignore it or I don't know like
they just you end up doing this and your
version control was your inbox which
obviously sucks and so actually and of
course you know you'll you'll probably
would be aware that actually we can't
solve the problem very well forward
because it's not line oriented and so
not very well versioned in gets a
technology but this is this is a
mathematics book that was written by
about 50 people up on github it's
written 47 contributors with 3,000
commits this was written by a whole
bunch of authors and they were using
this soap was something line or entered
their writing their mathematician their
writing in tech right so they are you
know in every you know this is the
equivalent of track changes on github
this is a single commit we're showing
line additions line removals line by
line changes so this there's you know a
whole bunch of stuff that's happening on
github this is the very small so if you
are writing latex then this is a file
that's useful to you when using get this
is the hidden file that tells get what
to ignore in a project so latex pues out
all these temporary files left right and
center and actually you probably don't
want a version those as you go so this
is a get ignore file that's actually got
a whole bunch of people both forking it
starring it for people are kind of
getting value out of this and then at
the very large scale this is a seven
million line code base it's c and python
and all sorts of other things but it's
the production software pipeline for the
CMS experiment on the Large Hadron
Collider so this is one of the two
experiments that detected the Higgs
boson this is a group that are active on
github they collaborate on github
there's a
about I forget how many authors are
things about 300 authors on this project
but their PhD students in labs and they
are building you know the software that
that produced the data it's not the
science part of the experiment it's the
production kind of data release part but
that manages the instrument that's all
happening on get up so from the very
very small very very big um I also have
to sometimes do this when I speak which
is explained what researchers do and why
I think github is kind of relevant and
so I have this kind of a story that I
like to tell which the Toyota version is
that astrophysics is technical people
are smart they are solving hard problems
but their research workflows are
brimming with in efficiencies like they
are wasting vast amount of time and this
is not because astronomers are silly
people but it's because they don't know
about technologies that we know about in
the open source world and so so
astrophysics is shame about the lighting
but never mind it's otherwise really
nice projector this is you know this is
a telescope it's on the top of Mauna Kea
astrophysics is going to wonderful
places using amazing instruments seeing
the sky like most people don't and using
this is the last telescope I used it's
the anglo-australian telescope in
Australia and so you know it's like big
science big hardware but the technology
actually looks like this so this is the
control system for that telescope so
there's I think like vax Hardware
underneath this somewhere that actually
is in the kind of production pipeline
for data off the telescope so you know
there's both the absolute pinnacle of
engineering effort goes into creating
these things and the computation stuff
is sometimes behind and also this is the
kind of rarely seen side of astrophysics
this person his name's Steve Fosse he's
so tired that he's got a post-it note on
his face telling him to remind me to
remind him to change something about the
configuration of the hardware because
it's 3am and we've been awake for 27
hours and with jet lagged and you know
so it's not that glamorous but the point
about what you're doing in data
reduction is that you spray
time you know this is kind of a common
pattern in research that your job as a
researcher initially is to kind of
remove the effect of the instrument that
you're using from the data you've
collected you want to be able to compare
you know datasets from multiple
different instruments and so the
detectives that are used in telescopes
typically see CDs this is what they look
like when you illuminate them and you
can see these are quite big physical
devices that probably like about this
large they're somewhat larger than the
CCD in your in your phone but you can
see they've got all sorts of weird
fringing effects and this is kind of
internal reflections that go on inside
inside the device and when you zoom in
on them and look at them up close
because they're you know they're quite
expensive devices but there astronomers
sometimes buy cheap versions of these
things because your telescopes really
expensive so you're cutting costs on the
ccd you get these stuck pixels these
white ones these are called hot pixels
so these are pixels that are not
actually detecting light they're just
stuck reading out one hundred percent
all the time so you can see that these
these columns if we scroll down the CCD
there's a hot column that runs top to
bottom all the way up and down the CCD
but then if you actually look in further
then you see that there's actually lots
of these small pixels all across the
device so there's these pixels in your
data set that you want to remove right
so this is what a researcher does when
they first first get their data from the
telescope so they have a you open up
this viewer and you look at these files
because some of them are really obvious
but some of them are really subtle like
this one you'll see like not only is it
not stuck on one hundred percent but the
response functions got a bit weird on
the CCD so you end up making this thing
called a bad pixel mask in its plain
text and it looks something like this it
describes x1 x2 y1 y2 positions for all
the crappy data yes hotels don't like
her detector yes so like you don't have
to if you're new to the telescope you
don't have
build it for yourself over time like
somebody did it like 20 years ago when
they first wouldn't that be wonderful
wouldn't that be amazing if that
happened no I'm about to tell you what
actually happens is that everybody does
this every time right so that detector
is I said brimming with in efficiencies
that detector well you know it's an
expensive telescope it's you probably
only get three nights of use on it so it
has two different groups using it every
week or maybe maybe you get two days
when three observing groups using it
every week it takes about two days when
you first look at the new detector if
you've never done that task before so a
new PhD student like I was takes a
couple of days to really get a canonical
bad pixel mask um that detector will
probably be on the telescope 15 years
and so there's about 13 years of human
effort ballpark wasted doing that task
and nobody shares these things so these
are the most shareable hey you use it
wednesday how are you give me where you
really don't it like wow why I don't
being stood there is there something
meditative about doing the same thing I
don't know but there's this idea as well
that this is like rite of passage as
well right how everyone's got to make a
bad pixel mask and you know when you've
used this hella scope again you probably
use your old one but you have a quick
look the problem is as well as they're
not absolutely static so they evolve
right people drop you know like things
into the instrument or somebody suppose
coffee or something they are they're not
there static like in like the person who
used the telescope two weeks ago you
could just share but you probably
wouldn't want to share the one from
three years ago you probably would want
to make a new one or you would at least
want to version the one and then we
could all iterate and collaborate around
it so if the most extreme use case here
and I'm trying to be I'm being
deliberately extreme here but is that
it's purple perfectly feasible that you
might spend a decade of human effort
writing these things and I would like to
say that this is unusual but I think
this is normal actually in research like
this kind of inefficiency where the
things that we produce as researchers
the things that we only think about
really ever are the papers at the end we
don't think about the products of our
research as we go so this is kind of a
deliberately
a extreme example but I think if ever
there was a use case for the kind of
most human time wasted on a single file
it would be probably bad pixel masks
because they're you know years per byte
is the unit I think anyway so how do you
open source communities kind of deal
with problems like this how do they
collaborate around stuff well the first
thing I wanted to do just because I
think this is a sort of a sort of
experienced audience is I want to just
draw a slight difference between open
source and open collaborations because I
think there's a subtle tea there that
matters especially in academia and so
very broadly and hand-wavy I'm not a
licensing guru or nor law train but you
know open source is about a right to
modify the underlying thing that you are
you have been you know you have stumbled
across you know there's some kind of
contract there that you have confidence
you can take what's been published and
you have a right to modify and reuse
that work but you don't actually with an
open source license there's nothing
there saying you you can contribute back
to that project that is this no there's
no right to contribute that and so and
so this is the kind of difference
between I think open source and open
collaborations and this is where github
and academia I think are our wet
academia can learn a lot from what
happens on github is that open
collaborations are often also open
source projects the product of these
communities are but the the idea is that
anyone who's competent if they make a
valid contribution then they might have
a reasonable expectation that
contribution going back into the project
be hopping up and down and say a little
intent of copyleft was that you know if
i forked from you and then did some
additions and i had to contribute it
back shop and so that the intent was in
shall I my collaboration with maybe the
mechanism so I might have to make it
available but would it go back into the
canonical sauce so so that's kind of
what I'm saying like if I stumble across
a library that's got an open source
license on it I might do some amazing
work but the it's great for
right so the maintain this might have no
interest in taking notes back know it
you have to develop all community around
right answer and so it's this it's this
this kind of open collaboration that so
I guess I'm talking about today I want
to sort of talk more about how academics
or the academic model could work well
for I guess open collaboration and also
open as an open source and open science
but so so what's different you know
comparing and contrasting what I just
kind of explained in that situation with
with bad pixel master well in open
source there's this culture of reuse
right so there's no shame in picking up
the work of somebody else and building
upon that in fact this is just this is
this is this is actually core two
quarter how the expectations all the all
the norms of the community but there's
something more than that and there's
something that that academics really
don't have is that the environment from
which open source software is often
built is actually lower friction than
academic environments so you know
emailing Word documents or or or sitting
in a room together these are not these
are not models that scale when you've
got something like 4,000 people working
together on a project and so the the
piece of github that I think is most
interesting and this is I guess my sales
pitches what happens on pull requests
and I think this is pretty much the only
feature that I'm going to talk about
today that's about github and I think
really good example of this and again
sorry some of these slides are probably
a little bit inappropriate for this
audience but you know there's this this
is a project called home brew which is a
thing that you put on it's not
inappropriate because what I'm about so
there you know you put it on your Mac
and it allows you to get a some software
dependency on your computer so if you
want MySQL or you want you know some
kind of a C library installed or some
kind of weird esoteric a bit of software
then there's this there's this package
management thing called homebrew but it
is an open source projects got 3,700
contributors so how the hell does that
work well the way it works is that a
whole bunch of people take copies of
this by forking on github so when I
click that button on github if you
haven't done it you basically get asked
where do you want to take a copy of this
base where do you want to take it to so
I exist in as an individual on github I
work for github so I'm in a few
organizations that belong to github
these ones but I've also interacted with
Mozilla science lab so I I'm on some of
their projects as well but I basically
take my own copy we call this forking
you folk the code base you bring it into
your name space on github so this is a
you know a effectively a name
state-based branch of the code base and
then I just go away and I write my new
formula that goes into into home brew
this is where I go and do my work but
and this has happened tens of thousands
of times on github I was going to see if
we can see the number of pull requests
on on home brew but you know this
happens an enormous man actually 28,000
there thank you 28 thousand seven
hundred nearly um the important point
about this though is that I can do my
coding first and then I can ask for
permission later so if I am interested
in making a contribution I don't have to
go and ask for permissions on the
repository I don't have to go and ask
permissions to become a contributor I
can fork the codebase go off and do my
work and lead with with examples so code
first Commission later and I think this
is the this is certainly a barrier in in
or breaks down a barrier when when
trying to advocate for a change you can
actually go and make that change before
having to you don't have to advocate for
for the option to make the contribution
you can go and do the work and lead by
example so this is actually the longest
I wanted to prove that github eat its
own dog food and users github to build
github so this is github github the
codebase internally and this is I think
our longest ever running pull request
our most commented pull request and it
was by somebody who wanted to change the
about page you know this is a screen
grab of that page and you can see you
know there's the initial code
contributions at the top this is a
design change and functionality change
see images coming in whole bunch of
people commenting a whole bunch of code
of these are code additions hear
comments new images more code more code
and then when you get to the bottom of
the page
you can see the pj Hyatt merged commit
in to master at the end so that merged
master was actually the change going
live on in production and so so you know
pull requests merging pull request is
kind of the core kind of part of how
people collaborate on get up but I think
one of the things that's interesting to
me when you have projects that are open
like how what does the collaboration
look like what is the actual this
difference between open source and open
collaborations like what is the
expectation of a contributor or
potential contributor to their changes
going back into the library that they're
interested in so this is a project
called Redis so this is a key value
store in memory stores bit like
memcached very popular kind of a caching
layer for web applications and this is
time across the bottom here we've got
about three years worth of data and on
the y-axis we've got the fraction of
pull requests that get merged over for a
given month so the size of the dot here
is actually how many pull requests were
open that month and you're what we're
looking at here is you know in this
month there are only a couple of workers
but they were all merged in but over
time this project is well I'm an
astronomer so I see a trend there but we
can argue about that if you if you don't
but you can see that basically this
project is getting more popular these
dots are getting bigger but actually the
fraction of pull requests that are
opened like the fraction that's getting
merged in is is is is getting smaller
compare that with something like ember
which is a pretty popular JavaScript web
framework this is wildly popular project
this is now only actually a about two
years worth of data in fact a little bit
less than that this is a project that's
growing in population popularity this is
a more open collaboration than Redis
right red is they're both MIT licensed
open source projects but one is actually
taking a large number of community
contributions so I think there's a
there's a difference here and I think
this is important and this is actually a
library in astrophysics a very popular
project called astro pi and again you
can see the
checks really getting a lot more popular
as about two years worth of data here
but they're pretty pretty good at got a
bad month at the end though we'll ignore
that oh we run the data but yeah that
they're getting that they're pretty good
at taking contributions so so but
sometimes things like this happen right
so this is home brew it's written by a
British guy who thinks that the word
formula is cool and Americans get upset
with that because Americans like
formulas and occasionally you c63 files
changed this is somebody saying actually
it should be formulas and about
apparently about once a month I know one
of the maintainer of homebrew about once
a month somebody opens a pull request it
takes him a ton of work and actually
they probably just do a find and replace
but they they send a pull request in and
they say I want to rename formula and
that never goes well for them because
most of the maintain is a British and
they don't care and so you know there's
this as there's a governance thing here
when you have 4,000 people can
contribute into code but you know at the
same time these thing you know somehow
these these open collaborations managed
to create something a great net worth to
the community um there's a really really
wonderful blog post that if you're
interested in kind of open source and
and academia by a guy called Fernando
Perez so he's one of the lead engineers
on the ipython notebook if you're
familiar with that he's at Berkeley and
he has this kind of a kind of pretty
well argued thing that the academic
environments dead today are where you
know papers are the kind of combination
or the only thing that gets credited in
academia these are you know there's no
actually real incentive to to share you
know your research products other than
other than your other Neal papers
because there's no credit baked in as a
researcher kind of has this idea that
open source projects the ones that are
you know distributed people working in
different languages there oh they're
reproducible by necessity there's no way
that you can collaborate with a hundred
other people if you can't quickly
evaluate somebody else's work and
understand the contribution that they've
made and whether it's a good
contribution or a bad contribution the
the very the way that these communities
exist is more reproducible and one that
the academics could learn from and so
you know people who collaborate well and
get up a better collaborating because
they have to be because if they weren't
there often not in the same room they
probably don't know each other it might
not speak the same language but they
have to they have to have find a way of
working together because otherwise their
project just wouldn't wouldn't grow so
what's the thing that you know open open
source brings to academia well i think
you know does open have to mean public i
think this is a really important
question i think alex and i've been
talking bouncing around today you know
what does it mean is this is this kind
of way of working out sort of a call to
action for an open science kind of way
of working do we have to share
everything we're doing as as we go and i
don't think it does i think it's
actually open can be kind of different
different stages of those different
stages of openness you know there's open
within your team within your department
or within your institution or maybe with
the whole world but the the kind of
principles are the same that what you're
doing should be electronics Liz this is
not meet spaced based communication but
a something that's electronic and that's
available to everybody preferably and I
think this is something where you know
get does actually give you something
that the branching we were just talking
about in the meeting before you know the
idea that people can go off in different
directions make a feature branch work
and then the technology is actually
helping you with the with the merging
back in later but the process as you're
working is exposed and I think that's a
really important principle that's
there's immediately transferable to
academics again you know multiple people
working on the same thing this is a lock
free environment but overall we're
talking about some kind of low friction
collaboration that the open source has
that academics typically don't but this
isn't completely true ah there's there's
some interesting stuff having an
academia today and I wanted to take
chance to just kind of talk through some
good examples I think of open source
collaborations on get up so this is from
this sort of very small this is a guy
called Dan Foreman Mackie he is a
astrophysics PhD student at NYU and he's
written this really nice sampling
library that is up on github it's a
Python framework but you know his
initial release was for his own I think
he was doing some exoplanet research but
his initial release was about a year or
so ago now but um he's basically had a a
reasonable number we're looking at
probably a hundred now I think pull
request but people doing really useful
things so stuff that was not on some
published roadmap but that's of value to
to other folks so this is guy in guys
who basically initially there was a pull
request to and make the make the library
work well in an MPI environment and now
somebody's actually optimizing the that
you know the task allocation in that
environment so this is a this is a
library and a piece of software that's
growing in terms of its function and use
for the wider community all through
through pull requests from people that
Dan doesn't immediately know this is
something at sort of lab scale I guess
this is Titus brown at Michigan State
University so this is a library that
does I think this is a genomic I know
this is a DNA DNA analysis routing I
think it's looking for I think it came
as whatever I don't know what that term
is I think some kind of inconsistency in
the in the DNA structure but this is
this is a piece of software that is you
know this is the lab publishing this is
a research group probably 10 or 15
people working on it and then you've got
like full scale I don't think it's any
accident that this is a division of the
NIH this is a whole Institute the cancer
ncip publishing all of this offer a
curated list they've got where's the
number they've got a couple of ya a
hundred and sixty public repositories I
probably get help everything they do is
public and these are the kind of core
arm software that they want people to
people to use this as a kind of curated
set so that's software but there's
really interesting stuff happening in
the collaborative authoring environment
too so I started with our with that with
that math textbook but this is a rather
wonderful example of the side pie
conference proceedings so if you want to
sipe I then you actually this is the
master branch but I think there's a 2012
2013 2014 branch if you want to submit a
paper to side pie you fork the
repository and you make a pull request
with your paper in and the review
happens in the pull request and
acceptance to scifi as the is a merge
back into into the branch on the syfy
organization so that's I think that's
pretty neat and then there's a bunch of
stuff happening in teaching Ashley so I
think it's you know the the ipython
notebooks are I think a really
significant event in this place this is
a scientific Python lecture series I
think worth noting that you know
starring on github is a bit like a
bookmarking somebody you know 250 people
have bookmarked this but you know 59
fault you got a question so do so no
higher level question
as you get to more complex environments
or like your last example turning in the
paper I mean when I was an undergraduate
and turn in your first computer science
homework assignment you have to use a
special version of Emax and say medevacs
turn in homework right that got rid of
200 people out of successful person
class because they couldn't figure out
how to turn the homework yeah I wasn't
understated a large fraction of them
could have been pretty good computer
scientists right that was him idea it
was sort of an unfair way to own leave
people out and with out being pieces
that translate get up into normal person
oh sure yeah yeah like let's say an
astronomer who's not a programmer
absolutely that was yeah so I think
training is a huge factor in adoption so
it's actually a really good training
program called software carpentry you
might have heard of which is run by the
Mozilla science lab these days which
should have takes on this challenge
right like you're a new undergraduate or
postgraduate and somebody says Python
and you're like what you mean what is
that you're going to be using it and go
and like both learn how to structure
code and think about our documenting
code but also like one of the core
components of that is versioning and get
up in fact actually because there's this
are you like but if you're going to be a
scientist and you're not like like
journals taking journals like Captain I
do
biology always journal we stack them up
and you always have that version at your
data is just good practice right i mean
that's the number of scientists who
basically probably lost dana go
Catherine show that that mean so 20
years from now I think you know people
will just be you have to look so there
will be pain now but these people are
going to be scientists shouldn't they be
shouldn't they be living out in the
store away their data I can't just write
in the journal sorry huge general though
it's in 20 years if you were a professor
now in 20 years you will and if you
needed to turn in the paper you you know
a github method but the new thing that's
out there you'd be like with the student
can just submit the paper for me and not
try to deal with it like I'm sure my
advisor can program in alcohol 68 really
really well but it doesn't get paid a
lot against okay it was a part of
education some big john service connects
talks is like is teaching people the
skills they need for the jobs that don't
exist but are in the sense that pushing
to I mean there are put you know pushing
sort of the state of the art so that
people aren't being trained for the next
generation not it's so I aren't we ready
for this as I magnifica me Joe oh but
it's related years between you think of
it and that is both in the submitting a
paper to a conference and the turning in
homework assignment and there's a soup
there's a subtle aspect of that workflow
that I'm not familiar with how what we
work on github which is the submission
is not visible to everyone else Joe
right so my homework shouldn't be
readable by all my classmates and the
paper might not for every conference you
be visible to all the other submitters
until it's been merged show how is it
just a workflow of something that it's
okay for it all the invisible
so in teaching so the way that people
use it is it's a private repository
typically and so the student will fork
the teachers the professor's repository
and then submit a pull request which is
private because the repository is
private hey you joke they did this
they're doing the water's going right so
when they get a pull request they've got
some stat for how like they scored it
which is yeah but all souls yeah yeah
but I mean for this no I mean I'd for
the syfy I mean that's perfectly but I
think the there are communities now I
mean the camer library i'll just show
before every time Titus Brown submits
the grant proposal he publishes it on
submission he's I don't know if I'm
gonna get this money but here's what I
just asked for a million dollars would
from the NSF yeah there are people who
are just okay with that I'm not arguing
us ready notch or everyone's ready for
that but some people are doing yeah um
yeah so this so these plating lectures
are you know both look like this when
they're in their executable form but or
in their rendered for more should say
but these are these are these are this
is a kind of a growing growing space for
us but I feel like I have to explain
this stupid title so come back to that
so that was the setup again so I'm going
to do some variable substitution and
there's a telescope called the LSST
which some of you might have heard of
this is the large synoptic survey
telescope and this is the i guess our
evolution of the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey which some of you will be
familiar with which yeah so which so
scss was something that Jim Gray had a
lot of influence over with Alex la at
johns hopkins university so alice's tea
is the next kind of generation all-sky
survey telescope I should show you a
picture of it it's incredibly badass
looking this is about an 8 meter mirror
here there's a art as a version with a
you sized rendered person in it but
would be about this big here I didn't
realize it wasn't yeah there's an
official you side
the regulations for everything is good
but this thing is going to scan the
visible sky there's the sky it can see
every three nights so Sloan the Sloan
robotic survey you know would image I
think took a decade to image about a
quarter of the sky a depth this thing's
going to image all it can see every
three nights is basically you're going
to do video astronomy and it's going to
have to core data products it's going to
have a continual stream they call it
level one data of things that look a bit
like this so when you're imaging the sky
every night then something sometimes
things are going to have changed are you
going to look at the sky and say hi
there's a new thing there it wasn't
there last night wasn't there the night
before but it's there now and that might
be a low-flying rock like me it might be
an asteroid or it might be a new
supernova or it might be a gamma-ray
burst it might be you know they call
these things transients those things
that are changing in the sky so it's
going to ship it's going to be this data
stream 10 to the something you know that
could be five or eight the number you
get is kind of depends on who you talk
to there's going to be probably hundreds
of millions of events coming off the
data pipeline every night live streaming
and it's going to ship with a small
postage size stamp image of the sky with
a crosshair saying that thing and here's
some basic information about it and then
it's up to the community to go and point
their telescopes at it and then there's
going to be the level two data there's
so this is like the data released a
yearly cadence big data releases all the
imaging it's done over that year with a
reduced data product a lot more effort
going into the into the data this is a
telescope that inherently open because
of the way it's being funded it so join
jointly funded project between
Department of Energy and the NSF and
it's year it's kind of expensive it's
like half a billion dollars or something
so it's inherently open because if its
data policy it's got a got an open data
monday any of us in the u.s. can get all
of the data
if we want it if we can take a copy of
it if you're outside the US I think
there's a kind of al they're trying to
encourage research institutes to kind of
buy a license to access the data is
something like twenty thousand dollars
per year per institution so you know
it's it certainly within the u.s. it's
inherently a kind of open data product
project and actually more there's
actually a really cool opportunity when
you're spending half a billion dollars
building a telescope people like the NSF
and does want you to think quite
carefully about what cut type of
instrument you're going to build which
is fair and so they set up all these
working groups who were interested in
different science cases you got people
who are interested in supernovae and
galaxies and the large-scale structure
of the universe dark energy ajm and so
each of these groups have been spending
about the last seven or eight years
sitting down regularly three or four
times a year saying well what kind of
science do we want to do and what kind
of instrument would we need to build to
have that to have our science serve best
and so you know there's lots of science
as possible with Alice's tea but these
groups have basically informed the
design of the instrument so they've been
working together for close to a decade
so they'd help design the telescope and
I think there's an opportunity for
groups like this to do more and so the
question is like where do communities
form and you know certainly with LSST
it's around a shared challenge they are
interested in doing the same science you
can get a bunch of people in a room
together to talk about the problem
they're interested in solving so Alice's
to you has both their interest in the
shared challenge and there's also this
kind of like a flies to the honey pot or
whatever the you know the phrases that
you know there's this core shared data
product they're all going to have to use
they're all going to start with the same
the same data product and so so I think
there's an opportunity this is you know
there's these hundreds and hundreds of
researchers who have shaped the design
but they actually have an opportunity to
do more than that they're all going to
do basically the same science or very
similar signs they all have their own
interests but they've got an opportunity
with with alice st i think to do some
interesting and I think this for me this
kind of argument applies to any large
centralized science project that they
should basically just copy open source
they should copy what open source
communities do in terms of how they
build like the core parts of their
software and here's why I think the you
know in open source the this kind of
ubiquitous culture of reuse it is like
people spend time you know reading other
people's code copying each other's code
having an opinion on implementation may
be making their own implementation but
people are using each other's work and I
think the best example I have of like my
recent experience with this is a friend
of mine who is also astronomers
currently riding a bike across America
so that's quite impressive I think he's
following the route of somebody who did
this in eighteen eighty four on a
penny-farthing which is even more
impressive and he's somewhere in Nevada
right now actually I think he's in in
Nebraska now but you know I Stewart this
guy Stewart low he's carrying with him
not something dissimilar looking to this
he's got a non-smartphone and he's got
quite a nice GPS that gives him latitude
and longitude and we had a conversation
when he was in San Francisco I'm getting
on this bike and I really want to have a
map that shows where I am I want to
update a map and so you know I said well
you have you got a smartphone me so no
I'm got a smartphone what have you got
to go I've got I got an old nokia phone
and garmin gps I was like all right well
we can I'm sure we can do something like
this and he'd already actually to be
fair he had this is a file format called
geo Jason so it's geospatially aware
Jason structure that we render quite
nicely on github if you upload it so
he'd already worked out his path and he
said I want to i'd really be really cool
to update a map so i thought we must be
able to do this you know so when two
rubygems i typically right Ruby if I'm
trying to get something done searched
for SMS and you know something like 50
lines of Ruby later the story here is
not that I'm a good software developer
the story is that this was not hard 50
lines of Ruby later we've got a little
service where when he's done at the end
of the evening he sends a text message
was last seen longitude and it updates
the map right so it's just a
deliberately small example but you know
this software that
you know that to be able to achieve that
you've got many components in what you
build like many components in your
software stack but the point about for
me about that story is that my kind of
50 lines of code were about the thing
that's different like the value at the
the the the thing the particular thing I
want to achieve I have no idea how to
read receive a text message as a web
service but somebody else had built me
that library already I had a particular
use case my use case was I have a github
repository with a map in it and I have
somebody who wants to send messages and
I want to put those two together that
was my that was the thing I was trying
to build and I think this should be the
same with research as well horn honking
one on one that I think the issue was
science especially astronomy is Big Data
chopped right and so like Jim Gray
worked out this for years was was was
fond of saying you know that sneakernet
still was you know doing better than
internet at delivering astronomy data
for really big data so I mean
fundamentally sharing the source code is
fine yeah but but but really you know
when you're collecting all this data a
lot of what the scientists wanted to
share the data so they can run their
different experiments show me different
sort let me difference the same Dana
different programs yep or sharing the
programs is great but but fundamentally
they need to share the date yeah so so
how do you certain see get you know
interacting with so the whole big data
movement which you know every science is
generating tons and tons of Nevada it's
easier but they were biologist or
astronomer yes easier to store yeah so I
mean gif does not help you in any way
with data I mean get not have an
appropriate technology for that but I
think they open how are you you know
because a program when you execute them
is the source code plus amendments
shilts and so you know having you know I
understand that's outside of github but
to make to make this really work for
science seems like you eat so the month
around the day yes there's a bunch of
people working on like solutions that do
this and so the I would say the there's
a collection of implementation
that are have varying likelihoods of
successes i would say in my opinion the
the you know and like research work
flows that are executable that try and
combine compute with data with some kind
of version of and provenance capture of
the software that you're executing um
the kind of current breed do something
pretty pretty smart i think where they
are insist on you know referenceable and
accessible data stores so you've got you
know where are you i'm in my computer
environment okay well here's some
abstraction of what it looks like to run
a workflow but where do those resources
come from and the resources can be
referenced as like a binary at URL or a
git repository or so you know people are
basically programming solutions together
typically where they're referencing you
know some of the software might be on
github the data might be local or it
might be an API that they're querying I
mean that's sort of a I mean in LSST the
data sets are projected to be I mean I
know Moore's law and what a blue people
is kind of not wise to argue against
that but i think the I I don't foresee
people hosting 50 petabytes of data on
their laptop in six years time I mean I
think we can work that out that's not
know I mean so people aren't going to do
this locally so LSST they have already
kind of got a model where there's going
to be a few centers where people I think
one is a ncsa where they're going to
have like a large probably virtualized
compute environment where you could run
your computer so the opportunity here is
not I mean so I agree that data and get
on our only a piece of the problem made
a separation I'd like you there are
other web services that provide bill
like you don't provide build a service
first right you've never you've never
been in the business providing other
tooling other than sort of your value
add for collaboration yep I'm not spin
many phones yeah yes sir now there's
what for pylon about the astronomy is an
interesting example okay
because with the LHC with LSST the
notion that he needed to devote a not
insignificant amount of the funding of
the project to figure out how you
distribute the data right is unique yes
it does not happen another domain right
and Jim Gray was talking about this a
long time ago and yes it's now I think
getting to the point where that notion
of the expectation of the funding agency
that you will share the data yeah Evan
sold how you pay for it yeah where it
goes and how that sustained yeah but
that is sort of coming to fruition and
it's now I think that leading to be okay
then yeah what happens when we get to an
environment whenever be sure and data
what do we do with it there's another
butter length trailer code we know it
though right what the one eventually is
to say stop writing your software from
scratch the data exists here's the
framework for which you develop your
algorithms and stop translating from 17
different formats he's spending your
friends 25 years right leverage a
framework working on one of the working
on a system that big support right and
so I know I mean I and this for me is
the opportunity with we're not
everyone's producing their own data and
it's not feasible to host your own copy
of the data you're not gonna build your
analysis t you're probably not going to
have your own copy of the data so but
the first I don't know if you're
thinking about like a standard data
reduction ninety ninety-five percent of
the operations that you perform on those
data are not actually unique Lee your
contribution they're just like the
legwork some massaging of the data some
probably quite primitive analysis before
you do the bit that's the actual
academic contribution and so this is
where I think research has an
opportunity to learn from open source
like the the software that you are
writing as an academic should not be the
whole kind of pipeline it should be
somebody like the data reduction
pipeline should be there and your value
add should be in your academic
contribution should be the you know the
the five percent on the top but that's
not where we are today so so
if that's something where we want to get
to like how do we even make that you
know not many people are doing it today
hat what are the what are the
significant barriers to actually making
that behavior both are possible and and
in fact normal so I think I think the
first one is is credit like as an
academic today i right you know you
would write a paper and you would get
credit and the mechanisms were rewarding
that IE tenure a professorship are
understood but this Adler was goes you
know just down the road and you dub this
is a huge la launch I was going to say
party but I don't think it was a party
it was an event for that there's a co
funded program between the morn sloan
foundations to build kind of where the s
the assertion is that kind of data
science is the bridge between lots of
both computationally and data rich
domains where your methods are kind of
key and to 2 the domain and the fact
that there's lots of you know the
environment we exist in today in
universities kind of the culture that we
have is that you know people who build
tools people who write software don't
actually get academic or equitable
credit for that kind of behavior and so
when you're looking at something like
this this tool has come out of the tides
Browns lab then you know they go to
enormous lengths to point out that you
should be citing them for this work
they've both um yeah it's in capitals
because that's I guess they're shouting
at us but you know there's a there's a
file called citation which basically
says like this is a piece of research
software this is it do I this is how you
can reference it you should cite this
this is scientific software we go back
to that Astro pie project I was showing
the contribution graph one before this
is add 75 contributors this is a project
that's being built by you know fairly
early career postdocs they've got
something like they're pretty healthy
guy on project they've got nearly 200
Forks a couple of hundred stars they
they actually wrote a I think a paper
about about this project if you look
there's a badge I think this is the
Python package index will give you
you like this flower budge you know it's
had 32 thousand downloads in the last
month this piece of software it's
basically used by pretty much all
astronomers worldwide and yet the paper
about this project has had where are we
looking 28 citations right so there's
something going wrong here right so but
this is the only really established way
to collect career points right now is to
write a paper about the code but but
there's a David de novo kind of nailed
this when when he said that you know
publishing a paper is just about code is
just advertising the actual scholarship
in in scientific software is really
often actually in the source code not in
the PDF that you choose to share so you
know these are significant numbers these
are significant measures of reuse
forking starring number of people
watching something but right now we
don't have a established there are
people who are pushing on this is called
altmetrics but there isn't an
established recognized recognized by
tenure committee way of valuing are
giving a value metric concert to this
these kind of open contributions that we
see here so so I encourage you to look
at some of the altmetric stuff if you if
you're interested so this feels very
appropriate to be putting this slide up
here but i think you know as research
becomes more data intensive as we're
moving into this domain of you know
methods and the tools that we build are
becoming more and more key to actually
doing any research then there's a great
talk by later called victorious stub
who's a Stanford who she talked about
this crisis and reproducibility how we
are becoming as more and more of our
scholarly activities are encoded in
software and this actually isn't
published typically then we are becoming
less and less reproducible as a domain
this is my XKCD summary of her talk as
we get more and data intensive we become
less reproducible I think I've never
shown her there's hopefully she wouldn't
be too offended it's an excellent talk
so so you know what are barriers so
credit is a big barrier I think Trust is
a barrier I think people are both scared
of sharing but also like how do I
do I trust somebody's software I mean
yeah when I went and downloaded that
Ruby library to do SMS parsing it's
called twilio Lou Ruby like something
about this number made me think it was
probably okay you know six hundred
thousand downloads I mean I don't assume
that everyone's you know I think that's
that's got some some value that number
but you know deeper than that I can
actually go and look at the code
obviously if I really care i can go and
read the source code and and you know i
can go and get a code climate measure i
can see that they were at least written
some tests or hopefully they have i can
go and see those tests executing i can
gain confidence with that and i can
actually go and see you know what code
climate says about you know churn and
quality of quality of what they're
writing so you know this tools and ways
and means that we could do that and i
think there's chef party yeah so these
are all third-party to the gray shins
here parties okay yes so can you just
say a little more about the code the
next one so the code climate yeah so
this is um I'll they look at blue build
test how they don't do they don't do see
I so this is travis CI I said all of
these trevisan Travis so Travis doesn't
see I co climate does like method length
kind of duplication I think it does I
mean I forget what the I think it looks
at churn as well as but it tries to give
you a tricycle your score so this is
nearly green is pretty good I think four
is a more stereo bus yeah yeah yeah yeah
so you know these are all these are all
things that can give me confidence but
there's also a serious problem with
academic software and more generally and
more kind of niche domains where you
know you're lucky if you're working in a
kind of a widely adopted field where
there's a standard we're publishing if
you write a ruby gem which is kind of de
facto way of packaging up some
functionality in a library you put it on
rubygems this is where you find these
things I mean most people who have got a
shipping shipping rubygems are
publishing them here so there's a kind
of a de facto place to go and get them
but discoverability is hard i think in
academic domains until you you know
knowing that somebody's
written software similar to us is a
serious problem but in truth I think you
know most of the barriers that we have
our cultural and not technical they are
about like how academia works not that
there aren't tools to service the needs
of academia so for academic audiences I
kind of encourage them to think about
what they can do today and I think I you
know there's a kind of wisdom again
coming from some people now that we
should just stop talking about kind of
open science and just start doing it and
see where it breaks and where it works
and where it doesn't work and so when
people are sharing I kind of encourage
them to think about why are they sharing
because they want credit are they
sharing because they're trying to create
an open source community they're trying
to get collaboration happening online I
think this is a really important
question but I think you know the
general message for for research
communities we want to try sharing a bit
more often but if you if you are doing
that then certainly put a damn license
on it because that matters so we we we
put it give a lot of prominence to this
on on github and also that you know
documentation matters because the the
sharing story I want to tell in the
future is not this is that there's like
this step first which is some git clone
of you know the latest the latest
version of that bad pixel must because
that's the kind of the kind of thing
that's still lasting with me a decade
after writing that thing so when it
comes to telescopes like alice st i
think the open data argument is the
absolute least we can do you know
there's so much more in terms of
opportunity and this is not this is not
about open science this is actually
about accelerating how science happens
so that is me thanks
NIH yep example with the see a star see
a big sea of course he whatever yeah do
you have any metrics on how well how we
used the various components in the
framework work I remember folks working
on that right 10 or 10 years ago right
on but i believe the culture of shifted
significantly in 10 years so in terms
old actually use all mandating cherry
people's willingness to share from the
bottom up as opposed to in compliance
with me yeah I I mean my understanding
so I thought so I mean three years ago I
was writing grants to the NSF and and
there was this data management plan that
you had to ride right and you still do
um and I yeah and wait for someone to
have an implementation of something to
manage data views right and yeah i think
the my understanding is that only in the
last six months has anybody not got a
grant because of what they wrote in
their data management but i mean you
could write i'm gonna write a ton
of software pardon my french and then
i'm gonna burn it all at the end like
i'm not going to do i'm not going to
share it with anyone and if that was
okay you just had to say what you were
going to do so that's NSF and i'd still
believe that you can say this is going
to be a close source project like
because we want to write ton of papers
and we're not we're in competition with
i mean i think that would be people be
like really is that like you really
going to do that but you know it would
certainly be better to say this will be
open source and open data I think that's
yeah or some kind of embargo is um NIH
by understanding is quite a long way
ahead of that in that there's you know I
mean it's still I mean I think it's
still more of a mandate than me i was at
an nih event a few weeks ago and Phil
Bourne who's the new duh forget yeah
director of data science is there to
affect cultural change right because so
and his joke is well what do I do in my
second week but I think that's a serious
challenge like
actually so yeah I don't I don't know
that's very long-winded way of saying I
don't know what but I know there are
there's definitely in the u.s. there's a
difference at the agency level as to
whether they're just asking for you to
say what you're going to do or saying
you have to adhere to this policy or is
increasingly with the US team over yeah
you're I mean the White House said you
have to write and then there's
legislation in committee this week yeah
to put that into more effect be the
expectation is still turning now or is
turning now to you will make your data
available unless and there unless you've
got some yeah human subjects data etc
etc right what is unclear is how the age
of them is comply with that when it's
effectively an unfunded mandate what yes
they need to make me shared ones you
have to lose funding this house it means
estate which is an opportunity right or
you know people with cloud problems
can you talk briefly when getting back
to what you're talking about with
getting credit for code talk briefly
about the project that you did well sure
picture and how that's how that's going
right now yeah so um so we are going to
show you something but I don't think
that's very good idea cuz I I don't know
what I would show you how it's going to
go to a web browser so um so right now
you know there's a growing movement to
make more things in there called
research objects so things in a research
portfolio that you might want to cite so
you know the idea being that you might
want to cite a data set or you might
want to cite a piece of software or
maybe even just a figure from somebody
else's work or something and so there's
a some services one called fig shares
dryad there's a note oh there's a bunch
of organizations that are taking on the
burden of I guest-hosting data and
giving some kind of guarantee of its
preservation and then issuing these
things called do I so document object
identifies and these are basically a bit
like a kind of a bit ly URL but not not
HTTP there are you know there are a
referenceable string that are you can
use you can cite and use these these
these do is to reference something
that's that's those here maybe it's a
paper maybe it's a piece of code so just
over the last couple of months been
working a little bit with the mozilla
science lab and fig share amazon odo who
a couple of these archiver's and we
basically made it really easy to get a
DOI for a github repository so both
archives the repository just gluing
together a couple of API so there's
actually not been much code written on
the github side but more just making
sure that those groups were kind of
walked through kind of how to integrate
and yeah so there's I think some of you
are saying about 2,000 pieces of
software have had a DOI issued for them
now across the two services which is
pretty neat and yeah and I hear that
they're all like that like credible
pieces of research software that you
would actually really
12 you know site I mean right now a good
example for me would be in cosmology if
you want to there's a piece of software
called gadget which is used for
simulating you know making your own
universe in your computer and this thing
is on some guy's website you know you
download a tarball and he says you know
please cite me like this and use this
URL but it's you know if he leaves that
university and that web space goes away
a whole bunch of people are just not
going to be able to if that was where
