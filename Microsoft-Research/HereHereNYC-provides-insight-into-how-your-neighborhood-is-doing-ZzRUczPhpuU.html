project here here in New York City to
give you a sense of my background I used
to make games and here here's research
question is looking at the impact of
using social mechanics and character
design as a way to drive engagement with
data and the data set that we're using
is New York City's 311 non-emergency
data set so those are things like any
resident giving a phone call sending an
email or texting when a street lights
out or fire hydrants running so we take
that data on a daily basis and we
generate opinionated status updates for
all the neighborhoods across the thigh
boroughs of New York City so those are
things that end up looking like the
upper west side today is feeling
delighted because there's no dust
complaints no reports of a fire alarm or
highway concerns which means that they
probably had some of those things
recently and we'll also give you some
contextual information so the biggest
issue for the Upper West Side a year ago
today was a high of 18 heating
complaints and then we also linked you
to the community boards for your
neighborhood right in the interface now
the primary way that users will interact
with this is by subscribing to a daily
email summary or by following one of the
neighborhoods Twitter feeds and sort of
getting that information in the flow of
their day we're trying to drive light
engagement and create new rituals around
connecting to data on a daily basis so
we also generate awards or superlatives
or a leaderboard if you will for the
neighborhoods so today the Upper West
Side is the most adamant humanitarian
and you can see some of the other ones
biggest health public health advocate
biggest trash talker greatest animal
defender they're basically procedurally
generated cartoons based on data and
they're kind of fun but what we're
hoping to do is by optimizing them for
sharing is to start conversations about
those things because under the hood
they're pretty serious there are things
like the neighborhood that has the most
complaints around recycling litter trash
that sort of thing and perhaps that data
needs to be contested or maybe there's
efforts that are happening already in
the communities to deal with those
things what we're hoping to do is jump
start a conversation around that so to
give you a sense of how this is working
under the hood project sentient data
is a server and rest api that allows you
to create a character that cares about
any set of data streams so as an example
are 42 neighborhoods in New York City
are each different characters with
different personalities and they care
about around 120 different types of data
on a daily basis so South East Bronx is
one example and one of the measures or
data types that it cares about are the
rodent reports for the South East Bronx
and in fact that character has a desired
state for it to be one or below the
rodent reports on a daily basis we also
can assign it a personality we have a
set of default personalities that we can
assign or you can design your own and
then based on the pace trend in position
of the data we have a new calculated
emotion so when it's one or below it
might be feeling glad or content and
then as it's trending up it might get
suspicious or feel desperate or
impatient that sort of thing basically
the system enables you to use any sort
of data stream whether it's Internet of
Things network data streams data feeds
from api's but really what we're trying
to do is enable to you to use character
design as a way to drive new forms of
interaction around that data this is
project sentient data and I'm Katie
London thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
