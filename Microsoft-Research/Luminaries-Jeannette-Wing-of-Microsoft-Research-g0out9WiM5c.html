tell us a little bit about your
background you have a very strong
academic background yes i was at kearney
mellon university for over 27 years
where I was department head twice and
before that I was actually at the
University of Southern California for
two years and I got all my degrees at
MIT so I had been in academia for
basically my whole career my whole
professional life I did have a stint at
the National Science Foundation for
three years and that exposed me to how
DC really works and what was a path that
led you here to Microsoft well I I have
always had friends at Microsoft
certainly Rick Rashid was at Carnegie
Mellon when I was a very young faculty
member and I saw him be swooped up by
Microsoft to start microsoft research
and i have watched from afar in academia
of how Microsoft Research grew up over
the 22 23 years now and so I've always
been a friend of Microsoft and also I
myself spent a sabbatical at microsoft
research in 2002 2003 and I had a great
time and what were the things that
interested you most about microsoft
research well as a an academic as much
as a researcher myself there were two
areas of research that overlapped in in
my interest with Microsoft Research one
was the whole trustworthy computing
effort that was going on and that
started with Bill Gates 2001 memo and in
fact that's what brought me to microsoft
research in 2002 2003 because i read
that memo and i said well what does
trustworthy computing really mean and i
figured the only way I'm going to find
out is if i come to microsoft research
and work within microsoft research to
find out what to you
she really means and the other area of
interest research interests at overlap
is actually the group that hosted me was
run by Jamal eros it was the software
productivity tools group or something
like that spt and at the time they were
showing how formal methods which is my
first research area of interest in terms
of humor improving and model checking
and static analysis could be used in
practice to scale and it was the heyday
of the slam project and I was very lucky
I felt very lucky to be here when all of
that tech transfer was happening between
Microsoft Research and the rest of the
company what is computational thinking
computational thinking is the thought
processes for formulating a problem and
expressing a solution to that problem in
a way that a computer a human or a
machine can effectively carry out now
that's quite a mouthful of a definition
and I used words like effectively
solution problem expressing quite
carefully because there are technical
meanings to those terms but let me put
it more simply I like to think of
computational thinking as just the
thought processes that a computer
scientist would use in solving a problem
and that begs the question of what are
those ways a computer scientists
approaches problem solving and many of
the ways that we learn in computer
science just you know the concepts but
the most important thought process that
all computer scientists use in problem
solving is abstraction the ability to
ignore all the irrelevant complex
details of the problem at hand and look
at a higher level of what are the
11th parts of the problem that I need to
tackle that I need to address and the
ability to decompose a problem into
smaller pieces solve the smaller pieces
and put together a solution to the whole
problem by putting together the
solutions of the smaller pieces those
kinds of come think thought processes of
abstraction decomposition composition
are the bread and butter techniques of a
computer scientist kind of on a
day-to-day basis and I strongly believe
that anyone and everyone can learn these
concepts and learn and how to use them
and apply them in daily life at what age
is it appropriate for a child to begin
thinking this way and how does one
become better at computational thinking
well I have been advocating that
computational thinking is for everyone
and I think that already from the
undergraduate programs through graduate
programs and beyond people have already
embraced the importance of computational
thinking so now the challenge is to
address the K through 12 level now what
would it mean to teach a kindergartner
what computer science is and what good
computing can do for him or her when
you're five years old on and I I think
that's still an interesting research
question not just for computer
scientists in fact but I would challenge
the education scientists the cognitive
scientists the learning science test to
ask the question what kind of computing
concepts would make sense to teach to a
kindergartner and I think they're
actually already programs out there that
address that question so for instance
there's a program out there are called
CS unplugged which is teaching little
kids all about computer science without
a computer and so for instance you can
teach a sorting algorithm by lining up a
whole bunch of kids and you know telling
them they need to be sorted in a
particular way and maybe they discover
how to sort themselves you know like the
height of the the children and maybe
they discover on their own a particular
sorting algorithm and then you can ask
is there a more efficient way you know
and so they can actually discover on
their own the different kinds of sorting
algorithms interesting so this might
date me but I remember when I was a
child reading stories about how big a
computational problem DNA sequencing was
for example and that it might not even
be done in my lifetime and in hindsight
that's kind of laughable what are the
big problems that we're facing today
what are the big data problems that that
are the equivalent of that well the big
data is clearly a buzzword these days
and I think that certainly every sector
every science every engineering
discipline every you know professional
sector when I say sector law medicine
humanities and then all the science is
astronomy biology and so on they are
facing this big data problem in in terms
of generating lots of data with say
scientific instruments like the Large
Hadron Collider collecting lots of data
through sensors so we've got a sensor
nets that's banned the globe all in real
time collecting lots of data and then
processing all this data and then
generating a metadata on top of that
and you can imagine and that's just a
4-1 scientific discipline now you'd like
to put it all together you'd like a
different strip in principle you'd like
all these streams of data to come
together and all of us to make some
sense out of it and I like to talk about
not just big data but I like to talk
about from data to knowledge to action
so from all this data which is just a
lot of bits you'd like to actually
extract some interesting information
some knowledge some semantics from this
data and then from the representation of
that knowledge and it's usually going to
be visual a human being or some BOTS
eventually we'll make a decision make an
intelligent decision on that knowledge
so the one example is if we look at some
work for instance being done at
Microsoft Research in climate modeling
we've got lots of data that different
government agencies collect in terms of
weather and soil and you know air and
wind and so on imagine all of this data
being put together in a way that we can
predict what when to plant what crop so
we have the capability we have this
information information sources and in
the end you want someone to make that
decision you know we need to plant more
soybeans here at this time of year arm
in this region and and and so that's
where we're going with the big data now
right now we're we're so consumed with
the big data part we're forgetting that
what we really want is data to knowledge
to action
so bye-bye my saying we're so consumed
by the big data part I mean that we're
thinking all this data we have to store
all this data we have to process all
this data but in the end you want to
represent the knowledge that's inherent
in all the bits in a way that a human
being in the end will make some
intelligent decision and so we're I
think where we're going I think we're
very conservative big data now but I
think any very soon we'll start talking
talking more about intelligent decision
making or visualization of this data so
that mere human beings can make these
decisions can actually act on the
knowledge that's represented by the data
pretty standard for executives to to
rave about the talent under them but you
know we also like metrics so if I
challenge you and say you know prove it
what what are the things that you tell
me about the researchers at MSR
microsoft research has a stellar
academic reputation and one of the
standard metrics whether we like it or
not in terms of evaluating the quality
of research coming out of an
organization or the quality of the
researchers who produce the research is
of course publications and Microsoft
Research Microsoft researchers are way
up there in terms of conference in
journal publications in the highest
quality venues that's one metric it's a
stand-in actually for what I think is a
more important metric in research but
harder to quantify which is the impact
of a person's research at the impact of
an organization's research there again I
still think that Microsoft Research
partly by the sheer size of Microsoft's
urges of organization has had a
tremendous impact on the advances of
science one of the groups within MSR is
the rise team have been very active in
the developer community and they've
created and released some amazing tools
what's the value of that group to ms are
tremendous so the rise team has had
tremendous value both to microsoft
research but also to the entire
developer community so i am quite
familiar with the rise the kind of work
that rise does because that's actually
my home research area in formal methods
and software engineering in programming
languages and I just have to share with
you one story because I know one of the
great contributions that rise has made
for the developer developer community
has been the code contracts and if you
look at what you would write in one of
those contracts it would be requires
clauses and ensures clauses which are
the equivalent of pre and post
conditions and in my very own PhD thesis
you will see requires and ensures in the
specification language that I actually
defined in my own thesis work and that
wasn't new to me that was the kind of
informal specifications we were actually
asking undergraduates said MIT to use in
the software engineering course that I
was a TA for so way back in decades ago
we were writing requires insurers closet
clauses we didn't have tools support the
way you know the rice group has provided
for developers so we've come a long way
but let me let me speak more
specifically to the benefit of the rise
group for both microsoft research and
the developer community first of all
they really are world-class in terms of
advancing
all the research areas i mentioned in
terms of formal methods and programming
languages static and dynamic analysis
testing verification specification and
tool support their of all and the one of
the things that really impresses me
about the rise tool set is that they
really build on each other so you have
like z3 as this constraint solver on the
bottom which is the core state of the
art you know if your improver and all
these tools that sit on top and work
together it's really impressive that
this one team has put this all together
and all of that is made available to the
developer community and the developer
community at the same time has been able
to inspire the rise community the rise
team to work on research problems that I
don't think they would have thought of
had it not been for the feedback they
got from the developers what are some of
your favorite projects at MSR Mike one
of my current favorites is actually the
the world wide telescope to geo flow
example and before I explain why that's
before I explain that favorite I want to
tell you why it's one of my favorites
and when I talk about research and
computer science I like to talk about
both the drivers of the questions
researchers asked in computer science
and also as I mentioned earlier the
impact that one can have in doing
research in computer science so I'd like
to talk about science drivers technology
drivers and societal drivers so there
are deep science questions that
researchers in computer science asked
they asked questions like what is
computable you know is this problem even
solvable by a computer those kinds of
deep questions continue to intrigue
theoretical computer scientists and as
the nature of what a computer is change
is we have to reassess it's clear as
technology advances we again have old
questions that we have to ask again
because they're going to be new answers
and new questions to ask and then I
think what's really new in the field of
computing or at least recently is what I
call societal drivers the societal grand
challenges like health care energy
transportation education that require
advances the computer science to
actually help solve the problems in
their sectors and I believe that
advances of computer science can
actually transform the very conduct of
these other professions so in healthcare
for instance I really believe that if we
were far out thinking in terms of where
this country or world that where the
world could be in terms of personalized
medicine and so on to achieve that
vision we are going to need advances of
computer science so I think now of
instead of science technology and
society as being drivers of computer
science research I think they are also
measures of how much impact we have had
as a field we have through our research
advanced science certainly our
understanding of computer science but
other sciences as well again biology
chemistry material science astronomy and
also through our research we have
certainly had an impact on technology
just look at Microsoft look at all the
Microsoft products and services and
devices that we sell to our customers a
lot of the technology rests on advances
that we have made in research and then
finally their society and I like to
think that through our reach
through our customers that we reach
through our technology we certainly
affect society in a very direct manner
so getting back to the stories you asked
me one of the reasons i like the world
wide telescope story is it started as a
pure science research story not even
computer science it was about the store
zito of the galaxies and you know what
might even questioned what why was why
was that research going on in microsoft
research but it was going on anyway and
so and of course it had to do with big
data in some sense and so all of a
sudden not all of a sudden but over time
the research technology the research
ideas the ability to scale to the data
that the world wide telescope needed to
handle the ability for citizen
scientists to actually contribute all
that technology could actually have a
very important and interesting
application in excel through power map
and and now through this plug-in people
can look at crime statistics in Chicago
and policymakers can make intelligent
decisions based on the visualization
that comes out of all this data packaged
in a way that again from data to
knowledge to decision affect society so
this is my science technology society
story another example along those lines
is some work that's more recently being
done on urban computing so this is work
one example of this is is work called
you air that you Jang our new new TR 35
fellow from msra has been promoting on
the ideas again taking lots of different
data sources whether it's weather
road conditions their points of interest
in a city the human mobility patterns
and putting all these data streams
together along with the few sensors that
for instance are in Beijing putting all
the sensor data together to figure out
what is the air quality of not the city
but the street that I live on in this
city and so this is an example of
multiple data streams coming together
using machine learning and other data
analytics algorithms to convey to the
beer user but also to policymakers
information that people can use to
decide well should I take this route to
work should I go to the park because
maybe there's too much pollution out
there and the air will be bad or for a
policymaker to decide maybe we should
actually focus on this particular
neighborhood to improve the air quality
because of the the the readings that we
have from all this data so that's so
that urban computing example is again
you know science technology and society
kind of coming together so that's
another exam there are a lot of really
fun things going on on there's I mean I
can talk oh I don't have any stories do
you want I could talk IV for instance I
was just at Microsoft Research Asia a
couple weeks ago and they were showing
me that our newest work on hair modeling
so it turns out that if you try to model
the human being you know people work
hope worked really hard and modeling the
face down to the level of you know the
pores in the skin but it's really really
hard to model hair I'm so if you look at
a lot of the state of the yard you'll
see these heads without hair
because it's much easier to model the
skin the eyebrows and so on I mean the
eyes and so on but you won't see the
hair so what the these researchers have
been doing is actually a tackling that
problem and their most recent work is
actually to add a little dynamic so now
you can see the hair like blowing in the
wind so there are like fun things that
that our researchers work on as well
what's going to surprise us in the
future if I told you it wouldn't be a
surprise I think one of the areas that I
see a lot of research in right now a lot
of interest by the consumer and where
we're going is in what Microsoft like
likes to call natural user interfaces I
think that we have already been seeing
our ability to get rid of the mouse and
maybe the keyboard at least the physical
one and I think with speech input with
gesture in terms of interacting with
devices we are going to more naturally
interact with devices with services and
then of course with each other thank you
so much for talking to us today Jenna
