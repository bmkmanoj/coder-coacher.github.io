hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
welcome to Microsoft Research my name is
Mary gray and I'm a senior researcher
here like what am i what am I and it is
my absolute pleasure to introduce our
cloakroom speaker Dorothea Klein she's a
senior lecturer at the University of
London and she's going to talk with us
today about her field work which is
available in book form fantastic book
there's one more up here just a hawker
book for her so please join me in
welcoming der Thea thanks Mary for the
invite and it's a great pleasure to be
here there's some people that I met
before at different talks here in
Cambridge and a different other occasion
and it's lovely to kind of see you again
and I'm sort of got a vague idea that's
because we have some common interests
and I want to hear a lot about that so
serene question I will I can't whine on
that's on online okay can you hear me
yeah that's good okay removed my cup
okay right hopefully you can hear me
yeah and they can just fiddle with about
fiddle with the sound yeah fair enough
i'll do the Queen's lecture theatre
voice which is our biggest lecture
theatre so I'll project okay talking
about the Queen's lectris theater okay
so Royal Holloway is part of the
University of London so that's the
college that I work at where we have a
center in ict4d which means information
communication technologies for
development so that's kind of our group
of people
and I thought I'd give you just a quick
overview what we do before I go into my
specific work in my specific study and
so we've basically a groove people ten
PhD 11 staff who are in different
disciplines including geography
management and computer science and we
work on subfields like this access
illiteracy government participation so
on and stakeholders very broadly
multi-stakeholder as well and these are
some themes that we work with for this
talk in particular you'll find themes
such as value sensitive design and
gender in particular coming up so that
just gives you an idea of the breadth of
work that's going on if you want to find
out more we've got here I see for DC is
our website and this basically brings
together blog post from our members and
the kind of Twitter feeds from different
members and no information about our
events and so on so if you're interested
in the breadth of what we're doing
that's what you might want to consider
also give you an idea how we link to
business because we're right here at
Microsoft it's basically we work with
business on research projects we have
collaborative work on studentships
masters and PhDs we have some sponsored
scholarships and particularly for
students in the global south we do
consultancy but we also do short courses
for business and particularly
methodological courses as well and
there's a master's program that we run
about which is in sustainable
development so it brings together
environmental and development aspects
and there's a specialism in that which
is on ICT and development if any of that
is of interest to you there's like some
flyers at the back as you go out and
just pick up some stuff
this is my own kind of research universe
at the moment quick quack capture there
I think that's possibly true for many
academics that they struggle to have it
all captured in just one bubble so my
bubbles is like two bubbles and the Hat
so the Hat is the line capabilities
approach to human development and
well-being I'll talk a little bit about
those theoretical foundations and then
specifically I use this in the area of
ethical consumption fair trade also
ethical design and in ict4d this is part
of the sort of theoretical framework
where I kind of come from which is
theoretically is not neutral this is
kind of a starting point it might be
something that's incredibly obvious to
colleagues in the round but not not to
all audiences that I work with so
castells for example talks about her
technology is society and how society
and technology designed to related
Lawrence Lessig up the road is talking
about how norms and values are written
into code and do this vise men coming
talking from a gendered perspective is
talking about how people's access to the
Internet is mediated by Framing
institutions with specific norms and
expectations and as I go through some of
the work in the study you'll kind of see
some of these things echoing again so
I've already pointed out how ict4d
relates to the D is basically
development but sometimes it's really
difficult to define what we mean by
development we get asked that a lot what
do you mean by development often it's
equated week with economic growth and
that's specifically not the area that I
kind of stand-in so what I'd like you to
think about just for a moment is what
you personally value most tomorrow I'm
not going to ask people to kind of
disclose I'm just kind of think about a
moment what you value most
most of you will have thought about
something other than economic resources
as in pots of loads and loads of money
loads and loads of money usually gets
you to what you want to do and you may
have thought about you know having sort
of exciting lives you might have thought
about travel you might have thought
about more meaningful relationships with
people whatever is kind of your
aspiration it might be a fantastic
career but fundamentally economic
resources just form a means to that end
and one of the things we get wrong when
we think in development studies about
equating development with growth is that
we mix up means and ends we're not
thinking about economic growth just as a
mean to give people richer lives and
allowing them to and basically have
choices so what I argue in the book is
basically that we need to move from an
econo centric view to a more holistic
view of development from a linear view
to a more systemic view top-down
approaches to the more kind of
dialogical view including lots of
participation and participatory
approaches and also we need to get away
from an environment where in sort of ICT
and development we often have a tendency
to push down technology push it out into
a field to a space where we're actually
being led by users choices and demand by
users the approach that I'm using is the
capabilities approach which has been
formulated mainly by Amartya Sen
starting in the 70s and 80s and then
famously summarized in development as
freedom in 1999 and it's also there's a
variation of that of the capabilities
approach which is also put forward by
Martin Nussbaum but I follow largely a
march SN on this so for March SN
development can be seen as a process of
expanding the real freedoms that people
enjoy focusing specifically on
substantive freedoms
of the people to lead the lives they
have reason to value and to enhance the
real choices they have so we here
talking about an expansion of real and
meaningful choice capabilities for those
of you are specifically interested in
the terminology capabilities are things
that people have reason to value doing
or being guess one of my critiques with
the capabilities approach is that it
uses a particular kind of language that
may or may not be helpful in translation
but what I kind of emphasize in my work
is freedom and choice meaningful choices
the point is that the capabilities
approach is currently the most
influential alternative to econo centric
versions of development and this
basically gives us a great way in to
thinking about development differently
in the capabilities approach we think
about the agent differently we think
about the agent is someone who acts and
brings about change who's achievement
can be valued in terms of his own values
and objectives and that means that
there's a huge emphasis on participation
public debate democratic practice and
empowerment in the sense of actually
people having agency to shape the spaces
that they're there operating in having
choices really meaningful choices and
control over their lives and that is in
itself a development outcome in the
capabilities approach so real freedoms
are central it's important to recognize
these individual differences that people
might have which means that the same set
of resources means different things to
different people and different
activities can give rise to happiness to
different people there's not just met
realistic but also non-materialistic
factors and there is also a concern for
distribution but not based on the simple
idea that if everyone has got the same
resources that means the same thing for
everyone
so I'm giving you a lot of kind of the
theoretical background upfront before we
then go into the actual field study on
the ground which is the work that I did
in Chile for the operationalization of
the capabilities approached I will kind
of draw on work that specific in the
ict4d field and here this is basically
has been an ongoing journey so there's a
whole bunch of scholars we've been
trying to translate the capabilities
approach into the ict4d field and you
know I'm one of this kind of set of
scholars who are doing that translation
work this is kind of the way for me that
I translate some of this something that
I'm not going to go into in detail right
now i'll do it in detail once i actually
have a case study to lead you back to it
okay but broadly and basically
identifying classic sociology form
identifying that there's agency and
structure i'm identifying that there's
different elements of structure and
different resources that people might
have so there might be some researchers
such as financial resources and material
resources but then also some more non
material resources such as psychological
resources information and social
resources people individual agents use
those resources to navigate a structure
to have those choices different degrees
of choice to achieve those development
outcomes which they themselves have
defined and if they achieve those
outcomes that actually then impacts on
their agency and it impacts on
structures as well if they act
collectively so there's broadly this is
a sort of a systemic systemic map of
development processes the idea is that
it allows you to help deconstruct what
values are embedded if you understand
how the process works it's a mapping
tool for processes and it allows you to
hopefully design for choice
and I'll show you I'll try to show you
how to do that today especially this bit
and in other projects we've been also
pushing in this direction so this study
this was a study which basically
combined policy analysis at national
level with some work at the local level
as well come back to this slide the
study was on ICT policies and Gillian's
you can see this is the the cover of the
book before MIT press got hold of it and
actually did something rather clever
with a circuit board over it as well but
this is southern Chile for you it's a
country of basically 4,000 kilometres
extension north to south and it's vastly
beautiful but it poses some real
challenges in terms of Digital Inclusion
so some outline facts if you want so you
have with chili the country has
discussed a sort of a long stretch often
called a pencil at the southwest edge
south america 17 million inhabitants
continued economic growth comparatively
low levels of corruption very high
literacy level we're talking sort of
ninety-seven percent literacy across the
country and a good IT infrastructure and
that had to do with the fact that the
government decided to put a backbone
internet backbone north to south running
the whole length of the pencil which of
course helps tremendously with
connectivity so there's plenty of
potential for ICT assisted development
and as you can see this is a and I am I
tu graphic from 2002 which points out
how much in the in the IE readiness
statistics of the ITU Chile is kind of
standing out in Latin America at the
same time Chile is typically if you want
for South America suffering from high
levels of social
and also high levels of regional
inequality so that means that we're also
looking at a real risk for digital
divides along existing divides of for
example income but as we'll see also
along gender lines this was chilis a
kinetic detail and that's a that was a
policy framework which was leading not
just a mass in America but
internationally and that it actually
tried to bring together policy across a
whole set of different government
departments into basically one
streamlined ice ICT policy approach and
there was you know everything regulatory
framework infrastructure sort of
promoting use of icts and business
adapting the judicial norms accordingly
but then also trying to roll out a
network of info centers into every town
in Chile four different models they had
but specifically the model that I'll be
talking about with the model to actually
have and free set of free access
internet points computers in libraries
in particular these were state-funded
meant that people could get free access
there they could surf the web basically
sign up for half an hour internet use or
an hour's internet use and was
practically integrated into these
library points there was also policy
around egovernment lots of services were
being pushed online but specifically
also eprocurement the way that the state
buys goods and services were being
pushed online in a system called jus de
compra so in 2005 the state within about
six months basically shifted all their
their procurement to online procurement
and there was literacy training remember
I said 17 million Chileans as population
there was a literal
see training not just in all the schools
but also for half a million out of
school adults free at the point of
access and these kind of info centers so
it was an integrated policy to prepare
chili and chili ins for the digital age
the policy that was designed was
designed in a context like this this is
santiago central business district this
is the santiago underground you know
with Wi-Fi included this is way advanced
compared to the London Underground you
know nice Airy and Wi-Fi this is
santiago center an environment where you
know typical middle-class office workers
basically walking around with their
laptops stripped to them a discourse of
aspiration social aspiration linked to
learning english but also linked to
learning IT so there's a story here
about Santiago being very much a city
that sees itself as part of kind of the
sort of digital new age and very
successful here this is the part where
the policymakers basically work in the
seventh and two ninth floor you have the
direction of Chile compra the
e-procurement guys and they're based in
basically this center of santiago in
this kind of aspiring city so when I
then interviewed the deputy director he
told me this the important thing is that
people are proactive not interested in
doing better than others we have to
create the conditions and the tools in
which they can do that this has to do
with the economic model in which Chile
is developing itself it's the neoliberal
market economy in which the Lance's of
poll point in one direction so that the
most efficient will win so that was the
discourse of the policymakers they had a
clear vision here remember what I said
about sort of plurality of the
capabilities approach they weren't so
much into plurality
what they wanted was basically a you
know this was the this divorce of
direction of travel but they did worry
that there would be other people who
wouldn't keep up wouldn't be able to
keep up so the deputy director then went
on to also explain I believe that
essentially one has to invest much more
in education in the region as well
especially the world sphere how to
include it in the wagon of productivity
in the engine of development the same
time this is difficult because they're
also obviously the values of those
communities values that can be from
another planet-- even other spiritual
beliefs so his struggle was that they
would actually be also some some value
clashes in terms of his vision of the
new Chile which he assumed was a shared
one and the modern one and then people's
values in those dark ruled spaces that
were still out there in the country so
welcome to the dark world spaces in the
country this is eight hours in a on by
bus from Santiago in the south and the
village which I'll call a lagoon and
obviously I had to kind of anonymize the
whole field study but this is a place
with 30,000 inhabitants as you can see
public infrastructure including roads is
very limited funding is limited it's a
space where there's around 200
registered enterprises and probably
twice as many still that are operating
informally so just getting tax revenue
together as a challenge it's a space
however where when I started they were
45 for 30,000 inhabitants they were
already five cyber cafes and when'll a
year later I stopped my study there were
seven of them so there was this growth
of kind of private use of cyber cafes at
the same time you can see those two
mobile phone antennas already coming up
a third one was added by the time I left
I will just briefly go back to the
methods just to show you what happened
at the local level I had five months of
participant observation 92 interviews at
different stages across that year
basically five-month meant five months
in three rounds across one year we did
some media usage charts which I'll show
you basic social network analysis focus
groups one day survey transects of the
location in other words going through
the location having someone tell you the
story of different places mapping of the
local infrastructure monitoring the
prices for communications in particular
and member checking in other words
showing to your participants at the end
what your results were and roughly
getting an idea through different
methods whether they agree or not and
whether you got it wrong or what they
would like to add so this just to
continue the story this was a goon and
the infrastructure there shows that
there was a parallel universe of
different technologies happening the
same time there was also public
infrastructure problems for example here
the potholes in the road while at the
same time there was these quite
flourishing cyber cafes people would
have if you want material resources IT
equipment it sometimes in their living
room on display so this is very much
someone's living room you can see how
the television is integrated in that
space there's a printer there's the
computer and it's it's part of the
living room environment partly because
of lack of space but mainly also because
this is a status symbol and it's
integrated and it's shown off this is
the telecentre so this is the kind of
free access internet point where the
underlying goals of the policy were very
much
social inclusion allowing people to
access the Internet according to
principles of equal opportunity and
social inclusion there was free access
small free for printing etc but it was
miles away from a logic that telecentres
would forever at any point pay for
themselves this was very much
state-funded access to the Internet the
way that it was assumed that public
libraries would be free and accessed and
funded by the state it was in that
paradigm of thinking and it was in this
the space as well that free IT courses
were run guest and Zimmerman talk about
access is being dependent on
availability affordability and skills so
you know is is internet access available
is it affordable what is the skill set
that is needed but in the study it
became very clear that there were
actually also gendered norms of access
to to space and also gendered norms on
the use of people's time give you an
example so this was one of the cyber
cafes so I use this in my class or and
participant observation to just kind of
get people into the habit of looking so
what you can see here is that the
screens are basically turn inward you
can see how there's very little space to
actually go in and behind these kind of
computers so it makes it difficult for
any wheelchair users or people kind of
also have a stroller to navigate this
space you generally were looking at many
young guys using your space some people
also have other ages age groups but
particularly very few women go in there
and there was a variety of reasons but
also this was a space where as you can
see with the kind of scantily clad
youths on the beach in this corner here
represented in this coca-cola ad it was
a space that was kind of cool it was
also slightly masculinist it was
to space where well frankly if you
wanted to look at poor and you could
look at porn I'm not saying that that
was the main thing they were doing you
know he's kind of loading some sort of
game accessory here but that was also
fully part of the package now in
conservative southern Chile that's not a
space where a single woman really wants
to be I'm certainly not hanging out so
basically this is a also a space where
women would only come to effectively sit
on the lap of their boyfriend it
wouldn't come there on their own switch
over this is a very differently coded
space this is the telecenter and you can
see the screens are turned inwards and
immediately you can see how much on the
one hand how much openness that creates
how much the learning experience can be
that the telecenter director can help
you with whatever work you're doing but
you can also see the degree of social
control this guy for examples just
watching the what's on the on the other
screen there and in generally if you
were standing in line about here you
could get a rough overview basically
what everyone was doing there so it's
not really a space where for example you
wanted to look up sensitive health
issues or something like that online
what you can also see is how the
wheelchairs basically had space to come
in now in particularly women have space
to collaborate a lot of that was going
on where actually women would be
collaborating on work on on the on
screen and so if you contrast that with
here just physically a lot harder to do
this in this space so when we're talking
about sort of gendered norms of access
that is actually kind of happening in
these two spaces I'm not saying that one
is necessarily better I think there's
some real issues around privacy in this
space but it's really something that we
when we think about what kind of
technology we might design we also need
to think about the spaces of interaction
that are then happening this is a
another example so this is the info
center direct
to also welcoming the kind of kids of
one of the users in this space this is
about the use of time so in the
beginning it was difficult with the
women because the men come home in the
evening when things that the IT training
courses take a bit more time the men
come home and the foods not ready so we
told the women you go do all the
housework first and leave it ready and
then you come here there's an Maxine
Mullen yer has a wonderful distinction
between strategic and practical gender
interests and here what we're seeing
very much is that they're not pursuing a
kind of a revolutionary agenda of
actually changing the division of labor
in the household which would be
strategic tender interests but what
we're seeing is a very pragmatic
approach which is not rock the boat just
rearrange your time bid so in a sense
these are gendered norms in the use of
time that have been holding women back
from actually learning IT because of for
example the timing of the courses and
the info center directors aware but
she's basically not trying to tackle the
big stuff she's basically trying to work
with the existing social structures and
the existing gendered norms so I'd like
to introduce you to Marta you can see
I'm taking you all the way from the
national level down to the community
level down to the group level and I'm
now kind of town coming to the
individual so now welcome to Martha's
life martyr of course a made-up name
anonymized she's a single mom the head
of household she's got three kids to
look after and the grand mom she's on
low-income basic education but here's
her trump card she was a Nana a cook and
a maid in Santiago for several years and
therefore she's got excellent cooking
skills and what's possibly even more
important she knows how to present this
of give it fancy names and put it nicely
on plates so she's dreaming of things
like studying her
interim service or also work bringing
some women together to collectively
actually offer a party service she took
free IT courses at the info center and
she uses the internet in the info center
to research recipes to diversify her
production particularly she found some
recipes for diabetics and she's worked
out that in this little town increasing
number of people are getting older and
increasing number of people actually
have diabetic diabetes and so for she
needs to diversify her production so she
finds these recipes on the internet this
is the kind of classic or a story of the
ict4d world where basically someone uses
plain old information that they get from
the air from the internet and then use
it in a different context and dot dot
dot make money of it but the internet
was a much bigger deal for March or more
generally she also hopes to organize the
women so they can provide Jam for local
schools and hospitals and that means
that sooner or later she needs to work
out how the state buys goods and
services she needs he needs to engage
with this whole procurement side of
things problem is that she's never used
the procurement system to the compra in
2005 and that meanwhile also the
e-procurement system is now being used
to get get the product sourced from the
cheapest provider and this means that
they're regularly starting to source
their jam which Martha was hoping to
provide from a large distributor in
Santiago in a big package with other
food supplies and they basically offered
the lower lowest prices that was a big
distributor and this brought costs down
further local hospital which one side is
great it's not good news for the local
economy there's a whole section in the
book that then talks about what this
means if you open up the markets to
eprocurement and do this fairly quickly
what kind of effects this has for the
local economy and people like Marta
talking about people like Marta this
gives you an idea about her media usage
so you can see she's using her mobile
often on reception mode or through kind
of texting basically low-cost usage of
mobile there's no television or radio
fees in Chile so it's a one-off
investment to get a television and a
radio she's on a black-and-white
television but she hasn't bothered
changing programming quality ? and then
there's her internet use which is
entirely linked to the telecenter so she
lives fairly close by geographical
resources and actually can go to the
telecentre fairly easily on a daily
basis and she does this religiously so
that's worked this through in terms of
the choice framework so if we go water
would like more choices in terms of her
secondary choices yes she would
definitely like war and increased income
I'm collaborating with these other women
through better and more social
relationships she would probably also
like other things like easier
communication in particular with her
children who we are dispersed some of
them are at boarding school and
increased knowledge you know remember
her diabetic recipes and so on so she's
got these different outcomes that she
also pursues she's operating in a
structure in environment where there's a
discourse of the internet being
something amazing and something
game-changing and also an environment
where being left behind of these
technologies is a very horrible thing
you don't want to be left behind so
that's kind of part of this discourse
there's these policies and programs so
the telecentre kind of coming in the
Connecticut I'll kind of influencing
even her small town there are these
ongoing norms on the use
space and the use of time that are
affecting how people especially women in
this community live and there's classic
things about availabilities of iced teas
affordability of ice ice teas and the
skills that are needed her basic
education actually allows her to access
the internet and then we can look at her
agency position she's in her 50s she's
female and she's of the kind of general
kind of mestizo kind of Chilean
ethnicity and in terms of her resources
educational resources we know basic
education information well she's got a
set of information and she's building on
it terms of time because she's divorced
and she's sort of in charge of own
household she's got a degree of time
flexibility her financial resources are
very very limited geographical resources
she's doing okay she lives closer to
telecentre and in an environment where
it's okay for her to use those spaces
she can cross freely on the street there
are material resources say for example
her mobile handset and her television
that she can use in her radio but she
doesn't have a computer natural resource
is less relevant in this context
cultural resources let's say that's
leave that first side there's a
wonderful other example in the in the
book as well social resources she's
massively connected in this little
community like through this women's
group through knowing the info center
director through actually helping about
half the town out there half the town
out with producing the dough that people
need for empanadas basically she's kind
of the cheats kind of helper for half
the households in town because in an
environment where you don't get a free
frozen pizza very easily you kind of go
to martyr for the kind of the dough for
the empanada
to kind of speed up your you're cooking
um in terms of health it's a little bit
dodgy and then psychological resources
this is another area where she's got
loads this is a woman with masses of
tenacity who's come in the book I have a
chance to describe this in more detail
she's come through a lot of adversity
and she's got capacity to envision way
beyond what one might assume that she's
actually had in terms of her
experiencing small town probably helped
by the fact that she traveled to
Santiago as well for a while and got an
exposure to some of this so here it
becomes quite clear that isn't just
about material resources she's got these
kind of social and psychological
resources that really make a difference
for her so this means that she's using
these resources to navigate the
structure to achieve particular degrees
of choice so when it for example it
comes to using the telecentre she is
able to use what she's got to actually
navigate through the new program which
is this free telecentre to actually have
the know that there isn't there's this
choice existing that she knows that this
choice is there she uses this choice as
in the tell assent and the free internet
access and she achieves through the free
internet access finding out about for
example the diabetics recipe towards
increased knowledge or our mission
succeeded now the problem is if you do
the same thing for the e-procurement
thing the procurement program is being
introduced her material resources are
not such then she can basically compete
at scale so there might be a possibility
of this this choice of actually
competing there she's not aware of it
that she can actually use this
procurement system and frankly it stops
already there because if you are that
size you can't compete in this
particular market so at that point she
won't achieve through this e procurement
system her hope for result of increased
income
so what I've just done is effectively
map a particular case and a particular
set of circumstances onto a sort of a
systemic map of how the process would
work and also you can imagine how this
then feeds back with increased knowledge
then affecting her information levels
here and what she knows and in census
you can do so you get an idea about how
this is an ongoing systemic system
that's something I'm working on how to
then embed all of this into limited
ecological resources that we all share
that's kind of just a glimpse to the
future so to conclude we need to think
about development not as growth but its
freedom with people to live the lives
that they have reason to value
individuals and communities may have
very different values might seem obvious
but it's important to remember and that
means that we need an approach which is
radically pluralistic and this is
something that the capabilities approach
allows us to do I've offered the choice
framework as a tool to translate this
incredibly rich and theoretical approach
the capabilities approach into something
very concrete in the empirical realities
that we are social scientists might find
locally so it's an offer I call it a
living tool because I'd like people to
take the bits that work for them and
mash it up effectively it's not meant to
be kind of somehow preserved in a spec
it's something that hopefully can be
used I also hope that it allows us to
recognize the multiple resources of
income poor people and understand that
these people actually have an awful lot
of agency for example through social
resources cultural resources and
psychological resources we shouldn't
underestimate the agency of people in
development but we also need to
understand that there's some significant
structures that may limit that agency
and that can only be overcome with
collective action I get over those
structures and we might want to think
about then mechanisms which allow people
to express choice
in development so that's open and more
malleable technology recognizing and
understanding that we have joint limits
that we need to negotiate whether there
are in terms of social challenges or
ecological limits we might think about
voucher schemes in terms of allocation
and then participatory aspects such as
participatory budgeting we may actually
decide that we want to pay more and buy
local that might be of a collective
value decision and in terms of
participatory design of Technology if we
want to be truly pluralistic and value
sensitive I think we need a much more
participatory approach towards design
and that would be then the next step to
do that collectively with users so
thinking development beyond growth and
planning and designing for choice of my
kind of big to take awakes thank you
very much and I look forward to your
comments idea how much time we have for
questions cuz I know how my watch 1205
12 minutes um so this is the talking
stick if you have a question I'll walk
it to you and then you'll pass it to
another person thanks for a super
interesting talk I'm wondering you
started out talking about the goals at
the national level of this sort of we're
going to be neoliberal and we're going
to make lots of money and the people who
can make money the best are going to be
the winners and then you have rich
examples where that doesn't play out are
there ways in which those two models
come into conflict in specific instances
or is it just sort of a conceptual
disjuncture that plays out on two
different levels that don't really talk
to one another at all I've so far found
that the best platform for dialogue for
that particular sort of discursive
conflict if you want has been this space
of state procurement because it's
supposedly where we collectively as
taxpayers and citizens make decisions
about how the government is supposed to
spend money in our name
and there are there are approaches where
you basically just say you know you want
value for money for taxpayers money so
you want to optimize this and it's sort
of narrow sense you want you know you
want to buy it most basically the
cheapest at stable quality effectively
but for a small town like a lagoon where
a lot of small and small enterprises
don't any medium enterprises but small
enterprises are just about hanging on
this is a matter of you know the the
survival of that town for the you know
in the next 50 or 100 years I'm probably
more 50 so whether actually even the
local public administration will
actually kind of go and buy externally
from that town or internally from that
town matters tremendously for the future
of this space and there are some
arguments for example ecological
arguments of not shipping in one case
for example school furniture from China
into Santiago and then eight hours by
truck basically down into that into the
the school when next door there's a
whole bunch of carpentry businesses the
ecological argument would be in your
favor as well as the argument around you
know the jobs of the parents of the kids
who go to said school so it's these kind
of discussions that would have to be had
and I think when we're talking about
public money we're actually talking
about a much broader set of outcomes
that you may want to achieve with that
public money and so it's a really
interesting space to observe this and we
currently have a with said Chile compra
that really does gets a quite a tough
right up in the book it said Julie
compra is currently adjusted also there
are criteria towards ecological and
social norms we're having a really rich
dialogue with them on this journey to
actually looking at criteria that
they're buying from so this is really
interesting space to watch
hi um thanks for the talk I guess I'm
having a I'm not familiar with the the
choice framework but I'm having a hard
time seeing how it's all that different
from a more economic framework and it
seems like I guess I still feel like
there's a Western sort of individual
preference utility maximizing framework
in both of them and I guess I wonder if
there's tensions then if you try to
import this framework it feels very
Western still to me and not all that
different than a you know economic actor
type other than maybe they're not just
exercising choices through markets but I
guess you know are these frameworks
actually you know is it us again
imposing just a slightly different
framework on other parts of the world
that comes out of the West or is it you
know is it really actually a significant
departure from I mean I see there's like
a macro it seems like development has
been thought of as a aggregate kind of
gdp type phenomenon and this is more
nuanced but it still seems to share the
same basic underlying assumptions to me
I think I'd like to take that into into
two parts so so one is this question of
whether you know there's a great just
distinction between this kind of work
and a focus on on growth I would
immediately point out it yes because you
basically have instead of focusing on
this bit as the kind of agreed focus of
what people want you have a primary
outcome being choice and then a whole
set of options that people might choose
so there I would say there's a huge
distinction now on the on the second
part which is about you know there's a
hole that the the framework focus is
quite heavily on the individual and I'm
struggling at the moment in the next
step the current work that I'm doing to
also translate this on on groups and
democratic discussions in groups and
scaling this up in terms of groups
so that's the kind of next challenge but
for individuals one of the big debates
were having in development is whether a
focus on the individual and individual
choice is something sort of ingrained in
the Western view or whether it is
something that is much more shared in
Universal and I think this is a very
long discussion but one of the things
that is arguably underplayed in that
space is what happens when you move away
from the individual two groups basically
in relative terms the powerless are
going to lose in as soon as you scale up
from the individual and I'm particularly
interested in marginalized new
marginalized and powerless and so
there's a real cost to thinking about
groups and what does the community want
or what does the household want because
we may not hear from specifically the
women and the kids in the household what
will hear is you know the guys speaking
head of male head of household speaking
about the household or the headman
speaking about the community and if we
assume that well you know we as
Westerners don't quite understand how
collective everyone's thinking we're
ending up in in a space where we're
taking the collective in some way as
read and we're expecting that there's
some kind of cohesion in that collective
in terms of their values and I I've seen
too many situations in my fieldwork
where the values that were expressed in
the name of the collective did not match
up with the values of the individual
that was being marginalized in that
group process so I think there's some
real challenges there for us in terms of
understanding how power works in these
groups and you know if we don't have
time to kind of expand on this we can
maybe chat a little bit longer
afterwards bit it's worth looking at the
literature around adaptive preferences
which is a big literature and the
capabilities approach how people
basically adjust what they want
according to what the pressure of the
group is yeah more more later I'd say
yeah I'm really glad you went down to a
specific instance the case especially
the Rockville resilience and
resourcefulness of a female thinking
about even a small level
entrepreneurship um are you able have
you been able to keep in contact and
find out where she well since you said
2005-2006 certainly with I don't know if
there's more market penetration or the
price of tablets and computers goes down
so this more you know penetration or is
she able to follow through with such a
great wonderful I'm een she's fixing a
pain point and if you have a chance to
upgrade herself but yeah where is she
now right so um you know the the
official field work period is well and
truly over just for you know the
rigorous field study etc etc but of
course the the informal contacts in many
ways continue which actually for for
example for Marta you know the health
challenge has become a lot more
difficult so there's some there's some
aspects here which we haven't even
covered we're basically a lot of this
also the psychological resources can be
directed just to overcome that for the
director of the info center there's a
lovely story basically where her work in
particular has been recognized and she
now runs the regional library service
which is an integrated service for both
the telecentres and libraries she's
basically making the case that there can
be kind of a adjoint and holistic
thinking about how to integrate
libraries and intellisense as we move
along and as technology evolves so i
think that's a really interesting story
where you see technological change also
so then affecting the way that people
think locally and how that then
translates into some sort of strategic
thinking for the for the next you know
decades I think what's important in the
Chilean case here talking about you know
the agency of this particular woman
leader is that there are there is a
political will to actually invest in
public knowledge infrastructure which is
something unusual in many countries so
including in the UK where libraries are
being closed down etc etc in in Chile
there is this commitment to investing in
a knowledge infrastructure but it's kind
of it used to be split between
telecentres and libraries but it's there
is some integrated thinking going on so
it's spaced worth watching I think and
yeah someone ought to do the research I
was just curious about the the women's
group that you mentioned that she was
particularly involved with and I was
trying to parlay that into Christopher's
question about thinking beyond the
individual so rather than necessarily
thinking about these quite hierarchical
structures of household and village
these of these transverse structures
like that women's group that you spoke
of where if you could tell us a bit more
about that and where that sits within
something like a choice framework how
does it how does a collective that's
sort of voluntary form in it and that's
the way how does that mesh with this
kind of framework and welcome to my
current one of my kind of current
theoretical research puzzles so I'll
share with you where how far I've got
which bits I have I don't have the
puzzle solved by any means so one is
collectively we can never in with the
capabilities approach assume that any
two people in this room have an
identical value structure so
what we may be able to agree on is some
kind of joint objectives or joint
purpose and that would then basically
allow us to kind of build collective
action around a joint purpose even
though we don't necessarily agree on
everything which kind of meshes
interestingly with all so much sense
work on justice so the idea of justice
the if I had to sum it up in a sentence
for you know basically a student seminar
I'd basically say it's very much about
focusing on the bits that you can all
agree is our super unjust and start with
those so it's this building shared
purpose which then would allow for
collective action there's another aspect
which is this idea of pooling resources
so some of these resources can be very
effectively pooled and there's a massive
literature on how you know social
resources can kind of be pooled and you
can create kind of these famous weak
links by just kind of linking also
together some of these networks there's
other aspects like information where you
can have wonderful discussions as to
whether there are forms of information
that actually devalue when they're
entirely shared versus information that
when you share it is it is kind of
collectively shared also can actually
become a shared resource so this for
each of these resources you have to work
out very carefully how that works out
collectively and individually so you
know I find it a fascinating challenge
to kind of try and scale up if you want
but it's by no means you know neither
theoretically nor practically simple but
for I think for me it's a starting point
that for an individual it works and that
allows me to make sense of a very
complex reality in the field and it
gives me a basis to start then thinking
about how it then works collectively and
I'm absolutely certain that in order to
make some changes here in this space in
the structures you actually need
think about collective change collective
action and collective agency and that's
what motivates me to kind of dig deeper
into how to kind of conceptualize this
effectively thank you so join me a
finger at the end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
