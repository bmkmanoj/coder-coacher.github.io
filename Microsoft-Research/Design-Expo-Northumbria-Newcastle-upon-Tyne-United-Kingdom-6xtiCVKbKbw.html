next up we have Northumbria hi I'm Leah
and this is luke and I'm going to talk
you through our responses to making data
useful now we envision data as something
that can reinforce our connection to the
past as much as it connects us to our
future our project explores the link
between memory and meaning using
physical and look users digital
technology as a way of use in viewing
physical objects with a greater
narrative worth sorry so through a
series of smart tools and interactive
makers marks we sought to link both the
digital and the physical data in our
lives creating an active engagement that
strengthened our connection to our
possessions and to our predecessors now
we're an interdisciplinary team ID
product from furniture design and Lucas
interactive media design we wanted we
really really wanted our project to
reflect this now our response we also
sell parallels between the overwhelming
mass of data big data in the sense Louie
have a microphone that's really useful
that's great question is fine we saw the
if possessions sorry here we go there we
go we saw that if our possessions told
us a little more about ourselves if they
reinforced our connection to our own
sense of history in torun past then
there'd be more inclined to be valued in
the future and they we saw that the less
they become less disposable and less
throw away and we wanted to link both so
use data and physical objects as a way
imbue physical objects with data and
sorry see them as objects sorry as a way
of imbuing physical objects with greater
material worth value in the past maker's
marks hallmarks and the artists
signature were you we used as ways to
mark the handmade however these marks
these objects soon became valued for the
marks themselves and we saw that this
was because of the what makes objects
precious was they've been hand touched
that sense of history and place that
came with them we keep objects if we
know the maker we're more inclined to
treasure oh sorry we buy from farmers
market so we meet the producer and we're
more inclined to keep a son's painting
than a stranger's its objects that tell
us something about ourselves that
reinforce our connection to the physical
place and what reinforce a sense of our
own history we wanted to bring this
human fingerprint into the digital to
imbue an object with the value of the
artists signature and create something
you didn't have to rely on another's
evaluation to know its value in short we
wanted to create a digital signature of
the handmade this and see ya then we
decided to create a series of digitally
active makers marks and these would
allow the maker to be both identified
and for the maker to choose what what
data they leave behind their kind of
like legacy their imprint so yeah our
first iteration of this idea use
Gadgeteer and it was kind of way of as
experimenting and kind of to try the
whole tangible interaction of it and
really we then thought about the
feedback and we really like the idea of
a line graph it is quite synonymous with
the a pulse kind of giving life to the
object itself and so we looked at data
as a tool for living and by adding these
this light line graph this calls to
their to the object we're giving it a
life and so the different tools would
have sensors within them so forgive you
yah yah's back so yeah we we
experimented with their adding senses to
different tools and so within this one
we've got an accelerometer and we looked
at adding different nodes within the
tools and and then adding footage and
imagery to that and but it was important
for is that the the maker and chose what
was important we didn't want to just
kind of record the whole process we
wanted the maker to be in charge of what
data was meaningful and useful to them
allowing them to leave their legacy they
were the ones in charge so yeah the
final iteration of this was a phone up
but as ubiquitous technology improves it
might be that that it could use
augmented reality for example and yeah
so so we developed this app where you
can interact with a different kind of
line graphs or pulses of the tools and
interact with a different
footage or imagery that is present
within each each line graph also you can
look at information about the maker find
out more information about them and kind
of their what what a makers mark was
originally intended for yeah we've got a
video that would kind of and hopefully
encapsulate what our service is that
would like to play no yeah can we roll
the video please
you
we really wanted our object to be a
passive store of data that's as a
testament to the handmade just to
summarize now and it were running
through at a time but so our service is
something that connects people with the
handmade it gives them a sense of their
own history and encourages them to leave
a legacy in objects that are made
valuable by the time that they have
taken to create them it places
developing technology is the key to our
future past and bridges the gap between
high-tech and handmade we see a future
where technology is ubiquitous when even
the most basic tools are able to
remember their use in this the database
and a value for the data they store for
how they connect us with us with the act
of making and the way they can text
july's our own memories thank you very
much
would you like this despite least an
equal things how's this ok ok so I
actually have a proper question this
time I think um so Christopher dresser
was arguably the first industrial
designer yes and he tried to imbue
industrially produced objects with the
values of craft and and those objects
are still carry his imprint right even
though he didn't create them it wasn't
his hand that made them and so I'm
curious you focused very much on
handmade and the traditional crafts and
I I just like to ask you how do you see
this possibly extending because I think
it could to the digital artifacts and
objects of today which are
depersonalized suspect despite the fact
in sort of dressers time times 100
actually do emerge from the human hand
just not directly ok yeah well we
initially we developed the service and
based on an individual who'd be making
an object themselves so we saw the lot
of future videos of you know the lab
tech future so videos in the future
promoted quite a hands-off future where
it to my mind they kind of maybe d is it
like took away the significance of
skills and they saw that they I saw that
from those that people were seen as kind
of having it hands off kind of lifestyle
and so that actually people are going to
start to really value being hands-on
because we need to be hands-on to switch
off you know we need that process of
making something with our hands to be
able to really really like get to that
point where we don't think which i think
is actually really valuable now we
initially developed this for an
individual and then we saw that actually
it'd be quite appropriate like you say
for a service which is hence the
application that we developed and I had
a lot of questions earlier about people
saying well
happens if the person you know if
they're a professional they make 20
chairs do they embed you know the each
chair with the same data does that not
cheap in it and I said well no because
the individual is going to be making you
know whether they're a professional
crafts person might make 20 chairs the
same jet name so that you know what what
if they do choose to embed the same data
into each one but we don't like value an
attic or devalue an artist's prints
because there's 20 of them we still it's
that connect that connection to
something that's physical it's handmade
and it's because it's one of 20 as
opposed to one of like 20,000 it does
make it more well I suppose more
precious more personal to know if that
answers your question if you want to
reframe it and Luke and answer it so
you're asking though and digital
specifically and engineering was out of
the question can kind of but it also
just I like the idea and I want to see
how it extends even further but I wanted
hug the time so go slow chances um I
think okay I really like what you're
doing and I'm really I think stuff
you're really missing something in the
way you're presenting it because it
wouldn't have been difficult to simply
video really video yourselves making
something and show the connection
between what that really looks like and
what you get from the objects it feels
isn't really Kristin because I think
what you're doing is great is just that
it comes over they corporate the way in
which the kind of videos you're showing
even the kind of chair you're showing
and I'm kind of curious particularly in
this kind of situation with is what's it
mean to show stuff where people start
actually believing in the content and
all you had to do is make stuff and
video it really make it really video it
and then we get a sense of what that
feels like when you click the person
back to the object John said yes
did you want a responsible a peterson I
be just know whether you have any doubts
about the way the type of furniture
you've chosen and the type of video you
shown in connection wait have you this
is going to be using this is me coming
from my perspective as a product and
finishes Anya I see that there's a
massive trend at moment or massive as
though its resurgence in makers or
craftspeople creating videos that
glorify or I suppose celebrate the
making process not necessarily what's
made but it's that process so through
videos or through sites which is kind of
put it by process and Vimeo and what
have you they're kind of celebrating
their skills now whilst Mia Luke didn't
show us actually supposed let you say
physically making things on this on the
video we did think that this was kind of
a quite applicable to this kind of we
saw that makers would choose to embed
video or what have you just because it
showed that very real nature of like
what they were doing that kind of
hands-on and yeah yes I think I'll just
not answered your question I think we
wanted a service as well that was
personalized for each individual maker I
mean what they leave it could be could
be corporate but maybe in a different
maker is more kind of more heart you
know craft-based handmade and I don't
know I think we saw a service that
change depending on who who was the mega
really alright so thank you as you guys
should chat more after but we're gonna
move on
so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
