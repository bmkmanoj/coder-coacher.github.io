you
hello everyone I'm Marc Maron and this
is my collaborator James Mickens from
MSR and we're really excited to be here
today to tell you some more about the
work that we've been doing with our
great partners in the product group to
build a time travel debugging experience
in JavaScript HTML so what is a
time-travel debugger allow you to do
well so now in addition having the
standard sort of forward step step into
buttons in your debugger you now have
the reverse version so you can step back
in time as your debug your application
to inspect values and figure out where
things went wrong so let's just start
out by taking a demo and look at the
experience that we're trying to build
for you guys what we have here is this
is a version of the edge browser running
on a preview release of threshold and
what we did is we went on in online and
found the ever popular 2048 game you can
find many you know implementations of
this we went and we're interested in one
that was how to build a 2048 clone using
angularjs so as you see I can play the
game as usual and we added a key press
button down at the bottom so you can see
which arrow key I'm I'm pushing now
since this is a debugging demo we have a
bug that when I push the right arrow key
the tiles actually slide up to the top
so I can go ahead and open my trusty f12
debugger and once it launches here I've
already set a breakpoint at the function
that is of interest to me in grid j/s
and what this function does is it goes
and converts the actual arrow key press
into a direction vector that's used
internally so I can go ahead and
reproduce the bug and I'll break here at
the end of the method so we can go ahead
and inspect values just like we usually
would we can see the return vector the x
value is actually 0 and the y value is
negative 1 so the direction we got was
indeed up so from this I can conclude
that the bug is up here in my conversion
code not in the actual move logic now
normally if I was debugging I would have
to clear this breakpoint set a
breakpoint up here in a new place before
where I believe the bug occurred and
then reproduce the bug and start
stepping forward instead we now have
these reverse step buttons
so I can just in fact step back into the
actual switch statement where the bug
occurred and I can do this as many times
as I like again I can see here I'm in
this up case but my key is actually
right so i might wonder well why did i
get in this case what's what's the bug
here i can step back again and see that
oh it's because i fell through from the
correct case statement into the
incorrect case statement and so i can
easily fix that bug we might be
interested in sort of understanding more
about our options for this fix and you
know if we made this fix would we write
have the right value after there so i
can go up here and even drill down so i
can look at fact that the key vectors
the internal values and i can see that
key vectors 1 x is 1 and y is 0 and that
is the correct direction vector we want
so now i can be confident that after my
bug fix i'll have the right value and I
could even you know step forward and see
how it might change step back again as
many times as I want until I'm confident
in what I need to do to identify the
root cause of the bug and fix that cause
so given what we just saw the big
question is like how do we go about
actually implementing this reverse
execution functionality so the kind of
interesting thing here is we don't
actually step back or undo the single
operation we have sort of a more
roundabout but actually more efficient
way to do this so let me show you an
example here we have some code a simple
JavaScript function it has a single
global variable TM with a time field and
a message field initially set to hello
we have a single function that updates
the time to the current time and the
message to whatever argument you passed
in and then we'll have a button they
just when you click it calls this
function with the message quick and so
if we start up we load this page into
our web browser it'll parse the code set
up the global variables and we'll have
some internal state that looks something
like this where we have the time set to
the integer hello the message points to
it or n points to a string hello we've
implemented eight here some way we don't
actually need it for this example so I'm
just going to leave it to sort of unter
written here so when we go ahead and
launch f12 what's going to happen is
we're going to start taking snapshots
every so often of the program state
during execution so that's all the
JavaScript keep all of the HTML Dom and
we're going to log all the
non-deterministic events that happen
that could be random numbers that you
read the dates that you get any event
handlers that are fired so if we imagine
we hit f12 the first thing that's going
to do is say I don't have any snapshots
so I'm going to go ahead and take one
and so what it does is it's going to
come over and set this snapshot to a
nice serialized representation of the
current program state so it's going to
say oh I have the variable let's say TM
I can represent this as a JSON object
where T is 0 the message is the string
hello there's going to be some other
information to track the functions and
various other built-in objects and we'll
also have the actual HTML written out in
its regular format again we don't need
it for this demo so I'm just going to
sort of leave the details out and then
down here in the log will say oh by the
way we had a snapshot event and this
event occurred at sort of this abstract
event time 0 so once this is done we
might go ahead and the user is going to
go ahead and click the button and so
will so this is a non-deterministic type
of event that can occur so over here in
our log the first thing we'll do is
we'll say we had an event it was the
call of the function do it and then will
log what the arguments were in this case
click
and then any event information we had
for the event argument on that and we'll
note this is event time number one so
we'll go ahead and start executing the
function the first thing we do is we
read this non-deterministic value the
date dot now so we'll go ahead and add a
final entry to our log where we have you
know the now thing let's say it returns
10 and this will be at time 3 so finally
we get to the next statement here will
assign oh sorry we've got to finish
executing the first statement where we
got the time value 10 from the now
function so we need to go up here and
actually update the time in our concrete
stain through its new value 10 we'll
start executing the next statement there
are no non-deterministic events here so
we can just go ahead and execute this as
usual will overwrite this pointer create
a new string called click and set the
pointer to point to that and then we'll
reach the return statement where we
might have let's say a break point of
interest now what we do to step back is
we jump out and we just sort of abort
the current execution go back to the
main event loop state the next thing we
do is we actually destroy all of the
state that exists in the current program
we looked at our snapshot state copy all
of that back in so will actually create
a new object or the T is 0 we have a
message field we're going to allocate a
new string hello set the pointer to that
whatever other function in state we have
here and we'll rebuild the whole Dom
tree as it is in this from the HTML on
that snapshot now that we've done that
we can go look at our event log say
where was this snapshot come from what's
the next thing we need to do well we
need to start executing this particular
event handler so we're going to say
rather than generate an synthetic event
we'll just tell the JavaScript engine
execute the do it function with the
arguments click and whatever event
information re-recorded there so the pc
will now start here in this function
will start just executing this as before
we'll see this date now function will
say okay this is a non-deterministic
event so rather than getting the current
time will actually go back to our log
see what time we recorded during the
first execution will set the time to
whatever that value was in this case 10
move to the next statement and since
this is the statement we wanted to step
back to will actually stop here rather
than executing all the way forward so
you can see that in order to step back
one statement we sort of took this big
roundabout trip just stopping one step
before we got to where we were alright
so we've looked at how we use this time
travel debugging process to sort of go
backwards and forwards in time as
developers trying to debug a JavaScript
program now one thing you might think
about is isn't this expensive isn't it
going to be very costly to take these
snapshots and restore state and things
like that and the answer is actually no
and explain why we need to look at the
level at which we're actually
virtualizing things so if you look at
things like Lex a let's say as in for
example or maybe hyper-v then these
types of techniques actually virtualize
at a very low level at the x86 level and
so what that means is that there's a ton
of state that these tools have to
capture to represent programs behavior
so for example they have to capture a
lot of low-level sort of register state
they have to capture things like entire
heap snapshot of raw physical memory so
that means that snapshots are going to
be very very large so even if you
optimize them compress them a raw
snapshot is still typically on the order
of hundreds of mags or maybe even a gig
or something like that right so things
like Zen and hyper-v virtual eyes at a
very low level okay which means that
their state snapshots are very large
hundreds of megabytes or perhaps even a
gigabyte or more now another technique
you might think to reduce the size of
the state snapshots in the event logs is
to virtualize at a slightly higher level
of abstraction so for example if you
look at tools like dr. what these things
do is that
they virtualize at the level of the OS
essentially so they virtualize the level
of POSIX system calls for example and so
this is nice so this allows us to
actually ignore even more architectural
state but even if you virtualize this
level snapshots are still typically
hundreds of megabytes in size and
there's also a lot of complexity that
you have to deal with even if you're
virtualizing at this higher level of
abstraction so you might have to worry
about things like the order in which
signals are delivered and stuff like
that and that's a pain if you're trying
to do high fidelity logging and replay
so what we actually do in our system is
virtualized at yet another higher level
of abstraction so we sit up here in the
stack so we virtualize at the level of
the managed runtime so in our case this
is at the level of the JavaScript
runtime and so basically as you move
this way in the levels of abstraction
you see that the amount of state plus
the size of the event logs actually
decreases and this is nice because what
this means is that it becomes more
feasible to take snapshots to log events
in real time as the actual program is
deployed on real immature machines and
so this is one of the fundamental
advantages of the technology that we've
created right so as you've seen in some
of the demos we can use these things in
an interactive manner without showing
appreciable slowdowns and they can be
used by developers in an interactive
interactive way and so note that this
technique up here is something that we
can generalize beyond the JavaScript
runtime and we can generalize this to
something that we call interrogative
virtualization and so the basic idea
here is that if we take a high level of
runtime such as a JavaScript runtime but
perhaps something like the dotnet and on
time
for instance or maybe even the java
runtime or something like that then that
level of abstraction allows us to ignore
a lot of the architectural state that
has to be introspective upon by things
like doctor or x86 and it actually
allows us to only worried about the
high-level semantics of the application
that we care about right so for example
we probably don't care about a lot of
the low-level x86 events with respect to
interrupts and things like that if we're
trying to log and replay a JavaScript
application instead we worry about
things like what are the events that are
being fired by the event loop for
example and so by abstracting at that
higher level we really make it much more
efficient to take the snapshot into
capture the state and so in terms of the
sizes of the images for example as I
mentioned down here image snapshots are
typically on the order of hundreds of
mags or a gig or more up here we can get
extremely small snapshots right on the
order of a sometimes hundreds of K
depending on what the application is and
so one important thing to note is that
if we virtualize at this level here of
the managed runtime we can actually
leverage a lot of the support that these
managed runtimes have for things like
garbage collection because if you think
about it what is it that we're doing
when we're taking a snapshot of the
application we're actually traversing
the heap and trying to collect some
information for every live object in the
heap well if you think about it that's
exactly what a garbage collector does
write a garbage collector has to
efficiently be able to walk the heap and
collect statistics about all the live
objects so by piggybacking on a lot of
the heap walking code that's already in
these matters runtimes we can actually
support serialization very very
efficiently and in fact in a lot of
these managed runtimes collecting the
event log is also very very easy because
if you think about it you know what is
the JavaScript execution context at its
heart it's an event loop that iterates
and dispatches events one after another
well to log a lot of the events that we
care about in time travel debugging we
just need to introspect on that event
loop and sort of record a little bit of
information after every event dispatch
it's a long story short by moving the
level of abstraction which we virtualize
up not only do we decrease the size of
the state in the event
we have to capture but we can also
efficiently leverage mechanisms that the
manager runtime already has to do things
like garbage collection and event
dispatch so for this next demo we have a
classic game pac-man we got this one
online as well it's written using the
html5 canvas element and so what I can
do to sort of demonstrate the overhead
of snapshots the impact that we have
when running the time travel debugger is
I can go ahead and start playing this
game as normal without the time travel
debugger attached and as you see I have
pac-man he can run around no problem let
me pause the game as I launch the f12
debugger and again I've gone and set a
breakpoint at the needed location in the
game function where we actually in the
e2 ghost method so when pac-man managed
to eat a ghost will hit this breakpoint
so now I can actually resume playing the
game and this is with the time travel
debugger actually running taking
snapshots recording all the events and I
can go ahead eat a pellet and now chase
down a ghost and I'll hit this
breakpoint here and let me move the
debugger out of the way so you can see
in this particular version we've
actually gone back to the first snapshot
we took when the debugger was launched
so you'll see the entire game state
including the canvas and the HTML
content be restored exactly the same and
then you can see the fidelity of the
replay as it executes so I'll click the
step back button you see pac-man is
restored all the ghosts all the actions
moving exactly the same through all the
event handlers and as soon as I eat the
ghost I'll break as desired down here in
this method now as you notice replay was
a little slower than it was to actually
do the recording so what happened is we
were actually recording a bit of extra
information so that any future step
backs would be much much faster so you
see now I can step backwards almost the
same speed as I can step forward so this
demonstrates both the sort of high
fidelity with which we can
this recording and the very low
performance impact that the time travel
debugging snapshots and recording has on
application performance interestingly
based on the way we showed the
architecture is we're only capturing the
actual application state not this large
chunk of information about the browser
runtime so the snapshots are very small
for this pac-man game about four hundred
kilobytes a second of data is recorded
including snapshot and the event and
these snapshots are machine independent
so we can actually save the snapshot to
disk maybe I want to debug a bug later
or I could actually send this to my
colleague and he could load it up on his
machine even if he doesn't have the
exact same set of dll's and debug there
so we're really excited about some of
the scenarios that this enables so today
what we've showed you is a new
technology for enabling time travel
debugging for web applications and we're
really excited about the new scenarios
that this enables for developers because
so many developers lose so many hours
trying to figure out exactly when where
and how a bug took place and we think
that this new time travel technology
really enables some powerful bug
hypotheses and bug localization
strategies and we showed you several
demos that demonstrate the time travel
debugging is not just a neat idea it's
also extremely efficient snapshotting is
very quick event logs are very small in
the process of moving backwards and
forwards and time is quick enough for
developers to have essentially
interactive experiences with the
debugging technology and also as we've
showed you time travel debugging is
really sort of part of a more
fundamental contribution you believe so
we believe that we've actually
discovered sort of this new layer at
which to introduce virtualization
technology and so we're pretty excited
about that too because we think that
these techniques that we've described in
the context of JavaScript may also be
applicable in other sort of manage
runtime environments and so we're very
happy that we've been able to work with
the product groups on this they've been
very supportive about this stuff and
they've been key enablers in making at
this technology as efficient and as
interactive as it is right now so in
conclusion we hope that you get excited
about time travel debugging and we hope
that you're excited about sort of the
larger sort of technical vision that we
have here and we look forward to talking
to you soon
