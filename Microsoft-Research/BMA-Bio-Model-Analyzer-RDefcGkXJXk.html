the bimodal analyzer tool is designed to
help allergists understand biological
networks for example it can help you
identify what kind of interactions
between genes and proteins make a cancer
cell so what makes the BMA tool a unique
is the fact that it can help us make
sense of this huge complexity that is
hidden in these biological networks if
we can get a glimpse into what's going
on inside the cell if we can identify
what kind of program or algorithm is
running inside the cell let's say a
cancer cell we can try and and trace the
set of instructions that make that cell
behave in a certain way for example
divide or die and in the context of a
diseased cell like a cancer so we can
try and figure out what lead and healthy
cell to become cancerous
it's an experimental system allows a
biologist to sort of approach the
biological system tweak things here and
there and so the way the tools been
designed among the computers that
variables can be manipulated adjuster
the algorithms and the codes and
functions that connect one sort of
variable in a biological system to
another can be just adjusted that tiny
bit and then the system is run all you
have to do is press a button on the
screen and it comes back with an answer
within a few seconds
you don't need to be a computer
programmer to do the hands-on analysis
here it is just like using PowerPoint or
word or excel but you can do very
sophisticated the analysis of things
that are staggeringly complex so it
opens up the floor to ask completely new
biological questions that we couldn't
tackle before and it also more recently
allowed us to start thinking about how
we can use that also in the space of
drug discovery these kinds of
computational methods will become an
everyday technique in every lab and my
own personal a hope for the BMA is that
it will become such a tool that will be
used on a daily base tin in biological
and medical research allowed to do very
complicated analysis allowed to do
modeling hands-on by experimental
biologists and even clinicians and are
doing biological research
