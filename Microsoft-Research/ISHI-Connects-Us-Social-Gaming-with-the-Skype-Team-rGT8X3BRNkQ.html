you
alright hey everybody welcome and thanks
for joining us today as we talk about an
experiment in a social gaming that we
embarked upon this year with in
partnership with the skype team I'm
really pleased to talk about this we had
amazing time we had some tremendous
support for some some great engineers
and the skype group who helped us to
bring this thing to reality our goal was
to to instill slavish devotion to the
skype brand and in that we succeeded to
me because I've decided now that I we're
entirely skype colors from now on I well
I'm committed now in in for love of easy
to wear skype colors for the rest of the
day and including my wristband but
you'll learn more about kind of what I'm
talking about soon when I hand this over
to 20 beaman shaam he's my intern he is
a graduate student at university of
southern california he's working on his
mfa in interactive median games he
brings to Microsoft a a really strong
blend of industry and academic
experience and he's working on some
really cool projects in the past he's
just recently did an internship at BMW
working on augmented reality games for
their car lines and all kinds of other
stuff which he'll get into in more
detail so without further ado I will
hand it over to him thanks everyone
thanks Donald thank you all for coming
I'll be presenting as L mentioned about
eg which is a social game for the skype
team so just to give you all some
background of my background before
coming to USC I was a playwright and
director theatrical director by night
and a software developer and journalist
by day and at USC is Donald mentioned I
was part of the mobile and environmental
media lab which explores putting
interactive experiences and buildings
and cars and I went on to further do
some of that work at BMW last
her and I also helped found in lead the
world building media lab which is alex
macdowall slab alex macdowall is the
production designer of such films as
Fight Club a man ordered report and this
lab was kind of exploring a future
medium somewhere between game and film
so that's some of my background before
coming here to Microsoft so to get
started our main goal here for my
internship if I can put into one
question is can we embed a meaningful
game in the newly open skype buildings
and we'll get into what it means to have
a meaningful game in a second but just
to give you some background on to why we
were looking at the skype buildings for
this ross smith who is director of test
there had an initiative that he called
Signal Hill that was kind of the the
forerunner for this event and signal
hill if you don't know the background of
that name was the point in Newfoundland
where Marconi had the first
transatlantic communication so Ross
really wanted these new buildings which
are five and six year on the Redmond
campus to actually as the buildings be
interactive experiences so the
building's as community organizers the
buildings as facilitators of employee
health and initiatives so that they
would actually have these different
personas which he dubbed Ingrid and
Ingmar which apparently had no reference
to the bergmans but there you go so
these buildings in this premise would be
able to help you help facilitate your
day on they would learn more about you
they could potentially bring you into
small interactive experiences and some
of the new innovative spaces that they
had in the buildings so here's one of
their what they call an alt space in the
buildings which is like a congregation
collaboration area and additionally it
could help maybe be gamified in a way
of incentivizing you to some healthy
activities so those were kind of the
backgrounds from ross's perspective of
health games and using the buildings as
a conduit for those experiences and
additionally as these buildings were
getting open skype had some very
specific branding that they wanted to do
you know which at Redmond had to do with
retro Mariner shirts and tattoos
obviously and I don't know they had a
very specific a cult they wanted to
bring in culture shock well that was a
big thing that I talked about culture of
innovation and so they had some very
specific ideas about what they wanted
these new buildings to be which was an
openoffice that was very different than
what was there before so kind of look at
what our over top level initiatives were
this was at the beginning of the summer
before the experience started we wanted
to engage employees and a healthier
lifestyle make the workplace not feel
like a place of work we really wanted to
bring together employees that would
otherwise not interact on a day-to-day
basis which was pretty big because with
skype and lync coming together in these
buildings there from some of the just
basic demographic interviews that we did
before our design we found that there
were a lot of people that didn't
necessarily interact with people in
their neighborhood or between buildings
or had any idea who these other people
were and considering that they were
working on products / becoming more and
more integrated we wanted to find ways
through our game design to get that to
happen and we just like we said these
buildings have this very specific
branding and we wanted to help people
learn about those so a very brief primer
of games and game design not to get into
it too much but just a little bit as to
why something like this is important so
on a very formal level this is like a
very objective way of approaching a game
it's a close formal system that brings
about conflict and looks to have some
kind of resolution to that conflict
and another way to and so just really
quickly this is uh this quote comes from
Tracy Fullerton who's my professor at
University of Southern California and
literally wrote the book on game design
this is if you want to know more about
game design get into it I heartily
recommend this book and following Tracy
and this quote comes from Bernard suits
the grasshopper which is say that
playing is a game is a voluntary attempt
to overcome unnecessary obstacles which
is important thing to think about
because a lot of games if you stripped
away the context of the game are
actually things that you wouldn't really
want to do in real life if they were
your job if you think about SimCity
you're essentially a resource manager
without the objective of the game so
we're willingly allow ourselves to play
in these experiences because it allows
us to try out different things in that
space so the way that I see it the
things on a basic level if you're
thinking about games games have a goal
games have rules they give you feedback
on your play and their voluntary so you
opt in and out so we just look at soccer
the goal of the game is to win the rules
are different things you can't foul
people you have to 45 minute halves etc
you have feedback so everybody knows
when a goal is scored and if you don't
enjoy soccer well you can just leave the
game and then just kind of to capstone
this so people play games for very
different reasons and for example if you
guys know the board game Settlers of
Catan my wife and I when we play have
very different reasons that we play she
all she wants to do is trade with other
people and interact and have the social
experience and I'm much more interested
in mean cloak and dagger and winning the
game people like to win people like to
play people like to interact they get
into this flow state for various reasons
and that's an important thing to
consider when you're designing a game
was ultimately your game design
reinforces what ever desired behavior
you want as a game designer you need to
think about what you want players to do
and what players want to do and how
those
overlap because between those two things
is where you get a game that people want
to play and you'll be proud of and we'll
create that behavior that you like so
even a much much briefer primer of a RGS
which was kind of the original impetus
uh when Donald brought me aboard was to
create an alternate reality game for the
skype buildings so an Arg stands for an
alternate reality game if you all know
what that is and actually interesting
love energies kind of have their origin
here at Microsoft so right here this is
a poster for AI which came out in 2001
and there was an Arg started what they
called the Beast by Jordan Weissman and
some others and in the credits really
there was a really small line of
somebody's name that said that she was a
sentient technology specialist I believe
was a term and so people would Google
this person and then they would start to
unlock they would find all of this crazy
information and they unlock this really
crazy puzzle about a bizarre murder
mystery and they I think they had like
three million players and they got a ton
of press for it so and then I love bees
is a similar one that came out I believe
with halo 2 which they had like the
trailer for halo 2 and then there was
just really quick little I love bees URL
that was bleeped at the end of it and
people started to explore this really
crazy fake website in this history
behind it so the idea of an alternate
reality game is kind of embedded
narrative that is kind of not of this
world but in this world that people can
engage with and it's used it's been used
a lot as a marketing tool or kind of a
different way to get in to get people
engaged and traditionally although it's
called an alternate reality game it
usually has to do with puzzles itself I
would call an alternate reality puzzle
so a lot of embedded narrative that you
have to go through puzzles to understand
or to figure it all out
and so that was different than what we
really wanted to do ultimately because
there's a big difference between games
and puzzles puzzles are a part of games
but a puzzle always has a finite
solution and the goal of a puzzle is
always defined the solution and the
problem is ten years later if somebody
wanted to play the beast or people
wanted to play I love bees well it's all
solved when you look it up on the
Internet that's all you get is the
solution so there really wasn't this
option for multiple people who come in
afterwards was one of the things a
couple weeks into our design you know we
had an initial way that we were going
and Donald asked me is like well is this
something that could be replayed could
we create this in a way that it could be
done again and again or the same people
could play it again and again and we
were kind of initially going with this
crazy arg that was based off of Ingrid
and Ingmar this crazy Scandinavian
couple that had come to Seattle to be
musicians and we were going to embed all
of this crazy narrative and these
puzzles but we decided that the
alternate reality game wasn't exactly
what was going to be the most meaningful
for the people at skype and that we
really did want to create something that
would last so on that note I'm going to
play this is a rough cut of some
documentary footage that we've been
shooting about what this whole
experience is about so hopefully that'll
kind of clarify a little bit of where
we're coming from and where we're going
and then we'll move on to some of the
design and some of the results every was
asking what does she was the issue was
this year is she well I don't really
know maybe glad this again you can
access that's about all I know she is a
kind of a collaborative game it seems
like some sort of research project to
help us get better connected to each
other driving people to get up move
around interact it's been working it
seems like there's been a lot of people
I've met that I never would have met
otherwise yeah than that I don't know
there's been questions asked so they're
going somewhere I don't know
rather than developing a narrative to
embed in these buildings we decided that
we would create a mechanic and
experience and a game that would create
culture from the people in these
buildings because ultimately while we
think that we want other people's
stories the stories that matter to
people most are the ones that they
create themselves and tell themselves I
can tell other people Microsoft has a
long history of trying out new ideas on
its own employees we call it dogfooding
we believe we should eat our own dog
food and one of the ways that we do this
is by testing our own software and we've
been using games to test software for
more than 10 years now the incoming
generation of whether it's Microsoft or
any an employee is coming from a
background of gaming and social
networking in digital technology and so
it would be natural then for those those
tools and techniques to evolve into the
workplace as well we wanted our
mechanics to focus on collaboration and
communication and we wanted there to be
a low barrier of entry and yet the game
to feel rich nuanced and more complex as
you went on so the main mechanics that
we focus on were connections
breakthroughs and bolts the connections
mechanic was driven by the goal of
getting people out of their seats they
would go as individuals to these kiosks
or stations that we put across the two
buildings they would swipe their
employee badge and potentially answer a
few questions about themselves but
everyone get up and take a break to go
get drink I would just make a loop
through my floor um we would actually
usually do like two stations because if
you go to get coffee which you know we
would normally do every day you know
some some other guys from the team at
the kitchen there was two stations at
effins I just planned a rude if I went
to the bathroom I went to get a drink or
whatever I would just purposely pass an
easy station once a team had accrued
enough connections nexim kenick came in
which was the breakthrough mechanic a
breakthrough is a challenge that
everybody on the team receives and must
complete together in order for their
team to level up and move on these
breakthrough started out as very
tasks say just need one player at a
specific station in order to level up
but as the game progressed they became
more complex over time they needed
people at different stations at the
exact same time across buildings to
people at both stations in different
building at the same time they would
have to start answering questions about
their fellow teammates then they would
have to find hidden objects in the
building's then they would have to start
making media together hey you guys on
the challenge yes okay wait wait okay so
I don't know with it did you guys get
the challenge yeah we finally got it we
had our final mechanic was bolts with
connections and breakthroughs ultimately
people didn't really have any reason to
think about other teams or the game at
large bolts were ways that a team could
interact with another team either
positively or negatively at their
choosing but did you play a bolt a good
play bolt I played circle bolts I think
two vaults today and what were those
bolts i plate well that was the one bolt
and then a bolt i played was a big
barrier just now I actually played a
bolt to block the innocence one of our
big initiatives in creating this was to
really foster collaboration
communication between people in these
buildings even if they don't know each
other I notice structurally we're
changing our communication style and
interacting differently certainly
initially we didn't even have to be a
team we could just be individuals doing
tasks but that quickly changed I think I
got to know the co-workers in my room
better and I actually socialized with
them whereas I did not before one of the
things is having a friend at work is one
of the best ways to sort of retain
people and so making these connections
in sort of a whimsical fun sort of way
really can help the health of the
organization and help with retention and
just overall morale a lot of teams get
siloed and when they're supposed to be
working together and so if you have had
this
interaction in a game setting with
somebody then you actually have to work
with them it's going to be a different
initial meeting and a she's been great
because it's sort of subtly connected
people who would not normally be
connected and so now people from
different disciplines and different
teams who may or may not work together
regularly now have a different
connection we found some interesting
patterns across both weeks that as the
week went on we would get more and more
players and more connections throughout
the week which I thought was really
fascinating that people who didn't
necessarily have the initial call to
play would see their teammates achieving
things and want to receive messages or
emails asking them to play and finally
would come out and would begin playing
with ishii we're trying to lay the
foundation of a new form of new employee
orientation I wish we can do it all the
time because it's because something that
you're doing that's not it breaks up the
day a little bit and gets people to
interact and so the opportunities for
doing something like eg8 here at
Microsoft are actually pretty tremendous
not only is there a lot of amazing
hardware literally embedded in the walls
but I found a lot of people very
receptive to the whole idea and
experiment we want to encourage
employees to create their own culture
and do things not because they're
getting some points or an achievement
but because it's meaningful to them in a
more intrinsic way the challenge of
running a game in the workplace is that
it is a place of work and whatever you
do can't get in the way of that if
management was like on board um I think
I would play I like games you know if
you're playing a first-person shooter
game and you know you're trying to get
the new weapon or level up to a new suit
of armor you know it's akin to okay I'm
doing my job to get to the next level or
to get to the next title or it gets the
next role and so integrating some of
those and taking what we learn in
digital games and applying it to the
workplace can only help with engagement
cool oh okay well let's keep going yeah
great so that like I said is a rough cut
of a little bit of our interview footage
as well as kind of our higher goal so
hopefully that gives you a good idea but
just to read e8 what some of our design
initiatives were going into the
experience to make it replayable so it
was something that could be experienced
again and again focusing on game
mechanics that was a collaborative and
increasingly collaborative as time went
on and grew in complexity in that regard
and really gave ownership to the players
so that it didn't feel like it was a
story that we were telling that they
were uncovering but was something that
they were doing and they could take
ownership of and then some of the
constraints which is something that's
actually very important to game design
is constraints because when you don't
have constraints you can design anything
so it's important to know what your kind
of designing towards so we had a really
tough balance between voluntary versus
inven de involuntary as we mentioned
games are always voluntary you can opt
into a gamer opt out work is not
necessarily as voluntary so if you have
to do work you have to do work and the
balance between game and work was
something that we were always playing
with another issue is that we were kind
of trying to create a smaller footprint
as possible we were really lucky to have
ross smith with the director of tessa
skype to be a huge support for us there
but i wouldn't say this was an official
project you know it was kind of a a bit
cloak and dagger so to speak so we were
trying to put this game and run this
meaningful game in the workplace without
really disrupting people again and then
another issue was the skype and lync
merger and trying to figure out which
technology would be best for reaching
everybody in both buildings um being
that some people were more likely to use
skype and more some people are more
likely to use link and then figuring out
when and where to use those two
technologies excuse me
and then figuring out a mechanic in
which somebody who only played for five
seconds a day felt like they were making
a meaningful contribution and somebody
that was playing for 30 minutes a day
felt like they were making a meaningful
contribution so being able to allow both
of those to be helpful and then finally
i've mentioned rocksmith a couple of
times this is a table from one of his
paper the future of work is play which I
recommend you I'll check out so this
court this table is looking at what
kinds of games are most successful in
the workplace and the in his studies
Ross is found that the most successful
ones are ones that have to do with
learning skills that have to do with
your job or what's called core skills
that are not related to your job and by
core skills it means things that you
might do that are less than what you
actually do for your job so getting up
moving around answering emails playing
games it's you know it's not necessarily
part of what makes your job unique so I
would say that ishy with its connections
breakthroughs and both definitely falls
into this category and the other
interesting thing to note here is that
jobs that have to do with unique skills
to the job excuse me games that have to
do with these unique skills are
traditionally failures because if people
feel like they're being successful in
those games and maybe they think they
deserve a promotion and if they're not
doing well in the game then maybe
they're worried about their job so the
kinds of games that work in the
workplace it's not all kinds of games
and so these are the kind of areas that
are traditionally focused upon okay so
just a quick review of the mechanics
that we went over in the video so the
individual actions were connections that
involve swiping your badge at these
different stations there were two
stations for each floor of the two
buildings and when you do the connection
you either got just a thank you message
from the buildings either Ingrid or hang
mar or it asks you to answer a few
questions about yourself
once a team had done enough connections
to reach a breakthrough which was
somewhere between four and ten
connections they would get these
breakthroughs which as again mentioned
in the video they kind of rose and
complexity over time so it started off
with just single connections and then
rose through increasingly collaborative
efforts till we were hoping to get to
these more interesting things where they
had to answer questions about their
teammates to figure out which one's had
to go to stations or find objects
together and then ultimately create
media together so in the actual app they
could look at the leaderboard to tell
every time they had been moved up and
then again there were bolts so this is
an example of a bolt right here where
every bolt they received had a negative
and positive charge as we called it so
they could do something that positively
impacted their team and potentially
another team or negatively impacted
another team and that was a choice that
they had to make and so all of these
messages about breakthroughs and bolts
were received by every member of the
team via link and so yeah so just a
really quick note on onboarding which
was the week long process before the
actual game so we placed these posters
across the two buildings which we were
really lucky to have an awesome graphic
designer to put together these kind of
communist propaganda posters that said
either you can access or it's just fun
and games and I think we found that
pretty quickly we've gotten total
coverage just from those posters we put
them in front of all of the doors and
really quickly a lot of people we're
asking just what a she was and you know
in that regardless of success so here
you can see three different places that
it was up around the buildings near the
kitchens near the doors and then in
high-traffic areas and then we also put
up these onboarding stations so people
would see the
r EG logo going up and down on this
tablet and then if they swipe their
badge or she told them to do they could
say yes or no if they wanted to know
more information about it and then get
signed up to learn more about it so that
was kind of our main onboarding process
and we found that we had about a hundred
people sign up but you know and also
just uh we had to further our awesome
graphic design help our design a logo
and then we designed a hat and jumpsuits
so we were kind of walking around the
buildings in these jumpsuits and I think
I was referred to as jumpsuit guy for a
long time afterwards and so we had we
actually even had a ukulele player come
and kind of create more mystery but we
found at this point people like the the
Isha buzz had saturated people already
wondering where she was and so we had
people come by our office wanting to
know more we would give them stickers or
different promotional materials but we
kind of had different reactions to this
process so this is really cool this was
some fan art that was done during the
first during the onboarding week so you
can see the eec logo here in the
distances skype link making connections
and they doing it with the skype and
lync logos which was really cool to us
that people that you know they got it on
a higher level even if they didn't
actually know what a she was at that
point so you know people were intrigued
but there was a lot of different
reactions some people really got into
that mystery and we're really excited by
it which was really cool some people saw
the posters wonder what it was and just
out of my appt sight out of mind and two
weeks later they still had no idea that
easy was even running some people were
scared to join they just felt nervous
about it some people were really
intrigued but really annoyed that we
wouldn't tell them what it was um so you
know did we reach our target audience is
a big thing that I've been thinking
about afterwards because you know as I
mentioned earlier people play games for
a lot of different reasons and mystery
and whimsy
is not a the reason for a lot of people
it is for some people but this kind of
mysterious background and onboarding
process is something that's very popular
in a RGS like I mentioned the Beast I
love bees it was all about this mystery
and this thing that you uncovered and
not to take away from that but I i
wonder if we had been more explicit
about some of the things we had done if
we would actually would have gotten a
lot more people that would have been
interested in this collaborative team
based game and know that it wasn't
something that was potentially dangerous
or weird or etc so I think if I could do
one thing about the onboarding different
I would just try to find a way to let
people know a little more clearly what
the game was and to temper that you know
we were in this difficult position that
you know Donald said to me there is a
possibility that somebody could ask us
to take all of this down day one so we
were in this tough point of trying to
find a way to get people interested and
motivated without being in people's
faces you know and like I said I think
we got about we got a hundred people to
sign up to me I think the buildings hold
roughly 500 people and based off of
walking around it seems like there's
probably three or four hundred people in
the buildings right now especially over
vacation time so this you know that's a
reasonable percentage to be catching
okay so looking at the actual results of
the experiment just to reiterate our
original objective was a two-week
experiment where players are randomly
assigned to teams of strangers to
compete so when they came in the first
day I sent an email at the beginning of
the first day telling them to come by
and receive their package to help them
explain what this game was since they
didn't know at that point and they got
packages that look like this and inside
was a sheet with the rules and a letter
a big plastic colored letter which I
told them that they had to hang on to
because it would come into the game
later and there was also a sticker
involved
and we created dl's so that the teams
could communicate via email and Link and
then we just told them to figure it out
and have fun I tried really hard not to
be explicit about go do this go do X or
Y &amp;amp; Z and you know I brought it I
through this up with rewards because
ultimately like we mentioned in the
video we were looking for meaningful
game that has intrinsic rewards so here
are a few pictures of what the actual
reward swore in the game a foam rubber
cow skull with our logo driven drawn on
and marker lanterns bags wooden ducks
with stickers on them so people were not
playing this because they were going to
get gift certificates or you know
external rewards that were of value
there our rewards were essentially
trinkets that had to do with the game
and enjoying the game itself so looking
at the results people liked it that was
really really cool it's really scary as
a game designer to put a game out there
know that people might not like it and
people played which was also very cool
this is a picture of two different teams
you can't see the station which is back
here but both of these teams are trying
to coordinate a breakthrough at the same
time at different stations so they both
needed two people at the station at the
same time and they both had to be at the
same station randomly so that was a big
reward you know there's a lot of things
I would do differently which we'll get
to in a second but we had players and
that was a big relief you know at first
people really curious about what you she
is this message got sent out at UC at 11
on the first day 729 was our first day
and so this was kind of like I said
whenever a team got a breakthrough
challenge or bolts a link message would
get sent from the EC account to all of
the players
and see you can see here all of these
people for the first time getting this
message and then email link messaging
back to Ishii wondering what the heck
she is so people were really curious to
get in to figure out what was going on
but you know pretty quickly they begin
to organize and to figure out what the
goal was and how that goal had to be
achieved and and more players you know
we started off I said we had 100 people
come in and say they were interested but
we'd get more players both weeks as we
went on people asking to sign up because
they would see their either people in
their neighborhood or their friends you
know achieving things so this is an
email that was sent out after the first
team got you know the trophy of the game
which was the horns of Ishii so he's
sending an email out to his whole team
letting him know and then a couple of
guys from his neighborhood wanted to
join up subsequently from that and that
its height we had eight employees
simultaneously collaborating
collaborating on achieving the next
breakthrough so they had two people at
four different stations across the two
buildings which is you know okay so
pretty as a very difficult amount of
people to coordinate and so for the
first week just to be clear on all of
these dl's I'd also put our account so i
was able to kind of monitor a lot of the
communication just by being a part of
that group so i could see these the
emails as they were sending out the link
message and stuff so people use link
people use skype people you out look
they even use the amur to try to come
together and figure out how to
collaborate so you know we gave them a
couple of those tools for them to be
able to do that and we just let them
figure it out by themselves so and then
again speaking to the idea of trying to
teach them about the neighborhoods you
know the first couple of times people
engaged with breakthroughs that told
them they had to go to a specific
station they were completely confused as
to what stations were what these things
meant because a lot of people in the
building's only knew the name of their
neighborhood so they knew they live they
we're in motor sports or cloud room or
off-ramp but they didn't know that sit
and spin and weathered wall etc existed
and what we found was that teams
actually made cheat sheets that told
them about all the different
neighborhoods in there these are two
different teams they made a physical
cheat sheet that they passed out to
their teammates and this one sent an
email to everyone just letting them know
where all the neighborhoods were and
this is actually my favorite pictures a
picture of an asset senior you actually
in principle GPM collaborating for and
showing off their trophy and the thing
that I actually like about this picture
the most is that they asked me to take
it it wasn't me documenting it they were
proud and they sent this out to the
Edison's list you know showing that
their team had taken the horns of ye Shi
back so this is I think you know proof
of the fact that a game can create that
culture between teammates who exist who
none of these people even knew each
other before the game started and there
proudly taking a picture together and I
think that really speaks to the employee
engagement that we got from the people
that play and yeah so we had had a
really strong first week and then we had
a problem you know in the middle of the
summer and just talking to some of my
players because whenever there was a
small bug going on people would pop by
if they had an idea about the game
people would often come by the eec
office and just talking to my players I
found that roughly a third of our core
players at the end of week one we're
going on vacation for a week to which
was kind of a lot so we tried we thought
about it and we were trying to figure
out a way to make the game sustainable
because the problem was we had really
made our design we had tried to beat it
out for two weeks experience and when
you're balancing a game you know those
numbers and the really tricky to figure
out especially because it was a bit of a
guessing game because we couldn't play
test it so even though we had designed
it to be a two-week experience we
decided that we would rerun are one we
game because the idea of the
replayability allowed for that so we
came up with this neutrons that would be
organized by the neighborhoods the wings
that they were set in in the buildings
and rather than create dl's again to
really help them out we said okay this
time you're on your own we're not giving
you tools you guys have seen it a little
bit you figure it out and we also said
that if you don't want to experiment el
us that they wanted to continue playing
the second week so if they didn't tell
us what neighborhood they were part of
there were no longer part of the
experience which was really interesting
because you would expect all of your top
players to continue playing the people
that have done the most connections but
we actually found that there was a lot
of people would only made say one
connection to connections three
connections the first week they still
really wanted to keep playing which
really speaks to the fact that something
like this can engage a lot of people
even if they're not directly involved in
the gameplay so it can improve the
workplace culture and environment just
by the awareness of it rather than the
specific playing of it so this is our
this is our trophy the second week well
the sea shells were an additional touch
not made by me but we found that the
second week when players had to mobilize
their own co-workers some rose to the
challenge and some didn't so we had a
slight drop off in gameplay versus the
first week but we still had a pretty
high level and so it was really I don't
have as much documentation of it because
I wasn't a part of dl's because as far
as I know they didn't exist I didn't
create them but we definitely saw a lot
more coordination and when people are
working from the same neighborhood
oftentimes that can be non digital
communication to get things started so
just looking at some of the numbers
these are kind of our high-level numbers
from the two weeks so just that
connection of getting up swiping your
badge we had 2357 in total 1295 of those
the first week in a little ass the
second week this is kind of we did this
chart of
our connections by the hour and so what
we found is that we had a lot of a
little spike around lunch and then
usually we'd have big spikes around the
afternoon and towards the end of work so
kind of like tea time tea time players
if you will breakthroughs the leveling
up this collaborative act that you'd
have to do we had 93 the first week in
61 the second week and then bolts you
can see we had 20 the first week in 11
the second week and this is a
distribution of days so we had a couple
of days that got a little crazy and just
to clarify really quickly on both it was
every time somebody made a connection
they had a one in 20 chance of getting
given a bolt so so the amount of players
we had 58 players in total we had 43 the
first week in 31 the second week and
obviously there's some overlap of people
that kept playing the first week and
then new players the second week as well
and we found that our players if you're
familiar with distribution laws you know
we had our high players up here and then
we had our fall down to a lot of players
who made of just a few connections over
time which is pretty similar to what you
would expect from a distribution of
players and how much different people
are committed to it so i did a
quantitative and qualitative survey that
i sent out to all of the players at the
end and so i just wanted to share with
you all some of the feedback from that
so we found that pretty definitively
people learned a lot about felt they
learned about the building's we've got
pretty good feedback about that oh so
there's an interesting thing about the
people i feel like looking at the people
who filled out this survey the ones that
played a lot felt like they got a lot
out of the games and the people who
didn't play that much but still fill up
filled out the survey didn't feel like
they got much out of the game which is
where you'll see some of the people
filled out the survey didn't really play
that much and so they didn't really feel
like you know
they met new people because they didn't
they didn't really play as much and
that's something that we kind of see
across the board with playing a she and
enjoying Ichi by and large positive i
would say we'll get to this a little bit
more later the question of the distract
from work and you can see that's roughly
the same as the people that enjoyed it
so it was definitely balanced in a way
that it took too much time from the
workplace and that is actually probably
a fault it's not probably a fault it is
a fault of mine as the designer which
I'll get to later um people seemed again
divided about the length of the game and
I think that this also spoke to people
who didn't really engage with it but
people that did and we find that as well
with people seeing themselves playing it
over a long period of time some people
were really interested in that and some
people were not interested in that so
you know I think the interesting thing
when I'm summing up not just a
quantitative but the qualitative data is
that people just wanted more from it you
know they were really excited by the
potential one of the things that just to
summarize kind of the bigger the broader
trends of the qualitative data that I
got people really enjoyed collaboration
meeting new people playing with their
teams achieving in that fashion which is
you know great because that was one of
our huge goals people wanted the game to
be more complex they wanted to get to
those points of you know answering
questions making media they wanted to
solve puzzles they wanted it to be
richer than just signing in at stations
and that's great I really wanted it to
be richer than that too and this was a
really interest we want interesting
point people kind of wanted a smaller
footprint option that was like hey I'm
really busy right now I don't want to be
getting an IM telling me that this is
happening right now I don't want to be
getting five or ten emails in the course
of five minutes when I'm really busy I
see you know it's almost like they
wanted like a mute button on the game
for when they had the call of work um
and you know speaking again to the
mystery some people wanted a little bit
clear goals and why people should play
to help incentivize others which is
understandable when a tough balance
because we kind of wanted the game to
get richer and not tell them everything
that was going to happen but people
genuinely reacted very strongly towards
the mystery and the branding so you know
looking at these points together it's
it's a tough balance to find and we
didn't quite find it but there was a lot
of positive points you know and it's
actually you know as a designer you get
these things where people say I want it
to be more complex I want a smaller
footprint option I want clear goals
that's great because you want to have
bad feedback because I think that
ultimately speaks that people wanted
more from the experience and you know
this was experiment that we had such a
short amount of time to run and when I
look at this feedback I see people
wanting it to be more meaningful than it
was and that's something I can agree
with and I think that that speaks well
to what it could potentially be in the
future so here's just kind of a set of
my conclusions and things that I learned
so we had a really difficult time
because it's very difficult to play test
something like this because you don't
have all the players running around or
predict the amount of players that we
were going to have so i think we had on
the on the fourth day of the first week
the teams had push past where we had
play tested beyond and then bug started
happening because we just had not had
that option to kill those bugs there for
your design specifically like looking at
the database needs to be as adaptable as
possible and andy limit is Einar did a
great job of making it at design as you
know adaptable as possible so things
that we needed to tailor immediately as
the game came up could be for example
from that 100 players that we started
with we initially had 10 teams of 10 I
just divided them into the 10 teams and
then on the first day it became really
clear that the amount of players that we
had playing that were poor we needed to
have less fewer teams
that people could collaborate together
so when the first day we were able to
switch from 10 teams 24 really easily so
this was a really difficult one and what
I was talking about earlier i really
wanted people to play my game I was
really frightened that nobody would play
but a game the successful in the
workplace is not a game that people want
to play all the time and i ended up
balancing the numbers and skewing the
design to incentivize more and more
gameplay as opposed to the amount of
gameplay that might be more feasible to
have run long term in a workplace for
example we had this rule set in that
after your team got to a certain level
there would be an amount of time that
you would have to wait between
connections and initially the smallest
number was five minutes and then we go
to ten and then you go to 15 and i got
super scared the first day because it
wasn't a lot of play and i dropped that
number down to one and two so it's just
like please blame my game but as some of
the players pointed out that super
incentivize people that could just play
as much as possible for their teams to
win and it was not really a game about
skill and creation and you know it was
about collaboration in terms of getting
time getting timed events together but
it wasn't about collaboration in terms
of making things together or thinking
about skype and linked together or you
know some of the ideas that we had like
that they would have to create something
with Legos or just take pictures and
make media we miss out on some of those
Richard things and you know part of it
was there and part of it I would sit had
in there but as a game designer you have
to look past your desire or I want as
much play as possible for this to be
successful too what is that workplace
game that is successful what is the best
game that's meaningful in the workplace
and to bring up a point that are brought
up again just because employees aren't
playing doesn't mean that they aren't
involved and we saw
there was a lot of positive engagement
from people even if they weren't
actually playing the game people aware
of it people wanting to stay involved
you know that had never made more than
one connection so I found that to be a
really positive and rewarding experience
that you don't need to play to benefit
from this experience and then so like I
said earlier we had created this
two-week experience but some of the
initial Signal Hill initiatives and some
of our goals for the experience were
really long term ideas and then we were
trying to put them into a two-week
experience and some of the stuff kind of
was a jumble in that regard you know the
answering questions about yourself was
really a long-term idea that we could
provide rewards and create affinity
groups based up you know if every if ten
people answer that their van Halen fans
that was our go-to was if they like van
Halen vans and they also like cats then
we put all the van Halen cat fans in a
room and have them figure out what they
had in common and then give them some
kind of reward so answering questions
about yourself was kind of a long term
design goal and we kind of pigeon-holed
it into this design so there's a big
difference between what a long-term
issue looks like and a one-week you she
looks like and the design that we had
here was kind of borrowed from both of
those I think um it was really hard to
run EG by myself and i really want your
sympathy and understanding because we
would you know we had these old tablets
that would you know kind of flake out
every once in a while and you know i was
really lucky i had an awesome developer
and andy limb and you know i couldn't
give him all the stuff that i needed to
give him in order to get all of the
right design to the app necessarily or
you know to make sure that i was there
for everything um so I think you know
you kind of need to game runners for
this we needed a little bit more team
support to kind of
pull this off it was a very exhausting
experience from my side during the
actual experience so I felt like I
couldn't leave because potentially one
of the card readers were very inclined
to Fritz out so they had to be woken up
again so I felt like I could never leave
which was a tricky thing and hopefully
if we have better tech in the next
version that is not really going to be a
problem but you know that being said we
did do a lot of good database design and
the infrastructure for what we actually
have to embed for eg if this went back
into the sky buildings or someone else
is actually pretty minimal you know the
stations that we set up was an Ikea
table and a tablet with two part readers
and we could easily get rid of the
terrible idea table and there would be a
lot of other places where we could put
them in I was actually really surprised
that people that were in the
neighborhoods where we put our stations
nobody ever complain when I went in
there people hardly even noticed me
sometimes there was a little bit of
ribbing i told i was told people would
joke with other people about it but you
know putting this into an area is not
that hard you know it'd be pretty easy
to install this anywhere you know what
like i said i think we would need
another pass on the game design the
graphic design and the development but
you know if you got two people just
being aware of the game part time I
think you could run this most anywhere
on the Redmond campus so just to
reiterate I think that you she was
really successful at making this that
hitting this like most impact core
function really benefiting workplace
culture through the game and the fact
that we saw these people come together
that didn't know each other from all of
these different backgrounds in the
company was really rewarding and as much
as I would like to change and prove
about the game I think that we saw that
it can be in success in this environment
and kind of finally I'm just like really
grateful for Donald for bringing me here
just and to be able to be given the
opportunity to positively impact so many
people just on the last day I actually
had a ton of players come by and just
you know say things and wonder what
about what the future was of eg so you
know I think it really did positively
impact a lot of people and I feel really
lucky to have that opportunity and just
in a final thank you like to thank
Donald who brought me here ross smith
the director of tessa skype who was like
our big sponsor and helped us set that
groundwork and andy who was my developer
and just you know i would have been a
lot of trouble without him and you know
i gave him he made he had to make a lot
of figure out a lot of things just based
off of stuff that i gave him that was
not of enough information and yeah he
did an awesome job and then finally to
all the people that played a sheep
because you know he was designed to
exist through them and it did and they
did a lot of awesome things so yeah that
is a she so now open up to any questions
that you guys have
questions
we have a captivated audience um I have
a question for you okay you played a lot
with infrastructure with with doing
using employee information in some ways
did you run into any issues with using
that data and are there other aspects of
the data or ways you could use employee
data do you think to enhance the
experience well we in all of our
messaging we told them up front that we
wouldn't be giving our data to anybody
else we wouldn't be showing anybody else
in the company like x y&amp;amp;z about them we
we didn't take a whole lot of
information from them we just used their
alias and their email and we were trying
to learn more things like in terms of
you know their favorites and things that
they like so you might provide them with
a richer experience um you know would be
interesting how much like if this got
integrated if you could involve up with
people's calendars know when it might be
better for them to sync up or something
like that I think if a company
organization afforded that opportunity
could help make things more customized
and personal in a way that didn't seem
like it was invading somebody's privacy
ready uh so I want to thank everyone who
came out to to hear the talk I want to
thank everyone else out in Internet's
land present and future for listening
and learning about what we're doing you
can reach out to me or to avi man if you
have more questions and yes a special
thanks to Andy for for helping out with
the engineering and for Ross who is
really our champion who's been for more
than ten years the champion of serious
games here at Microsoft the champion of
serious games at Microsoft and who made
this possible and my final revelation
I'll reveal the Easter egg inside of
side of a she you've all been wondering
about many of you've seen this this logo
and you have probably because we talked
about signal hill and this is
in signal hill initiative so you might
have heard that this is like the signal
hill and this is like the bulb of the
radio transmission that Marconi sent I'm
here to tell you today that that's
actually not true that this is actually
Russ Smith skull so yes and and it's and
that easy is the idea that that sprang
from his head like a tina from the head
of Zeus so with that thank you all very
much and thank you a beam on you really
freakin fabulous I'm really pleased so
