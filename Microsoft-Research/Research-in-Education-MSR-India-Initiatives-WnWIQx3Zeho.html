hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
and the next speaker is from the same
team so far all of you would have seen
the regular format of a classroom in the
last maybe 100 years a teacher comes to
a class teachers and you as students
just take notes go back and do your
homework or whatever so we are talking
about how to use technology in
classrooms how to bring about a change
how do you use technology outside the
classroom or within the classroom and
also how technology can connect you as
students and help you learn more and
then thought that research connector see
that will not be talking but he is going
to talk about it
you
okay thanks with you so actually I don't
really need to do a talk on mag because
half of it was covered by on and then in
the other half of the video but even
then for the next 15-20 minutes I'll
keep it short because I know you guys
are getting restless and you've been
sitting in this room for a while so I'll
keep it really short and I will talk
about two initiatives that actually
really matter to you so since morning
I'm sure after hearing to all these
speakers many of you must have been
inspired and you must be thinking that
all right I mean now we know these
research talks and subjects how can we
really connect with this kind of
research and what can we do to
participate you know actively to be part
of the ecosystem and figure out if we
want to pursue a career in research or
not so before I actually jump into the
two topics I will tell you something
very interesting that we really figured
out very recently so while we were
preparing this talk with the help of my
colleagues here as well we thought that
since both of these initiatives are
online it may be very interesting to
know and find out if there have been
studies and surveys around this
particular question how many hours do
students spend online every day so what
do you think how many hours you spend
online every day one are for sure not
one are 24 hours okay all right good
exactly so this is the same amount of
confusion we had as well so we went
online did some search and what we found
was something like this so do you see
the spike there that is where most of
you belong right so it is it is
surprising and and what is more
interesting is that line 5 plus ours
every day so when it comes to taking
practical exams in your classrooms and
labs then you do not have internet but
when it comes to doing stuff on the
internet you spend 5 + hours every day
now obviously this led to another very
interesting question a very you know
obvious question that we were very
interested in finding out and that
question was all right you spend 5 plus
every day what do you really do on the
internet you know 45 des arts on the
Internet
so obviously the list was long and
obviously all of your smiling so I know
don't worry I'm not going to expose any
of you I will I will keep it you know
undercover but then the first I mean
okay let's start from three so according
to you what do you think is the third
most popular thing that students do
online take a guess louder louder I know
you have not got none she will get lunch
she can be louder social networking all
right okay let's see what do I have so
the third most popular thing by the way
before I put out these facts and figures
I have taken all of these facts and
figures from quality school rankings who
actually conducted a survey last year
and that did this service specially for
students in India because you know a lot
of students actually keep on saying that
Internet is a problem and so on and so
forth so the third most popular thing
that students do is watching videos
online the second one so this is skype
which is obviously so microsoft event
but people spend time chatting so the
point is that these five plus arts go in
doing these two things in that order now
what do you think is the most popular
thing that students do okay you're right
oops what is that okay so by the way
this person is somewhere in the crowd so
the qantas cards you have just find out
who the person is right the answer is
well okay so that's that's actually
fascinating right so five plus ours
every day doing these kind of things
then before investigating do students
actually study also online so how many
of you study online really what is ready
coursera ok go's new set course around
what goes you study on Coursera ok think
I'll ask you after half an hour alright
cool so interestingly a lot of these
courses that we are available online
like Coursera at X audacity I will not
spend time in explaining what these
courses are because I'm sure you don't
know so you would want to know so what
we really try to investigate is if these
things are available online where does
you know studying online actually figure
on the list so finally somewhere I think
158 200-250 as I don't even remember
where it was we find found out that yes
some people do study online is where ok
so with that motivation we started
investigating further and there are a
bunch of researchers in the mics of
research lab in India who essentially
try to focus on this particular idea and
studied different things they try to
figure out with so many courses
available online and good quality
content available online from top
professors all over the world what does
it really take to get students like you
interested in learning online so with
that particular area we came out with
this project called massively empowered
classrooms so have any of you ever heard
of massively empowered classroom or some
of you have have you ever taken a course
there no okay alright so the next five
minutes I will talk more about massively
empowered classroom and tell you how can
you actively participate because this
coming semester we are actually going to
do something for all of you in Rajasthan
as well so it's going to be very
relevant to you as well so essentially
with massively empowered classrooms we
are trying to do just what I said in the
last 57 minutes we are trying to build a
system that puts together all the
experiences that students typically
anyways go through so for example you
like to interact with your peers you
like to talk to people on facebook you
like to you know merge and mingling with
people socially you like to watch videos
which are engaging you want to interact
with you know what's happening on the
portal and more interestingly and most
importantly you want
content that's really really aligned to
what you study in college right because
most of the students when we were
talking to them they came back and said
but even though these courses which are
available online on this big platforms
big MOOC providers they are very good of
top quality but there are two main
problems one is the level of content is
kind of high it's very tough to
interpret and second is that it's not
really aligned to your curriculum so
even though you know you have lot of
free time but I'm sure a lot of you
spend time doing the other three things
so you don't really care about studying
online so Mac what does it do three main
things it's actually meant to be an
ecosystem it's not just about students
it's meant to be an ecosystem that
includes teachers enables them to use
quality content that you know some top
professors from India have already
created and will be creating it engages
with you students it builds it's built
around an ecosystem as I said where
content is available but it's very
engaging and it's something that you
would like to see and do and also help
institutions improve the overall quality
of education so for example if there's
an institution is facing death of
quality faculty who can teach a
particular course Mac can actually be
very useful in taking up that particular
person helping a new faculty ramp up and
go and deliver so this is not really new
but it's new for you know this part of
the country so we started with Mac
around probably a year ago in fact
exactly a year ago and we have done
three pilots so far so then we started
we did the first pilot with the business
area technological university which is
the based out of Belgium and all the
colleges in Karnataka actually
affiliated to that University so we
rolled out this content that we had on a
course called the design and analysis of
algorithms is that course called the
same here now or something da ok all
right you don't even know the full form
of course fantastic so yeah so we rolled
out this course and it's awesome good
results a lot of students participate a
lot of students watch the videos we
learnt a lot and we actually went back
made some modifications made some you
know did some fine tuning and came back
and the semester after that we rolled
out two pilots one with the
technical university and the other one
with university of pune so all of these
you know the reason we do it with the
universities is because what we are
trying to do with make is align courses
to your local curriculum so all as all
of you would know right if the
university is prescribed one particular
syllabus then generally what you
typically do is you have your chapters
arranged unit why chapter wise and so on
and so forth so that's essentially what
we are trying to do as well so now if
you go to make you will actually see
that the content that's available for
design and analysis of algorithms course
is absolutely aligned chapter wise to
the content and the course that you
study in the class so i'll actually do a
quick video to show you you know how
make works and how can you actually go
and log in so can you play the video
please so this is actually a demo so
don't be disappointed is no sound you
will have to hear to me only so you open
your browser go to m.e see rorg that's
the site URL this is how the page looks
like you can see multiple sections you
can see sign in there you can see social
media integration so the first step is
to actually sign in to sign in you just
you can sign in using your facebook
twitter google whatever handle you have
once you sign into the portal you will
again go back to the landing page and
you will see a lot of sections so the
first thing that you see is quick links
which basically has chapters or lessons
which are most popular among students
all across the country so students are
we watching you know different chapters
back and forth again and again and those
will appear in quick links you go down
you click on your university you will
see a list of colleges so whichever
college you are from you have to go
ahead select that college it's very
central that you select your own college
is not somebody else's because your
faculty is also involved so they will
know who has enrolled so I don't know if
that's good or bad but they will know so
you go register and this is how the
course looks like so as you can see you
of course right now itself this is the
Rajasthan course which is live on the
side and it's arranged
as per units that you study in the
classroom you can skip you can move on
if you this some concept that you
already know you do not really want to
pay attention to you can just go on and
you know do a fast forward on that so
essentially what this lets you do is
watch quality content at your own base
anytime anywhere so in fact in future we
are also coming out with a variant of
make where you will have the ability to
watch the videos offline as well so you
don't really need to log in and you know
be worried about all these issues like
internet and all that so that is
something in the pipeline and a couple
of months you will probably get to know
this has wide social integration this
has forums which are very active so we
have lot of people students as well as
faculty who keep on responding to
questions that you have but the main
objective is to connect you to each
other so we really encourage students to
answer questions from other students and
in case it's beyond all of you then
there's faculty who intervenes and goes
ahead and answers questions so because
we're trying to keep it short I don't
really have not showing you the social
integration bit but essentially whatever
you do on Mac can actually go to
Facebook and social media and vice versa
so if you do something around make on
facebook and you come here do something
on Twitter it will you know again come
back and appear in the Mac page you will
have a profile page which i think is
coming it's loading don't worry there
are incentives also i will talk about
that so these are the forums and we keep
a very close watch on what's happening
on the forums so we want you to
participate be active on these forums
and actually go ahead and do stuff there
is a bunch of cases which we call a quiz
i mean we k c stands for knowledge
checks which are essentially quizzes
which are also available online on the
tool all you have to do is go and from
time to time you specify a window when
you actually have to go and complete a
particle knowledge test and based on
that the incentives which i will talk
about once the demo is over there is an
faq page that you can actually go
through browse through just go on your
eye over it and there's any questions
that you have which we may not be able
to answer today you can actually go
ahead and do
and obviously there's an email that you
can use to contact us so and you
obviously need to sign out towards the
end alright so that's done now what's on
offer right so I already mentioned for
now we have a course that's aligned to
VT you sorry rajasthan technological
university content curriculum i know
there are some universities which don't
follow the ITU curriculum but they are
from what i have heard they are very
close to what I tu teaches so we can
definitely include them as well for now
we only have our tu colleges but we can
work with the universities and have them
listed as well more courses are going to
come we are also working with other
professors in you know different parts
of the country to include more courses
that may be very relevant to you and you
would want to see so those courses will
also come very soon and obviously
quizzes and other things to keep you in
st. device and keep you engaged the most
interesting part I kept this for the
last because I knew you will lose
interest by the time the slide comes so
what's what are the incentives right so
how many of you want certificates by the
way for everything in life okay
everybody this section you don't want
certificates volunteers please note note
taker attendance certificate is also ok
alright so we have be working again we
are exploring this and we are learning
as as the project is maturing but from
what we figured out so far with all the
learnings we've had over the last one
year is that we've created an incentive
model that has something to offer to
everybody so I can Institute level we
are looking at partnering with the
Institute's to run this project
successfully in your campus and to
ensure that you know there is a direct
connect between us and your campus your
faculty and students for faculty members
also faculty members who are going to
help us drive this initiative in this in
that classroom because as I said mech is
about students faculty and management
together so in fact faculty have a huge
role to play here so not only can they
use the content that is available that
is being shipped from us as Microsoft
Research they can also add content which
can be a PDF document a word document of
video file or whatever on top of
whatever is available
and that goes out only to their students
so it's basically something that faculty
have full control on full flexibility on
they can go ahead and create their own
quizzes they can specify from what time
to what time the quiz should be open and
how many students have to take it when
do they take it you can do all that as
well so faculty we really encourage you
to participate and be active I mean feel
free to reach out to all of us in case
there's something you want to clarify on
and for students obviously lot of
certifications two types of
certifications and most importantly
potential research internship
opportunities so I will elaborate on the
students bit the two types of
certificates we have to offer the first
one is a participation certificate that
any of you can get if you score fifty
percent plus marks across the seven
quizzes that will be available from next
tenth of ability until probably end of
April or first week of May so quizzes
will be available all you have to do is
log in very short quizzes or five to six
questions each we encourage you not to
cheat not to take help from your friends
but obviously you will do that that's
okay for now we have our ways of
catching you so we will do all that is
when but those side of the kids you can
go ahead and you know work for then
there are completion certificates if you
score seventy percent plus marks across
all the seven quizzes so you can score
zero in one and you really scored high
on the other one so that your average of
schools is seventy percent plus you get
a completion certificate and students
who do really well not only do they have
an opportunity to one another
distinction certificate they also have
an opportunity of getting linked to a
research internship opportunity at some
premier research organization so I will
elaborate on research connector in the
next five minutes that's why I will not
really you know touch on that right of
it so that's about neck I hope you guys
got some idea about what make is met is
available online the website is Emmy CR
go to RG the second initiative I'm going
to talk about is called research
connected so on and then briefly
mentioned about it in the talk before
this and the motivation behind creating
something like research connector was
actually three fold one was whenever we
went to colleges and we trade events
like tech with star
and did workshops and seminars and
different colleges and you know did
campus with its we asked lot of students
that why why do they not consider a
career in research so some answers we
got again I think all of you would
probably agree many of them came back
and said they don't know what
researchers they are curious about
research there's no awareness there is
no way of you know getting aware of what
researchers they said that no
opportunity so even if I know what
research is even if I know what's what's
the area I want to potentially work in
there as there is no way i can actually
go ahead and you know really experienced
something real and the third there is no
way to reach out to people i mean people
hardly know what researchers do and who
researchers are and how to connect with
them and reach out to them so with this
motivation we thought obviously we
cannot do tech which time every city
every day we have other things to do is
well so we thought we'll create
something online that has a wider reach
and that's available to you again for
any time anywhere viewing you can
actually go ahead and view stuff do
stuff at your own pace own leisure and
maybe you will have that spark with time
and realize what you want to do and go
get hooked up so site essentially i
don't have the site right now it's all
available online you can all log in
right now eating the lunch as well if
you want it's www.deezer.com sat
answering those three questions that I
had on the previous slide so one we want
to create research awareness so by
research how do we create such a Venice
we have videos of researchers talking
about who they are what kind of work do
they do you know what is going to happen
next what the problems they are working
on all these kind of things all these
videos are available online we have
sourced them from multiple sources and
we actually partnered with ACM India as
well then we want to connect you to real
opportunities in research now this is
very interesting right so how many of
you look for projects and internship the
real okay so what do you do typically
write random emails to whoever you know
in the world and say okay I want an
internship and project true false true
okay see that was anonymous good so yes
so that is again not something that
happens only in jaipur rajasthan that's
true for the entire country anyway you
go to this is the
so we thought that in India again there
are lot of good institutions there lot
of research organizations which work on
some you know problems which are really
important and researchers were very well
known can we do something to connect you
to them and at the same time ensure that
you get an opportunity to go and
experience what they're doing and
participate in the research that they're
doing so research connector essentially
lets you do that so the idea behind the
opportunity section in recent research
connector is listening down projects
that we get from researchers from
Institute's like IITs in professors in
these colleges who are working on good
problems great problems but they're
looking at students from you know nah
IIT kind of colleges to come help them
and when I say health not that you know
you have to go and buy vegetables for
them but help means really participate
in active research so he started this
this initiative also a year ago actually
we launched it at large loss tech based
on and then announced it at last I
Twista and over the last one year we
have seen some great response so in
terms of hits that we have heard on the
side we saw some 50 k plus people
visiting the site over the course of
last seven eight months in terms of
research opportunities because we
started opening up to more colleges and
more institutes and more IIT professors
we had some 20 people from colleges
which probably even none of us would
know also from different parts of the
country students from beast colleges
actually went ahead and applied for
opportunities which are available online
and for every project opportunity there
was an average around 200 applications
and the students who got selected went
to that IIT or that research
organization spent like a month or two
with these professors there came back
later continued on the problem they were
working on and ultimately lot of
students have actually been able to
publish papers in top conferences and
doing very well so I don't have this so
in terms of next steps just to summarize
I promised you I will be very quick and
I will keep my promise in terms of next
steps this is what you need to do for EM
ECR that is massively empowered
classroom you need to go to the website
you have to select your college first of
all select RT you
find your college go and roll and take
the quizzes on time so once you sign up
for the course you will automatically
start getting notifications and I
encourage you to do it right away
because the first quiz i think is going
to start as i said around tenth of every
it's okay if you miss the first quiz but
then it becomes tougher for you to score
that fifty percent is seventy percent
from the remaining quizzes so the
earlier it is the better it is so go
back n roll even if you don't watch
videos today it's okay you can watch it
over the weekend know whatever whenever
you have time might do it the second one
research connector URL is research
connector dotnet the site is actually
self-explanatory if you go there you
will see different tabs projects
opportunities in forums go ahead and
feel free to do you know whatever
questions you have asked people there
are I think three for open positions
right now to from IIT Bombay one from
iit guwahati and one from a world back
funded center at bassett in bangalore so
if you any of you are still looking for
projects and opportunities and
internships go ahead apply and you never
know you may just get selected and be
there so that's it thank you and our dr.
