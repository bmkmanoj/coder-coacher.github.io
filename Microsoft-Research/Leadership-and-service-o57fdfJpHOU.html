time on on sort of leadership activities
both Department leadership i became a
department chair and national leadership
sort of research initiatives and that's
been really rewarding to honest I think
the while the impact of students
surpasses the impact of anything the
impact of the leadership activities
surpasses any research paper I ever
wrote any collection of research paper
as I ever rode and again the reason is
the multiplicative factor if you're a
department chair or a lab director and
you do it right you're providing air
cover for a huge number of really bright
people who can do unbelievable things if
you just managed to get the bureaucracy
to leave them alone and let them do what
they're best at and that's kind of the
job and similarly in the National work I
do the goal is to get Congress and the
American people to realize the value of
what we do so that we have more
resources to do it
