hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
terrific let's go ahead and get started
so thank you all for coming
welcome to the MS are visiting speaker
series before we get started let me make
a few notes first of all thank you Amy
graves and Michelle Reagan ransom for
organizing this event we've got a great
speaker today so I'm really looking
forward to that also I wanted to make a
note
my name's Ryan brush I work in gfs
global foundation services for Microsoft
but I also teach at University of
Washington
so what's fun about this is I'm actually
gonna use part of the book that you see
in the back as a textbook for this
upcoming semester so from October
through June we offer data data analysis
certificate program through University
of Washington and this is basically in
the evenings Mondays and Thursdays if
you any of you are interested in
learning more about the program please
feel free to reach out be happy to share
details about that so so as we get
started let me read the short blip about
John Forman so John Forman he's the
chief data scientists for mailchimp.com
where he leads a data science product
development effort called the email
Genome Project as an analytics
consultant John has created data science
solutions for the coca-cola company
Royal Caribbean International
InterContinental Hotels Group and the
Department of Defense the IRS and the
FBI so John's book data smart using data
science to transform information into
insight is now out from Wiley and it's
possibly the most legal fun you can have
with spreadsheets so
looking forward to today's session and
without further ado I'll turn it over to
John thank you so I'm John and
appreciate the introduction right like
Ryan said I am a recovering consultant
that was all those projects he listed
office when I was a consultant and a
management consulting firm also before
this talk I had a huge lunch over like
near building 99 so I'm just gonna be
burping through the entire talk so
that'll just happen I'll try to keep it
quiet but food was delicious and I'm an
Operations research guy so operations
research is math applied to decision
making and it's kind of a piece of data
science before data science was sexy
right operations research has been
around for a long time
since World War two looking is you know
how do we schedule convoys things like
that so it's an analytics practice
that's been around for a long time but I
left management consulting and went to
MailChimp so I don't know how many of
you all know what MailChimp is or you
use MailChimp but it is the world's
largest I see a thumbs up in the back
there someone use MailChimp yes so it's
the world's largest email service
provider so MailChimp is a is a website
through which you would you upload your
email list and create a newsletter to
send to that list and we'd help you do
that and help you track opens clicks
ecommerce transactions that started in
that newsletter so we send about 10
billion emails every month and then we
track a bunch of interactions with those
emails and so there's another you know
four billion interactions coming in
opens clicks unsubscribes abuse reports
all that kind of stuff we actually send
a lot to hotmail so you all get a lot of
email from us we have about 280
employees in Atlanta so we're all in the
south that's why I say y'all you'll get
used to it by the end of this talk so I
was a math guy and was used to working
with large organizations before coming
to MailChimp and so my experience doing
analytics was always that there would be
this
other analytics team I'd be working with
and everyone be analytics all the time
and when I went to a startup it was kind
of weird I met Greg Greg as a designer
at MailChimp and then I met Fabio email
template designer margov is a designer
and I met Dave designer Caleb designer
gen designer suggesting our t-shirt
designer he designs t-shirts like this I
like that shirt they make things like
this billboard outside of our
headquarters this is the death metal
billboard it was eventually replaced
with an 80s metal billboard and these
are our action figures for Freddy
our mascot our vinyl figures and so this
became immediately very confusing for me
I met Aaron who's our head of UX he's a
very famous designer wrote a book called
designing for emotion and this has been
our CEO a man of many talents he also
has a design background and very quickly
I realized that most companies are not
in the business of analytics right when
you hear about data science in Alixe
these days you know the same companies
are in the headlines a lot of it seems
to have to do with tracking personal
data and doing ad targeting I was going
to a company that did not do that right
they had some other product that people
paid monthly fees for to submit so use
our product
what does analytics look like there when
I quickly realized was that all these
people all these designers they were
after one goal right then one improved
product by improving the users
experience of that product so what I
realized is if I'm gonna do analytics at
MailChimp I'm gonna have to get behind
this right this is the goal of everyone
I kept encountering so what does that
look like for me what does it look like
for a math guy to use my skill set which
is not Photoshop to improve this website
so I went online and started looking at
other websites right so this is one I
found this is a data science product I
thought okay I can do something like
this this is from a restaurant review
website I guess they review other things
restaurants but they released this
heatmap thing where I can pick a city
and Atlanta is not on there so I pick
San Francisco hey Seattle made the list
that's good for y'all
and then you can pick a keyword but you
can't type in any word they're curated
per city right so if you pick Paris like
baguette comes up but if you pick San
Francisco hipster comes up and then you
click it and it colors a heat map in
saying Oh for a review data all the
hipster all the reviews talking about
hipsters are all in the mission so
that's the mission in San Francisco and
so looking at this you kind of realized
okay this actually doesn't improve my
experience of the product right all it
does is it sort of flexes analytics
muscle that hey we have all this data
we've taken all this textual data and
put it in a heat map to say okay people
talked about hipsters now I'm showing it
back to you because we think it's cool
right and they've in fact selected the
words that I can play with to pair it
back something to me that I kind of
already knew to begin with that's how
they curate is they oh yeah that's
exactly where hipsters are isn't that
cool so I didn't want to do this you
know this doesn't look like it improves
the user experience of the product at
all this is more improved I don't know
impressing maybe the press or you know
someone before I go public this is
another example it's from a famous
professional social network this was
their big first data science project
that sort of kicked off data science is
sexy a few years ago so in this social
network there's me down here I can
visualize all my connections and a map
and they've they've graphed them in
these clusters this is probably using
modularity maximization which I talked
about in my book yeah and so I can see
okay I've got these people in orange
these are people I knew in Boston I've
got these people down here in green
these are people I worked with a Booz
Allen so I've got these different
clusters I already know why these
clusters exist right I can just look at
the graph is like yeah I worked with
those people there and I work with those
people there and it would just cool with
those people there so really all you're
telling me is things I already know and
I can highlight someone's name and it
gives me their name
so now I've seen their name twice so
it's it's really sexy looking right but
when you get into it it's not improving
the product in any way it just looks
really good it takes the data and just
sort of parrots it back to you and tells
you things you already know but it
doesn't a sexy way so if this isn't what
I should be doing I'll leave this kind
of stuff to the designers what should I
be doing so I thought okay well if I
can't find good examples maybe I'll look
at the toolset that's out there maybe if
I look at tools or techniques all the
I'll get some insight into what I should
be working on so what is the Big Data
data science technology landscape look
like all this look at all the tools I
found this slide which is a nightmare
but then there's version 2.0 of the
nightmare so this is version 2.0 and
this is still a couple of years old
actually I suspect it's getting even
more crowded it's like bubbles within
bubbles within bubbles so what I
discovered is that most analytics teams
do something like this right
you start by hearing about some tools
okay we need to use to do we have to I
don't know why we have to use to do
choose your tools first you know a
fraction of what's possible because
you've seen some other website do
something that involved a graph or they
wrote a blog post that was really cool
and then you just kind of flail about
looking for something to do right and
try to figure out what does this mean
for me and then in order to impress your
boss there's another step you create an
infographic right so this is the the
last step in analytics nirvana you've
collected some data and a new tool that
you paid a lot of money for to save it
there even though your data wasn't that
big and you probably could have put in a
sequel database but now I'm going to
create an infographic out of it to prove
that it was all worth it
and that I should keep my job so what I
would propose this there's another way
to go about analytics and it goes
something like this know what's possible
first so find out what data you have
available to you both internally and
externally if there's some external data
that has some bearing on your life but
most of the time it's going to be
internal data right so okay I got these
databases these databases these
databases Marge over there has a spray
she rarely shares with anyone but I
could use that to you know kind of take
a survey of all the things you have
around the company for Microsoft that's
going to be insane but at least in your
small world what are the data sources
you have at your disposal what
techniques could I possibly use right so
a basic understanding of okay what's
forecasting how is that different from
predictive modeling how's that different
from data mining how is that different
from optimization so it's kind of a
basic idea of okay these are the various
things people do with data in order to
solve problems and then understanding
some of the technologies right like oh
if I want to do predictive modeling
maybe I'll use R if I just want to do
some basic data vis maybe I would use
well I can use Aragon or Python or maybe
I could even use Excel and just draw a
graph so understanding various
technologies once you have all that down
then identifying problems or
opportunities right so talking with
people for an okay what do you guys need
help with that data could possibly solve
and actually these first two points are
in conversation all the time right you
should always be talking to people
learning what opportunities there are
and you should always be learning about
new stuff you know new data sources you
didn't know existed oh that's a finance
database that know about new
technologies that are coming out new
techniques people are publishing so
that's kind of all in conversation and
tension all the time and then once you
know all right we're gonna solve this
problem this requires theta and we can
solve it here's the data we're going to
use when you use these sources here's
the technologies we're going to use and
here's the techniques we're going to use
and then you solve it so it's sort of a
problem centric approach to data science
right and this is actually why I bought
I wrote this book so data smart this
book is is really not sexy basically I
take the reader through a bunch of
techniques that are sort of the bread
and butter of analytics data science and
I do it in Excel because that's a great
place to learn them it's very sort of
tool ignosi I mean is a tool but you
know it's a it's um the data is always
in your face right so you can say these
are the inputs and I'm gonna put them
through this formula and here the
outputs versus you know using a
programming language like our Python
we're just going to load up a library
and the work is done
for you never actually learned anything
so this book is just meant to teach you
it's kind of like a survey of all the
different techniques that your disposal
and it doesn't just hammer on one a lot
of a lot of books out there seem to
think that artificial intelligence is
gonna solve everything there's a really
sexy technique right now but there's a
bunch of other techniques out there that
that are also very useful
you know outlier detection is one where
you could do artificial intelligence or
you could do some other kind of
technique that maybe that would be
unsupervised so try to take people
through all of them okay so that's my
she'll on analytics and how it should be
done within a company or thin analytics
team or some part of the organization I
want to just give y'all some examples of
what this looks like at MailChimp so I'm
not just kind of blowing smoke like this
we actually try to practice this basic
philosophy and the way I'm going to do
this is this go through we break up the
data science team into sort of four
things that we do we deliver insights
and capabilities insights is just basic
analysis of research so these might be
one-off things where the the result
might be a report or a spreadsheet or a
blog post right and then we build
capabilities which are tools so these
could be internal tools that other teams
can use or external tools that actually
become part of the application right and
so a MailChimp customer could use one of
these tools so we do this internal and
external stuff so we do it for internal
customers which are essentially other
teams we act as an internal consultancy
to other teams and then we do it for
external customers which are our users
that pay us money in the way it
generally breaks down for us has we
spent about 20 percent of our time doing
this basic insect insights and eighty
percent of our time building tools
that's in part because tools are just
more powerful if I can build something
for the application that means that all
of our users can do analytics versus if
I just do it as a one-off then you know
that that one report gets created and
that's it
furthermore we spend a lot of time on
capabilities because they're just harder
to build okay
so I'm just gonna go we're just going to
go left to right and top to bottom so
internal insights I'll give you some
examples this is our customer support
team
they're all in Atlanta it's actually
about half the company
these folks answer chat and email
support right so users write in and say
hey I'm having trouble stinking up my
Shopify website with MailChimp how do I
make this happen these these folks are
the people that are gonna answer that
question and we're adding users very
quickly so in q1 we added 200,000 new
users and this is actually the the
nightshift logo you now have a night
shift yay we're hiring about one new
support employee every day which for a
company that I started there less than
three years ago we had 80 employees now
we're at about 300 so it's it's pretty
rapid for us it's been kind of a shock
but one of the things we're bumping up
against is okay we're now at a size with
six million customers where we have to
do some kind of triage or sorting of who
gets support when what does that look
like right and I think the easy way to
do it would be to say okay we've got
forever free accounts for very small
users so these would be people like oh I
have a fantasy football league and I'm
going to send a newsletter through
MailChimp they might use us should they
get support in the same way that a paid
user does so that would be very simple
way to do it unfortunately what we found
in the data is that 40% of eventually
paid users come into customer support
before they pay us money right so if you
just give a certain type of support or
support faster for people who've already
paid
you're missing a lot of people who would
have paid you money so how do we solve
that problem well one of the things we
could do you'll remember I'm in the
insights section and not in the modeling
and tool section right of this
presentation I could just build a big AI
model to predict paid customers that's
one way to go about this in fact it's
something we toyed with to see how far
we could get this is a quote that I
really like this is from Robert holt
he wrote a paper called very simple
classification rules perform well and
most commonly used data sets and the
basic premise is that you can build a
big AI model to do a lot of things but
single rules often
very well so what's a single rule it's
okay I have this data that comes in
about this user this user looks like
this they do this they do this to do
this let me check one thing and based on
that one check I'm going to say if
they're likely to pay us money so that
would be a single rule those actually
perform very well right a lot of times
people want to jump to the most complex
thing they can do but holds contention
in this paper is that complexity must be
justified people never really think
about the fact that they have to justify
why they're using a really complex
approach and in fact I think probably
hole was probably saying you know you've
got to justify it with better accuracy
or something like that you got to
provide a ROC curve that shows that wow
if we use this complex model we get all
these gains you also need to justify the
additional organizational complexity
right I've worked at a lot of companies
especially as a consultant where my job
was just to build this really complex
thing that the client had asked for and
the sad thing about that is that they'll
often get these really complex things
that they can't out of like man we got
this space-age model the moment the
consultants leave it dies right because
no one else knows how to update it they
asked for too many buttons and knobs and
then immediately forgot what they do and
no one wants to read the documentation
there's an organizational complexity you
can introduce if your model is just
unwieldy I had to build one forecast
model that included a standard deviation
in it and I had to describe to every
single person who's gonna use it what
standard deviation was and the moment I
left the model was mothballed right so
when we think about these models at
MailChimp I have to think okay am I
gonna stick around for this paid free
prediction or is this something I'm
handing to someone else who is that
person how do they keep it up to date in
this particular case the customer was
just a developer and someone and support
right and they were not going to be
keeping any eyes on this
so we analyzed the data and found that
you know what there actually is it's
actually not one rule there are two
rules I can hand you that do a really
good job of ordering customers one is
when you sign up for MailChimp account
what's your email address it's the
domain of free mail domain or is the
domain your own domain
for your business so is it a paid domain
if it's a free male domain you're less
likely to ever pay as money second rule
do you have a list of email addresses to
import into MailChimp if you say no or
if you leave this question blank
you're really not likely to ever pass
money those two questions combined were
really extremely powerful features after
those two questions you know anything
else we added two models helped but
wasn't nearly as powerful as those two
features so we just left it at that we
realized we could get a more accurate
model by including a bunch of other
things I mean you could go out to the
domain of that person's email address
and look at it and use built with to
tell what technologies they built what
is their checkout process yeah you could
do all of these creative things but
who's going to keep that up to date did
we think it had a chance of survival if
the answer is no let's stick with the
simple one that's fine people need to
realize they're free to do them okay
another example of the basic insight
that we created someone in support had
to schedule everyone who's doing chat
support and they had to schedule when
they would take their their lunch break
that's where it says phasing they're
phasing out of chat it's kind of sad
some of these people are 0.5 that means
they're half a person that's because
they were just hired and they're not
fully trained so they're counted as half
a person which is kind of depressing but
they all become full people eventually
after they take enough chats but this is
very difficult for someone this is
actually kind of a classic operations
research problem to have demand coming
along the bottom here it's sort of a
forecast in chat demand that comes out
of a forecast model and then you got a
schedule when are people gonna take
their lunch breaks and all these rules
like if you take a lunch break you
should take it with someone else because
you don't want to be lonely so we
thought okay well why don't we just do
this schedule for you because we know
the math behind it it's a classic
operations research problem looks like
this it's actually just a bunch of
inequalities and then you've got an
objective function in our case the
objective function is maximized
availability subject to demand code up
an LP format which looks like this which
is frightening don't look at that too
closely and just return to them a
schedule back in Excel just how they
wanted it it just says
okay here's when people are on point
that means they're taking chats here's
when they're taking their lunch break
certain days they're on email and that's
it so this is an example where we found
that someone was doing something the
manual way right they were just kind of
playing with people make okay what if I
slammed in lunch break and we realized
okay we know how to do this with math
this actually isn't a big data problem
and we can just do it real quick and
just hand you back this artifact this
this spreadsheet that's actually optimal
in terms of forecasted chat demand so
one thing I like to keep in mind while
we're still on this topic is the
Kobayashi Maru example from Star Trek
where Kirk has a test yes to take in
this particular test is unbeatable I
think the story actually changes in the
new Star Trek movie versus the old Star
Trek but the the basic idea is that
there are these Klingon warbirds and
they're coming in and they're going to
destroy you and you actually can't win
the point of the test is to kind of see
how you do under pressure given that you
will fail and Kirk actually goes in and
changes the rules of the game right so
actually goes into the system and
changes it and cheats so that he can win
because he refuses to admit defeat he's
just like that instead he eats an apple
and wins but this is something to keep
in mind is an analytics person because I
think the tendency is to be presented
with a very complex game or system and
be like ooh I can solve it with math and
data and you you need people to go to
lunch together so they're not they're
not lonely yeah absolutely but I think
that analysts need to feel empowered to
also say you know what maybe we don't
need to do that anymore like it is
perfectly acceptable to win some sort of
analytics problem by suggesting to the
business that maybe you should no longer
do that at all
right and the nice thing that that
analysts have and the data scientists
have is this ability to take in the data
describe the problem model it and say
okay what happens if we get rid of that
rule right so what happens if I get rid
of this rule that people have to go to
lunch together does that somehow make us
more available to take chats and if so
by how much right so it's okay to change
the rules of the game and it's really
nice when you can quantify what that
change brings the business in terms of
some
kind of revenue or cost savings and what
is it so keep that in mind okay
external insights we'll go through this
one really quickly these are basically
blog posts guides things like that right
so a bunch of our users want to know hey
what are the demographics of some of
these free mail providers so how does
hotmail compare with Yahoo AOL Gmail got
Comcast on here because we actually send
a ton of email to Comcast they're not
free mail interestingly enough this is
just a real there's a lot of analysis we
did but this is one graphite is stole
out of post this is a age distribution
so these are first quartile median third
quartile age for various email providers
Comcast is way older which is kind of
interesting and it's because you have to
have like at least a couple bucks to
have a Comcast email address right
because I gotta have cable or Internet
or something and then you'll see a o L
actually slides out you know about six
seven years past Hotmail and Gmail so
that's kind of interesting hotmail is
pretty young I suspect some of this has
to do with the fact that I need an email
address in order to have an Xbox Live
account when I'm setting that up it's
going to be hotmail a bunch of Microsoft
owned free mail providers that are
suggested so we see that those age
ranges Hotmail and Gmail actually very
close to each other
yeah who's a little bit older so that's
this one sort of thing that we did and
provided that to our users we have a
bunch of blog post like this and our
users will get concerned about a few
things so a lot of people send email to
Gmail this is my gmail account here
Gmail introduced the new promotions tab
right so they took a lot of email
marketing and put it on this separate
tab and so people were flipping out what
my emails in another tab what does that
mean are people ever gonna read my email
again right so we're actually able to do
analysis and find out what exactly it
meant because there's nothing to be
gained by by hiding any of this from
folks right rather than letting the
question fester what the data science
team can do is actually go into the data
and just quantify like okay here's what
the change actually did so for Gmail
email addresses what we saw is these are
typical click rates for weekend and
weekday the first the three weeks before
the promotions tab was introduced and
then the three weeks after
the promotions tab was introduced so
typical click rates during the week
would be 13% for a newsletter after
promotions was introduced as down around
12% so you lost about 1% right so it's
not the end of the world but it did get
affected right and so we're able to just
communicate that to the user hears about
what is gonna happen
another example during the government
shutdown people want to know what's
going to happen to the engagement of
email addresses who work for the
government right so we're actually able
to provide some that analysis as soon as
the government shutdown start happening
okay here's what we're seeing if you're
at the EPA or the SBA or HUD and no
one's checking their email because
they're not allowed they're forbade by
law some people are still cheating
you'll notice like technically no one
from HUD should have been checking their
email and you know about 1/5 were versus
the SEC somehow they skated by with
everyone still working and we actually
saw this is when the fall was ramping up
so there's going to be an increase in
email traffic and we should see actually
an increasing gauge Minh twitches why as
a percentage of before the shutdown it's
actually above 100% for SEC and State
Department so we're able to provide this
to people so they knew ok if I'm in the
mortgage industry if I'm sending a
newsletter that people who work at HUD
are gonna read yeah I should expect that
my engagement will fall off a cliff
that's normal well as much as a
government shutdown is normal it's
normal so these are just things that we
can provide to people ok so now let's
get into some of the fun stuff which is
building capabilities or tools let us
give you some examples of these I'm
gonna give an example from compliance we
have a team that shuts users down and
the reason why they do this is because
we have 6 million users we don't have 6
million IP addresses that we send email
over so a lot of our users share an IP
address there's some really good
averaging effects that come from that
but if you get one really terrible user
in there who's sending to a lot of you
know dead mailboxes you know people who
haven't checked their mail for 10 years
it's gonna get noticed and that IP
address could be blocked right so we
need to shut those users down very
quickly so one of the things I looked at
when I first joined MailChimp is who's
getting shut down right
for what reasons and I went through all
the reasons and created Kahn this
flowchart okay you can get shutdown from
multiple accounts you can shut down for
send you a bunch of dead addresses and
then you can either you can go through
various processes and either you're
gonna be kicked out the door permanently
you're gonna go make some restitution
have a good listen to that but one thing
I noticed I don't know if you can read
it in the back soviet for you about
one-sixth of our users were shut down
for loading a large list of email
addresses trying to buy a high dollar
account or requesting high volume
approval ie approval to send to a large
list none of those things are bad right
they're just scary if I've got a user
who comes in is like I want to send a
two million people we're gonna be we're
gonna shut you down
why do you want to send a two million
people because if we let that mail out
the door and they're an abuser that's a
really terrible situation right so we're
gonna manually review them but people
have this expectation when they sign up
for an online service that they
shouldn't be slowed down right the thing
should happen seamlessly we get a lot of
letters like this review
process I'm sending out high press
releases press releases as in all caps I
don't know yadda yadda yadda this was a
pain in the ass people get really angry
and I understand now when I sign up for
any account
I expect online this you know kind of
work really quickly you know it's email
just you know I should sign up a mule to
send they don't realize that you know
spam is something that is you know sort
of originated with email right it's a
big problem and it's when we have to
control for and people were signing up
like the day before Black Friday or
something right so it's high potential
for abuse but they really want to get
out their email today you know people
want to procrastinate so how do we solve
this problem
well we solve it instead of doing a
manual review process can we create
models that will predict when someone's
going to abused and that's what we tried
to do this is a quote from Paul Graham
about a decade ago basically he says oh
well spammers it's all about the content
you know they can't change their content
they can't get away from saying viagra
they have to say viagra so so long as I
can detect viagra I can shut him down
this is actually wrong these days right
of our abusers look like this this is an
email that I personally got I did not
sign up for this list
dear Avondale Estates president I'm a
realtor yada yada yada
you know welcome to the neighborhood
whatever I never signed up for this so
there's some ways that this person might
be within the law might be within
can-spam if they provide certain
information about maja and subscribe etc
but from a MailChimp perspective this is
non permission-based
email we would consider this person a
spammer they just got my email address
from the city and blasted something at
me but there's nothing in the content
that would allow me as let's say any I
model to necessarily know this is a
spammer you know there are good real
estate agents out there that only send
to actual customers so how do we tell
the difference well spam is in the eye
of the beholder right we tell the
difference because it's the people on
your list that are either going to open
and click the email or they're gonna hit
the spam button right and that's the
signal we're going after so really it's
not about content at all
it's about your list who are these email
addresses that you're about to send this
to where have I seen them before what
types of stuff do they receive how old
are those email addresses what happened
the last time any one of our millions of
users sent to them we send two three
billion email addresses currently and we
save all this data so we were able to
build a big system that looked at that
mostly list based information as well as
user based information a bit of campaign
information but the thing that we tried
to focus on and this goes back to the
earlier slides that being the talk is
eliminating risk and complexity right
even when we build a production system
and we deemed this one important enough
to actually build a full-fledged AI
model instead of just a simple rule we
want to make sure that we we design in
such a way that it's going to survive
right so most of the data we used
internally was already structured so
rather than using some unstructured
database you know like the Hadoop or you
know Mongo we just chose to use Postgres
because our data is already structured
so why not just use a shard and sequel
database for it so we made a lot of
design decisions like that we used
random forests as our AI model I talked
about that one in the book because that
one's actually particularly hard to over
train it's pretty robust against that
it's not very finicky it's
pretty good one to use so we just made
decisions that would be slightly more
robust okay but let's talk about
building tools for external users right
when I talk about building an AI system
that's something that's internal it can
be fairly complex I'm around to explain
it to my co-workers in person what does
it look like to do analytics where the
customer is someone on the other side of
the world right and they're paying me
maybe fifteen dollars a month how do I
build a tool for them this is very hard
not only because tools are hard to build
but they're also hard to communicate
right data science tool is so we like to
keep it simple this is probably the my
favorite thing I've gotten to work on we
have this CAPTCHA you have to fill out
when you create an account with us and
this is a nightmare
right I mean I don't know what point
Google decided that we were gonna start
labeling all the addresses in the world
for them I assume this is a street
address this like black blob
there's probably Street address but I
never know the answer to these things I
think you know on average I'm at least
failing the first one so can we just get
rid of it that was the question can we
use our data to get rid of it and in
fact what we found is that for certain
email addresses during the signup
process we could use our anti-abuse
models we've already built and all the
data we were already saving in a large
database called the email Genome Project
we actually have data about three
billion email addresses that we're
constantly updating based on their
interactions with the system we could
bring that data to bear on this question
there certainly there's certain email
address to certain people who are
signing up for an account where I just
don't know or it's a gray area you're
gonna fill it CAPTCHA but there's a
large portion of our user base for which
we never have to show this so we removed
it from the account signup process we
removed it from the process read contact
customer support
so the artifact for this project for me
you know how do I build a tool if we
think about oh it's really hard to
communicate data science to people
there's just nothing right we just
remove something from the application
and that's it that's all we did and so I
was really happy about that because I
didn't make one anyone's life any harder
all I did was remove a barrier and I
took great joy in that so another
example send time optimization a really
nagging question for our users when do I
send my email marketing right we just
get sort of hung up on it they would
spend all this time creating this
newsletter about some sale they're about
to have they have maybe a million
customers they're going to send it to
and they just don't know when to send it
and they start freaking out and then
they start going online and reading
anecdotes from people who are they
generally have guru in their job title
and they have no idea what they're
talking about maybe they have some small
set of data from one client they work
with they're like oh well you know
people work from 9:00 to 5:00 and they
always take their lunch break at noon
and they're always stuck in traffic at
6:00 you don't want to send at noon or
6:00 and it's just always baloney so
could we answer this question for people
well this is the graph of from one
individual email address I've got some
time slots here sins versus clicks right
and what are we really interested in
we're interested in when are people
engaging with their email and that
engagement is not being driven
necessarily by the notification they
just got that they received the email
right so we're gonna find engagement
that's not tied to volume but rather is
oh you were available and you went back
and you check your email so we built an
optimization model off of that data
here's actually some distributions of
optimal send times for email addresses
by category so we've got college-age
folks folks in their 40s and folks over
retirement and if we look at the
distribution of optimal send times we'll
actually see that college pushes out to
the right so it Peaks with most email
addresses in college have an optimal
send time around 1 p.m.
versus folks in their 40s and after
retirement it's more around 10 a.m. so
it's really interesting that the data
actually bore that out and we see
similar transfer a lot of stuff in
bartenders closer to 1 p.m. neonatal
nurses there really is no peak they're
kind of checking their email throughout
the day because their schedules are just
weird so we built this system but it's
got tons of data in it looks at data in
an individual level it's all stored and
medicines really sophisticated how are
we going to show this to our users
well they care about the optimal send
time for their list when they go through
the campaign setup process
they have to pick a time to send that if
they want to schedule their campaign we
just have a bubble there that says let
MailChimp pick and then a little
checkbox that says the optimal time to
send is 3:00 p.m. so we did all this
work but that doesn't mean I have to
build like a big graph with lots of
colors and a heat map or anything like
that to communicate that work right
that's not for our users that would be
for the press so instead if you want to
make the user experience better let's
just make it a simple bubble that's
enough right here's another example I'm
just loading up examples here
apologies what if I have a list and
there's a particular segment I'm really
interested in but I don't know all those
people right so let's say MailChimp has
a list of 5 million email addresses of
people that we that have asked to be
updated on our app and new things were
releasing so let's say I want to find
the press in there the tech press and I
know a few of the email just like oh
yeah I know that person who works for
read/write web I know that person who
works for I don't know some type 1
TechCrunch but I don't know all of the
press that's on my list how am I going
to find him well chances are based on
their data their subscription data how
they interact with our system other
people in the press live in their
neighborhood in in sort of a data in a
bur hood sense right so they're
subscribing to the same things that are
acting with the same things so what I
really want to know I want to know who
lives as close to the tech people the
tech writers I know who lives as close
to them as they live to each other so we
can do that calculation but how do we
expose it within the system you go into
the create a segment tab here and you
put in some email addresses people we
know oh I know this person Ars Technica
I know this person All Things D these
were people on my list right and I sort
of find the other people on my list that
might not be aware of all we did was we
created a discover similar segments
button so you can either save this
segment or you can save this segment
with some other people who look like
them and that's it it's just a button so
that's really the approach we take you
know we work hard to build these systems
that are very rigorous but we try to
keep things as simple as possible right
if we can keep the math simple we keep
the math simple if the math has to be
complex we try to make sure that the way
it's exposed to people the
is kept up is still simple and so I'll
just leave you with four points really I
think anyone who's doing data analysis
at any company it's important that you
align yourself with the goals of the
business and serve your colleagues right
you see a lot of articles these days
about like oh dude a science is the
sexiest job no no it just align yourself
with everyone else and serve in that way
when all the hype dies people see that
you're valuable and just want to keep
you around
data science products should receive no
special treatment right so if a designer
can solve a problem that I can solve by
just changing the color of a button or
making the app look different or feel
different that is fine right there's
nothing special necessarily about using
math versus something else so if
something's not working feel free to
kill it get a goal first and then get
toys right don't just flail about figure
out exactly what you want to do and then
figure out okay here's the toys that
here are the tools that are gonna solve
that problem and avoid complexity that's
really what I've talked about for 30
minutes now so that's it if you all have
questions I think we have time for
questions right yes it's not that's a
short answer of that so yeah we're still
trying to you know we're going really
slowly with it there are a few companies
out there that are sort of charging
around like a bull in a china shop with
related to data like this and they're
getting huge trouble
we've always err on the side of privacy
and these systems were built
first things first to prevent abuse
right so we have tons of data on
billions of email addresses but I yeah I
don't know we've always tried to figure
out how can we share what can we share
in a way that maintains expectations
from recipients expectations from our
users so stuff like discover similar
segments it's powered by EGP however
it's only about stuff on their list
right we might use that 3 billion email
address data set to perform these
neighborhood calculations but all I'm
telling you is you have these email
addresses
on your list these are email addresses
like them also on your list everyone's
double opted in everything's aboveboard
so we don't really share any of that
right now yes so my background is I did
pure math and undergrad so I studied
like abstract algebra and stuff and then
my advisor sat me down and said you're
not gonna be a great mathematician his
words were actually something like you
could go to an okay grad school but
you're gonna you're gonna be one of
those guys that's kind of like toys
around with small results for the rest
of your life and you know math will jump
for two you know really quickly at
certain points by geniuses and you'll
just kind of be toying around but if
you're cool with that and you really
like this keep doing incident that
sounds like that sucks I'm gonna get a
job so I went to grad school and applied
math operations research and did that
instead and and then my wife got
pregnant like well no I really need a
job so I worked for the government for a
while my problem with the government is
that some of the folks you interact with
just really want to retire you know
where I I like I like things that are
exciting and I just ran into problems
with people just kind of like there's
one person who's interacting with you
had a picture of the golf course above
their desk is like yeah I'm gonna be
there next year when I retire and I'm
not doing anything until then and it's
just really rough I'm sure there are
other government organizations from them
it's not true that was true for me so I
got out of there but that's where my
background yes
talked a lot about Britain's one of your
examples with the email the subjects or
the content of the email being the
primary predictor versus the recipients
but as soon as the recipients were
largely based on ancillary data about
the recipients whereas the intrinsic
data to the email itself the only thing
really there is the subject plus some
names that you don't know anything about
right oh the question which I should
have gotten to much quicker is how do
you think about the data neighborhood of
a person is it more important to get the
data to understand the neighborhood or
is it more important to get the toys
tools analysis to analyze what you do
have so if you were looking at emails
alone with nope
context how far could you get with
analytic tools and processes versus
ancillary data collection and
understanding the connections between
multiple your right yeah that that
becomes extremely important right so in
order to have that abuse model work the
main predictors are built on the list
right so it's when we think about an
email sent through MailChimp it's really
best use payload that's the content and
then the list of email addresses and
then there's your user metadata so your
geo-located here you say your business
address is here because you have to
provide a real address for can-spam and
then your billing address is here and
your payment diners club you know look
at all that - but with the email address
as your right we can get some stuff just
from the list just as it is right so you
know why is your list 100% Gmail and all
in caps
why is everything like admin at or you
know DBA at that would be like really
scary because they're all role addresses
but usually we have to connect it up
right so we want to go into EGP and
we've got to have tools to do this we
want to go in and say okay now where
have we seen these email addresses
before how many of them were involved in
the Sony hack helmet how many of them
have been made public how many of them
do we think are journalists you know why
are you emailing 80-percent journalists
that seems scary we'll look at all sorts
of stuff like that how many of them are
verifiably dead right so the last time
they were sent to they had you know the
inbox is dead or how many of them have
soft bounced a gazillion times in a row
meaning they're on vacation permanently
as far as we're concerned you know in
order to understand all that yet you got
to have this big network of everything
and also subscription data right I mean
you get some lists where it's extremely
broad and then other lists where it's
like it's all you know maybe women in
their 20s and that's it so if you know
what does it mean that you're sending to
a huge group of these people when your
content is kind of odd or you know your
geo-located halfway around the world and
you're sending a different language so
yeah we have to we have to consider that
whole thing and yet we had to get all
sorts of tools and techniques that would
help us you know
get that much data yes seems like you're
getting good results from all the
networks you have built up and all the
routes that you guys have just going
back in time if you and you first
started MailChimp you have a fewer set
of users was there heavy reliance on
external data sources to add some of
those problems or how do you reconcile
that as a company group it never really
factored in until so the company is
quite small until we introduced our free
plan right and then it exploded it's
kind like free marketing and one of the
great things about free users is okay
they're essentially a marketing cost but
they provide all this data that can be
used to facilitate building these tools
which helps keep the ecosystem clean for
everybody I came around after the free
account because before it yeah there
wasn't really enough data to do this
kind of analysis and because there
wasn't enough data people just didn't
focus on it at all just didn't even try
and so once we had all the data lying
around there's like what we could just
operate as we always have just charge
for accounts what we do and just keep
growing and that's fine but they just
wanted to make use of this and abuse was
really one of the main things that that
catalyzed it because if you have a free
plan you're gonna get abusers you're
like oh yeah it's just right a bot to
sign up for free account so they have to
bring in someone like me to solve that
problem but then you get to do all these
other fun things with the data there's a
question online I want to collect all
this data to analyze later so yeah
there's a tension there right like we
try to design MailChimp in a way that
just provides a really fun experience
for folks if you've never used the
website like before you send an email
campaign a little monkeys hand comes
down above this big red button it's kind
of shaking and sweats dropping off it
and it's really fun if you start
thinking about oh I want to collect this
data and that data all of a sudden the
user experience is degraded right so
recently I logged into Facebook and it
was like do you work here or here or
here and
I don't even why would you even think
that I worked for Mary Kay like I don't
understand what what did I say that made
you think that and how do I get past the
screen right so there's this tension
with if I want to collect data and and
you know use it to then have some
feedback loop where I get better
products is that going to get in the way
of the the thing I want which is a
better product so we we try to find ways
to not bug people right yes so find ways
not to bug people you have to deal with
uncertainty and ambiguity and your model
so instead of knowing for certain but
that person works in Mary Kay you say I
have I guess they might yeah and I think
that that's actually really good to keep
that humility in mind all the time right
like Shutterfly recently sent an email
campaign to a bunch of people saying
congratulations on your new baby and a
lot of those people did not have a new
baby right they thought that their data
was correct and in fact it's often not
correct so we tried to build tools or
that will never get us into that
situation and so it's kind of nice when
you you can you sort of never in a
situation where like oh yeah we know
that for sure you're most the time
you're wrong yes I just picked up from
the front desk of book on foundations
for predictive analytics because it had
words like foundations and practical and
simple and on page 10 that's the mouth
and this is the second book the first
one was pretty down like for dummies it
was the same thing uh-huh
nowhere to start by saying hey I have
two data points and I want to predict
the third and if you do that you can do
that but here's limitations of it so
here's how you want to get around that
and another example that sounds like
yeah I mean that's that's why I chose
Excel a lot of books do choose to go
like alright we're gonna do use some
mathematical notation written in latex
and it's got in Greek symbols like a
Sigma so we're gonna do some and this
kind of assumed not only people know how
to read that but if they don't like
they're gonna explain it that people
would even want to read
and I think that Excel is really nice
because it's this language people will
kind of already get cuz they've had like
I got to do a song I'm gonna equal sum
and then brag to this range you kind of
already know that and so yeah I'm tired
of mean I like I like that kind of stuff
degree but at some that you just get
sick of it after a while sometimes you
just want something that's a little bit
different so I will tell you have an
Operations research background it's an
option right we don't write and I think
if you're in school this is like your
job is to read this stuff but if you're
working another job you kind of want to
get to the chase a little faster and
that's great other questions yes it's a
big user experience story of last year
was a roll of the Obamacare web page can
you comment the the a/b testing they did
the significant a/b testing they did
around know the Obamacare rollout oh oh
that actually just the website falling
over I mean what I can say about that
was having worked in government and
working consulting when I heard that
that was happening I was like yeah it
was so many contractors all working on
little pieces of it and then smashing it
together and the whole the whole
government contracting apparatus is set
up for failure right I mean like you
look at that and then you look at what
is it the f-35 that's also having
problems and things like you know it's
thinks it's hard I feel bad for the
government sometimes if the working
email chip is so much nicer because it's
like we can do things soup-to-nuts
really quickly and it's not like we're
building a camel for four years and then
releasing and hoping it works yes at the
same time with MailChimp that founder
centric they people can build arbitrary
emails and surveys there's an infinite
number of content that they can produce
so can you walk us through how do you
take this you know fairly complex
product or a product that enables people
to build bridge complex applications and
distill that to a number of clear
metrics that you can track and make
decisions and also clearly communicate
to others the whole metrics question is
kind of funny because I
in a company that is almost vehemently
anti metric so for instance we did a
marketing campaign recently where we
took out a bunch of billboards in
various cities across the US and they
just had the Freddy head that our little
MailChimp logo and no text on them
whatsoever so the only people would even
understand what these billboards were
were people who were already customers
right and there was no data gathering
around how did you hear about us
did you see the Billboard when you
signed up you know nothing it was just
to make our current users a little
happier they would take pictures they
would tweet and so I mean I guess that's
kind of a metric did we see any pictures
on Twitter in the Billboard today um we
took the one down in Chicago there was a
local paper wrote an article about how
sad someone was across the street from
the billboard that the monkey was going
on he's like I'm gonna do anymore it was
all facetious it was like an onion
article but he's great so you know one
of the ways that we handle metrics is we
just blatantly ignore them and then we
do a lot of other things like we do we
do just a lot of customer interviews
right so a lot of what we would do would
be rather than looking at like well
what's our ARPU you know what's our ARPU
recently our me all these weird metrics
that you can sort of design around you
think they're somehow related to the
success of your company or to revenue
but then you end up gaming them right so
then you end up saying okay I want to
increase average revenue per user so I'm
going to do that by increasing wait
times and support for users who don't
pay us as much and making them pissed
and then they leave and all of a sudden
my average has gone up because I've just
gotten rid of a bunch of users so we
just seem to ignore stuff like that talk
to our customers
just very closely and don't track a lot
of things like that but instead talk to
our customers closely understand what
they want you know receive hearing
enough of the same thing enough for the
same stories and then and that's a lot
of what the UX team does they do a lot
of in person videos stuff they also do a
lot of surveys and then we'll build
things off of those right so we'll say
okay people really
this is really the problem they're
having you know they say they want this
but we've video them we've watched what
they do and they're really buffing them
stuff like this you can't ignore that
sort of basic insight that may not
actually come from data comes from
watching people we take that we build
tools off of that - that's a lot of that
and run we do around tracking website
metrics we just don't yes it is the UX
team that does it so we have a large
team at MailChimp it's the user
experience team the data science team
works very closely with them essentially
the way it works is that they're they're
sort of a small yappy dog they can sense
threats real quickly and run around and
claw-like the you know the glass screen
door and then we're like a really fat
slow dog they can do things that are
really frightening but it takes us
forever to get started up so they'll
start yapping in the wake of stuff and
the old one or a Bic all right we
building for y'all but they do a lot of
in cut in person customer interviews all
around the world some of those customers
would be sort of bleeding edge using us
in really creative ways other customers
would be just more of our standard
customers maybe it's a mom-and-pop shop
trying to sell some and they've realized
though a mailing list is really useful
and they'll go out and they'll actually
video those they'll watch people use the
website they do a lot of that they also
do a lot of surveys and that's how they
find people who are at least a little
bit engaged right I mean you filled up a
survey you filled out the comment
section like I really wish you guys did
this so they would find people that way
too so yeah they do all of that and then
actually we've started just recently
sending one data scientist with them so
the data science team MailChimp we tend
to hire former consultants I don't know
if that's just because I like former
consultants because that was one but we
want people who just in general can talk
to folks so there's no fear of you know
letting the data scientists out of the
closet like it is perfectly acceptable
to send someone with a math background
to talk to a customer and so they'll
hang on a fly on the wall and then once
data comes up or science comes up
they'll be like oh yeah can I ask you
some more questions about a/b testing
how to use it you gotta go and they'll
come back with I
like oh we should really try this and
that's really nice because if you wait
for other people who don't understand
what you do to translate it sometimes
stuff gets lost in translation right I
mean the best translation occurs inside
of one brain so yeah it's a bit about
that yes well the CEO helps prioritize
that for one you know another great
technique we use is we let people submit
requests and we wait two days and we see
which ones survive it's amazing the
number of requests people give you that
the next day people are like oh I don't
need that anymore okay
good but we actually generally
prioritize based on just we have broader
conversations with managers find out
what are the main goals for the year for
the company okay this year we're
thinking about you know I can't tell you
what they are because they're secret but
we're thinking about these three things
which of these products that we could
work on will help us achieve those three
high-level goals and we tackle those
first and we never have enough time so
it's never like we get to the point
where we clean off the list some stuff
just gets too old and dies yes so when
you started the email Genome Project and
you had no data to start with how did
you decide what to put into your
database you described everything or how
did you go about that well we started
with particular products in mind we're
gonna build first and so we knew the
first product we're going to build was
this abuse prediction model right and so
we knew we wanted mailbox interaction
data in order to build out like I need
to know about bounces dead mailboxes
things like that
spam bounces all that stuff so that's
just gonna be first
right and so some of those data sets I
mean that one's actually huge right
because we send 10 billion emails every
month all those emails are gonna get
some response back from the server
saying yeah we've accepted it or in the
case of certain email products they
might say yeah we've accepted it and
then two days later they'll send you a
bounce
we didn't actually accept it so we got
to grab all that so we started with that
so for us it's always been about what's
the next thing we're gonna build and
let's make sure that we start you know
six months out planning how that data is
going to enter into EGP there other
people tackle that in other ways I I'm a
little bit not optimistic about people
let's just get everything first and then
figure out what we're gonna build and so
they spend years capturing data and have
no idea what they're gonna do with it
until it's all in there yes like an
example which you talked about the email
you save from the bunch of those four
emails you can predict that this email
address is also a tech journalist or
something how do you correlate and how
do you throughout a times digression the
one where we've looked a lot and
accuracy would be the anti-abuse stuff
because we really care that we're only
shutting down bad people and so for that
one what I can say is that there is a
portion of people probably ten percent
of users that are a gray area right we
can tune the model such that we are
extremely accurate for all these abusers
and all these good people and the cool
thing there is if your predicted good
verifiably good we just never talk to
you you just sail straight through which
is awesome but there is this this
portion in the middle that's gray so
that would be one place we found that
and then the cool thing is is you know
this doesn't end at the research paper
someone was published earlier this is
how accurate we got instead what we did
is we figure out how do we handle the
great people and the way we do that is
through taste testing so we essentially
say hey
unfortunately this model has detected
that you could be good you could be bad
you know here's why what we're gonna do
is we're gonna take your list we're
gonna send out a taste test first so
we're gonna send out you know this many
email addresses we're gonna wait one
hour we're gonna see what kind of
feedback comes in and now we're not in
the realm of prediction anymore right
now we're in the realm of you know this
is reality
if you pass then the rest of your
campaign goes out so we've essentially
mitigated some of our risk it provides a
slightly diminished user experience to
that gray area but we found that it's
necessary we can't we can't just assume
the gray area is bad and we can't assume
they're good either
so that's sort of the
yes and we do analyze you know how well
we're doing that's part of what we do
yes for more congratulations
so you mentioned about like the
questions that you answer can be
answered by the data science team or the
UX team or sometimes can be fooled so
what is the process about how do you
decide if particular questions needs to
be answered by an insulator science
versus UX we are having a similar report
where we call it an object leeway to
correct things which is subjectivity of
collecting things but I would yeah I
mean sometimes it's just a matter of
priorities and whether we think there's
additional gains to be made out of not
just doing like the basic UX stuff like
oh yeah if we could just do a few
interviews look at our survey data maybe
it's a few sequel queries that even
someone the UX team could do yeah just
let them handle it if it becomes a
situation it's there's no formal process
it's a small company
right I mean eternity folks have those
our customer support so if you just look
at people doing operational stuff it's
actually very small we just talk to each
other and eventually the you know the UX
team will just check hey this is above
our mathematical pay grade and it's very
important to you know if everyone says
this is really important it needs to be
worked on you the data science team is
quite small but you know you guys handle
this one because we can't crack it with
our data and the finance team will do
that too right they have databases they
look at but sometimes like hey I really
have this question on international
users it's beyond us we have to go to
content we need to make sure we
understand the language contents written
in yadda yadda yadda all of a sudden
that becomes a data science question and
so it'll just end up in our court and
then if the CEO of things we should do
it we just do it regardless that always
breaks the tie alright thanks you all
think you're coming out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
