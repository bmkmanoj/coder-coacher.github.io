you
yeah my name is undressing I'm a
researcher here in Microsoft I have the
pleasure to introduce neocon he's
actually a cognitive science scientist
by training he went to grad school in
tufts he focused on psychology and he's
also kind of undecided it has been doing
a lot of work in comics so I think but
oh well he's presenting today is kind of
like the amalgamation of his research on
linguistics and psychology cognitive
science and his passion for comics and
so he's going to be presenting his book
the visual language of comics which is a
you come by he's over there for forty
dollars you'll sign it and draw a comic
for you as well so without any more
introduction let me into this game so so
thank you for having me this is very fun
and exciting to be able be here this is
a fun to be able presented people in
couches certainly so just a little bit
of background before we start is that I
started working in a comic industry when
I was about 14 these are some of the
comics that I've drawn and when I was in
college I basically start taking some
classes on linguistics and cognitive
science and I started noticing that
things that were happening in comics
were similar to things that were
happening in language and I realized
that nobody had really done this very
much before and kind of down the further
I got in the rabbit hole of thinking
about these issues the more I realized
there was a lot more there than I might
have suspected so I kind of used my
knowledge as a creator to then inform
the research and somewhat the reverse as
well but I mostly just do the research
these days so that brings us back to
here which is thinking about these
things in terms of cognition and science
essentially so if we're going to talk
about the relationship between say
drawing and language or between comics
and language like what is it that I mean
by a visual language we really need to
talk about what is language first so
oh let me start by just asking some
questions this is the audience
participation portion I guess which is
can you speak so okay yes so I I hear
your response which means that yes there
is a nice that you are speaking back to
me so the follow-up question would be
then these aren't very hard questions so
what do you speak in is the next
question so what do you speak in words
sounds so usually somebody probably say
well language and then English may be of
the type of language that is okay so now
let me ask you can you draw so I hear us
a lot more timid responses and but
basically everybody can draw they don't
necessarily feel that they can draw
proficiently right like everybody can at
least make marks that have some sort of
representational value maybe okay so
then the follow-up question is in line
with my previous questions what do you
draw in right so pencil a notebook those
are very different answers then say
English right but really my argument is
that they are parallel questions to what
do you speak in so the answer to what do
you draw in is you draw in a visual
language and you might draw in not just
a visual language generally but a
specific type of visual language so
American visual language or Japanese
visual language or something like that
and we're going to go into more detail
what that might mean so that's to set
the stage if that's the the parallel ISM
that I'm trying to get at so human
beings as a species have three
modalities that we can convey our
concepts with okay we can create sounds
which if we had sound you'd be able to
hear this is someone saying words like I
am doing right now so all kind of embody
my slide we can move our bodies
especially our hands and our faces to
convey meaning and we can draw things
basically and these are so that's to
make marks on a
page that are meaningful
representational II these are the only
three options we as a species have for
conveying meaning we don't emit smells
to each other to communicate we don't
secrete things and lick each other to
communicate as exciting as that sounds
it would make for a very different sort
of lecture but the you know this is
basically what we as human beings do and
and I'll make a note that writing is
essentially the conversion of the
auditory form into the visual graphic
form so it's essentially a synesthesia
it's a learned synesthesia that we do as
a culture that's very useful but
naturally these operate on their own
okay so my theory says that whenever you
have any of these kind of conceptually
expressive me these meaningful
modalities right and you put them into a
coherent sequence such that that
sequence is governed by a system of
rules that some sequences are good and
make sense and others do not make sense
IE a grammar what we would call a
grammar it becomes a type of language so
structured sequential sounds become
spoken languages of the world right
English Japanese Swahili structured
sequential body motions become sign
languages of the world which are also
not Universal so there's American Sign
Language British sign language actually
not mutually intelligible in Japanese
sign language and there's lots of sign
languages of the world so my argument
then is that when you have structured
sequential images they literally become
visual languages of the world right so
you have this combination of meaning the
modality and the grammar okay and that's
what gives you a type of language so
these things that we see which we call
comics are actually written in two
different languages they're written in a
verbal or written language that's the
converted version into the visual form
and the visual language these things are
the biological cognitive abilities that
we use to create comics so just for
clarification I want to say that comics
are not
language so that is not what I'm saying
I'm not saying the comics or language in
fact I must say it's so important that
I'm going to say it again comics are not
a language okay the argument rather is
that comics are too let's say American
visual language which is the brand that
we usually read the superheroes and or
cartoony things there might be different
dialects of that let's say American
visual language what novels are to
English okay which is to say that comics
and novels are the kind of
socio-cultural context and visual
language and English are the languages
that are used to write these right so we
use again American visual language to
write comics we use English to write
novels it's just the case that you
actually use two different languages in
the case of comics you use English and
an American visual language right so
that's the distinction that I'm making
it's not the comics are a language it's
they're written in a language okay so
what's a language then so we have at
least some basis of this it's a modality
that has meaning that is has a grammar
well ultimately that means that these
are patterns that are stored in people's
heads right it's not that they're a
language isn't floating out into the
cultural ether the way we talk about it
right it's purely instantiating patterns
in people's heads so I speak English
because these are the patterns that are
in my head and to the degree that the
patterns in my head or your heads are
you know shared by other people we say
that we speak similar languages and
that's not necessarily a clean-cut
division there might be certain groups
that you know have rough overlaps with
others right such that some people you
know are mutually intelligible with
multiple groups but those outer groups
are not mutually intelligible right so
when we carve up these languages those
are kind of so geopolitical distinctions
but really we're talking about patterns
that are in people's heads okay so
that's the basis of it so in my book the
overall argument that I make is this
that we have these patterns in people's
heads that relate to graphic information
these visual languages use a visual
vocabulary just like spoken languages
there they are built of memorized pieces
of units they have a grammatical system
that orders those units which uses
grammatical rules and roles that are
organized hierarchically there's cross
cultural diversity of these structures
so there's no one universal visual
language rather there's lots of
different cultures that have different
visual languages so why do american
comics with different than american
comics they're literally written in
different visual languages right and
that's the distinction and there's
possibly overlapping cognitive processes
that underlie that understanding as well
as a host of other things about this so
we're going to focus on these ones here
today okay so I'm going to make a broad
analogy as i have already between the
structure of a sequence of images and
the structure of a sequence of words
right they both have these grammatical
parts now immediately you might be
thinking well words are very different
than images right and one main way that
is true is that images contain far more
information than individual words right
I've heard the ratio as a thousand to
one I'm not sure if that's completely
right thank you for those of you who
laughed at that joke but clearly they
convey different information right and
that's going to change the way that the
system works possibly but the same
question is true right and that question
is how is it that we are able to create
meaning out of a sequence of units what
is it that happens in our minds and what
is it that happens in our brains and
then that level the question is the same
for how we engage these things okay so
let's first talk about a little bit
about the structures of this language
okay so what is a visual vocabulary and
here usually the first objection that
people make is well you know but there's
you know no vocabulary of memorized
panels right like memorize words so
let's talk about what a vocabulary is so
a vocabulary is made up of mappings but
in form and meaning that are stored in
in case of spoken language that mapping
is of sound too meaning right so we
usually like to think about these
mappings in that are stored in people's
heads as you know words part of our
vocabulary right so they might be whole
words like dance and wonderful but then
I'd be parts of words like on or tion
which are affixes that can modify larger
units to build something even bigger but
we still store these units as pieces
which is why I can make up words like
unmon go sighs which is to make
something not look like a Japanese comic
right which you know I kind of just made
that up but it's you know it still uses
this these prefixes we can do things
novel II with them right and you can
actually do this with pieces that are
bigger than words to like idioms like
kick the bucket to mean die right now
it's different if it means strike a pale
right but as a idiom that means you have
multiple words that then have a
different meaning on their own so you
have to store that in your head so in
the case of the visual languages we
simply have a different type of mapping
the form changes it's no longer sound
the form is graphics but we still make
that mapping to meaning so it's worth
saying that languages do these sorts of
things in different ways so an analytic
system of analytic morphology or
analytic lexical items you have a sinus
like this the two of them were
apparently really hungry we're basically
each unit serves as a grammatical unit
in in the sequence right and those units
have meaning and then we store these
things mostly as whole units in our in
our heads but synthetic lexical items
are actually built constructively so
this is a from the language you pick
which is a northern Canadian native
language and in this case I'm not even
to try to pronounce this but this is one
word and this word is the equivalent of
that sentence in meaning so they pack a
lot more in and in fact this word is not
stored in their head but the pieces are
so you can have these larger units that
are constructed novel II but our built
of memorized pieces which can't stand on
their own is the idea and that's similar
to the way images work so can we find
evidence then that there are systematic
pieces of images that then add up to
what look like novel larger units and
the answer is yes so to preview that for
you these are all hands done by a comic
creator now you might think well it's
all repet repetitious this is some you
know hack who just copy things this is
actually Jack Kirby who is probably the
most influential comic artist american
comic artist of superheroes in the 20th
century and you can tell that he's
influential because these are all hands
it's the identical schema same pattern
by jim lee who is probably the most
popular artists in the 90s and since
it's currently the vice president of DC
Comics and these are all hands by Erik
Larsen who is another major American
comic artist for a while was the
publisher at Image Comics they're all
the same pattern right in fact you can
say that they're playing with it so eric
has three fingers or two fingers in the
same pattern right so it's tweaked just
slightly but it's the same identical
pattern across everybody these are all
what should appear as pretty novel
looking faces each one should look
pretty unique right pretty different you
know these faces look very different
from each other if you zoom in you see
that all the ears are the same here all
the mouths are the same here so let's
say that they have these schematic
pieces that they're storing in their
heads and they're going to redeploy
right so what makes them look different
as maybe they have different noses that
they're putting on people or different
jaws and different other things that
then construct the look of people to
look very different from each other on a
larger level these are all peanuts comic
strips if you notice Linus looks almost
identical in all of these in fact I
didn't circle some of them but you know
if you go down here the bottom part that
looks identical to so he's just he's not
like sitting there copying himself all
the time this is just his schema for
drawing line of sitting down with a
blanket
similarly snoopy running basically the
identical identical looks right so you
can this repetitive patterns for the
ways in which things are being drawn
even though it looks very different when
it's in context you don't think about it
as being patterned in that way we also
have more creative things like these
which are kind of floating above the
head stuff I've actually argued that
these are a class of items this is a
type of ethics and so I call it an up
fix because it's an affix that's up
right so up fixes have these kind of
curious properties of floating above
ahead and in fact they have certain
restrictions to them so for example if
you move them to the side of the head it
probably doesn't make as much sense it
needs to be above the head and if the
face kind of disagrees with the emotion
it ends up looking very strange right so
you have these kind of constraints on
this combination and we've done some
studies on this recently showing that
these are indeed you know good
constraints on people judge these things
as much worse when this happens there's
this is a cheat sheet that floated
around the comic industry kind of in the
underground for decades before the
internet happened and then it suddenly
was everywhere called Hollywood's twenty
two panels that always worked while I
would was a comic artist and an editor
asked him to help out the rookies with
their the way their panels work so he
designed this kind of cheat sheet for
lots of different compositional ways to
spice up boring dialogue scenes and this
is kind of I think unconsciously two
people served as a template for whole
level templates for panels and in fact
this one here the big head schema number
one you can find across many different
comics where now it's not these people
had the template and we're looking at
wally woods things and thinking i'm
gonna use the big head schema now rather
they you know these are people who also
read comics and if then internalize this
pattern and then they use it when they
feel it's appropriate right because
their speakers of this visual language
so that's to say that we have different
mappings of form and meaning right
graphics and meaning that are stored in
people's heads that people then
reuse productively as they're drawing
and that's what drawing is if you feel
if you were one of people who has like I
can't really draw that literally means
you haven't learned a visual vocabulary
you haven't learned the vocabulary items
to redeploy to be able to be a
proficient drawer to have a vocabulary
right all right let's talk about the
grammar now so that's vocabulary let's
move into the grammar domain so the
easiest idea that you might think about
the way that in which say sequential
images might work is simply to have a
mapping again of graphics to meaning
just at a higher level of meaning so
this is the approach that taken when you
for example have theories that say well
I'm just going to look at the meaningful
changes that happen between images like
changes in characters or causation or
something like that and this is the
approach that was taken by Scott McCloud
and his book understanding comics which
was really the first in America the
first thing to really look at the
structures of these visual languages I
would say there are some problems though
and this is what he called panel
transitions so you have different types
of meaningful shifts between panels
there's some problems with a pure panel
transition approach though for example
these images might be difficult to
understand on their own I might be hard
to tell what's going on here if you
can't tell what's going on in something
how can you make just a mapping to some
other panel then but if you get the
context these things make sense fine
right and you suddenly know what that
actual pictorial content is which means
that there's something there's top-down
knowledge that having a larger sequence
gives you about understanding individual
units in a sequence like this which I'm
going to keep showing you over and over
again so you should really get used to
the sequence you probably recognize that
these two panels go together somehow
there is something meaningful about them
as a group not just the linear
relationship between them and these four
go together as a group right that goes
beyond just their individual
relationships in addition you have a
sequence like this which I'll let you
kind of take in for a little bit so
they're playing baseball Charlie hits a
ball Linus goes chasing it
and then you have Linus coming up to
snoop Lucy excuse me and building a sand
castle and running off and catching the
ball again right so what you might tell
is that in this panel here is almost
identical to this panel here and really
what happens is if you unfurl this
sequence into a linear sequence you'll
notice that what's actually going on is
you have this kind of embedded clause in
it you have this sequence about sand
castles plunk down into a sequence about
baseball and that means you have to
somehow connect this panel to this one
over here right and I can tell you that
yes this is a embedded clause because we
can unfurl these from each other we can
pull them out for each other and they
they both work fine right you understand
them as individual sequences on their
own but together they make an even
bigger meaning that is actually funny
because of the embedded claws right so
you can't do that with just a linear
sort of transition approach you need to
have something allows you to make these
distance connections so this same thing
happened in linguistics alright so in
earlier in the first half of the 20th
century linguistics viewed a grammar
like this is basically Markov chains so
you get you know one word and then you
kind of make a probabilistic decision
about what the next thing is going to be
or not right and the problems with this
approach we're basically the same as in
that I the argument that I just made you
can't make distance connections very
very well and things like that so what
they really needed was they needed
additional piece they need a grammar to
be able to account for these connections
which is to say that even though you
might experience language linearly
underlying it there might be groupings
of hierarchies hierarchic relationships
between words and this is the grammar
right these sorts of embedded phrase
structures and things like that so the
same is true here it's that instead of
this grammar being a syntactic structure
that has say like nouns and verbs it's
more of a narrative structure in this
case so what is this structure consists
of well
you might start off a strip with what I
call an establish basically sets things
up gives you information without acting
upon it so basically these characters
really aren't doing anything it's just
saying here are the characters that will
maybe do stuff right an initial starts
things off so it gets things going a
little bit the peak has the climax or
the culmination of the sequence and the
release kind of gives you the resolution
or aftermath prototypically kind of the
coda of events now these are pretty
similar to kind of traditional notions
of narrative and they all go into a
canonical narrative arc in this order
now I should stress that these narrative
structures are not meaningful on their
own they map two aspects of events so an
establishes usually a passive state
nothing's going on right there just
sitting there an initial is usually a
preparatory action something is about to
happen a peak is a completed action and
a release is a coda of an action like
what happens afterwards right but this
isn't always the case these are just the
prototypical mappings so in a sequence
like this there these things are non
prototypical so we still we have an
established that here sets up the
interaction between snoopy and the
hockey puck but notice they're both in
motion right snoop the hockey puck is
moving Snoopy surprised right and in
fact the puck is introduced to Snoopy as
you are introduced to them so there's
kind of a nice double introduction going
on there in this case the initial isn't
a preparatory action he's not about to
chase it are starting to chase it he's
in the process of already chasing the
book this is no longer a completed
action here it's the interruption of an
action right and this is not the direct
aftermath of this event if it was the
code of an action he'd be like you know
run over on the ice or something
flattened on the ice which does happen
in other strips I read a lot of peanuts
we do research with them which is why
you see these things so but this is like
his reaction to that event right so but
they still form the same kind of
canonical narrative arc okay so our
first analogy with kind of syntax is
that narrative is separate from yet
interfaces with meaning it's not the
same as meaning but they interface
together now if we just stop there we
would only have sequences that are four
units in length right and that'd be
really boring so how do we then account
for these additional things well in this
case we have a very prototypical initial
to the preparation and a completion
right of the hitting the ball these form
their own little mini arc let's say but
now we can map these together and in
this case now this whole grouping acts
as an initial that sets up this whole
grouping that acts as a peak right so
not only do individual units play these
roles but whole groupings play these
roles so that gives us our second
analogy which is narrative uses
constituent structures so larger
hierarchical relationships okay so with
that we can now return to our sandcastle
example and we can account for that
distance connection because the
architecture looks like this and we have
our embedded clause it looks smack here
in the middle which is what i call
prolongation which is kind of a medial
extender between an initial and a peak
oftentimes so this is what allows you to
have this embedded clause and if you
were to pull this out it would just be a
narc on its own because it's not playing
a role in a larger structure right so
this sort of grammar is able to handle
this pretty easily alright so I
presented you a bunch of theoretical
constructs right to what degree might
they be true and not just me making
stuff up right make having theories so
if we're going to say that visual
language is analogous to verbal language
then we can study it using analogous
methods using cognitive science methods
and psychological methods so the method
that I'm going to talk to you about
today is EEG which is looking at
people's brain waves essentially the
electrical activity of their brain so
what we do is we have people in a lab
and we have put this nice shower cap
that has these little electrodes on it
and we put on people sides and we play
them comic strips on the screen and we
measure their brain activity with this
cap amplified the signals not very
loud so we got to amplify it really big
and we feed that into a computer and the
raw EEG looks like this is very messy
because it essentially the total sum of
everything that the brain is
experiencing at that time but we time
lock to individual points say comic
panels and we can tell what's happening
at that time by averaging across lots of
trials and averaging across lots of
people and you get these nice smooth
waveforms they can be tell you about
things so let's say and this is you can
do this with words you can do this with
images you can do this with all sorts of
things so let's say these are two
different types of sequences when is
good when is bad right in context right
of whatever sequence it sits in if the
waves were right on top of each other it
would mean that the brain is not
differentiating between them so there's
no difference in the processing but when
there's a separation between those waves
it means that there's something that's
different going on in the brain okay so
that's the way to kind of read these
plots this is time on this case and by
convention so this is electricity so
that's negative and positive and by
convention negative is plotted up don't
ask me why it's just that's the way it
is some people plot it positive up and
we don't like them we kind of shown them
so okay in previous works through
language of the last 30 years the people
have actually recognize patterns in the
brain waves that are associated with
different types of processing we're
going to focus on three specific ones in
language processing so if I give you a
sentence like the cat won't eat the food
and you compare eat the food which
should sound like a normal sentence to
the cat won't bake the food you get this
little lip here okay and that happens
about 400 milliseconds after the onset
of the word bake okay and that's called
an n400 effect and meaning negative
polarity compared to the normal one the
white which would be eat the food and it
usually has to do with problems with
meaning with difficulty understanding
the meaning of something now this is
problem with meaning because cats don't
usually bake
food right at least not my cats so you
get this sort of meaningful thing it's
different if you get something like the
cat won't eating the food which should
sound grammatically bad but it's still
meaningfully okay in which case you get
this other deflection this big
positivity here and that Peaks around
600 milliseconds so it's been called the
p600 which is usually associated with
kind of grammatical errors so we have
these kind of two different waveforms
that have to do with meaning and grammar
it's not quite that clean anymore but
we're going to pretend it is just for
today to make it easier if you were to
have the cat won't baking the food you
would get both an n400 and a p600 the
same same time and I believe this work
was actually don't avert u-dub this this
particular experiment there is also a
different sort of negativity that
happens when you do something like Max's
of proof the theorem which should sound
really bad and what's happening is
you're messing with the the tree
structure so those constituent
structures and you get this kind of left
anterior negativity so this is again
around 400 milliseconds but this one has
a particular distribution on the scalp
it's kind of left anterior very
specifically and it has to do with
grammatical processing also okay so
let's now use this these precedents to
study this first analogy the narrative
is separate from meaning okay so in this
study what we did was we presented
people with sequences like this one
you've already seen where our peak panel
or culmination makes sense right here's
our big culminating panel so we also
then had semantic anomalies okay so in
this case this panel shouldn't make
sense in the context of the sequence but
it still has this kind of culminating
vibe to it right has this culmination to
it so it's a semantic anomaly but it's
still grammatically okay okay if you
have a sequence like this you now have
it should be semantically okay in that
it in so far is that it still relates to
baseball the strip is still about
baseball but this panel doesn't make
sense
right it's not a culmination anymore
it's more of a preparation which is more
like an initial panel okay this is a
grammatical error and we can do that
with both of them now so now you have
this kind of grammatical error because
it's more like a preparations and more
like an initial but it's about not about
baseball anymore so it's both
grammatically bad and meaningfully bad
okay so we show people these things one
image at a time measure their brainwaves
this is what we found ok this is the
waveforms that we find at that critical
panel and this is essentially the n400
effect so you get this larger n400
effect to the ones that are violating
the meaning the double violation is more
than the single violation of meaning and
both of those are larger than the one
that's to the grammatical violation now
this doesn't mean that the n400 is
telling you about those that there's
grammar here ok and 400 happens
basically with anything that is
unexpected unpredictable in meaning
certainly this is not going to be very
predictable as a subsequent panel here
right so you might get a little bit of
an end 400 effect but not as big as when
you violate the meaning okay so now
let's look at the very next panel the
panel after this if you find this which
is our p600 effect you get this positive
deflection no in this case this
positivity happens only for the ones
that violate the grammar the one that
has a violation of meaning was no
different than the normal one now we saw
previously you've got a big end 402 that
right and it seems really weird in
context but it's not giving you any sort
of p600 effect because it's not a
grammatical error right and so this is
evidence then that there is this
separation between this narrative
structure which the violations give you
a p600 and the meaningful violations
that give you an n400 effect right so
you get these two different structures
ok that's analogy one analogy to was
that we get this hierarchy constituent
structure right of this structure so
let's see if we can find evidence of
that so in kind of classic experiments
back in the 60s when they were first
trying to find out if this is the case
for
language they did this technique of the
cliq technique where they played people
sentences in one ear and in the other
ear they played white noise that sounded
like a click and that click either
happened at the break between clauses so
at the separation of structures or
inside the structures right maybe in the
second clause or in the first clause so
what you what they found was that as you
might expect it's easier to understand
or recall where the cliq happens if it
happens at the break because that's a
natural break between constituents right
you might expect you could put a comma
there and it'd be okay right or you
could pause in that sentence but it's
harder to understand the ones that
violate the structures because they
actually disrupt a cohesive unit so we
did the exact same sort of paradigm we
took our sequences like this and we took
blank white squares and we put them
either they appeared either at the break
between the structures inside the first
structure or inside the second structure
and we had multiple different types of
structures so the boundary wasn't always
at the second position it could be a
different position so people could just
eat by position alone guess where the
break would occur so you have these
different white panels okay so they look
kind of like this except people get them
one panel at a time the reason for that
is when you measure brain waves any
muscle activity that happens might be
basically noise electrical noise so if
people are moving their eyes around a
lot like reading a comic page that's
going to create noise in addition that
you don't know where they're looking to
lock those brain waves to so we do it
one at a time so this is really this
kind of like disruption jolt for them
this is what we found at the blank white
panel okay so this is at the white panel
itself we found this which is a left
anterior negativity so this left
lateralized negativity that's larger to
the disruptions within the constituents
than the ones between the constituents
so people are differentiating here
between the disruptions of the
whole groupings then the ones that fall
in between groupings we also though
found in the back of the head this
posterior positivity so again this is
the p600 effect that we were talking
about before in this case it just
happened to the ones in the second
constituent relative the things that
were not in a second constituent things
that were in the earlier ones okay so
let's disentangle these results so first
of all the violations of the
constituents were worse than the ones
that were between constituents showing
there is evidence that people are making
this grouping okay notice that this
cannot be a transition between panels so
it is the case there's like a major
break at a lot of these these boundaries
right like this character change but by
the time you get to the one that's
within the first constituent and the one
that's between constituents your brain
already can tell there's a difference
between them right but you don't know
that you've passed out of that
constituent yet you don't know that
you've shifted into the next thing
because you haven't gotten there yet
right but the brain is already
differentiating between them okay which
means you're actively predicting
upcoming structure you're not just
integrating things that you've already
gotten to so that means there has to be
some sort of structure there that you're
making predictions with okay what about
that positivity we saw out here in the
second constituent only so what I think
is happening in this case is it's
essentially like getting a comma in the
wrong place like one word too late right
so you read this you cross the boundary
you get another comma you think oh maybe
this is a boundary so you try to group
all of these panels here into one unit
which they can't be grouped in one unit
so you have to kind of reanalyze that
and that's what gives you this
positivity it's trying to make this
ungrammatical grouping of everything
that had you saw before ok let's go
beyond just the visual narrative that's
just the visual language ok so that does
give us some clues that there is indeed
this structure here right
okay so first of all it should be easy
to tell that if you just took got rid of
these panels and replace them with text
it would still tell a decent story right
so we would then assume that the
structure of verbal narratives uses the
same sort of structure that we find in
visual narratives and you might probably
have been thinking this for a while well
what about film so what about film well
what is film doing well with a camera
you can just capture stuff that happens
right it's just like seeing you get this
kind of pervasive temporality of stuff
unfolding in front of you and when you
combine that with the narrative grammar
that is in your cognitive structures to
cut that up do you say film editing you
get a hybrid of these which ends up
looking something like this like we can
find in film where you have different
film cuts and each of those cuts has a
different property similar to the kind
of structures that we talked about ok so
film is a hybrid between the kind of
pervasive temporality of seeing and the
narrative grammar now naturally again
that's going to create changes in the
structure so the fact that things move
cameras also move is going to maybe wash
out some of the finer grain structures
that you find in the static form right
and we should be able to quantify that
ok so what you end up with is you know
this narrative structure and meaning
they can then map to lots of different
types of modalities right and the
different structures that it operates
with will then change the way that that
structure operates but it's essentially
the same underlying system ok let's get
beyond that though ok so or the big view
here then is that we have these numerous
interacting structures that we we've
talked about right so what are different
behaviors well spoken language is
essentially this grouping here out of
this system it's the emergent structure
that happens when you combine syntax
phonology and meaning a written language
then adds the graphics because you now
need to have this link between phonology
and graphics because you are making
found in to light right a visual
language just selects a different
portion of this overall structure so a
visual language is the mapping of
narrative graphics and meaning right
when you have say individual images that
don't have a narrative structure you get
single images like this where now you
have just a mapping of graphics
demeaning without the narrative
structure right so the overall system
just depends on what portions are being
engaged at what time ok now let's get a
little bit weirder ok music has also if
you head sound you can hear some music
playing but music also has been
hypothesized to have a grammatical
structure to it a hierarchic system now
this system doesn't have meaning to it
it's not conveying concepts anymore but
there is still an ordering system to the
hierarchy of how we understand music so
when they do brainwave studies with
music and play say off-key notes that
violate that grammar you get waveforms
that lo and behold look similar to what
we have already been seeing so you get
this p600 in the back of the brain the
back of the head I should say not the
brain necessarily but back the head to
off-key notes and you get anterior
negativities in this case more right
lateralized instead of left lateralized
that map to kind of the same sort of
anterior negativities and people believe
that these are the same cognitive
mechanisms that are underlying these as
well so if it's the case that you use
the same kind of cognitive structures
the same brain responds to language and
music and visual language right well
maybe it's the case that you don't have
a dedicated like place in the brain for
each of these things but rather there's
a place in the brain generally that does
processing of kind of grammatical
structures and it does so differently
for each of these channels so if we were
to open this up even bigger than what we
see is with this kind of combination of
grammar modality and meaning a language
has all three right whether it's in a
visual language a spoken language or a
sign language language gets the magic
combination of all three
these now if you just get rid of the
grammar you still have a communication
system right single images gestures now
obviously language also within
communication but it's a special type
that uses all three of these together
but there's another mapping that we
might have which is that we might leave
out the meaning and just have a grammar
map to a modality and that's what
happens with music and dancing and other
channels that are not full languages
right so again it depends on what
portions of the overall system are being
selected and go to each other so it's
less about the individual sort of place
of comprehension it's more what emergent
structures occur out of common
underlying structures and that's where
I'll end it so that's a say that
studying the visual language of comics
can really tell you a lot about the
brain even bigger and the bigger picture
and I just like to acknowledge my
advisers and collaborators and
Fantagraphics which gave me all the
peanut stuff to use so thank you very
