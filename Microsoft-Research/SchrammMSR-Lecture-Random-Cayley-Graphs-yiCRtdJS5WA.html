hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
we're very pleased to have no guy loan
from Tel Aviv University the IES and
also Microsoft Israel and as our first
from Amos our lecturer and he will be
telling us about random Telegraph's
Thanks okay thanks a it's a it's a
pleasure to be here and let me thank you
all for coming and day it's actually a
special honor to give a this in Ogura
lay SRAM Microsoft lecture clearly these
are people in the audience who knew or
did better than me but I knew him pretty
well since the time a he was a student
in Israel a in fact in my first year in
Tel Aviv University I shared an office
with Oded say uncle and day and he was
telling me a already very some may
wonder stories about two dead who was at
that time a beginning a undergraduate
student and then later of course a I met
him in Israel and in visits in a in
Microsoft in Redmond Terry here and they
I want to tell you one story about two
dead a day in this house a essentially
nothing to do with mathematics but they
were still I think it's a nice story so
they say was in Microsoft I was visiting
their here in one of the summers and
they in some weekend they organized a
some sort of a family they a were say a
employees of Microsoft Research and day
in their families and visitors they went
to a park a nearby and there was food
day beverages and him some recreational
games
day one of the games was a some sort of
a of competition and they it went as
follows so we were partitioned into
where groups of a seven or eight people
and then each group a got a like Aggie a
big hoop like a hula hoop and we were
supposed to stand in the hall to stand
in a row and hold hands and they then
you are supposed to pass his hoop around
the body of fair everybody while still
holding hands
you probably gets a picture but I have
it here anyway so it's something like
this and if you want to see the hoop
better well of course I didn't draw it
but you can imagine that these girls say
over the hymns of fear of these people
and you are supposed to try to do it as
fast as possible while holding him say
anything the rule was it's a first one
was allowed after he finishes his part
the way to help the others away to stop
holding hands with the second guy in
twelve others because they were children
and so on and they you know that
mathematicians can be competitive a sum
can be more competitive than others
in short we really wanted to win okay so
we took it seriously and I was the first
one in my group and they and I thought
that I passed this a hoop around my body
pretty quickly and then I jump to help
the others but while doing so I kind of
blends it other groups to see what's
going on here and I was amazed to see is
a pale or Dead's group was about to
finish we were like in number two or
number three among the eight and they
were more as finishing in the reason
this happened there so he was the first
in his group and what he's done is that
he he placed the hoop on the grass
actually like you see here and they and
then he had everybody kind of going
through the hoop eyes are still holding
hands
and they in this is consistent with
rules and and you can check it it's
really you can do it much much faster
than to really take it around your body
and they and if so they won by a by a
huge margin if you think what's his
shows so he had the ability to a to
think fast to be original and think in a
non-conventional way it shows that he
has a a good day geometric intuition a
in short maybe does have something to do
with mathematics a after all I was very
impressed so well so that's a story in
there in the remaining time let me go to
say more a technical part of the talks
away so here is a title a again so a so
the title is random Kayla graphs a and
as the three words of the title
indicator will be here a a probability
and a algebra and combinatorics a and
they and I should point out that already
in the first slide there is something in
accurate a an opal radius clear out
eight a so the Peterson graph that you
see here is a is nautical graphing in
fact a but we will a you can wonder if
it's a random graph or norte but indeed
we want to see something about the
difference between a Telegraph's and
just a regular graphs maybe in one of
the theme say i want to try to convey is
a vet a random kala graphs is a is a
class of random graphs details that is
good to investigate now it is
interesting now I wrote it I wrote
here's a definition of a graph not
because I think you don't know it was
just to say it's a notation so all my
graphs will be finite and undirected I
denote the graph G by a pair ve visa set
of vertices is a set of pair say these
are edges in a graph is Kayla graph
if the vertices they are all the
elements of group finite group in our
case because we'll talk about trying and
telegraph so the group is age and then
we have a subset s of the group that is
closed undertaking inverses so a when X
belongs to s then X to the minus 1 also
belongs to s in the then two vertices a
B to group elements a are connected to
each other if a times B minus one
belongs to s or in other words if one of
them is obtained from the other one by
left multiplication by an element of
face of the set and here you see in
example the group is say the cyclic
group with five elements a additive
group a here and they in the generating
central sector s consists of plus two in
minus two right so we get there we get a
cycle and they and as I already
mentioned they this class of random
calligraph say maybe it's interesting to
study and they just remind you we're
here again we don't mean to do it in
this audience but let me do it anyway
the training on graphs of be named are
very successfully in a so their study a
really is interesting in day and there
is a lot of systematic study a in
started with a binomial a or any random
graphs a initiated very relation
training by Hibbert and they some 50
something years ago and then tell other
models of random graphs that have been
studied quite a lot there so this a
random regular graphs a smaller networks
random Leafs and a in others and they
and I want to try to convince you the
trained impale graphs are also
interesting now definitely random
Telegraph's have been studied they some
properties of them but but maybe not in
a systematic way as a as deal the other
classes and maybe it's a it's worthwhile
to do it a but today I'll demonstrate it
a only by a focusing at a at one
property of sale of random telegraphing
delay
try to give you some motivation for
doing it and this will be the chromatic
number so as you know the chromatic
number of the graph is a minimum number
of colors required to color the vertices
of graph so that adjacent vertices do
not get the same color and here you see
that they a chromatic number of the
Peterson graph is a three that's a
proper coloring and of course a it has
odd cycles so it is not too colorful
incidentally whenever something does not
make sense or you want to a ask
something called make comments and
please do so we don't have to wait to
the end I want to start with a this
study of the chromatic number of a
random paragraphs with a motivating
question and this is supposed to
indicate the things here are a bit
unexpected so I think it will be a hard
way to guess what's going on so here is
a question for you suppose n is bigger
than 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10th
let's say largest number I know to write
in a PowerPoint so if you say so n is
just a big number okay so it's a think
about a fixed big number and we take a
group H a it is of order n so finite
group n elements a and the Aces random
subset of H a both sides so still big
but small compared to the size of the
group we roll here 10 to the 10 and we
take the Cayley graph of H with respect
to F Union s minus 1 so I want to have
an undirected graph so it's inverses if
I need them so this will be a regular
graph of degrees the cardinality of s
Union X minus 1 so roughly 10 to the 10
or maybe twice than to them and they and
we ask what is typical chromatic number
of each graph okay is it for example
Biggers in pain so this will be a
regular graph maybe one thing that we
can think about is random regular graph
a random d regular graph has chromatic
number about D over
lordy some more precise estimates are
known so someone pretty big and here are
some answers here so with high
probability it it actually depends on
the group and here are three examples so
if the group is an elementary a billion
two group so just a binary vectors of
length K with respect to binary addition
then with high probability the chromatic
number will be - lets easy fact think
about it what they they this next to
worry are less obvious so if H is a
cyclic group with P elements that may be
prime or so it's true also if it is not
prying but then with high probability
the chromatic number will be 3 exactly
so with high probability here I mean
it's finite number so with high
probability it means with probability
least a 99.9% okay let's say and then if
H is a more random looking group like
modular group so SL to Z P 2 by 2
matrices over a finite field with
determinant 1 then the chromatic number
I don't know what it is say but but it's
definitely big so it is say certainly it
was high probability it is better
thinking okay and here is another one
another specific example so let's take
again the elementary abelian to group I
think that's kind of the simplest group
that we understand so just binary
vectors here of length a thousand with
respect to binary addition so two to the
thousand vectors vectors of thing
something and we take this example 2700
random elements here we don't have to
add the inverses right everything is an
inverse of self so this will be a 2700
regular graph decade graph what is the
chromatic number of the Cayley graph
here so here it turns out that again
with high probability at least 99.9
percent the chromatic number is exactly
4 will be exactly 4 and I thought it's
remarkable so I added an exclamation
mark and then I saw that the four looks
like for Victoria
so I dropped it one line below but that
little fizzy okay so these are examples
and of course you can name you can guess
the general question and they and I
should say sit despite what these
examples may indicate really we know
very little about these questions so
these were the few specific cases where
we kind of know the answer but usually
there will be very big gap between upper
and lower estimates say so the general
question is that H will be a given
finite group so someone gives you a
group a think about your favorite group
and this will be number say between 1
and H over 2 it's not so important and
we'll take a subset s of H random
uniformly at random which will be a
subset s of cardinality little s we ate
the inverses and they and we look at the
corresponding Kayla graph okay and they
and we ask what is so now the chromatic
number a of this Kayla graph is a random
variable we can ask about the
distribution right expectation Farian
say whatever birthday but we are very
far from trying to understand really a
the second moment so I just want to
understand expectation or just to get
what is the typical value with
reasonable probability so this is what
take what will you want a to know and in
some cases will be able to say something
and in some cases how we not be able to
say much in fact there is no finite
there is no infinite family of groups a
for which we know really the behavior of
this chromatic number for all the ranges
of a of the number of generators of the
cardinality of s so this will be
interesting to understand even for
elementary ibly in two group or cyclic
groups of prime order whatever now let
me talk a little bit about the
motivation so I'll mention three things
say I'll do it quickly so here are
mostly it mentions a buzzword say again
you can stop me if you want to hear more
or I can name but they but I think so
leave reasonable motivation for trying
to understand how the chromatic number
of random care graphs loop in the first
one is maybe the connection to expander
so expanders are again is probably most
of you know are very sparse graphs that
are very highly connected so the degrees
are relatively small may be concerned or
may be small compared to the size of the
graph but every small sanitary set of
most of the elements expands in the
sense that it is lots and lots of
neighbors outside the set so these are
expanders in the best constructions of
expanders and you can say so at least
best in in terms of the spectral game
our Cayley graphs okay so this holds for
say a Lebowski Philips Sonicare
Ramanujan graphs a found also by the
Ghoulies and this is true for many other
constructions as well so these are
Cayley graphs why random so so it turns
out there is a something quite general
that we prove to is a raw one long time
ago is it for every finite group that
you take if you take say two logs the
size of the group random elements then
with high probability this will be a
good expander okay so really random kala
graphs tend to be expanders and in fact
if the group is a is more carefully
chosen so these are more recent results
while we're gaining on board so for
example for SLE to Z P two by two
matrices over Z P whose determinant one
even if you choose a bounded number so
ten random elements then with high
probability
this will be an expander and something
similar a holds for other group so I
just mentioned here it this paper blue
yard the green in Poway this for suzuki
group so basically the same a kind of
machinery really works for many other
groups between the train bomb qaeda
graphs a tend to be expanders now you
see an expander if you are really a very
good expander think now about degrees
that are somewhat vigorous and constant
is then you cannot give a big
independent set because the big
independent set is
so that all the neighbors are outside
they said so it means a kid doesn't have
so many neighbors because it doesn't
have neighbors inside the independent
set in fact being a very good expander
is essentially like saying that you
don't have big independent set and for
Kaylie graphs in fact for any
vertex-transitive graph sayings it's the
largest independent set is small is
essentially like things that the
chromatic number is large there is some
liberate McGirt between the the two
obvious bounds but it's essentially the
same question a so somehow understanding
the chromatic number of random
telegraphs is closely related to
understanding their expansion properties
so this is one the second one is also
not say much so this comes from
information theory and they just to a
site without explaining the word they
and say something about the witson house
in a rate zone so it turns out the
random self complimentary Kayla graphs
provide examples of graphs with large
chromatic number in small what's called
whitson house and great so that's in an
old paper will say alone or litski and
they and let me describe to you what is
a problem here so this has something to
do with say communication complexity a
communication game so think about the
following communication game on graph G
so we have the two parties say Baba
Nellie solution and they say no a graph
G so G is some specific graphs which
they both know and then Bob knows an
edge of the graph and Ellis knows one of
the endpoints of sage okay and what they
want is at a Elysee is trying to a it's
written here so Alice is trying to send
a small number of bits to Bob so that he
will be able to tell which end point he
has as I see just a a one-sided
communication problem so she is sending
the bits and then Bob is supposed to
know her
which side his in
how many beats she has to send and
that's actually simple so if you think
about it a little bit you see that what
she really has to send in determining
she can do she well since we're counting
beats a she has to send log base two of
the chromatic number of G ceiling let's
say because what they can do is they can
agree on a proper coloring of the graph
and then she will just send the color of
her endpoint and in because the two
endpoints have different colors then Bob
we know and this is if and only if you
can convince yourself that they if they
have a good protocols and for two
adjacent things she cannot send the same
information so she really has to send
the bits that correspond to a proper
coloring of the graph so let's say the
questions it is well understood but one
of the main themes in information theory
is that things often become more
efficient as the length of communication
increases or as you repeat things many
times and this is what we want to ask
here and this say is leads to this
notion of whitson housing rate is like
some analog of Chinon capacity to though
say so what channel capacity is for
independence number which thousand rate
is for chromatic number time so let's
ask ourselves what happens if B Bob his
two edges e1 and e2 and Ellis has an end
point of even an end point of e two now
she wants again to send to Bob bits and
bits that will enable him to reconstruct
both endpoints and the question is can
she sent much less we so forth she can
do what she did for one case and double
it doing it twice but maybe she can do
better maybe what's called a direct some
thing fails here kind of in a strong way
and they and indeed it turns out that
sometimes she can gain a lot and if you
take random so some model of random self
complimentary Cayley graphs of high
chromatic number they provide examples
where the number of bits in both cases
will be about the same
so even for doing it once Ellis will
have to send roughly log the number of
vertices and speeds but for doing it
twice for two completely independent
things you'd still have to send the same
maybe plus two or something I saw what
she had sent for one plus another bit
and a half or two bits or something and
if you do it many times say in the limit
they when Bob has many many edges and
Ellis has many endpoints and you ask
what is the number of a a bit she has to
send and they pair edge so you divide it
by the number of edges then it's not
difficult to see that this thing has a
limit and the limit is called a within
house and great and in there several
interesting questions a regarding way
and the reason a housing great a but
they so as I said this rain dog self
convent or calligraph we provide
examples where one edge will require
roughly login beads in the width now
generate so in the limit it will drop to
about half log in but it's not known for
example is our graphs on n vertices were
for one edge you have to send roughly
logon beads maybe the chromatic number
is roughly n or n choose 1 minus epsilon
in still in the limit you will have to
send only say 0.01 log in beads and they
just anything and maybe understand being
a this a random paragraph in the
behavior of the chromatic number better
will tell us something about this was
yes so self confluent Ares say
isomorphic to the complement and the
complement is replace every knowledge by
an edge and every age by knowledge okay
now there is a third day motivation that
come say this was my original motivation
actually and that comes from additive a
number theory and they I think it's an
interesting question so it has to do
with something say so in additive number
theory really
lot of the work is about some sensei I
checked last week
so in maisonette there were a hundred
and sixty-three papers with the word
some set in the title and there were
actually fifty-three more papers with
the word some set in the title but very
clear some and - set so sorry
so really this is a studied a lot so it
is some set is just you have a set a and
you loop it's a sum a plus a so the sum
of all little a plus little B were
little a little B belong to a you take
all the sounds of pairs and you want to
understand the structure how does it
clue quad sets are some say same in one
thing that was a discovered by a Ben
green and it's quite surprising they say
if you're in ZP so in the finite field
we say or the thing I mean here it just
as an additive group and it's a group we
say P elements then every complement of
small set is actually some set so if you
take all of VP and you or me hundred
elements no matter which hundred
elements you omitted if P is big enough
then this will be of the form a plus a
for some appropriately chosen a and it's
a chiral to ask and he asked actually
what is a so let's define a F of B F of
P with this maximum number if so that
whenever we delete from ZP a set of F
elements then what we get is a subset
okay always and we want to estimate it
and he showed that it goes to infinity
we still so releases F of 3 is at least
one ninth or something times log P and
we scour say they showed that a F of P
is at most some constant P to the
two-thirds plus epsilon so little bit
there and I could improve a the bounce
so really a lower bound is say something
like squared P over score log P whenever
you delete square root P over scroll
slope three elements from ZP it's always
a subset what you get its upper bound is
a most Beatles two thirds over some
algorithmic power
but the truth should be so there are
several reasons to think that the truth
should be roughly Peter's 1/2 ok so the
lower man should be closer to the to the
truth in the let me tell you something
about a house a a proof of faith of this
a upper bound goes because this is what
they I think that one name one should
improve and why is it related to this
chromatic number or friend Impaler
graphs so roughly it go say is for all
we have to show that we can choose a set
B which is not so big right maybe P to
the two-thirds so that is a complement
of it is not a something so just do it
in two steps
we chose B as a union of b1 or did I
write here B and V prime a a union of a
B prime and a and B Double prime okay so
first we choose V prime half of the
elements of V and we say that ok these
all are going to be in the set B that
I'm trying to a construct its complement
is a subset or to show that complement
cannot be a subset now you see once I
know B prime then any set a so that a
plus a would be ZP minus B a per se has
two for it B prime because V prime is
part of me ok so it means it a has to be
an independent set in the Cayley here
it's Cayley some graph but some graphs
are really similar to a usual Cal graph
so instead of difference we take some 2
are adjacent if their son belongs to B
prime so a will have to be an
independent set in this scale E some
graph with respect to B Prime
now if all these independent sets are
small if then there aren't too many of
them just because there aren't too many
small sets and therefore now since I can
complement B prime to set B by many ways
that can just add another set of the
same size roughly and I can do it in
many ways
if there are more ways to complete
b-prime to set B then there are
potential is then this will give us say
some B's it is not a sunset so that's
basically how it goes
is the main thing you have to way to do
is to show that indeed there is a choice
of B prime which is not so big so that
the independence number of the Cayley
some graph is small I already told you
that for Cayley graphs independence
number in karateka number are about the
same well here is some it's Cayley some
graphics it's still Russia's essentially
the same and they in some how-to way so
if we would be able to understand I
think what is a typical chromatic number
of a random kala graph it will be the
same as a random Cayley some graph of CP
with respect to about square root P
random elements then hopefully we will
be able to improve this a square root P
in that question of grade okay so these
are some me so so let me tell you what
they what is known about a about this
question what is not known
so here's invitation H will be a group
of size a in just because G is graph so
H is we did not say group and s will be
a random subset of size K which is at
most n over 2 it's not so crucial here
if you take K distinct elements or you
take them with repetitions because the
gap between the bounds is is larger than
the difference between these two models
so so think about it what you prefer and
let me denote by this sky of HK the
chromatic number of the calligraph of a
of H with respect to s a union with the
set of it's a inverse si a and of course
it's a random variable we want to know
what is say it's difficult for you so
here our a here is a comment that I
already said that of course this is a
regular graph is
every que de Graaff is regularly the
first extensity Vey if the degree is
roughly K right so it's most 2k because
maybe with 2 K elements and we added all
the inverses maybe there were some
repetitions or maybe some are inverses
of themselves but the degree was I
probably say essentially K and therefore
just by a by the trivial a upper
estimate for the chromatic number of any
graph then the chromatic number is
always at most a this degree plus 1 if
you want since if it's not the Cleveland
you don't need the plus 1 a in the any
known fact that I mentioned is it's a
chromatic number of random regular graph
of degree D is roughly D over log D so
maybe one guess would be is it a here it
should be close to that also I've told
you at the beginning some examples where
the behavior was a little bit different
there but still I I really in fact I
suspect it for bigger case a this gives
a kind of say right behavior but but
this could be one gives and a and here
are some results so here's some things
it holds for any group for general group
you don't assume anything about the
group so the group is just a finite
group of order in n elements in de case
anything then the following case you may
say hold with a high probability so the
chromatic number of this Cayley graph
wage was respect to K random elements
enter in vs. is at most some constant K
over low K so indeed you can always gain
these locations upper bound the same as
a what happens for a for usual K a
regular random graph what about the
lower bound so there is a pretty big gap
between the lower bounds the upper bound
with high probability of course as
always with high probability I mean with
probabilities that tends one is a in 10
as the size of the group tends to
infinity ok so in the wrong round you
have a instead of log K in the
denominator there is log n log of the
size of the group but what's worse say
there is a square root
on both say the numerator and the
denominator so so in general they'd say
and if the best a lower bound a train
always worth a over square root log N
and they notice that the log in somehow
has to be there because I told you I
didn't quite tell you maybe but but the
example say that I showed in the
beginning for Z P before with specific
numbers say actually shows it for some
groups really the chromatic number
doesn't grow at all as long as you
choose randomly only log the size of the
group elements so then still the
chromatic number says three or something
but then it starts growing okay so it
will come soon again in another lower
bound that is somewhat a better if K is
big so if case bigger than square root N
or something is always say at least some
constant K square over n log square n so
in particular if K is n over two if it's
really a dense graph something that
looks like a random graph G in 1/2 or
something then this will tell you that
the chromatic number is it most n over
log n because of a the first bullet
there and at least a n over log square
in because of say second bullet so so at
least four then say one understands it
reasonably well in the middle there is a
very big gap so in the middle let's say
when K is about square root n here are
something gay ok and I should say some
special cases so most is the case that K
is equal to n over two it's been
considered before so so it follows from
the papers that I mentioned in there
there is also a the more recent paper
right Christofias in marks room so
basically say a case of a K equals n
over two is we may study day now here is
say something about safety graph so for
s A to Z P and for other finer simple
groups as well but let's just take a SL
to CP
there is some absolute constant Delta
maybe one over a hundred or so so that
they for every K then if you choose K
random elements a and a they're inverses
then the chromatic number will be at
least a to the Delta so it starts
growing there immediately and they and
here is a a group of a prime order a so
cyclic a group of F prime order there is
a result by young polish a mathematician
called H Irwin ski so he shows it for a
K which is at least log V over log log P
to the one half so up to some point
today then the chromatic number is it
most actually is exactly three right
it's a three three because peace odd so
any any element will give you an odd
cycle so and they in this case not so
big then with high probability the
chromatic number you say is exactly
three and this can be improved a up to K
which is a so this what's the proof God
gives I don't know if it stops exactly
there but if you go up to 0.99 say or 1
minus epsilon log base three of P then
with high probably the chromatic number
is at least three and and because of
what I said before false a lower bound
the log behavior is sort of tight right
so we know that once the number of
elements we choose is significantly
bigger than log P let's say 100 log P
then the chromatic number starts growing
because there is this lower bounds it is
a constant square K over square root log
P that's one say okay this is for groups
of prime order is something similar
holds for any cyclic group and they in
fact also for any abelian group art a
but let me if we stay with this CPK if
we choose more elements so then the
chromatic number is at most K over log P
so we gain this log P but afterwards say
maybe we we keep growing this upper
bound a and they enforce a very dense
case so if a
if Kay begins to be a constant feel like
half of P or P over 100 then there is a
result by green and a more accurate
estimate by green Morris that they says
that actually in this case the chromatic
number is up to a constant P over log P
so it really behaves like say usual
random graph up to a constant in there
and in fact for C P and C equals 1/2
even the constant is a correct content
so to really behave like a random graphs
okay so these are results and let's say
something about K about proofs and they
literally is a proof say a combined some
probability because we are talking about
random graph say some algebra because
it's Cayley graph so specifically Czar
spectral bounds that are used so some
properties of the eigen values or fail
phase graphs and a known connection
between eigen values and the chromatic
number and in some community really
arguments because this combinatoric say
so I want to show something that is a
that is it may be part of the
probabilistic part and it will be a
simple thing that I can almost describe
it and maybe I'll just say so this about
groups of prime order so you know
usually you prepare a PowerPoint
presentation you want a a picture so you
go to a Google Images or Bing images and
a and you type a the sentence and you
look at the pictures and usually you
have no idea what's the connection of
the picture you get to what you typed
but here I thought about it and sent it
this is a group of people and there is a
prime number of them because this is a
so so I think that's why here but anyway
definitely this is what I got so okay so
so we want to prove a this will be
pretty simple we want to prove that the
chromatic number of Z
be cyclic group P elements was respect
to K randomly chosen elements in K is at
most point 99 log away three of P we
want to show that with high probability
the chromatic number is exactly three so
we do the following and okay so what we
want to show is it with high probability
if we choose these random elements X 1 X
2 up to X K in CP and K is what we said
then there is an element a in Z P so
that a times X I mod loopy all of them
lie in the middle third between PI over
3 and 2 PI over 3 for all I let me show
you why this is enough a it's similar to
things it so probably some of you see it
already but but let me show it anyway
so suppose that I know already is it
surgeries such a nail then here is
coloring we cover we take CP and we
cover it by 3 cyclic intervals that are
nearly equal so each of them is a size P
over 3 it small ceiling of you over 3
then we have this a this elements it I'm
still supposed to tell you why it exists
and they we have to call all each
element Y so to call a while you will
take Y we multiply it by a modulo P and
we see to which interval it falls among
the three disjoint intervals and this is
the color it if it failed into the
second intervals and the color is 2 and
if it's a third and so on okay so why
would this be a good coloring that's a
simple to see we have to show that if y1
try to have the same color and with the
a y1 a y2 fell into the same interval
then the difference between them is not
plus or minus one of our x i's right and
why is it the case because if they fell
into the same interval then the
difference between them is smaller than
the length of the interval so it's
between strictly between minus PI over 3
and PI over 3 this difference between
them because they lie in the same
interval
but all the ax I are a hour between are
in the middle third between PI over 3 &amp;amp;
2 PI over 3 so they are not between
minus PI over 3 and plus PI over 3 and
therefore this difference is not ax I
meanings it's the difference before I
multiply by a is not X i if therefore
the color in this good it's very simple
now why there is this a okay so I'll a
say something about C is same so the
intuition is very clear right so you fix
an A in this say ZP star so in non zero
element a or do you see P and then the
probability is that X I now we take this
X is a rental me the probably is at a X
I fell into the say the middle interval
is one third for each fixed X I and
these are random independent so the
probabilities at all of them lie in the
middle third is one third to the K and
because K is 1 minus epsilon 0.99 log
base 3 of P then these 3 to the K is
still significantly smaller than P and
because of this expected number of phase
which will be okay is big right so we
kind of expect to have one but of course
we still have to prove it because the
fact is expectation of a random variable
is big does not mean that it's positive
with high probability so one has to
prove something definitely the bad
events for distinctly the mainsails are
not independent a if you know that a X I
is in the middle third then two a X I is
certainly not in the middle third so
some of them really depend a lot on each
other so so some of you have to use
second moment and there is a nice trick
that works only for the prime case and
they I just a say the streak so so this
trick is useful things like play for
example in a paper with you value used
it a long time go away and they don't
say why it really and something is great
here but let's not yeah it's just not
there look at it and just saying that
instead of looking at a X I modulo P we
look at a we add y so instead of looking
at a X where X is random model P we look
at ax plus y model oopy all right
and somehow the good thing about adding
Y although it's not clear it seems
unrelated to what we are trying to prove
the good thing about it is that when we
add y then for two distinct tails for a1
and a2 the events at a1 X plus y lies in
the middle third and a 2x plus y line
the middle third become independent so
all these events will become pairwise
independent and if they become pairwise
independent it means that we can compute
various a and we can apply chebyshev and
if we do it carefully then we realize
afterwards its effects that we added Y
is not so crucial there so you have to
do something but they but there is a way
to take this Y away okay so this is not
supposed to make too much sense but at
least you understand what's going on and
there it's not to complicate it it's
more complicated if you want to do it
for general cyclic group say when P is
not a prime so then but the same result
still holds or or if you want to prove
something for abelian group so for him
okay something a quick about a general
group say so this you say this very
different so basically what they we know
to do there is just a to us a to the
spectral a connection between me between
the chromatic number of graph and eigen
values jjcc matrix and they so this
what's written here so so one bound that
I mentioned is it for any group H of
order N and for all K this chromatic
number of the random Telegraph H respect
to K randomly chosen element is at least
constant root K over load root lo game
so the way to do this is a to use the
following so this result with a right
ones that I already mentioned is that
for any group if K is bigger than log N
and if you take K random element since
group you can look at a non-trivial
eigen values very so the biggest
eigenvalue is always the degree of
regularity in a regular graph but you
can look at all the non-trivial eigen
values no one can chose that they with
high probabilities absolute values of
all the other eigen values is at most
constant root K over root log in it's
are several subsequent proofs of the
same results that are somewhat better so
they give a little bit more information
and at the beginning I was very happy to
see that people keep reproving it
because it shows that you're interested
day after why I started to think what's
what's wrong with the original proof
okay but anyway so this is a so there it
did they some later proofs and then
there is a a simple a old result while
alien - which shows it's a chromatic
number of any D regular graph in which
the smallest the most negative eigen
value is lambda so lambda is always
negative because the trace zero the sum
of eigen values zeros as smallest one is
negative but if the negative one is
small in absolute value so there is it
provides a lower bound for a chromatic
number socratic number is always at
least minus D minus lambda over lambda
because lambda is negative this is a
positive number so just plug in it and
you get a you get a lower bound and they
and essentially the same may works for
him for those other groups so if you
look at what they a for example the
boolean that word proof does it shows
that if you take a random Kayla graph of
s A to Z P with respect to some bounded
respect to K generators then all the
non-trivial eigen values with high
probability will be somewhat small and
somewhat small here is K to the one
minus Delta so some smaller power of
faith
reality and and they say and getting you
you plug you plug in there so this would
give the tale with high probability the
chromatic number of si to Z P with
respect to K random may generate or say
will be a cliff stay K to the Delta so
let me just use the last day three four
minutes to mention me if you open
problem say those are many problems of
course a for the main one is maybe to
close the gaps between the upper and
lower bounds and as I said there is no
even a single infinite family of groups
or say a binary vectors or elementary a
billion two grooves or a or cyclic
groups or any groups you want for which
we understand the behavior of a of the
typical chromatic number when say the
number of generators is square root of
the size of school so then the bounds
will be the lower bound will be about
eight the fourth root of the size of the
group in the upper bound roughly the
square root there are some logarithmic
terms here and there but but just to
understand say the right exponent but
maybe it's interesting to look at other
groups so so in particular I wrote here
the symmetric rule pay I haven't done it
much but I think it's a now it should be
true I don't want to prove it but it
seems that it should we choose it for
solvable group say if a chromatic number
stays a small at least at the beginning
so until K is they may be logarithm of
the size of the group and they it seems
that it should be true I mean as I said
it's true way for any abelian group a
and they and if it's true for all well
then we would know for every that for
every group of all the orders is say
chromatic number with high probability
is exactly three they are always
solvable by a fight Thompson here I'm a
4h equals Z 2 to the K it seems that
this is a group that we understand waste
I mean just binary vectors with respect
to binary addition
you can prove they're a little bit a
more than what I said in there for
general grooves so if H is equal to the
T binary vectors of length 30 with
respect to addition and they so if K is
n over 2 let's say we choose 1/2 of
sentiments then till the truth is both
upper and lower bounds say up to a
constant factor in fact I think that's
error you can get you the right concern
it we have like n over log n log logging
so it's not really like a usual random
graph but there is another log log n
factor and the reason for that is that
these groups have a very many subgroups
right so this is a difference between
them and cyclic groups and and because
of this it a you gain something and they
in what I mentioned it's a beginning it
was a special case of this so if the
number of generators that we choose is
between 1 plus epsilon T let's say in 3
minus epsilon T they mean with high
probability the chromatic number will be
exactly 4 so so the examples that I
mentioned at the beginning was a Z -
2000 when we choose 2700 elements and
with high probability the chromatic
number will be exactly 4 maybe it stays
for even a little bit further I don't
want to prove it but it could be but we
know that after that it should start
growing in Christ so once for any group
if we have some big constant times log
the size of group sends a chromatic
number is at least the square root of
this big constant starts growing for 3
ok and finally maybe say following could
still be true and actually believe it's
true if it although if since these are
some differences between groups then it
seems that these differences are only
logarithmic vectors so maybe a and in
fact a it could be true that for every
group of order N and for all admissible
values of K this typical chromatic
number is like
is equal to K up to Paulino great unit
vectors in M in the size of the groups
so this is true when K is very small it
is true in case very big when K is close
to n but they but it will be nice to
know it for K which is about a square
root N or anything in between so just to
understand a the behavior when K is a
power of n and n this looks a
interesting and with this I'll a finish
and a thank you for your patience
I know so there was the lower bunk that
I didn't talk about it for large case
was this K square over in log N and day
over n log square n so a so this was the
different K so it's a me some more
probabilistic counting argument and day
and again some of them also use a some
specific so this n over log n log log n
for Z two to the T something more
specific for the group but K but indeed
for kind of the middle the middle range
when when Z degree is a is about a
square root say a if they may then they
all come through through the eigenvalues
in did and maybe
you mean is it possible is it my
eigenvalues now so so the eigenvalues
will not give Baker this is a correct
behavior of say eigenvalues sowing
because their second eigenvalue of a
regular graph is always at least
something like in terms of the other
applications or things like square root
and when one of the regions of K that
you're really interested you know right
yes
so I I think as I said originally I was
interested in in this say square root
behavior because that was related to a
to this question of fail of green and
our say I don't care I mean so this is
one range a which looks interesting a
they yeah I mean for the K over to way
it looks interesting because of trying
to understand the analogy we'll say with
usual random graphs but they but there's
a gap is smaller so I think a and then
for a small case it's interesting I
think to understand for which groups it
stays small as K grows and for which
growth groups it starts a growing
immediately but they did for me square
root will be the most interesting right
case so I thought about he I mean for
the range where I prove that it's a
three with very high probability I can
say something about the concentrations
well it should right sorry so kind of I
keep thinking that I should think about
it more but it should be true that it's
a concentrated said it's very
concentrated at least when they
difficult chromatic number is a
quite small so I would expect just
because of the analogy was usually
random graphs that they that maybe
whenever is a chromatic number is a it
most say even a small power of Fame then
it's concentrated in one or two values
but they but I don't yeah yeah I don't
know it's a yeah it's interesting okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
