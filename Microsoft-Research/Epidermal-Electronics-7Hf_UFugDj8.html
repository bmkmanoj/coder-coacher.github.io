you
John Rogers is here from UIUC
he does nano and molecular scale
fabrication materials patterning and
build some really crazy electronics as
you'll see today he's got a chemistry
physics background in fact has a
physical chemistry PhD out of MIT he
spent time at Harvard Bell Labs so he
was in the condensed matter physics
department and in fact ran the
department for a number of years is now
the swollen material sites are swollen
chair in the material science and
engineering department at UIUC with
joint appointments across just about
every department you can imagine and so
his publication patent you know press
awards list is massive and again you can
look at his bio for a small snippet of
that he's also start had multiple
startups I'm starting with his PhD work
and I guess recently with company called
MT 10 which I don't know if you're gonna
talk about yeah but if you look at his
project list as well and he's done
everything from stretchable lithium-ion
batteries and silicon icees to flexible
silicon volt photovoltaics electronics
on balloons for surgical catheters
cellular scale optoelectronics negative
index metamaterials the list goes on and
on the thing he's going to talk to us
about today is in the bio integrated
graded electronic space specifically
epidermal electronics so rather than get
in the way of a great talk I'm gonna
okay all right hey thanks a lot
does he for that invitation and for the
invitation to come here and spend some
time at the labs it's bringing a lot of
good memories back from my time at Bell
Labs sort of you know a research lab in
a in a company that makes products and
so I think it's a great environment to
do innovation I'll tell you about some
of the things that we've been doing it
Ellen Oy recently that you know may be
of interest to you know hardware
interfaces to the body of relevance to
future computing and health and wellness
and sports and
other things and it's you know referred
to you know this is term we made up sort
of epidermal in the sense that the
electronics themselves have physical
properties pretty well matched to the
epidermis so they go on in a way that's
more or less invisible to the to the
person wearing the devices which we
think is important for you know kind of
an intimate high functionality interface
to the body to have that kind of
wearability so I'll start by you know
giving you a motivation what we're
trying to do perspective on how you know
this kind of electronics relates to more
conventional stuff I'll give you some
ideas around you know requirements in
materials and mechanics and
manufacturing in order to do this kind
of skin integration and then you know
the last half maybe a last third or so
it's just step you through a bunch of
examples of things that we've built with
the idea that this is still you know in
the early days and I think there are a
lot of opportunities for new ideas and
higher levels of functionality but just
give you a snapshot of where we are
right now in the in the development of
this this kind of technology so let me
just start by telling you something that
is obvious you already know it but it's
a useful reference point which is you
know the future of electronics where
it's been in the past where it is now
and where it's going into the future and
it's really all about making things
smaller faster and cheaper so in the old
days you know if giant boxes that you
know fill desktops or fill rooms they're
used primarily for special specialized
industrial you know academic computation
but Moore's Law miniaturization and the
transistor sizes reduction in their cost
increasing levels of functionality
really transformed the hardware into
completely new device formats and you
know that's an engineering
accomplishment maybe the more
significant one is it introduced a
qualitative shift in the way that
computing devices are used in our
everyday lives much more ubiquitous much
more personal as communication tools
productivity enhancement systems and
entertainment devices and you know if
this is where we were this is where we
are where we go in the future it's
pretty easy answer you just go to the
signal
to roadmap and it tells you exactly
where you know this integrated circuit
technology is going to be you know 5 10
15 years into the future and if you
think about folks who are in electronic
materials electrical engineering and
thinking about integrated circuits doing
research on them you know the vast
majority are working on scientific
problems around that scaling and that's
that's a very valid set of problems to
be thinking about because this is a
trillion-dollar global industry and
there's a lot of interesting fundamental
science problems in the service of that
enormous market and an enormous impact
it's not the future though that we're
thinking about these days we're trying
to do something a little bit different
and complementary not competitive with
that future but something that might
open up range of opportunities that are
currently unavailable because one thing
that has not changed over the years is
the platform for all of this electronics
has always been a silicon wafer which is
a wonderful class of material in a wafer
form it's a wonderful type of substrate
but it has certain geometrical and
mechanical constraints that make it
tough to say take your iPhone and wrap
it onto your brain or melt it in your
skin or envelop your heart with it
because the wafer is rigid and brittle
and planar and that's fine for lots of
applications but there are some that
require intimate integration with
biology that cannot be addressed with
commercial integrated circuits that
exists today and the idea is if you
could do some of this stuff bring all of
this power to bear on problems of human
health or brain machine interfaces that
could lead to you know another
qualitative shift in the way that the
technology is used and you know expand
out some some opportunities there so
that's you know a 30,000 foot view of
what we're trying to do let me pound
that message home a little bit further
in the context of the brain and we've
done a lot on the brain the heart I'll
focus this talk in the skin but the
brain is a good
raishin to further help me make the
point that I'm trying to make so if you
think about the brain it is a very
sophisticated electrical system and if
you want to do therapy on the brain you
want to diagnose abnormality in in the
brain or you want to establish a brain
machine interface the best way to do
that might be to take the most
sophisticated man-made electronic system
which is silicon CMOS electronics and
interface it with the brain but that's
not easy to do for the reasons I just
told you the wafer itself is planar huge
geometry in this match what is not quite
as obvious is there's also an enormous
mechanic's mismatch because silicon is a
very stiff hard material it has a
modulus about 150 Giga Pascal the brain
is a soft squishy piece of jell-o its
modulus is about 5 kilo Pascal so you
have geometry and mechanics problems
there so what do people do today this is
the workhorse you know last 20 years
it's really a pretty nice piece of
technology and it's been very useful for
a variety of neuroscience studies and it
accommodates that geometry mismatch
through a micro machined array of doped
silicon pins that penetrate down into
the tissue on one side and on the other
side terminate on a flat platform where
you can mount a chip that you would dice
out of the wafer and establish the
electrical interconnect that way and you
take that integrated thing and with an
air hammer you mount it onto the surface
of the brain these different pins can
penetrate to different depths in the
brain and thereby solving the geometry
mismatch problem but you damage the
brain upon insertion and then what's
worse is that over time the interface
between these hard shafts of silicon and
this soft yellow degrade because the
brain is not static in a mechanical
sense it's swelling D swelling is
rattling around in the skull slightly
and now you have a pin in a moving bowl
of jell-o and that's it's a bad
mechanics interface to think about so
this is great
it will likely remain in widespread use
but
what we're thinking about is what could
you do to enable a future in which the
electronics are configured to match
biology so soft in a mechanic's sense
shape conformal and then made out of
biocompatible materials so so that's a
pretty clear example the heart as well
where where you kind of can appreciate
the motivation but the same you know
constraints and considerations apply to
skin as well because the skin although
not as soft as the brain and not as
reticulated in geometry as the brain is
rough and stretchy and flexible and so
what's done today usually involves point
contact with conductive coupling gel
gels tapes individual wires that run to
a separate box of electronics
electronics really not integrated with
the skin it's electrodes and this is
great for a hospital or research
environment but nobody's going to wear
that long-term because you know you got
wires running all over the place and
then also this tape interface to the
skin is irritating over time for reasons
that I'll get into in a few moments so
not great for long term wearability also
not great for improving the
sophistication of the interface because
as you add electrodes you add wires and
pretty soon you just you're you're
swamped with wires and it becomes a
difficult scaling which is a shame
because the electronics themselves are
racing ahead according to Moore's law
but then your interface to the body is
stuck in this kind of old old approach
you can get better and there are
commercial devices and and you know more
sophisticated than this obviously and
you know this is kind of one example
where you have you know bare die or
individual chips mounted on two flex PCB
so you know a tape of polyamide
you have adhesive on that and you can
put it on the on the forehead in this
example but still it's not great for the
same reasons I just mentioned you'd
eliminate some of the wires but you
don't eliminate the mechanics problems
at the interface which are driven by the
fact that the skin is soft and stretchy
and even a tape is only flexible it does
not stretch so its constraining the
natural motions of the skin and that's
kind of a problem
so if you think about that set of
circumstances you might conclude I got
to use something other than silicon if I
if I want to do do better and you know
we've been working in this space almost
20 years by now and we spent a lot of
time looking at alternatives and you
know the semiconductor is probably the
most challenging materials component of
an integrated circuit and so you can
think about organics so polymers small
molecules single crystals maybe carbon
nanotubes the only thing graphene is
interesting to say these classes and
materials you might say okay you know
polymer would be a good choice for a
semiconductor because it's already kind
of soft its bendable whatnot we spend a
lot of time on this we built flexible
displays like like this one in the early
days the problems with polymers are that
their electrical properties are lousy so
you can do a slow non emissive display
like this you want to do liquid crystal
display that's a lot tougher if you want
to make a high functional interface to
the brain that's out of the question so
you know the the topic might be then I
need a synthesize new polymers so I can
move this metric for transistor
performance in terms of the mobility in
centimeter square per volt second from
this regime up to something you know
more comparable to state-of-the-art
inorganic electronics but you know
that's a large number of you know that's
orders of magnitude is the point and so
you got a huge gap
how you gonna span that gap becomes a
topic of research and a lot of folks are
still working on that we sort of moved
away because that just seemed a little
bit too daunting and instead you know
come back and ask the question is
silicon really ill suited for this kind
of thing certainly in the wafer format
it is and certainly the intrinsic
material properties are not well matched
but could you do some simple things to
effectively bypass those apparent
limitations and that's where we focus
and that's what I'll talk to you about
today but not in super deep level just
give you a sense of it so I can skip
over to you know what what kind of
devices are enabled so if you think
about the wafer as I already mentioned
and as you know you can't bend it and if
you try to bend it it will it will crack
very quickly why is that
because partly the material property so
you think about the bending stiffness
and the degree of bend ability is
defined by the peak strains associated
bending over given radius of curvature
it depends on the intrinsic electric
properties of the material that's the
Young's modulus and you're stuck with
that if you want to go with silicon but
it scales with thickness in a pretty
straightforward easy-to-understand way
it was a really strong scaling so the
bending rigidity or the flexural
rigidity bending stiffness is the
product of these two things so what that
means is if you think about plotting the
bending stiffness as a function of
thickness and a log-log plot you have
you know a power-law behavior so you
know for a wafer that might be a
millimeter thick the bending stiffness
is maybe 10 Newton meters but if you
take that way for you shave it down to
something that's sort of nano scale and
thickness so this is 20 nanometers in
thickness you've reduced the bending
stiffness by you know up to 15 orders of
magnitude so now it's 10 finto Newton
meters and you know although that's just
linear elasticity Newtonian mechanics
there's nothing quantum about that
whenever you change a material property
by 15 orders of magnitude that changes
qualitatively the way you sort of think
about it and in fact silicon with that
thickness is floppy very very flexible
as illustrated with this SEM image in
the sense of a low bending stiffness was
also in sense of degree of bend ability
so the peak strains associated with
bending are going to find how far you
can bend it before you crack it because
silicon can only withstand about a 1%
tensile strain and what you see is for a
given Bend radius R that bending strain
goes down linearly with thickness so not
quite as strong as scaling as the
bending stiffness but nevertheless
thinner is better so very flexible very
floppy now if you think about the
silicon sheet with that type of
thickness it's great it's bendable but
it's incredibly fragile you touch it
this little shattered it's just not a
sensible platform for an integrated
circuit in the same way that a silicon
wafer is and in fact that's why people
use wafers that are this thick it gives
it some robustness so robots can move it
and you can put it on a PCB for example
so you know next question is maybe you
think about this as a building block
material for an integrated circuit you
build on a sheet of plastic or a piece
of rubber and so that brings up the next
challenge then which is how do you go
about gluing a piece of silicon to a
piece of silicon rubber and that's a
hard problem because the material
properties are so different the thermal
expansion coefficients in particular are
very different 100 or thousand times
different and as a result it's hard to
come up with an adhesive that would keep
a silicon chip bonded to a piece of
rubber in kind of a realistic way but
there again thickness comes to your
rescue because if you think about what
drives interface cracks it's this
parameter which is the energy release
rate and you can see how it depends on
the differences in thermal expansion
coefficients of the two materials also
the change in temperature is driving
interface stresses but here again it's
scaling in a nice way with thickness
which means that as I decrease the
thickness of my silicon the energy
release rate goes down the propensity
for a crack to open up is diminished and
so it relaxes a lot of constraints on
what kind of adhesive you need to think
about in order to keep these dissimilar
materials bonded together here's an
example so this is a very thin plate of
silicon we've printed it down onto a
micro machine Ridge on a plastic sheet
there's no adhesive at all right here
this is just Van der Waals forces
keeping it in this cantilevered state
partly because of that scaling so thin
silicon is what we like it's floppy it's
very flexible and it's sticky in some
sense so you can do this kind of
heterogeneous integration so those are
nice features thin silicon looks pretty
good but not good enough because this
kind of characteristic is not what you
want or you need if you want to get on
the human body so this is bending what
you really need is something that can
both bend and also stretch because if
you only have been to bendability then
you can only wrap cylinders and cones
you can't even wrap a sphere much less a
brain or a heart and you can't
accommodate the kind of
complex motions that you know organs are
undergoing all the time either so you
need stretching and there's no thickness
to which you can make the silicon that
will impart stretch ability so that may
seem like a daunting problem but even
that one is really easy to overcome it
turns out so if you take this thin
silicon and you bond it to your
elastomer substrate you know ultimately
you want something that stretches you
probably need to use a stretchy
substrate so you stretch out your
silicon rubber and then you use surface
chemistry such that upon contact this
silicon will bond very well at the
interface with the rubbers such that
when you relaxed the pre strain it
induces compressive forces on the
silicon and what happens it will cause
the silicon to spontaneously buckle into
that type of shape and that's pretty
nice because it's an accordion bellows
made out of silicon on silicon and in
particular if I stretch it out now I'm
not stretching the silicon itself but I
get it effective into any stretch
ability because I'm trading out of plane
displacement for in plane deformation so
the amplitude goes down wavelength goes
up if I stretch it out and then the
reverse happens when I compress it back
down so as simple and and it works
provided you understand what's going on
with the mechanics because all you know
this kind of you know thing is a hard
soft composite you have to know where
the stresses and strains are if you want
to do real engineering with these kind
of ideas we spend a lot of time on the
mechanics really entire papers just on
that type of structure so we understand
what's going on so that's that's the
idea thin silicon buckling physics off
you go you can make integrated circuits
this is not an integrated circuit
obviously this is a test structure it's
not even a good starting point for an
integrated circuit because you're never
going to do device processing on rubber
it's just not going to happen but you
can make ultra-thin circuits fully
formed flexible and then as a backend
packaging step you bond them to this pre
strain rubber you create all this buckle
wavy shape now you have a composite that
has the soft mechanics you want and this
is an example of one of these you know
stretchy integrated circuits based on
silicon this is a picture taken at our
Beckman Institute we have an imaging
technologies group and so they made a
nice
image here so this is a glass pipette
they're just pushing down on the center
of our circuit and you can see how it is
able to deform in a continuous
curvilinear way you can see the
different wrinkles and the interconnect
traces and here you can see you know
that particular trace is stretched out
by this local force so you know all the
way the structure that was originally
present has been pulled out you've
pulled your accordion all the way out to
its full extension if you kept pressing
you'd probably crack that line so the
key is be able to understand what is the
range of defamation that your devices
can accommodate and do the design
upfront so that your application
requirements can be satisfied so circuit
design combined with mechanic's design
to allow you to do what you what you
want to do now the key thing is that you
haven't sacrificed in the electronic
properties by doing all this stuff so
it's thin silicon it's wavy circuits but
the electronic performance is very much
comparable to what you see in a wafer
based system factor of a thousand better
than what you can do with the organics
very nice switching characteristics and
both types of transistors and this is
just a simple ring oscillator so you've
taken this stuff you've crumpled it up
and yet you've done it in systematic way
with understanding of mechanics you
haven't disrupted the electronic
function and that's that's the key part
of this obviously yeah
material is under mechanical load yeah
so that's a good question in this
geometry No
so there's actually finite strains at
the device positions there's the P
channel in channel MOSFET and so ring
oscillator mobility are the switching
characteristics of the transistors train
change slightly with strain that's been
exploited by the semiconductor industry
to increase the speed of integrated
circuits at a modest level I would say
you know kind of a twenty percent type
shift in the output currents so in some
cases you can live with that in some
cases you cannot and in cases that you
cannot you actually take this circuit
and you can do things to it to strain
isolate the active devices to eliminate
that dependence but it's coupled in this
very simple implementation but I won't
step you through the basic ideas thin
materials hybrid hard soft composites
and buckling and from there all kinds of
elaborations and different things that
you can do to accomplish strain
isolation it's a very good question but
you know you can sidestep as an
engineering problem so if you can make
soft circuits that way then you know
what do you want to do with it and I
outlined at the beginning what we have
in mind and that's putting things on the
body and it could be inside the body
could be on the body we got interested
in skin mounted maybe four years ago I
guess and started to think about what's
out there today that goes on the skin
unlike you know these tape on electrode
wires that is comfortable and and works
and we thought about kids temporary
tattoos as maybe a model to think about
how to do circuits on the skin because
you know they look great you put them on
your skin you move your skin around it
can kind of wrinkle stretch deform with
the skin and you don't even know it's
there
so that's what we set out to do is to
think about whether we can make a
integrated circuit and sensor suite that
has that kind of mechanics or something
as close as possible to that and what
does that mean that means as thin as you
can go we had a target of five microns
we got pretty close to that regime as
light as possible in an aerial mass
loading sense so maybe a milligram per
centimeters
squared as low in modulus as you can go
we had targeted something kind of brain
modulus level 5 kilopascal but the skin
is actually much stiffer it's about 100
kilopascal so 100 it would be good we a
little you know aggressive on that but 5
kilo Pascal needed to be at least as
stretchable as the skin itself so skin
will stretch to about 30% before it
starts to tear so when something that
would have that kind of elastic level
stretch ability and then some additional
requirements you know you need your
sensors and electronics electrically
isolated from the skin so needs to be
waterproofed but at the same time you
don't want to disrupt natural processes
of trans epidermal water loss so you
need some level of permeability as well
and you know so that's what we had hoped
to do and there you know a lot of
challenges in you know getting anything
on the skin and they relate to you know
issues and long-term viability and the
interface and you got to have access
adhesion is always always a challenge
you know you want something that's soft
and conformal like like a tattoo and
then you know cause power weight and
size also you know relevant
considerations this one is a big one and
has been over the years you know how do
you do robust bonding or binding without
you know irritation and it turns out
that that problem is directly related to
the mechanics goals as well so I'm not
going to go through all the details let
me just highlight the key points so if
you think about modeling the mechanics
of a piece of electronics just a generic
material bonded to the skin you can run
different scenarios in terms of the
modulus of the electronics and its
thickness and you can calculate
interface stresses in particular that
tend to drive delamination those could
be shear stresses or peeling stresses
and you can do it for different
scenarios silicon chip glued to the skin
flexible electronics a plastic sheet on
the skin thinner lower in modulus or all
the way to this kind of tattoo like
construct that I put forward in the
previous slide and what you see in both
cases peeling and shear is that the
stresses peak up at the edges so if I
stretch on the skin delamination will
start at the edge
which is sort of intuitive but then look
at the magnitude so the magnitude for
otherwise similar level of deformation
for the silicon chip is large smaller
for plastic sheet and then smaller still
for the skin like same thing over here
but the actual magnitudes are what are
notable here so if you think about the
ratios of the stress silicon chip to
plastic sheet for skin in tension or
under a bending deformation going from
silicon chip to plastic sheet helps
because it's reducing interface stresses
but not by a huge amount by about a
factor of four to five now if you think
about the ratios though for silicon chip
to this electronic skin that is skin
like scenario now you're talking about
five orders of magnitude and that really
changes the way that you think about
adhesives to the skin to the point that
you don't even need adhesives at all
these things just cling to the skin
because they're so soft and deformable
and so you can see that it's easy to do
that experiment just to see a
consequence of that mechanics so this is
same chemistry in an elastomer silicone
based material all we've done is we've
changed the density of cross-links
between polymers in this material to
change its modulus same thickness same
interface chemistry just different
modulus and you can laminate it onto the
skin it's sort of near the wrist and
then you can flex your wrist and you can
see what happens no adhesive this is
just you know attacking us of the
material itself keeping bonded so here's
a silicone material with a modulus about
1 megapascal so you flex your risk wrist
and it new laminate you stretch the skin
again it drives the delamination front
that begins at the edge now if you take
do the same exact experiment now with
let me see can i get rid of this
now with lower modulus here's what
happens so same thing same region of the
skin same interface chemistry same
adhesive strength it doesn t laminate
and that's just because you've minimized
the interface stresses and it sticks now
it just clings and you can you'll move
your wrist around and it stays put so
that's the basic modulus just so much
just softer yeah yeah you can do that
yeah penetrating pins those those are
options we were trying to get the thing
stuck on the skin without any straps or
pins or tapes but you could add that to
like improve the robustness of the
adhesion you can definitely do that
so how do you get something that has
very low modules so I told you some
tricks to get stretching but now you
need stretching but also a very low
stiffness effective stiffness and it's a
tricky problem you want a device that
has a modulus of say a hundred kilo
Pascal's but you want silicon in there
and that modulus is 150 Giga Pascal's so
how do you do this kind of composite
engineering and this is one way to do it
so illuminated by full 3d finite element
modeling so you take a circuit ultra
thin one like I mentioned before with
silicon nano membranes but don't use it
in the form of a continuous sheet cut it
into an open spider web mesh like this
in terms of these intersecting
filamentary serpentine wires and devices
built into that and then bond it to a
low modulus silicon substrate thin you
know 30 microns in thickness 50 kilo
pascal if you do that fully optimize
with modeling guidance and then you
stretch it along this direction or along
this direction you can measure stress
strain behaviors and that's telling you
how stiff it is so the first thing you
see is that the measurements along x and
y are quantitatively captured by the
modeling the other thing you see is that
the modulus is very much comparable to
the epidermis itself which is has a
modules that slope is about 160
kilopascal and you can see it starts to
go nonlinear around 15 to
percent strain so this is actually a
better material in some ways you can
stretch it further but in this small
strain regime it's very well aligned
with with skin itself so that's a
framework into which you can drop
transistors integrated circuit sensors
and so on and so this example of a field
effect transistor there's a resistive
trace of silicon very thin silicon cut
into that geometry here's what it looks
like the transistor performs well even
though it's in this fun funky
configuration you can do sensors these
are strain gauges you can do photo
detectors other kinds of things we've
done many many classes of devices in
this context so here's what it looks
like when it's mounted up onto the skin
very soft no penetrating pins no
adhesive you just laminated on good to
go same kind of experiment that's
laminated on the skin of the postdoc who
did the work and then we poked them with
a glass rod so you can kind of see how
that moves around if you grab it at an
edge you can peel it off this is what it
looks like it's so flexible and floppy
and soft it doesn't even support its own
weight it just kind of collapses down
onto itself to give you a sense of the
mechanics you know the practical yeah
yeah so these filaments are polyamide
and then in certain regions they're
silicon and metals and dielectrics to
make the devices exactly and then
transferring it to the soft substrate
then the key there is to keep the
elastomer out of any kind of processing
it's not going to happen because it
moves around too much you can't get
registration from a layer 2 layer yeah
good question so in terms of this this
mechanics you know the practical
question is how do you hold this stuff
and you know manipulate it around and
you know there we just use water soluble
tape
okay so PVA put the circuit on there
flip it over put on the skin wash away
the tape and that constitutes the
mounting procedure some movie to show
that so
it's just a demonstration platform that
has a number of different types of
active devices transistors diodes
inductors capacitors LC oscillators
temperature gauges strain gauges there's
an inductive coil and then an antenna
that runs around the outside so what
you're seeing is this transparent tape
backing allowing student to place this
circuit directly into contact with the
skin so it's skin circuit silicone
rubber backing and then that PVA tape
and he's washing away to tape by playing
a little bit of water and eventually
that will disappear and just leave the
circuit right here behind and the
circuit substrate which extends a bit
further out around the periphery here
and you'll kind of see that so once it's
gone then it's just this epidermal
electronics on the on the skin and you
can see then by you know pinching the
skin you can get a sense of what the
mechanics is is all about so here's just
the silicone rubber backing here is the
rubber backing plus the circuit
demonstrator and as you pinch this thing
what you see is that you know the skin
wrinkles and folds into forms in the
region where the circuit is located
almost exactly the same as the way it
deforms in regions where the circuit is
not located so that's sort of validating
the design approach so the circuit is
not constraining the skin or preventing
it from behaving in a natural way as a
result you put these things on and you
don't even know that they're there and
that's with no adhesive so you can
squeeze it move it around the inner
interface is strong enough to stay
bonded but not in an absolute sense it's
not strong bonding so you can just grab
it at an edge and you can peel it off
and that's what you're seeing that's
what you're seeing here yeah so there
are a couple ways to do that you can
come in with one of these water-soluble
tapes stick it there and then peel it
off it'll come with the tape and then
you can do them the mounting
but in this case you could not reuse
that let's say so you know the absolute
strength of the bonding is not great but
if you want to do better one way is to
just use you know existing temporary
transfer tattoos as substrate you
already have the fda-approved glue
mounted on the back and then go through
the regular thing so this is a Malaya
night pirate just somehow pirates and
tattoos you know there's no ocean
anywhere near Illinois so this doesn't
make a lot of sense but in context of
tattoos maybe so you flip it off now you
know the additional benefit of this is
you can conceal your electronics you
know so if you're into covert things
we've worked with CIA and so on that
turns out to be a relevant capability so
the circuit is kind of right there in
the facial region of the pirate so I
used to travel around with these
circuits mounted on my skin just so
people could see it but requires you
know students to make lots of you know
circuits so I don't do that anymore
giving them a break yeah so you can I'll
come back to that in a second there is a
finite time over which you can stay on
the skin and remain viable in terms of
function I'll describe that in a second
but I'll just instead of you know
wearing them I just carry some
representative examples around so this
one is your one of these kinds of
circuits but embedded in about a
millimeter thick sheet of rubber so this
is not epidermal but you can handle it
and kind of twist it around and get a
sense of what's going on
the other one is one of these epidermal
constructs on PVA so the mechanics here
is dominated by the tape but you know
just to give you a sense of what it
looks like so to your point how do you
get these things on and how long do they
stay on
so tattoo is not bad this just Van der
Waals forces it's okay for in an office
environment but if you go swimming it's
coming off you know and so how do you
get it to stay on better is something
that we started to think about and what
we found is that a really simple way to
get
very robust integration with the skin
that does not compromise this epidermal
construction just just use spray on
bandage so I don't know if you guys have
ever used it go to Walgreens you get a
little spray can of this stuff it's a
it's a copolymer of an acrylate and a
silicone and you can spray it down as an
adhesive and then you can spray it down
on top as an encapsulants the circuit so
no silicone backing at all just the
circuit printed off of a silicone stamp
and that's what's shown in this video
it's a little more advanced way so
there's the spray-on bandage it's a few
squirts that's only about a micron thick
sheet of this that spray-on bandage
material but it's a nice adhesive you
print your circuit right onto your skin
like that and then you spritz it up with
some more spray-on bandage on top and
you let that dry and now it's much
thinner than it used to be and it's also
much more robust from a mechanical
standpoint so there's a video we have of
so now you can go swimming you can take
showers you can exercise you can do you
know essentially whatever you want and
it won't come off
typically after a few days you in the
morning you add a little spray-on
bandage to you know maintain the
integrity the encapsulating layer but
you know just give you since this a
little bit bigger is a piece of
electronics designed to do something a
bit different than I showed you before
this is actually a functional thing and
now you can you can wash it and do you
think so time frame these devices will
stay on about two weeks that's about it
and it fails not because of a deficiency
in the adhesive or the encapsulating
layer it fails because the skin is
exfoliating cells from the stratum
corneum all the time and the time scale
for that exfoliation is about two weeks
the entire surface your skin is gone
kind of in that time scale and so you're
not sitting on a stable platform it's
shedding you know those cells and your
circuit with it so that's a fundamental
biological process I don't see a great
way around that you can imagine taking
the device off maybe for a day and then
you could reapply it
something like that but that's that's
just the practical reality of where
these things are so this is what it
looks like on the skin this spiderweb
stuff and you know the key thing is it's
conformal to all of the very challenging
topography of the skin except you know
the most daunting crevices and that's
good from a standpoint of adhesion but
it's also good in terms of the interface
to the skin so the skin is a window into
health and wellness and physiology of
the person wearing the device you can
imagine you know put a cell phone in
this format I think it's more compelling
to think about applications and wellness
and sports and healthcare so that's
where our interface emphasis has been
and this kind of contact ensures that
you can make good good measurements and
you can make those measurements on any
place in the skin like places where you
would not be able in a practical sense
to have a wire and a piece of tape so
the finger back in the neck forearm jaw
so if you come into the group you have
to be willing to do this and then you
can make all kinds of measurements I'll
come back to the details of what these
measurements are but there are number of
different measurement options that we've
shown and one of them involves just
measuring electrical activity associated
with muscle contractions either the
heart or the skeletal muscles or muscles
that are controlling your your eyes or
your throat I'll show you
speech I'll show you examples of all of
those this is the heart so you can
measure EKGs with high fidelity and the
detailed waveform there is saying
something about health status to put on
the chest if you put it on the leg you
can measure a mg that's electrical
activity associative contraction of the
skeletal muscle so you can measure
things related to gait for example so
the subject is walking and then standing
this is that epidermal electronics here
here's the conventional paste on an
electrode with conductive gel just to do
a comparison so we're not claiming that
the fidelity of the measurement itself
is higher it's comparable but it's
different because you don't have you
know a piece of tape you have something
matched
the skin and you don't have just an
electrode you have full electronics so
it's really a lot different but the
fidelity is about the same not in this
particular electrode yeah you can do
that and we have done that but not not
in this particular example yeah I'll
come back to that in second very good
question if you put them on the forehead
you can measure EEG and you can see all
the standard things you do Stroup tests
and you can look at alpha rhythms and so
if you put on the head you might think
about a brain machine interface but
these devices because they can go on
unusual parts of the body you don't have
to think just about brain machine but
just more generically human machine and
we found that if you put these devices
on the throat area then you can pick up
complex patterns in EMG associate as
much muscle contractions involved in
speech so if you look at the spectrogram
of data that you collect when you know
the subjects is saying different words
either vocally or sub vocally you can
see different patterns and we work with
folks in electrical engineering to do
pattern recognition so you can train the
system on a finite vocabulary of words
and then use that as a brain machine
interface maybe you know for someone who
suffers a disease of the trachea or you
know as a prosthetic control mechanism
my students wanted to develop like a
game interface so this was a very simple
example this is a couple years back but
you could just move a cursor up down
left or right this is I've never played
this as some kind of strategy game but
just with your neck so if you want to
play a video game with your neck we have
the technology that so may be
interesting maybe not not that
compelling but anyway it's a demo we got
a little bit better over the last year
and a half or so so that things can
happen faster in terms of the interface
so it doesn't have to be just strategy a
game can be more of a
action game and there are companies out
there now trying to do things like this
the hardware is totally different but
let me just show you that you can do
this by Ian Ian G control so this is a
helicopter drone actually if you just
turn out the lights momentarily then
this movie shows up a little bit better
and then we go back to lights on so this
is a post-hoc over here so it's by
manual control he has these epidermal
electronic patches on both forearms and
then there's a computer system that
takes that data and then translates it
into a set of commands for the
helicopter and you can see that go here
so the helicopter he'll rotate his fists
and the drone takes off and then he's
tilting his fists this way it rotates in
that direction he'll stop that it will
cease rotating then he clenches his
fists and it will fly off in that
direction release rotate the other
direction it will land then he'll rotate
again it will take off and he'll tilt
back the other direction and it will
rotate counterclockwise in this case
stop then
clench his fists and he's trying to fly
the helicopter back to get it to land in
that box
and he'll cause it to land and you can
see he missed so he's a little bit more
practice but you get to get the idea
it's just just a demo academic level
demo but you know we think that these
devices could be useful in a more
commercial setting and for that reason
two three years ago we put in place the
startup company in the Cambridge area
and they're trying to push these kinds
of ideas out more into the real world
and they're interested as one
application area sports wellness
monitoring and as an example of a
sporting event to the extent you think
about NASCAR as a sporting event you
know we put put devices on this guy's
really interesting guy undergrad at Duke
so he's a really young driver on the
circuit but he's interested in advanced
technologies so we put these things on
and you know he races race another two
or three times now
and it's a great proving ground for the
technology because it's incredibly hot
in these cars a lot of sweating and it's
an endurance type of thing so so that's
been a great interaction we also have as
head of the sports segment at MC ten
former NFL guy Isiah Kaczynski he's the
highest draft pick ever out of Harvard
he played for Seattle Seahawks actually
for eight years played in the Super Bowl
in 2006 and he's assembled a sports
advisory board so usually in a small
company have a technical advisory board
we have that and then we have this other
really cool thing sports advisory board
you got all these famous guys who are
part of that and providing input on like
what kind of function you would want
it's not just you lending their name but
actually you know really intellectual
input to what MC Tim is trying to do
which is which is pretty cool so MC ten
makes these kind of patches now here
here and they launched their first
product in July July third was the
launch date it's a joint offering with
Reebok and it's a piece of flexible
electronics that goes in sort of the
brim region of a soft good a skullcap
the measures in a very precise way three
axis accelerometer II and rotations so
it can quantify the detailed physics
associated with an impact to the head
and then it uses you know advanced
algorithms to take that data and then
bend it into three categories moderate
hit severe hit and then a hit that could
represent a concussive you know impact
to the head and the idea is to provide
you know additional information to folks
on the field to determine a path of
action after a hit to the head and Matt
Hasselbeck he used to be a quarterback
starting quarterback for the Seahawks
then the Titans now he's a backup for
the in the Indianapolis Colts has been a
real evangelist so this was kind of
publicly announced at CES in January
that's Matt with device on and then
there's our device right there so that
was pretty cool you got it on
throwing arm of a starting NFL
quarterback was kind of kind of a nice
milestone but this is a check light you
can go you can order them up if you want
one you can go to Reebok website and you
can buy these so order early order often
it's a great piece of technology this is
what it looks like it's about 130 bucks
and it keeps a running tab on the total
number of hits in these three categories
to the head during the course of the
season so it does overall dosimetry I
guess so to speak in terms of impacts
and this is the indicator system and the
back back piece of this so that's one
example you have a lot of other things
going on at MC 10 you know our focus at
you know my own University group is not
I mean we're interested in sports but
you know back to sort of health care and
you know the wires and the straps and
the tapes and so on or problem for
adults it's a real severe issue for
premature babies that require a lot of
monitoring so this is just Photoshop
we've not put a device on a baby yet but
just you know that's this is our vision
of you know way that this stuff could be
useful and you know to do this you need
wireless you need a radio you need
onboard power or strategy to that and
you need sophisticated sensors as well
let me talk about sensors a little bit
then I'll talk about interface and
radios why our wireless approaches so we
were doing this work we were approached
by an expert in skin surface temperature
measurement at NIH and when we were
approached I was thinking at the time
temperature is not that interesting but
it turns out it is if you have an
ability to spatially map temperature and
measure it at millikelvin precision so
instead of saying your temperature is
98.6 you can evaluate temperature to
98.6 53 and what's happening in that
last digit tells you a lot about health
and wellness and what's going on with
the body but you have to be able to do
that kind of precision and also have
some spatial mapping capability because
the surface temperature at that level on
the skin extremely heterogeneous
now here's an example of how they do it
now so these are quarter-million-dollar
very sensitive IR cameras that are
imaging temperature profiles in space
and time and this is a close-up image of
a thumb and what you see are these
little dots so these each one of these
dots is a black region that's a little
bit cooler than the rest of the rest of
the thumb and if you play this this is
it real time you can see that though
that pattern of dots is constantly
changing the pattern and there's a time
scale someone's like a periodic type of
thing each one of those black dots
corresponds to an individual sweat gland
and it fires a little bit of sweat comes
out it evaporates it cools locally and
so that that was seem pretty cool to me
like if you could do that without the
expensive hardware or the camera without
all the motion artifacts so getting the
thumb to stay still enough to do this is
a challenge then that might be
interesting the thumb you know that's
kind of a curiosity but if you look at a
full body temperature maps during
exercise you see at least for me things
are really remarkable so this is an IR
image of an individual on a treadmill
and then the images are manipulated to
keep these four points fixed and this is
time so this is average body temperature
varying as this person is jogging and
then kind of running and then resting
and so if you look at this variation and
say okay that's kind of interesting it's
not you know jumping out at you is
something that's high in information
content but if you look at the spatial
patterns and again with with high
precision and spatial resolution then
you see some really funny things so he's
what he's walking he'll start to jog
very slowly at this point he begins to
sweat and you'll see the overall surface
temperature of the skin decreased
because of that sweating and so you'll
see the body starts to go dark you begin
to see that and then as it gets darker
and darker
you begin to see an amazing level of
texture that begins to build up on the
body and these lightning bolts here
that happens to be associated with
vasculature blood vessels that are
transporting blood from the deep muscle
regions up to the skin and there's a
thermal transport associated with that
though those are hot regions
that's not sort of dripping sweat that's
really telling you about blood flow and
in turn cardiovascular cardiovascular
stress and and health associated with
exercise so that seemed interesting so
can you do that kind of thing with this
epidermal patch technology and it turns
out that you can let me give you a
couple examples here's one of these
devices so now in this case not only
mass loading but thermal loading becomes
in a very important consideration and
that was not on our list of metrics when
we started this project but if you want
to put a sensor on the skin it can't
load the natural processes of water loss
and sweat and it can't you know heat as
a result so that becomes an important
aspect and spend a lot of time on that
but you can use the high-end cameras at
NIH you can measure this way and then
you can measure that way and you can
look at the precision and the accuracy
in this kind of sensor and it turns out
that without a huge amount of difficulty
you can do this so here's a here's
temperature as a function of time
measure with the IR camera and one of
these epidermal sensors just offset for
clarity so what you see is that when the
patient is just at rest there's some
periodic variations this is associated
with natural vasoconstriction
vasodilation of blood vessels in the
near surface region of the skin there's
characteristic amplitude and frequency
associated with that which itself is
interesting but the purpose of this
graph has to show you what happens and
the kind of subtle things you can pick
up so here at this time the patient was
told to do a series of operations in
mental math so division and subtraction
and what you see is you can pick that up
the effects of that because now your
skin is sweating a little bit you know
and so you can see that cooling so you
can say something about cognitive state
the other thing that you can do is you
can really pick up subtle effects of
physical activity so here we are again
sensor IR camera rest now physical
stimulus now rest so in principle you
see the same kind of trend I show you
with the tread
Mill temperature goes down then it
stabilizes but this physical stimulus is
very subtle so you have one device
measuring on the left palm and the
physical stimulus corresponds to rubbing
two fingers together on the right hand
so just to give you a sense of the
precision and the kind of coupled
response of the body is sort of
interesting to me so I'm running out of
time here so let me just skip through
and get get to the last few slides so
there's a question about interphase IO
so what we've done is things in two
parallel tracks one is let's use a soft
cable like this hardwired connection
just so we can understand how these
sensors are behaving you do the thermal
mapping we do eg we can do other things
and we can also look at device lifetime
so here's EMG we're measuring on the
forearm right after the device is
mounted and then a week later where you
know the subject is doing showers and
all the normal stuff you come back and
it's pretty good maybe a little bit of
increase of noise and not too bad so
here this is a releasable cable we
laminate it on make the measurement we
peel it back then off they go that is
not the vision though of how this
technology could best be used you'd like
to do wireless interfaces one way to do
that is a simple passive wireless
coupling mutual inductive coupling
between an external coil and a stretchy
epidermal coil this coupled electrically
to the skin this is one way to do it you
can measure thermal conductivity of the
skin you can measure hydration state
impedance of the skin you can do
different things in that way and that's
fine for certain applications it's not
completely generic however and so I'll
show you at this point some things is
still unpublished but it's the result of
integration of a full active radio on
the on the patch and so I won't get in
the details but this is full wireless
radio transmission and EEG the green
traces are traces measured with the
epidermal patch the blue blue with a
standard wired based system and you see
a good correlation there is ECG
sitting state again very nice
correlation between epidermal and
standard wired approaches this is EMG
same thing waveforms look a little bit
different here but again this is ongoing
work so we're trying to tease out you
know the details here this is measuring
a og so you can put these things near
your eye and you can track emotions
because there's muscle activity
associated with that so this is moving
the eyes up and down you can see
conventional EEG and then this is
horizontal back and forth motions of the
eye and we've shown and this is not
great I can even put a movie in here but
you can do game control with that that
kind of thing I'm i motion tracked using
an electrical measurement and a wireless
link and we did did pac-man but I did
just have a still image here so that's
kind of all I wanted to say I would say
you know what we're trying to do is
still early days there's still lots of
opportunities for as I was saying before
new ideas or advanced technology
development but I feel like we have some
ideas in place and some functionality
that's you know headed in the right
direction I guess I'd say you know it
involves a lot of collaborators jung
dong-hwan does all the mechanics Theory
Placid prayer does the manufacturing
systems Todd Coleman we've worked a lot
on eg these two guys on brain machine
interfaces at Beckman but ultimately the
students do all the work they come up
with a lot of the best ideas and so it's
best to kind of in the talk by
acknowledging them and thanking you for
your attention I'd be happy to answer
questions those are great questions so
the answer is yes to everything so you
do inductive you can do far field RF
power transfer we've done both of those
this is an example of inductive powering
of LEDs these are for implantable
devices you can get them subdermal and
you can light them up in that way I
don't have our far field
RF transmission data but you can do that
as well there's a fair amount of RF
comes out of your phone and so you can
harvest even if a small fraction of that
you can begin to do things depending on
the power requirements so yeah so for so
for our radios so we have
multifunctional system that does EMG
temperature and XLR accelerometry with a
voltage controlled oscillator for the
radio frequency communication about two
milliwatts this low duty cycle but
that's not very sophisticated I need to
blow Power Bluetooth sub-threshold logic
there's a lot of opportunities for
driving down the power requirements but
if it's a couple of milliwatts you know
you got a watt coming out of your phone
you're you're pretty close to something
that's reasonable I think in the case of
a confined environment like a hospital
or a research lab you can always put an
RF source Apache antenna in one corner
of the room and do it that way and in
fact we haven't done that in a
continuous mode on humans but we have
done it for LEDs injected into animals
for optogenetics studies at Washington
University so that's full full wireless
power and controlling you know when the
LED is coming on and off so inductive
far-field RF are two options you know in
some of these passive systems you don't
need power directly on the device the
other you know would be storage right a
battery and I think batteries are
possible batteries I just be cautious I
think batteries are challenging so we're
working on it I think you can do it the
there's some practical aspects around
how do you achieve robust encapsulation
when you're in a rubber soft rubber
situation and I would say that that's a
challenge maybe for the community it's
not one that we've solved we're still
thinking about it but we can do
batteries that are soft and stretchy and
this is an example of one so this is a
rechargeable lithium-ion battery not a
huge capacity but you can run run an LED
and the way that make it stretchable is
basically just take conventional lithium
ion a note and cathode materials and
create very small cells
and then connect them with the
deformable wires and then package it
soft elastomer top and bottom and an
electrolyte gel in between and so you
can do that so this offers extreme wide
range of stretch ability maybe up to 400
percent biaxial as you'll see here and
it's um you know the LED stays on during
this deformation so so not out of the
question
I personally prefer a far field RF
because then you just need an antenna
it's very simple its constraining a
little bit but it again I keep thinking
about the smartphone and you you might
be able to use its battery essentially
right and ultimately the phone is going
to be a part of any kind of you know
monitoring system anyway so so yeah
pallet power is a good question you we
also do mechanical energy harvesting so
you can do piezo electric materials
we've done things a lot of things on the
heart hearts moving you can generate
enough to power a pacemaker but for
things that are on the skin you have to
think about where you're gonna put it to
get enough continuous power to MIT to
make sense and it's not clear to me how
that would work but we're still you know
we're tinkering around the time yeah is
it if you're willing to sacrifice drinks
for a few millimeters you're there okay
yeah the traditional silicon interest
like batteries or whatever absolutely
you can think about it really depends on
the application requirements so what I
didn't show you is we have ways today to
take unpackage bairdi and get it into a
format it's not full epidermal like the
full academic thing that we kind of
strive for but a lot of cases it's good
enough you know you talk to our sports
advisory board folks and we hand them
the thing that's made with the with the
bairdi type type approaches they look at
it and think fantastic you know doesn't
need to be innocent
there F is you sort of you want that
part to not been this rolling yeah yeah
all about mechanical engineering things
like that yeah there are few different
maybe offline this this has been
recorded for something we haven't
published that yeah so they're there to
three different others you can imagine
what they would be considered subsurface
blood flow yeah absolutely so I kind of
ran out of time there so we're doing a
lot around core body I know you guys are
too you can do blood flow and that's
interesting because the precision you
can pick up temperature changes you can
see affects of flow on thermal diffusion
so if you put one of these devices on
the arm you constrict the bicep to
prevent flow through an Omer artery down
down the arm and then you release that
you can see a thermal effect essentially
a pulse type response associated with
flow and again you have to be able to do
mapping because you don't know it's hard
to locate that artery it's deep in the
tissue but here's one of these devices
this is you know while the artery is
constricted and then you release it
that's the artery right there and you
can pick it up so some of these channels
have very little response they're not
overlapped spatially coincident with the
artery but some have very strong
response like that and this is the IR
camera so again almost perfect match
with that quarter-million dollar piece
of equipment and did details of how far
it overshoots here what the timescale of
this is can be you know related to the
flow properties and that is an important
indicator of cardiovascular health so
you can do this what we're finding
though is that you can also do something
that doesn't even require the
constriction like if you put the patches
on the arm the thing that you can do
with these patches that you cannot do
with an IR cameras you can operate the
temperature sensors as heaters so you
can light them up here we've heated up
these
or in an array of sixteen and blood flow
will cause a nice entre P in the
resulting thermal distribution so if
there's an artery running down in this
direction then heat will tend to spread
more this way than that way or that way
and you can you can map blood flow that
in that manner what this this slide
doesn't show that but this slide is
showing that you can determine thermal
conductivity of the skin so you can
pulse the heat here and depending on how
efficient a heat sink you're sitting on
that determines the ultimate temperature
of those heaters and with a simple model
you can back out thermal conductivity
now why is thermal conductivity
interesting is it because it
quantitatively correlates to hydration
of the skin and so we use a conventional
moisture meter as a handheld thing that
makes the measurement electrically but
we see a very good correlation there so
so you can do temperature and hydration
and blood flow with this yeah yeah right
could be molten from fish weren't you
yeah right so we can do impedance
measurements of the skin look at
galvanic response things like that yeah
yeah so I didn't put slides we've done a
lot of work on the heart in the brain
yeah and and I didn't put it in because
it seemed like it was kind of outside of
Microsoft realm of interest it's sort of
hard core clinical medicine is the
context there yeah yeah
presentation information supposed to
give the little LEP example yeah
LEDs not great because their power hogs
you know and you're trying to you know
minimize power so you know elect we
thought about electro phoretic you know
display elements because they're by
stable you have to think about you know
the mechanics there we have done some
work on thermochromic material so you
know I think Coors beer has like a
thermochromic thing so that that kind of
material and it turns out you can embed
those dyes into rubber so you can make a
fully stretchable little simple
indicator and it's being switched by
heat and so if you run the numbers it's
reasonably it's more power efficient
than an LED it's not by stable like
electro phoretic inks so we made a
little stretchable in the indicator
using leuco dyes these heat sensitive
dyes but there may be some other other
concepts that's kind of what we're
thinking about the reebok device is just
leds but i think there there's often
times the value in having you know the
indicator right right on the patch so i
think you're asking a great great
question and we've we've thought about
it
I didn't send you a copy of the movie I
should really highlight this is Alex
ghormach shoes our collaborator with NIH
he's a world's authority on skin
temperature you know and them and he's a
great collaborator so this is this may
be this is not something that we
collected in terms of cost no I mean it
depends on the devices like those those
passive devices I have one of these
little hydration monitors here this is
uh this is one that uses inductive
coupling for the readout min is just
metal traces this could be pennies right
some of the things that involve you know
radios obviously be more expensive but
you know I think back to our initial
motivation we're trying to do things
that are aligned with conventional
electronics and then just do a few
things on the back end so terms of you
know rubbers and stuff and mechanics so
our thought is that it might be
incrementally more expensive but it's
not going to be qualitatively different
in cost structure but qualitatively
different in mechanics and user you know
interface
Thanks
