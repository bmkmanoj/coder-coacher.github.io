you
morning I'm Meredith Pringle Morris from
Microsoft Research and I'm giving you a
short talk about the accessibility of
crowd work to people with disabilities
and I particularly want to acknowledge
my co-author Kate Zukowski who was an
internet microsoft last year so digital
labor is becoming an increasingly
important form of labor in the modern
era and micro tasking of which Amazon
Mechanical Turk is probably the most
familiar example is becoming an
increasingly important category of
digital labor however this is still a
very unregulated category of labor so of
course there has been a lot of talk
about the lack of benefits or fair wages
on these platforms and it's also the
case that currently these platforms
don't need to comply with various labor
laws for example the Americans with
Disabilities Act which among other
things requires that employers provide
reasonable accommodations to make sure
that people with varying disabilities
have fair access to employment and if
one of the goals of us in thinking about
these platforms is to think about how
digital labor can evolve to be a fair
and just form and meaningful form of
employment it's important to think about
whether that form of employment is
accessible for participation by
everybody their vent several studies
looking at the demographics of who
currently participates as workers in
various micro tasking platforms such as
mechanical turk and these have found
things that for example there are many
more female workers than male workers
they tend to be less on the less
educated end of the spectrum there's
increasing participation from places
such as India but none of these
demography is have looked into whether
the participants on these platforms are
disabled in any fashion and so we set
out to understand whether people with
disabilities have access to this form of
digital labour whether they're
interested in participating in this form
of digital labour
and whether those who have been trying
to participate are able to do so
successfully or if not how should
platforms be redesigned to better
support inclusion so we worked we
conducted a series of both interviews
and surveys with people with a Americans
with a wide variety of sensory physical
and cognitive disabilities and I just
wanted to highlight a couple of our
findings so one thing that surprised me
was that i found that thinking about
accessibility in reference to micro
tasking was much more nuanced than i
first thought so when I think about the
accessibility of software the first
thing that usually comes to mind is what
I'll call here level one accessibility
so the basic accessibility of the user
interface and of course this was a
problem that many of our interviewees
and survey respondents discussed so for
example someone who was blind tried to
register for an account on Mechanical
Turk and it required completing a
CAPTCHA to prove that they were into
bought but of course CAPTCHAs can be
very difficult to complete audio
CAPTCHAs that they have for blind people
are actually much harder to complete
than visual CAPTCHAs and so it was hard
for them just to make an account on the
system there's also the the sort of
basic accessibility problem that the
platform isn't the only place where
people interact so even if the platform
itself is accessible Mechanical Turk is
always redirecting you two different
third party sites that the individual
requesters create and those third party
sites have a very wide variety of
interface is a very wide variety of
compliance with different regulations
and suggestions for being accessible and
so this is a very challenging level of
accessibility for many workers but then
from talking to people it became clear
that there's a second deeper level of
accessibility problem and that's around
the fundamental way that work flows in
micro tasking are structured so for
example it's very difficult for workers
to identify what tasks that they should
choose to get started working because
the metadata for different tasks doesn't
necessarily specify what kinds of
abilities might be required for example
you might select a survey task and
perhaps you have a vision impairment and
most of the questions
our textual but and so they work through
a screen reader but then you get to a
question that requires looking at
imagery and suddenly you have to abandon
the task partway through even though
you've already invested time in it then
there's the problem that you have to do
again using a lot of third-party sites
and switching back and forth between
different applications which can be very
complicated and timing is fundamentally
built into the workflow of many of these
platforms partly to try to weed out bad
workers who are spamming the system by
accepting tasks and never finishing them
but many people with different
disabilities require perhaps slightly
more time to complete a task not because
they're scammer but perhaps you're
dyslexic and it's slower for you to read
things and there's no flexibility
typically to those time limits built
into the workflows of micro tasking and
finally there was a third level of
accessibility challenge which was more
fundamentally about the accessibility of
new types of job experiences for example
just learning about the existence of
this type of work which was for the
people we interviewed who were disabled
who participated in micro tasking it was
actually highly valued to them as a type
of work because of the flexible hours
they were able to work from home they
didn't necessarily have to reveal their
disability status to anyone if they
didn't choose to do so and yet it was
very difficult for them to learn about
crowd work so right now people who know
about things like TaskRabbit are often
in the technorati or in kind of a hip in
circle and so how do we disseminate that
information also the accessibility of
the job experience in terms of being
promoted and not just doing the basic
more menial tasks but so as our speaker
mentioned you have to earn reputation
within the system to get rise up the
ladder and get access to the more
interesting and high-quality jobs but
because of the the problems with the
workflow many of these participants
weren't able to earn reputation or earn
it as quickly for example if they had to
abandon tasks because of the time limits
or they weren't well described they
would often their reputation points on
the system would suffer even though they
weren't necessarily scammers there was
no good way for them to a Jew she ate
the process of
of managing their reputation to advance
through the system so I don't have time
to talk right now about this but during
lunch I'd be happy to talk with anyone
who's interested about what does this
mean for platform operators for job
requesters how should we restructure
platforms to be more inclusive of people
with disabilities thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
