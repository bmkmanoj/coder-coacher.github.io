hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
thank you so much for coming my name is
Amy graves
and I'm pleased to welcome Amy Wilkinson
to the Microsoft Research visiting
speaker series Amy will be discussing
her book the creators code in which she
reveals six fundamental skills that
highly successful entrepreneurs use and
we all can learn these can be used for
both launching new companies and for
launching successful initiatives in your
current role Amy is a strategic adviser
and lecturer at the Stanford Graduate
School of Business and her career has
included leadership roles at McKinsey JP
Morgan and her own startup she has
served as a White House Fellow in the
office of the US Trade Representative
and a senior fellow at the Harvard
Kennedy School please join me in giving
her a very warm welcome so thank you for
the introduction and I'm absolutely
thrilled to be at Microsoft it feels a
little bit like a homecoming to me
because I grew up in Tacoma Washington
and I just flew in this morning from New
York and I was just so excited to
actually see the mountain range and to
come into the city and I grew up here
when it felt like Microsoft was growing
up and now it's just exciting to be back
here because it's such a big and
interesting and world-changing place
where you guys work so I'm truly truly
thrilled to be here and I will start
with a tiny it's a one and a half minute
video clip so I've done five years of
research most recently at Harvard and
interviewed 200 of the top entrepreneurs
in the United States for a book that
came out last week and it's exactly one
week into the market called the creators
code and that's what we'll talk about
and I'm also first-time writer and very
very excited because it's the number one
on Amazon in the business category right
now so as I came into Seattle I was like
hurray Amazon and Microsoft they're like
it's an exciting place up here so I'll
give you guys a minute and a half clip
and and then I'll tell you the six
skills but the this will hopefully be
interesting because it shows some of the
people in the book when you feel you're
changing people's lives you're saving
people's lives I think that's just
incredibly highly motivating I made the
same shirt for five years over and over
and over again making it right
entrepreneurs are an interesting beast
you've got to get used to this idea the
people are gonna say no to you that
you're gonna do something that it might
not work
you don't worry about Killian how are
you alive actually yeah absolutely and I
feel feel quite strongly
it's really about creating something
special and getting people excited and
making a difference remember like the
white lights going on thinking while
this is what I should be doing there was
something something that lived inside if
there was a spirit that we couldn't
shake right there was all this logic
that was around us telling us to stop
but there's something inside us that we
couldn't ignore he gave me this great
piece of ice because I had spent so many
hours fiddling with this and he said
Robin start and then once you start is
it you can change it so we started that
is the you know the number one message
and I want people when they see or hear
the underarmor story I want them to look
at it and go getting that that football
player from Maryland could do this oh
geez I mean I must be able to do this to
like good and go do it
so that's the research set some of those
founders will talk about I'm not exactly
sure what this is okay good so it's five
years of research 200 interviews that
the criteria set for figuring out who
some of the leading entrepreneurs were
in the United States right now is you
had to found a company and scale it over
a hundred million in revenue with five
years of history and not more than ten
years of a ramp so these are younger
entrepreneurs than the Microsoft story
and they are currently number of them
leading in their industries it's also
across industries so the JetBlue founder
was here the Airbnb founder Under Armor
a lot of the Silicon Valley tech
companies but I was very specific to
look across and then identify what came
back as six skills that anyone can use
so the other big part about this as we
go through it is the creators code the
word creator is very intentionally used
you don't have to be an entrepreneur you
don't have to be a founder of a company
you can create an idea here inside of a
very very large company like the idea is
the six skills very much so apply inside
of a place like Microsoft or also in the
nonprofit world so we can take these
ideas and create and scale concepts not
just by being the founder of a business
over a hundred million in revenue but
that's the data set for trying to figure
out who we would like to emulate and who
has actually figured this out in the
last ten years five to ten years in a
pretty substantial way and I'll say a
little bit about how I got into doing
this so I had the great privilege of
working in the White House I was a White
House Fellow and I did four years of
international trade in economics and so
while I was doing that at one point I
was invited to a birthday party in fact
in New York City I went into New York
and it was in this sort of dark basement
place kind of strange birthday party and
I looked around and the founders of
Google were there and eBay and Gilt
Groupe and
a number of startups that were so
fascinating and they were changing the
world like in lightning speed and I was
in the White House there these people
were just doing things no red tape no
big bureaucracy they were truly standing
up concepts that were changing the way
that we were living and I'm trained as a
sociologist I have a master's in
sociology
I am also trained as an MBA so I'm
fascinated by people and especially the
people behind business and so I thought
to myself if I could just study what
these really fabulous entrepreneurial
creators were doing and then distill it
that other people would also be able to
go and do that too and so that was the
genesis of the project I thought it
would be a quick sabbatical I came out
of the White House and I thought I would
do that you know really in about 12 to
18 months it's taken five years and a
huge amount of research not only in the
marketplace as first interviews but also
I've looked across academic disciplines
so cognitive psychology or behavioral
economics or creativity research as a
field the entrepreneurial research is a
pretty young field so that's the basis
behind what is now the creators code so
this is the story and you saw this is
the story of Kevin Plank you saw him in
the short clip but he is the football
player right here
he's a walk-on to the University of
Maryland he's five-ten when he walks on
and 260 pounds he's not a great athlete
he's not a great football player he's in
Division one he basically was the
slowest player he's known as Maryland's
sweatiest player and he at one point in
time weighed his cotton t-shirt that was
under his uniform and it weighed three
pounds and he basically said I can't
afford three extra pounds because you
know I'm not all that great to begin
with and so he went to a local fabric
store in College Park Maryland and found
out that synthetic fabrics would wick
away moisture then he took this stretchy
bolt of material and he took it to a
tailor
four hundred and fifty dollars and seven
prototypes later he basically came up
with what is Under Armour and it's a two
billion dollar global brand now so he
outfits big big football players like
this and across multiple sports but the
little known secret about Under Armour
is that big tough football players like
the same fabric as is found here so
Under Armour is using the same fabric as
Victoria Secret and that's what Kevin
didn't tell all these football players
when he first started was that he had
figured out the fabric and he'd gone to
the tailors and he was in the garment
district in New York and he found a mill
in Ohio I mean he was just driving this
old Jeep Grand Cherokee everywhere
trying to figure out how we would solve
his sweaty problem and it's an unusual
solution but it's one of the things that
I found over and over in my research is
people would look in places that other
people wouldn't look and that they would
basically take solutions that other
people might not have thought of so the
power of six this out of all of the
research basically it's a grounded
Theory method it's a very nerdy
sociology methodology but what it comes
up with is six essential skills and they
work in concert so we'll talk about each
one of them but the kind of big takeaway
here is that we might naturally be
really good at two or three of these
skills but people who are creating and
scaling ideas they're really doing all
six so it's when these are combined that
the magic happens is when we learn and
practice and hone all of them that that
we can really scale our ideas so the
first is what I'm calling find the gap
and it is very much being a detective
it's how do you see a gap or how do you
spot something that other people don't
see the research informs three ways that
these creators are doing that one is as
Howard Schultz oh there's another great
Starbucks company hurray for Seattle
just so amazing so this he didn't
actually invent the
rafi concept right he saw it in Italy so
he any bread at home and that is what
I'm calling a Sunbird way of discovery
and there's quite a lot of research
around reasoning by analogy so can you
see something in one place and then can
you pick it up and fly it over and apply
it in another place and so the Sunbird
is actually the Australian word for a
hummingbird so if you think of like
being a hummingbird what Schultz did was
he thought coffee culture in Italy and
then at the time here in Seattle I mean
people were having coffee maybe at home
or in diners but there weren't really
coffee houses that people were going to
and he brought it back but first it
didn't work as well as it does today
he had bowtie clad waiters he was having
opera music in the background it was a
stand up bar it looked very Italian like
he had actually seen and loved and so
one of these concepts is that you see
something but you transport it with a
twist and so you apply it in a place
with some kind of a little modification
to it and Starbucks obviously is done
very very well another way of seeing is
what I'm calling an architect this is
Elon Musk and he's extraordinary he's
trained as a physicist and I think he's
very much Albert Einstein as the
physicist meet Steve Jobs he loves
design and so he's the co-founder as a
founder of SpaceX co-founder of Tesla
Motors he's the co CEO of both companies
right now at this time and SpaceX as an
architect what architects do is look for
just as an architect would an open space
right a green field and then they build
concepts from the ground up so trained
as a physicist Elon is a great example
of reasoning by first principles so
he'll talk about going right back to the
very fundamental ideas and then building
them a completely different way and the
SpaceX company is now resupplying the
International Space Station at 1/10 the
price that NASA did and he's building a
reusable rocket so I don't know if
you've all seen in the headlines the
last couple weeks but it's an
extraordinary way of reasoning
that that we weren't doing before I mean
no government was thinking that we would
build a reusable rocket we would you
know have it launched and then have it
land on a sheet of flame or in the ocean
now they're building platforms right to
try to have these things land but Elon
thinks about it and he basically says no
we'll just that's how Rockets should
work I mean to have them on a transcript
saying that's how it should work nobody
has just thought about it working like
that yet and if if you think that every
time we would fly between Seattle and
London or New York we would throw away
the jet it would be pretty expensive to
be flying around that's basically what
we do with space travel and we are
throwing away rockets we're not
recycling or reusing them so it's a way
of seeing the world and to think that
you have to build a rocket it's not
right so this bank's founder is also an
architect this is a very everyday
problem that she sees she cuts the feet
out of her nylons and she's the youngest
self-made female billionaire in 2012 who
here knows what Spanx is okay so we have
a few men so what men in the room need
to know is that Manx is coming do you
guys know what banks is it's like the
compression shirt for the stomach
so basically Sara Blakely is also what
I'm considering to be an architect
because she sees an unaddressed need
which her story is it's extraordinary
she was in Atlanta she was a
door-to-door fax machine sales woman for
seven years and so she was trying to
wear nylons under her white pants to
look more professional as she was going
door-to-door to sell these fax machines
and then when she cut the feet out of
them because she wanted to her open-toed
shoes she went to a local retailer and
said you know is there some kind of
undergarment that I can wear that will
make my white pants look better and she
kept getting no no that this doesn't
seem to exist so she went and built it
and she because she was a door-to-door
sales lady she also went door-to-door
and all the manufacturing mills in the
southeast until she finally got someone
to make a prototype for this product so
that's another way to think about being
an architect and then the third way of
seeing is as an integrate
and this is steve ells at Chipotle he's
a classically trained chef and at the
New York Culinary Academy but he was
working in San Francisco at stars
restaurant and loving burritos he just
loves burritos hanging out the Mission
District and starting to think about
ways that you could make fast food not
just hamburgers that would be frozen and
reheated but they could actually be
something that you would cook in front
of you and this became cooking for the
line is what Chipotle's model is and so
you actually see people cooking
ingredients it's fresher ingredients but
he comes up with fast casual so it's an
integration of two different concepts
and if you think about it like you know
the luxury SUV that we used to have
luxury vehicles or all-terrain vehicles
you put that together you have a whole
new category or shabby-chic in the
design world you know you have something
that looks informal but it's a nice
design so it's another way of trying to
see things by looking at what you could
put together how you would go to an
intersection of ideas and create
something new skill two is what I'm
calling drive for daylight and I
actually enrolled in NASCAR driving
school for two weeks the analogy is that
racecar drivers that are managing speed
always look for the light on the horizon
so they're not looking at the lines on
the pavement and they're not looking at
the competitors right next to them
because they're moving too fast and so
this is what entrepreneurial creators
are also doing and this is Elizabeth
Holmes has anyone heard of their notes
and Elizabeth Holmes okay kid a few
hands I truly think that she is the next
Steve Jobs and she wears a black
turtleneck every day I mean I think
she's also trying to portray this image
in that she's going to revolutionize the
health care industry and she is spent 10
years driving for daylight or looking to
go thinking I mean looking only ahead
she dropped out of Stanford University
as an undergraduate at age 19 she's just
turned 30 she's been in stealth mode in
Palo Alto for ten years what she's doing
here
is holding a little tiny nano tainer
it's got a couple drops of blood in it
with two or three drops of blood she can
turn around two or three hundred tests
in a couple hours and wirelessly deliver
results and she's just now signed a very
large contract with Walgreens so this
will roll across our Walgreens
pharmaceutical outlets to being really a
very widespread technology and her idea
is if you have a few pinpricks of blood
and you look at data analytics from your
bloodstream that you could detect
disease so we would detect and
eventually prevent disease instead of
waiting to see that we have a tumor and
knowing we have cancer we might be able
to see through smaller tests done more
frequently that we would be on that
progression we could stop it or instead
of knowing that we might have heart
disease by the time we have a heart
attack we would also be able to prevent
that if we had these little pin pricks
of blood taken very easily and locally
but in order to build this she's been
thinking about it and working and
building a team for 10 years and she
operates from the former Facebook
headquarters in Palo Alto so it's it
should be coming on the screen I think
pretty pretty quickly or she was the
cover of Fortune magazine about a month
ago the to go thinking point is one that
I find really interesting there's
research out of the University of
Chicago that shows that when you're
committed to a goal of any kind that if
you think about what's left to go that
you're a lot more likely to achieve it
so you throw energy focus your brain the
cognitive capability is actually focused
on getting that done and so the research
has shown if you're running a marathon
and you're you know 20 miles in and you
just think to yourself my feet hurt and
my legs hurt and that's that's you know
thinking about what's not left to go if
you actually just think of the miles
left to go you're a lot more likely to
complete same thing with students as
they get through an academic quarter or
semester if you think oh I've only
completed 40% and I have 60% to go
you're less likely to complete that
course so there's a lot of research that
shows
focusing on what's left will actually
help you accomplish it
another thing with driving for daylight
is scanning the edges so this is the
Airbnb concept and have people here used
Airbnb okay a few not that many wow I'm
surprised so this is very much an idea
that came from the fringe into the
mainstream and
the story is of Joe Gibeah he was in the
short clip and Brian Chesky they were
designers Rhode Island School of Design
designers
living in San Francisco and their rent
went up 25% and they couldn't pay the
rent and so they didn't really know what
they were going to do but there is a big
design conference at that time in San
Francisco coming in that week and they
noticed that the hotels were sold out
and so they put up a little notice
online that said hey we have some air
mattresses and if want to come and stand
our air mattresses we'll charge you a
little something but we have space and
that was the genesis of Airbnb
absolutely no venture capitalists wanted
to fund this it was not an idea that
made any sense like renting out your
couch or your mattress or having a
stranger sleep in your house seemed like
a really really strange idea and they
tried to launch it a couple times they
tried to launch at South by Southwest it
didn't work like three people used it
they tried to launch around the 2008
presidential conventions and the way
they raised capital is actually it's
kind of humorous because they couldn't
get anyone to give them money they'd
maxed out credit cards and they
basically because there were designers
designed cereal boxes that were called
Obama owes hope in every Bowl and
Captain McCain like a maverick and every
bite and then they went and put cereal
in it and they sold that and they raised
$25,000 and that's basically what kept
this company afloat and now it's a 10
billion dollar valuation on a start-up I
mean it's amazing what they've done but
it was a fringe idea so that's one of
the things you have to constantly be
scanning the edges for what might be
coming next the third skill is what I'm
calling fly the OODA loop
and it stands for observe orient decide
and act
are there any former military people in
the room okay have you heard of the u2
loop so it's an Air Force it originally
came from an Air Force pilot named John
Boyd and the legend is that John Boyd
could shoot down any other fighter pilot
in 40 seconds or less and so across the
Air Force it really became known as the
OODA loop this is his secret the way
that you can defeat a competitor in real
time in a fight is to observe orient
decide and act faster and if you can do
that you change the landscape you
actually in a dogfight in a fighter jet
in a cockpit you change what's happening
and the other opponent is reacting to
something that is now outdated so in the
workplace in the business workplace
it's the zach same thing and I think as
every as the landscape accelerates this
becomes more and more important so what
do you observe like what do you do one
thing that fighter pilots or
entrepreneurs are looking for is a
glitch right what doesn't make sense
what do you actually pick up on and
there's academic research here about
tacit awareness like you might think
that something was odd you might see
something out of the corner of your eye
and most of us just rationalize it away
and we don't think about it we just sort
of think okay that was weird that was an
anomaly
people who are are you know creating and
scaling ideas they jump on it they like
go for the glitch
they absolutely observe it they just
they do something about it and one of
the things is you know how do you orient
to it you ask a ton of questions and you
have certain metrics so Peter Thiel who
is the PayPal co-founder and then
Palantir he's the first money behind
Facebook he will say to orient as an
investor at least he'll look for
technologies that are 10 times better in
a very very narrow market like that's
counterintuitive because a lot of people
are trying to go for these huge markets
and they're trying to pitch out like
these ideas that would just change the
world in huge ways but instead what here
teal Orient's 2 is like a very
narrow deep marketplace that will have a
ten times better technology so it's
important to think about how to orient
as well and then the decide and the act
pieces are just fast so this is not the
Hamlet to be or not to be nobody sits
around and wonders what to do they just
make decisions and keep making more and
more decisions and then once you act it
changes the landscape so the faster you
do this the more effectively you combat
any kind of a competitor in the
landscape so this is Peter teal and Elon
Musk this is PayPal early on PayPal was
started it's two companies merging so it
was Peter and Max Levchin that started
and then they merged with XCOM which was
Ellen's company and the reason why
PayPal is a great example here is that
they had that startup for 18 months not
a long period of time they moved it
through six models so they first thought
it was in 1999 they first thought that
they would beam well they would have an
encrypted technology for money they
would have a virtual wallet then they
actually raised funding on beaming money
between Palm Pilots like who here had a
palm okay so some people had a pump palm
is not really round but PayPal is still
around right they observed at one point
that people were using the support site
for trying to email money over and they
weren't actually doing this beam between
devices and that seemed very very
strange to them they thought that seemed
wrong but then they very quickly
oriented to it and jumped on it they
were like okay even though we raised
money for that we're gonna try to do
something with a website and then they
realized that eBay users we're actually
using PayPal and they didn't want that
that was a bat they thought they were
like go away eBay people here messing
with our products and then all of a
sudden they oriented very quickly and
acted on it because they realized that
was a huge market for everybody at that
point in time who was sending a check in
the mail or whatever is like a very slow
process and if you could use PayPal that
would scale PayPal for them
and they then were embedding their logos
inside of eBay there was all this kind
of war going on with eBay and eBay was
slow so this is the competitor that
didn't react as quickly they bought bill
point another technology then they
studied at the market for 12 months and
so while they were studying the market
these guys were like really really
quickly orienting to things and changing
things up they also had chargebacks does
anyone in here work with credit cards or
no what a chargeback is yeah so Max
Levchin who's the technology kind of
wizard and founder on this he saw a
chargeback and he jumped right on it
again like there was no waiting around
to try to wonder what that would be and
a lot of the competitors got buried by
money laundering and fraud and Max built
a technology he's from the Ukraine and
he built a technology that he called I
Gor because the Russians were hacking
into the site and just like pilfering
all the money out of it and so it is
today the squiggly line technology the
are you a human test you know to try to
make sure that you are a person and not
a computer that's trying to hack into
anything so they all as individuals
inside of PayPal we're all flying the a
loop and they were doing it as a team so
then what comes out of it the more
interesting part they sold PayPal when
the tech bubble burst it's when I was at
business school at Stanford as a student
and it was doom and gloom everybody
thought in 2000-2001 to that like
technology and the Silicon Valley was
done and these guys sold their company
at that time and then they went on to
start YouTube and Yelp and LinkedIn
slide Tesla Motors dig they're their
first money into Facebook's 500 startups
I mean the the outcome out of the PayPal
mafia as they're called in Silicon
Valley is extraordinary and when you
talk to them like the Yelp founder
Jeremy Stoppelman when you talk to
Jeremy he'll say well he was a really
young guy at PayPal but what he learned
was when something didn't work to jump
on the counterintuitive blip of data so
like Yelp was started as an
email referral site and embedded in that
they had like would you like to write a
review and Jeremy it was like nobody's
gonna want to write a review that's it
and then he found out a lot of people
liked writing reviews of like the dry
cleaner and the restaurant whatever so
Yelp became a review site or YouTube was
originally a video dating site I mean
like that was what they thought that was
going to be and then they had a video of
one of their founders at the zoo and
this big elephant whatever and if they
were just kind of him hamming it up like
clowning around and then everybody was
watching the elephant video and so they
were like well that's strange but so
they opened it up obviously YouTube has
kind of got all kinds of videos on it so
what they learned and if you know they
all talk about it in slightly different
ways but one of the things they say is
if you had worked in a place that was a
really big place that you only learned
about success and one way of doing it
you wouldn't have struggled as much as
they struggled I mean they really almost
they had all these near-death
experiences at PayPal but what they
learned was that you could continue to
iterate a model you could continue to
observe orient decide and act and then
they could take it with them and the
next things that they did so that's
something that all of us can do and then
the fourth skill is what I'm calling
fail wisely and this is different from
failing fast and failing forward I think
that's the web 2.0 thing I think
actually now from all the people that I
interviewed they want to be imperfect
they will set a certain failure ratio
and they'll say twenty percent of the
time I will get it wrong or ten percent
or thirty percent or you know but the
ingoing assumption is that you will not
have a perfect record here so you don't
want to actually be a four-point student
anymore I think that business used to be
about scaling up existing ideas
replicating and scaling and taking
things out into the world with with a
perfect record and now given the
landscape change and given how how
little we can actually predict now it's
about pushing the envelope and knowing
that you will be wrong some of the time
but not failing catastrophic ly like
nobody wants to fail catastrophically
here right
so marshmallow challenge have you guys
has has anyone seen this okay a few
people so this experiment was started in
2007 and it's been run with thousands of
people actually internationally and
basically what it is is 26 of spaghetti
one yard of tape one yard of string one
marshmallow you have 20 minutes in teams
of four to build the largest
freestanding structure that you can with
the marshmallow on top so this was
started actually out of Nokia and then
it was run all across different
universities and engineers and MBAs and
fortune 500 CEOs and architects and all
kinds of people have been put through
the marshmallow challenge so who do you
think can build the tallest structure
anyone yeah yeah there you go these are
the people who do the best job at it
and they build structures at 25 inches
tall and engineers with master's degrees
build it on average 24 inches so the
five-year-olds actually win they now the
question is why is that right and what I
think is that they are able to fail
wisely so they are the only group that
rolls up their sleeves they are not
fearful they just get right at it they
grab all the materials they start right
in they're the only group that asks more
of any one of the materials so they
asked for more spaghetti and more
marshmallows and they just go for it the
worst performing group here is MBA
student and so the MBA students when you
watch them sit around and plan right
they plan about what they're gonna do
and who's going to lead their team and
all of that and then their time runs out
so it's an example of just getting right
in and trying to have a trial-and-error
experimental approach setting a failure
ratio so these two guys are the founders
of Opower this company went public last
year they're a great example they can
serve energy they are based out of
Virginia they started on the very
premise of an experiment so they've
hey if we want to have people conserve
how would we do that and they put door
knockers on the handle the doors of a
number of homes in California saying
please turn off your air conditioning in
the summer and turn on your fan you
would be a good citizen that would be a
really good thing to do we could
conserve energy and absolutely nobody
did it nobody cared and so then they put
a door knocker on the door that
basically said please turn off your air
conditioning please turn on your fan you
will save the planet you know and
absolutely nobody cared and so then they
did a third experiment and they put
these door knockers on people's doors
and they said you know please turn off
the air-conditioning turn on the fan you
will save fifty five dollars on your
bill they have figured that again nobody
cared no one did anything and so then
they ran a fourth experiment and they
put the door knockers on and they
basically said turn off your air
conditioning turn on your fans
seventy-seven percent of your neighbors
are doing that and that worked it's the
pure pressure model of thinking that
like the people in your neighborhood are
conserving and you're somehow like not
keeping up with the Joneses or whatever
and so that's the basis of this entire
model and they have been running the
company they now have done other
experiments this last summer they did a
big one with the city of Baltimore on
peak demands like could you get people
to turn off their dishwasher during peak
demands it could you and they have
conserved enough energy to power the
city of Miami for a year so it's an
amazing model but it is always small
bets it's always these small experiments
and they're gonna get it wrong some of
the time they also built a Facebook app
they thought like oh this is great we
can get all social pressure going online
that did not work and they shut it back
down it actually has to be a report and
you have to think that you might
physically see your neighbors and not be
doing as well in your actual physical
neighborhood but they're an example of
running it now a pretty large company on
this so is the Stella and Dot founder so
this is Jess Herron and she was a
co-founder wedding channel comm now she
is the founder of Stella &amp;amp; Dot it's a
home-based jewelry business it's like
Mary Kay meets eBay right and it's
scaled up to be about a 300 million in
new business and she basically was all
of these products those are her two
little girls she was an undergrad and an
MBA with me you know every single
product that she's putting out with
other women
stylists they sell from home they do a
trunk show kind of model they have loved
it or lose it and so they're always
testing all of these little things and a
certain percentage of her products just
don't ever make it into the market or
they don't you know they don't make very
much success but she's constantly
experimenting and constantly getting it
wrong so if you talk to her it's just as
much about what she will learn and learn
through so the fifth skill is what I'm
calling network minds and the idea here
is all about cognitive diversity so we
talk about what we look like on the
outside right gender race socio-economic
differences my research basically
informs the fact that it doesn't matter
that much of what matters is what your
mind looks like on the inside and then
how will you bring your brain power to
solve a problem and what will you do to
get other brains to come and help you
solve your problems so how can you
network minds this is an MRI machine
who's had an MRI okay what is it like
who know who can tell me what it's like
to have an MRI when okay okay so it's
loud it's claustrophobic okay so Doug
Dietz is the designer of this for GE
he's interviewed in the research as well
he's a creator inside of a very large
company and he was so proud of this
technology and was in a hospital
observing it when a 7 year old little
girl came to have an MRI scan and as she
came down the hallway with her parents
holding her hands everything was fine
until she saw this machine and then she
completely melted down and you know
became hysterical and was crying and
scared and everything else and it was a
bad experience for her and her
parents and the lab techs and it just
didn't work and Doug Dietz then really
felt like he had failed because it's a
beautiful piece of technology but it
really wasn't working at all that day
for that child and so he went away and
basically the the data shows that 80% of
children have to be sedated to take an
MRI because they can't stay still enough
it's scary it's loud
they don't totally understand why
they're there and what's going on and so
what Doug did was go away and network
mines he tried to figure out like who
who he could get to talk to him about
how they would redesign this and so he
went and got a bunch of people from the
Children's Museum he got a bunch of
people from daycare centers he had a
bunch of kids come in he had parents
come in and they all had these big sort
of brainstorming sessions around how
would you make this technology better
for a kid and that a lot of the kids
started talking about going to camp or
dressing up like their older sister or
you know the people who designed
children museums displays start talking
about how to make it interactive and
everything else and basically what they
came up with is this so this is now an
MRI there it's called the adventure
series for kids there are seven
different themes
it's the Zac same technology but when
kids come to the hospital now they get
like a backpack they talked to a camp
counselor not a nurse there's music
playing and music was mentioned they get
to this is a nautical theme but there
there's that there's Safari there's like
a space theme there's all these
different things and the sedation rate
the amazing part is basically down to
zero and so by networking mines and
getting all of these kind of
non-traditional players involved in
figuring out how to make things better
that's the result this is David Kelly
who is the founder of IDEO and the
Stanford d.school
and Stanford so I'm going back to teach
at Stanford Business School this spring
and it's not really publicly known but
Stanford's putting a large portion of
the endowment now behind the d.school
which is
the design school and it pulls from
seven of the different graduate programs
to try to get people basically
networking minds to solve problems in
new ways and there are no degrees
awarded but it is just an unbelievably
oversubscribed
part of the university for taking
everybody in the latest when I was on
campus the latest thing they were trying
to solve is the TSA security thing like
everybody hates TSA security and it's a
hassle for absolutely everybody it's a
hassle for the workers it's hassle for
the travelers you know it's obviously
very important because we want to have a
secure situation going on but they are
looking at complex problems and putting
you know an anthropologist with a
neuroscientist with an educator with an
MBA and trying to figure out like how
would we get problem solved in different
ways and then the last skill is what I'm
calling gift small goods and the idea
here is that we the small good would be
a small favor or a small kindness and in
the workplace it would be forwarding a
resume or writing a few lines of code or
making an introduction for someone
critiquing a proposal there are lots of
small ways that we can help each other
and it used to be the right thing to be
a nice guy right in a workplace and help
your colleagues now in fact with the
transparent economy and as quickly as
word travels it's a lot more productive
so that's the counterintuitive finding
here is that nice guys are nice women
who help each other out what that does
is that sources your reputation is
amplified and proliferated we know how
you behave now and people then want to
bring you information and bring you
opportunities and open doors for you and
it makes you a lot more productive
professional so this is reid hoffman the
founder of LinkedIn the LinkedIn is
founded on this very premise so the idea
is if we are all transparently connected
to each other and we know who's worked
with whom in the past just a boss might
be able to get information on an
employee but now like employees or
anybody can get information about
anybody else and so it actually drives
better behave
you're in the workplace and Reid will
say no one's going to throw themselves
in front of a train for you it's not
like people are going to do these huge
big favors but if you have a whole lot
of small favors and if you have being of
the exchange of small goods but that is
a much better workplace and it's
actually much better for your own
reputation and getting things done for
yourself and then we're back to bringing
them all together so it's really when
all these things are combined that you
know people are able to take an idea and
take it to scale and it the the big
point here about my research is really
that it's accessible to everyone if
these are not you don't have to have a
certain set of credentials you don't
have to have an MBA you don't have to
come with a lot of capital you don't
actually have to have that much time you
can be learning and moving these things
very quickly and in small steps but it's
the combination of bringing them
together that makes initiatives take off
so that's it and I would love questions
yes actually when interviewed at that
time the same sort of entrepreneur folks
have you read that book and how would
you I haven't read that book might be
interesting yeah yeah yeah I haven't
read that book um Simon &amp;amp; Schuster's my
publisher and Simon Schuster's bringing
this book out as the good - great for
people if you know the Jim Collins good
- great book and that looked at
organizations right how do you take an
organization up a level this is all at
the individual skill level so this is
like how does an individual person do
something that is you know taking their
own leadership up a level but all the
kids would look thank you yeah so you
start with 2030 different skills and we
do it down to the six yes so yes so it's
a grounded Theory method which is a
sociology or a qualitative research
methodology so there are 10,000 pages of
transcripts here that were reviewed you
know 5,000 pages of extra material 10k
and 10-q s and annual you know
of various varieties and 4,000 pages of
academic studies so it's a huge data set
and then what what you do with that is
you start coding and you start looking
for repeated concepts and repeated words
and pattern it's a pattern recognition
exercise across and originally I thought
there were 40 I mean like this is why it
takes years to kind of do it I thought
there were 42 things and then I thought
there were 20 some and then I was down
in the teens and these categories so
there's six it's a new theory of six
skills but underneath each one of the
six if you if you read in the chapters
there's three or four concepts in each
one of the skills so yeah it's a big you
know kind of pattern recognition
exercise yeah they're sequel about what
not to I don't know maybe I mean what to
avoid
yeah or did you get in your interviews
for example did you get specific advice
or examples of weirdness where somebody
went wrong or where something was
obviously either behavior problem or
some situation that you can also codify
about what not to do yeah so I mean in
the field wisely chapters so you don't
want to fail stupidly right if that's
what you're asking so that I mean like
meaning you don't want to keep making
the same mistake over and over and over
that's one thing that people talked
about as you mentioned the stats are
pretty bad for venture capital business
yes do well it might be as interesting
to look at what causes the thirty
thousand failures for every success and
it feels almost like looking at what not
to do might be more actionable than
looking to do what I think I would
choose pretty others right yes it's good
to look at that before the drill down
but I I was gonna be I don't I like I
mean so so the I here we saying and I
think that's right I mean 70% of venture
capital is either a wash or not not up
right so three of 10 bets in the VC
industry payoff I went out very
specifically to study the success
stories and it's hard to succeed right
so I mean the data actually shows that a
lot of startups don't make it or they
don't
so in fact this data set is that is you
know one of the very largest on
companies over a hundred million in
revenue that have scaled in a short
period of time I think it's I think it's
more interesting to know why somebody
succeeded and across all the industries
because that's what we want to emulate I
think companies fail for many reasons so
a few of them that were talked about
when I interviewed people they fail for
internal team dynamics right so if your
internal team is fighting with itself
and you see a lot of that and you see it
with mergers of startups you see it with
teams that didn't know each other before
they started as a team those those
startups often don't work and I think
that's the same in big companies I mean
I don't think that that's but internal
dynamics take teams down not learning a
lesson so failing at the same thing over
and over and not trying something new
that was talked about like if you you
know a product could not work a market
could shift but if you just continue to
stay after the same thing and you don't
actually pivot is a word that a lot of
people I'm not wild about the word pivot
but if you don't actually move off and
do something different that's a pretty
bad thing to be stuck doing but I don't
know I mean I guess it you could study
all the failures I don't know why I
would do that I would much rather study
the successes and then figure out how to
emulate that and I think the
commonalities are more interesting
because I think the reasons for failure
are a whole lot and you know it's like
what is the famous quote every happy
family looks the same and every unhappy
family has got some you know strange and
different deviation to it so I'm after
the happy families yeah do you think
kind of through the data that all six of
those concepts you weight equally so I
know you say they all have to come
together but do you did you see that
anything was more stronger or more
prevalent than the others and they're
pretty much equal I think that you'd
have to find a gap to begin what's the
other thing to say about the model is
you know it's a sequential model but you
find a gap off
and then you drive for daylight like you
say hey I found that thing and now I'm
gonna just really manage as fast as I
can and then you fly a new tulip so you
observe orient decide act you try to
figure out how to iterate it then
inevitably you fail like I mean like
people are not having straight-line
careers like something is not working
right
and then they net people in network
mines like let me get some more brain
power over here to try to help me out
and then gifting small goods is
something that just happens very but I
want to say specifically that it doesn't
hat it's not a line this is not a
checklist and I don't want people to go
away thinking oh I have a checklist of
six things to do because these things
work in concert so you could fail and
out of failing you could see an
opportunity right I mean so you could
fail wisely and then spot a gap right or
you could be driving for daylight and
then be be able to find something and be
very generous and gifting you know a
small good to somebody else I mean so
these things are happening sort of in
concert I do think you people have to
find a gap you have to spot an
opportunity or you're not in a game to
begin with right and I also think that
people are failing all the time like
every single person that I interviewed
for this book talked about things that
hadn't gone right so I think those two
if you know what was talked about most
those two were probably talked about
most yeah a couple of online questions
one being he was talking about small
groups and how it microsoft we work a
lot small groups work with each other
but you sort of addressed that a little
bit you thought how do you drive this
thinking beyond the person and target
the target being the immediate work to
your immediate workgroup how do you
bring that entrepreneurial spirit to a
team I suppose yeah so it's a really
good question because the research is
all on the individual level but we're
all working with each other all the time
right
so the PayPal guys are a great example
they and and the fly that you to loop
like the wingman idea is you are flying
with other people you are working with
other people in your team and those
dynamics that chapter talks a little bit
more about you know the obligation to
dissent I used to work at McKinsey
that's
actually one of the rules you must
descent if you disagree you actually
have an obligation to speak up that's
very much how the PayPal guys you know
they they have fierce discussions they
you know in they disagree a lot with
each other but there's a lot of respect
for the intellectual capacity of each
one of them there's a lot of respect but
there is not consensus is actually seen
as a bad thing a lot of the time because
it means that somebody's not thinking or
somebody's not coming up with a
different angle on how you would crack a
problem and so I think you know this is
an individual skill set but I think it
also takes into consideration that the
other people around you would be also
like-minded or kindred spirits in trying
to be innovative in trying to be
entrepreneurial and then respecting that
there will be differences of opinion
there's not going to be a a real easy
and fluid situation it's just not how
the world works
yeah for those successful creators that
you interview to what extent were they
aware that they were practicing these
things like were they deliberately
developing these skills or what they're
just kind of in their nature and so they
are fascinated by the research now
because I went out and asked pretty
open-ended questions this is kaya do it
do you have a you know semi structured
interview schedule so you asked many of
the same questions but then depending on
the answers you let people talk about
how their company worked or how their
individual situation works so they they
are not I'm not going to them and they
are not saying to me I have six skills
right out of the research come the six
skills so I would say they are pretty
fascinated now to know what the other
people are also doing so they're calling
me saying wow you know I didn't realize
that I was like Elon Musk and I'm in
Atlanta making you know Spanx that's
cool so you know I think they're all
exhibiting these six skills but they
weren't necessarily going out to do that
they were living their own lives that's
one of the reasons to do the book to be
honest I feel like it's the shortcut
like I did the homework and I can hand
somebody like hey these six things will
actually
really help you and it's not a sure
thing I mean like there's no sure thing
on the fact that people will actually
scale something that will really work
but the odds are a lot better if you do
these six skills just because the the
recognition off of all these other
successful people is that they have done
these six skills but they they weren't
yeah they're they're kind of also quite
interested in what the results are
because most entrepreneurs most business
people are operating you know we're all
recreating the wheel we're like all
trying to learn our own thing and so
getting a research-based
piece of information that says these six
things actually help I think is
hopefully hopefully it matters I mean
that would be the reason I would go and
try to do it right yeah I have two
questions the first question is in your
book you actually have the transcripts
of the 200 interviews and the second
question is the six skills can you tell
us a little bit about maybe one or two
skills that didn't quite make the cut
but that you saw kind of are widespread
among entrepreneurs you talk to you so
the 200 interview transcripts are not in
the book that they're probably going to
come out in various forms and articles
and case studies and other things like
that
but the book is designed and this is
very intentional the book is designed to
take all of that nerdy research and try
to make it a fast and fun read so the
book is written narrative it's written
so I hope people can read it in three or
four hours and it's one of these things
but I think I so five years of my life
and life someone's going to read that on
an airplane like okay but it's designed
like that because I think that's how
people learn I think we learned through
stories and if you don't make it a story
based narrative concept people don't
grab it so the transcripts yeah I mean
they will I'm happy to send some to to
if you want them but this is the
distilled version that's a lot
friendlier and hopefully it faster so
that's that and then on the second
question about what didn't make the
cut hmm you know I think there's a
concept that I think quite a lot about
that's not really in the book which is
about how uncomfortable all these people
are that they actually get comfortable
with being uncomfortable and I find that
interesting and it's it's kind of baked
in there but not entirely and that is
that there's no striving for the corner
office there's no like oh I made it you
know and a lot of these people have been
very very successful right I mean
financially successful and so there's a
lot of hero-worship around entrepreneurs
but if you actually talk to them they'll
say oh gosh you know I don't know if the
next thing's gonna work I don't know if
this Rockets gonna land on the you know
there's all these waves in the oh I was
just with you on last week and he's like
ah we're gonna try this launch again in
April and then we're gonna try it again
in June and you know a lot of people
look at him and think ah he's just
really made it and if you really talk to
him he thinks like we're gonna just keep
trying and I hope I live long enough to
get this you know actually you know in a
he thinks he's gonna take life to Mars I
mean that's like a crazy ambition right
but I think that nobody is comfortable
and that's something I think we used to
think that we would just have a job that
would be a thirty-year job or we would
have a corner office or we would have
made it at some point in time and the
creators in this book are just always
the curiosity level never goes away so
they're always curiously exploring the
next thing and sometimes it's going to
work and sometimes is not going to work
and I think that might not have come out
as much as I would like it to so you can
carry the message in the world for me
