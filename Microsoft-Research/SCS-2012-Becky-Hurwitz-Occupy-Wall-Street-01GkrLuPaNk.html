I've seen the occupied movement using
communication technology some successes
I've seen some failures so and then try
to speculate on why things are
succeeding and failing so that we can
maybe we think together about how we can
make a movement stronger in technology
going forward so Oh am a problem that
the Occupy movement face at starve is
that we GA is every night which are big
public gatherings everybody was invited
anyone can come to participate and speak
with some speakers proposed things to
improve but then also early on we're
told we can't have we could magnify them
so having another the first great
success was the people's make you know
familiar with what people time is no
okay so the people who might work like
this we don't have it right down so in
order for me to get my voice over there
I say something
so Mike Jack the human Mike human body
is a communication technology just being
across distances so large
so why is such a success it's all so
real and recurring problem which is
a growing problem every night the ga
people need to speak to a large group
and the park is large and it's in the
middle of the are so I so noisy and it
gets around this legal issue it's
extremely easy to learn how to use it
you can you all just learned it in the
space of no time whatsoever it's
extremely easy to replicate and you can
do it almost anywhere almost anyone can
do it you can even like check yourself
and you would wipe yourself alone if you
want it to open and it's entirely free
so beyond this I think it also has some
I think unintended qualities that
contribute to its great success one is
that it really does embody core values
of the movement so it encourages active
participation everyone is asked which is
peaking this to to be an equal voice of
as equal to the person who has the main
stage it's a level of resource we have
to speak in three word phrases you don't
get to sort of wield your debate skills
and your rhetorical across and it solves
a large Lupin problem which is the
problem of outreach and engagement it's
a simple and legal tactic so so it
doesn't put anybody at risk of getting
arrested
and so it's really easy to participate
in it I also think it's it's an empathic
technology and we're trying to build a
community movement and so when you're
when you're listening to somebody to
speak and then you have to internalize
that they have just said and then sweep
it out again and hear your voice saying
you really have to consider what you're
saying I'm listening to and we're asked
to repeat things even if we disagree
with them so even within that frame it's
still you still have control over a test
if you disagree with something that's
being said that's one thing but if
somebody's entirely speaking out of turn
a disruptive process you'll hear the
human Mike fizzle out people will stop
repeating it and then any people will
raise issues about process and then
something else I think was unintended is
that the tactic itself has become
inactive resistance it's sort of a
calling card or an expression of
affiliation with equipment so then some
less successful it turns to augment the
people's neck so early on the occupied
translation group got together and
borrowed in a system so the David
simulcast that's mannish and this went
on for maybe a couple of weeks and it
was successful and and anybody who what
is listen to
management about get our headsets and
endless in and then that included
reduction users who couldn't understand
English but back when it was on loan it
was expensive and so it was returned and
then I was involved with the group where
we set up an FM broadcast so we put a
microphone right air than me the main
speaker and they could broadcast about
three blocks around the park the main
failure of that was then required at
least three people that operate so
somebody has sit with the radios of the
other base of the bike and then there
had to be a third person running
interference in case somebody needed to
be relieved or something you might plug
somewhere it also required power obvious
but how are we gave a big problem in the
park once our generator started getting
seized and then some other people were
working on mobile out solutions so
actually a colleague of mine worked on
the thing where the person who's
speaking could broadcast what they were
saying streaming over the web and then
other people in the audience could
listen X rating that presumably used to
have projected it's peter hook but we
found that there were that many people
actually in the audience
moans and that there was a latency
problem which is a little ironic because
you might have links problem too but
also that a Jays nest for hours and so
streaming audio for hours was pretty
impossible with given battery life
skills oh sorry AGA is in general as I'd
like it so they were never held daily to
start in the park anybody was welcome to
come down and now they're sort of every
other day still public it's a way to get
together and talk about movement issues
but also make
but so these are all solutions actually
we're trying to stop some real problems
to write the problem of people not being
able to understand English and and most
of the main speaker speaking in English
to have a problem with another problem
we're trying to solve with the FM
broadcast was that people were getting
course it was it was just kind of her
towards me shouting night after night
and but but still the problem of power
sort of over love that and then the
mobile app I was probably an access
really
that's good question because the the
city I decided oh sorry the question was
why identification prohibited because
using the application would have made it
much easier to me and I think you good
for not interested
I think I think it was allowed in Tecate
go for a bit my understanding of it as a
treatment is that these laws are
enforced erratically in New York like
you're not allowed you can you can bust
anywhere in the city with that
application application your prop you
know you get busting sort of better not
they like you're playing sorry this IP
there's a political point like a champ
that's sort of the story of the party
there there are number laws of the books
and there are facts see another
information problem that seen a lot of
development around and attempts to solve
was probably keeping up with the
applications so I'm the tech Hawks group
down at occupy wall streeters
maintaining this this really long list
of feeds from occupations around country
and around a little but they have over a
thousand sites they have now listed in a
spreadsheet so keeping up with the
information was coming out of a thousand
occupation seems pretty impossible and
it it's
quite difficult people so a solution
that came up were feet i think there
were about seven feet I Viator's maybe
with but that we found and the first
couple of months i'm sure there were
more and none of them really took off i
can show you the interface of a human
them and i think it explains a little
bit of why now here's one that's being
developed by folks in New York it's
bullying in fees were applications
around the country from that scratching
thought I was here's another product but
some group not in here so you can see
there's a lot of information it's not
really these fees aren't really helping
us to figure out what's important for or
or even to make choices about what we're
looking at I can't say oh I care more
about this states or show me that
information on me so we still have a
fire this problem there's still a ton of
information coming at us and it's her to
sit through it so I think one of the
solutions that we've come up with is
coming up with more authoritative voices
and that's why cast out this man chicago
tribune Tribune so if you group together
and you say oh here are some issues that
we want to talk about and then you
publish together and maybe in print or
on a single website that it makes it
easier for people to under
budget for meeting me are generally
deciding to pay attention to and so you
do some of that shifting from equal
source this is the product of the techno
script done it by wall street fair they
have seen this problem they got together
I decided to build a site which would be
a bit to eat a lot essentially so we'll
decide as community who guys post there
when this rules are and sort of see some
of that will bring ourselves there's
also
so here's a third problem people are
getting arrested and when they get
arrested they want to alert other people
that they're being arrested and so
technologists came up with solutions
apps um actually I should say this is an
app that we develop our this press that
I'm working on right now much we working
mobile phone security that's enough to
help you overhear your friends and
colleagues you've been arrested and then
deletes of data off your phone it wasn't
developed for this use case though and
I'll tell you little bit more wine but
your two other apps that are really
similar to popped up just after we r you
press a button and it sent off with
emergency SMS tell somebody that you're
being arrested and but why didn't this
take off um well largely because i
already have sharpies and lawyers
everywhere so before a protest people or
during the protest people were walking
around pens and sharpies and shouting
out this number to call the nlg the
National Lawyers Guild and so this is a
group of trained lawyers license lawyers
who who hang out at the par get it all
the protest and we're in breaking hat so
you can identify them and they're there
to both bear witness to police activity
and and also to take down names and
numbers of people are getting arrested
so it's only gets arrested you hear them
you hear an energy bar shout out what's
your name what's your birthday what's
your phone number and they take these
things down it goes into a long
afterwards and there's actually a decent
system for tracking who's being arrested
and where they are and the nlg will
track them from arrest through through
their Court dates and it's an important
system the lawyers actually have to be
there observing
they end up being witnesses often times
in cases and if we just relied on apps
to say to send to say an LG number it
wouldn't be enough try to verify
anything that is having so so I just
wanted to step back and try to think
about why certain technologies of being
developed by why some of them are
working why some of them are not and to
think about where we might invest our
energies most efficiently going forward
so one of one of the things that's
interesting to me is how does
development happen in another ebay space
and not unfortunately during space so if
i create a product like it if its
commercial my motivation to make that
appt take off is that i'm going to try
to make money off and i may need to have
a big marketing budget we don't have it
right we're volunteering and we're
building these things and they don't
take off from the best choice is usually
just to leave it
jump on to the next day and write it off
as alright and so what does that mean I
think it's pretty healthy actually but I
also i also wonder about how how we
might convince to ideas a little bit
more strongly and what would drive that
commitment to an idea or two a product
without a partial recent to do and then
also there are ongoing costs so even
with tools that tank often are really
successful if it takes ongoing
maintenance that means people to time
and this is this is largely volunteer
movement right so people are giving
finding extra time in their lives to do
these things will people stop finding
that time maybe we'll and how will we
deal with that cost of preferring and
then really generally I think we need
sort of a bit are to innovate at the
same time as performing so to create
brand new ways of doing things and and
then also to look at the systems that we
already have and figure out how we can
make them serve our needs better and so
I would suggest that a way that we could
innovate in in this in the technology
space is to to really push the idea of
empowering users developers designers
equally so what does that mean it means
really trying to understand those me
getting like if the need is for a free
tool then yeah maybe human Mike really
is much better than sort of smartphone
calm and then but but also throughout
the design process so not just about
design and not just at the beginning of
an idea but then how do you make an end
product that a user can also control so
with again it's a human Mike that the
user has also been control over whether
they become an even Mike and whether
they're shouting out or going to link as
well cuz you know a bigger between fair
because what's being said is on process
planning do that in a more traditional
communication technology and also how do
you do this from the ground up so how do
we look at the architecture of our
systems also and make sure that those
are accountable to the values of the
people using them so how do you build a
system that the day is is secure on
going through activists how do you go
system that doesn't have a lot of data
about people and who they are in their
uses so that people aren't missing in
the endangering themselves
and also how do we choose needs so in a
movement where things are pretty
uncertain where it's difficult to
predict what how the move it will grow
and what challenges will face next how
do we choose the needs that we address
so I think that this problem of finding
and developing an authoritative voice
will and that we can create our own
publications and websites and tools but
that also figuring out how to be from
allow boys non existing platforms is
really important so places like facebook
and twitter and other people's inboxes
engagement making sure that whatever
tools were choosing our cheap easy to
use illegal and then the third problem
is just the maybe the most interesting
to me is how do we build a movement
that's national and international so how
do we take advantage for some of the
tools that we have to to grow our
hammers
yeah so like I was saying early on as
people were gathering in the park we we
were not allowed to use empathize how do
I get out of the park it was there hi
Ashley I don't know from where I was it
came from I suspect
yeah feels like a comment
great
I think a concept of trying to learn
immediate ranger ii and since Christmas
it seems like the media coverage you
want players kind of all outfitted as
avatar poster i'm pleased to kind of
life yeah the time that yeah that i sees
succeeding is is that there are there
like a few pigs that call themselves on
my wall street or some three words and
they seem to post frequently enough that
they owe their straight right so if you
subscribed to a book is likely not half
of everything in your newsfeed is going
to be about right i think whether this
is not just fact or not it's a
successful in terms of engaging with
mainstream media the you know does every
hour working group they're like out
these working groups and they and
everybody was down there so you can try
to engage when I was being covered I
don't know how to answer okay
ok
actually yeah
it's hard for me to list successes I
think it's an ongoing problem I actually
think initially the message was pretty
clear because it was so small people say
we're standing up against economic
inequity and and the lack of regulation
on bay and we're popular movement were
the ninety-nine percent right so that
was a small message and as it messages
Grove it's been harder to sort of just
stick to that because it's easy to say
but we need to look at all all of the
reasons that's happened and then your
message becomes kind of money I also but
now with the winter I think things are
changing I live in crisis mode whatever
would there were people living in the
park every day was Christmas right and
and now that that's not the case I think
there's a lot more like goals and
visioning work in downward moving
together like across the movement and
having discussions about without the
site and what our message what are
talking points I don't know that I can
show you really successful yeah but I do
know that
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
