hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
good morning I guess most of the
audience are from academia so I'll
introduce myself from industry in a
slightly mood we got a different way to
start with a confession i am not a
researcher by any means so my insights
or perspectives will be from industry
and in my experience of working in a
corporate dealing with the research
institutes and are now in a start-up
trying to deal with research institutes
both in academia and industry so since
the first session i thought i will offer
some entertainment value to start with
and then share my perspectives i happen
to be at a research seminar on a very
different topic a week ago in bangalore
it has nothing to do with my domain it
is about influence of shahrukh in
architecture on deccan heritage or
deccan monuments in india incidentally
presented by a researcher and a scholar
from us there are a hundred people in
the meeting and forty of them are non
Indians and the remaining are senior
citizens and there are ten or so
research scholars I would guess in the
area of history archaeology and art the
session took one hour and there was one
question from a recessed scholar I
thought it's quite an insight to listen
to the answer given for the question
asked the question asked by the lady I
guess you there is a scholar because it
takes a long time to figure out patterns
in architecture especially the columns
in the temples and its roots in person
or in Hindu philosophy she asked how
does one go about it did the professor
spend time in looking at every rock
monument stone it's a very large region
in deccan plateau right it's almost
ahora Sonya and how much time it took I
guess the question is she's trying to
figure out how much time does it take to
do such kind of work I thought I knew
the answer because i know many
researchers and many PhDs in my family
is Swiper okay it will say what for
following for five years ago he said it
takes some familiarity to before you
discover any pattern and then you can do
some research and figure out some you
know insights or in for something the
familiarity took about 20 years and
there are 10 years there was absolute
silence in the room which actually
amounted to 30 years so he said I spent
35 years in this region in looking at
every Rock every monument before I any
pattern it took me a long time I hope
the IT research is not that long but
maybe it is a balance between what we
call wisdom and knowledge so let me
start with analytics with a headline
view I want to make too provocative
statements before i start the startup
side of collaborations i think the
headline view i want to make maybe three
statements the first one is the
disaggregation of stack in analytics for
those people who involved in analytics
before right from the spreadsheet models
to the current big data models the stank
got disaggregated now wait and research
perhaps in each of the areas whether it
is in data sets whether it is
algorithmic lavers whether it is in
business logic or computational whether
it is in visualization interaction
design to use a more fashionable term or
in case of business impact which is what
MBS do the second one is the mix of
three datasets
which in my view i put it slightly
differently you have the enterprise data
which is generally structured machine
data which is basically ad hoc and then
maybe you have social data which you are
trying to mix and you find most startups
in big data space either meddling with
one of them are at least more than one
of them but on the people site or on the
research side or even on the engineering
side and I want to use the term very
incisive Lee that to differentiate
between engineering and research I would
think that it is the overloading of
skills but under representation of
knowledge and this is one thing which
you find both in large corporates and in
startups perhaps it is there a
provocative statement to make that we
stop distinguishing between skills and
knowledge but let me also give a
landscape view are not the headline view
like this on how I see their space and
and the role for research and the
segments in which startups normally work
it's also a convergence of many domains
as i was speaking another panel
discussion of ACM maybe a month ago I
don't know whether oolitic see is a
science is it an engineering discipline
is it art is it just business I think we
mixed a lot of domains today in the
current area of analytics I would also
say that it's an integration to more
philosophically of what you think what
you feel and what you do to put it more
rigorously it's an integration of
sensorial semantics and perhaps
structural which is it may behave you
know data so let me now with that
context explain how a start-up looks at
it and I give two examples just to go
take you through the the experience our
been through in the recent or i'd i
would say five years I I skipped my
corporate experience
and just focus on the topside the two
examples I want to give our one from
them my own company and what we did in
the initial six months which is our
three years ago and sickened about an
example which is currently hot or active
we still not done with it I'm a mentor
and in versal in that company the first
one is about crayon data this is my form
in Singapore with a center in chennai I
work out of Daniel Bert it's in the
science of choice so I will maybe
explain about my experience of trying to
solve one dimension of it which is
called trust modeling in social reader
and given an example of the other
startup where I'm an investor and mentor
in image analytics just to drive home
the point on where we where I find the
research challenge or collaboration from
a starter perspective just to complete
the story I also lead the task force on
start a process understand of India so
I'm very familiar with venture capital
and the funding processes and what is
the gap and why some things are done
differently in and started so that's the
perspective I come from so let me just
give a view or the life stage view of
the first example in science of choice
the startup was established in 2012 by
three of us I count from engineering an
IT background my co-founder comes from
digital media and the other person comes
from analytics prior to that in
advertising he sold his earlier form to
IBM but I'm the only person who is tech
so these are three people and we
initially started modeling how choices
are made so this is the science of
choice or choice theory recommended
systems if you want to use an academic
categorization the the theoretical
foundation is based on the art of
choosing of Sheena Iyengar book or the
paradox of choice of Barry squads
however when we want to look at choice
in
more scientific way there are enough
papers in MIT and other things which are
published we looked at a few dimensions
and I will talk about one dimension in
detail we said the choice is generally
made by a combination of taste behavior
which is about what you act context the
context of your behavior influence which
is social influence for all practical
purposes and trust these were the our
initial dimensions when we want to look
at how choices are built so I hired a
dual PhD 11 in computational linguistics
and second differential geometry paired
him up with a lady from Stanford so you
can pick all the data science covered
and we have enough people who have done
on big data and IT startup so we are
trying to it is the initial six months
yeah so we're trying to model how to use
this so it's easy to look at context
because for most practical purposes and
we were looking at a retail example at
the time which was proved to be wrong
later we will get context essentially
location for example or your geospatial
data and the behavior is about
transaction which you come from
enterprise data in flames typically is
about social data influence or peer
network and then you have taste which is
about your product to product or item to
item affinity which we compute we added
trust because we thought that's the
dimension which we should model so we
spend a lot of time in trying to model
trust trust in online and I will give a
reason why we picked that at that time
this is in the first six months of a
start-up just remember that we were
thinking rather we made an assumption i
would say that our best customer fit
will be in a retail space or especially
online retail in online retail for those
people who are from industry and some of
you work in the space will know it
diverges from the physical or what we
call brick-and-mortar space in the sense
in brick-and-mortar transactions lead to
trust in online trust leads to
transaction it is exactly the other way
and hence because we thought we should
focus on retail segment we should model
trust so we looked at the academic
papers we looked at the mathematical
models etc so the question I mean since
you are mostly from academia you can you
can perhaps characterize it as should a
triadic closure work in trust in case of
social influence or reviews it works
right he likes baby like see you can do
the triadic closure ABC so the question
that is asked is can you use a directed
acyclic graph or a triadic closure in
trust network so I trust have a person
and he trust somebody else can I say
that I can trust the third person does
trust propagate in the same way so we
felt after researching for some time the
question seemed to be more about
behavioral and cognitive science than
computer science and second we found
that maybe there is a sub cultural
variation it depends on what your data
as it is and North American data set
behaves very differently from an Indian
or a Southeast Asian data set we really
don't know a crude example but I'm a
hard-hitting example you trust your
mother but do you trust a recommendation
to buy a stock not necessarily your
stock broker has an influence on the
stock you pick you trust him or her
maybe it isn't propagate in that sense
so we thought after doing over for five
months we really don't know whether we
are solving the problem and imagine this
is one of the dimensions of the overall
model the second problem is the data set
so what is the signal for trust
especially online trust distrust of
individuals are not trust in a data
space or nodes so the closest we could
come to is somebody sharing photographs
or intimate photographs is one of the
indicators of high amount of trust then
I spoke to somebody
a PhD from social in social sciences
from this he said well I don't know
whether you can see that because
sometimes you you actually upload your
intimate photographs to anonymous users
rather than people who know so you can
really say definitely that trust means
sharing your photographs but in general
that is an indicator a strong indicator
at the end of the day we are trying to
find model someone's behavior or have
you think so then he explained to me
that you should understand the
difference between cognitive science and
behavioral science how do you think he
may be different from how you act you
can't just correlate so easily without
looking at the subculture and belief
variations imagine a startup I cannot be
spending time in figuring out behavioral
science cognitive science human behavior
sub cultural variations etc so we felt
okay let me see given the other data
sets we have and other factors we have
what is the amount of business effect we
have if actually do it and we did try
this model and we found that it doesn't
really add to us at the time and we also
realized in six to eight months time
frame that the retail online retail to
be specific is not nasally early
customer and we had that time thought
that the banks will be the least
interesting for us and that have
happened to be the most interesting so
my experiments with a with a
mathematician a computer scientist in
trying to figure out I was wondering
should i have used in external or a
research collaboration in that sense to
cut down this time I found that very few
were willing to talk because most of the
time when we approached any academic
Institute even a a business institute
who do tangible psychology the problem
is to be defined in a very precise way
or a very narrow fashion rather than
such a broad fashion the second issue I
had was a data set we were interested in
a very large amount of data points and
not about 10,000 people and 5,000 people
which is that normally campus kind of
solution so we actually dropped modeling
trust
in the first six months now it's almost
three and a half years so far we never
found a reason to go back though I still
keep a tab on it it's only later when I
was speaking at myntra and I was
explaining the same problem that the
trust propagates differently online
compared to physical world but we still
find that it's a very niche problem to
solve for most of the business issues
you see so as a start-up since I don't
have too much of time and too much of
money you have to make those choices
worry early so one of the first things I
learned is that you need a kind of a
rigorous analysis in the first six
months of a startup phase but then it
will go back later to solve a problem at
scale and we suspend most of the
research collaboration in between
because most of us would like to patent
and not publish that's the case with
ground data as well so we decided to
actually hire people with those
backgrounds into the company rather than
collaborate with anybody else now coming
to the next point which is wrong the
image-side which is an interesting
argument again on the image side it's a
I'll give an example again in retail
which is easier to connect instead of
giving an IOT example in it text
analytics I will try to figure out what
you meant by seeing what you said or
what you stated or what you wrote in
image and it takes I'm trying to figure
out what you're trying to buy or
similarity measure so if I see a shirt I
know that you are liking black shirt so
you like maybe formal shirts some
conclusion like that but an object of
interest you will find a specific from
academia you will know it is very
difficult to find or in for something
like that if you wear a brown shirt what
is the object it's not so easy to figure
out it matches your skin so I have to
look at the texture i will look at a lot
of other things it's very easy for the
blue shirt because skin is not blue now
there is enough you know research in
this incidentally this is one of the top
startup areas in retail
then we went to look at him and this is
a stop I invested and mentor them is to
look at some of the unsupervised
learning systems right or learning
techniques especially CNN's neural
networks and since I have gone through
the experience of for six months in the
other startup I told this person that I
think we should try it again whether we
can deal with academia or industry
research institutes to see what's the
state of art so we found many things we
found the packages we found the methods
we also know the people who actually
research in that area but one of the
biggest challenges even today it's a
live case that the one the problem
definition may not be same as what an
academic researcher or domain wants was
as an industry use second we found that
most of the github or whatever packages
they upload they are not at a level of
industry quality they're rarely walk at
scale so this is one of the biggest
challenges at the end of the day we
can't be testing 10 packages just to
figure what works then comes dealing
with the people who are experts
unfortunately in Indian ecosystem this
may be a little exotic but well there is
no the question is whether is it a
collaboration in a commercial sense or
is just a research interest right so as
you can figure out in many of the
collaborations we found with the
exception of startups coming from
Institute's where the professor normally
has an equity component in the company
any company which is starting outside of
the campus having an equity deal where
the professor is not very common India
it is also not very common actually
outside for the simple reason that the
trust that way is not very high because
most of them would like to patent many
of these methods however we found that
the the state of art doesn't really fit
in to some of the models and this is the
same debate ways to have internally and
this is the case with many big data
analytics companies especially in data
science that
should I take a mathematician should I
walk with their critical comparisons
person or should I take a person who is
more active one I say big data stack who
can of course a good Big Data programmer
can you not solve or she not solve we
found that most of the areas here they
club statistics or stochastic models
graph models and the big data
computational complexities now this is a
very rare combination actually from an
academic perspective it will cut into
different departments right to be make
it more provocative most professors who
come from that background cannot
actually code in a big data environment
I don't want a spreadsheet model right
we can't walk in with such models and in
a big data I cannot just work with a
manual one and then try to make it big
yeah the second one we found is that
statisticians do not know graph theory
and most of them especially the affinity
models are built on graph theory or
network models as we say in image
processing it is also true with some
powerful signal processing and other
subjects which may not cut with many of
the classical mathematician domain and
we found a combination of a theoretical
computer science seems to work but then
many of them want almost a computer
science problem rather than an
engineering problem so I think it if you
find most of the groups like us we are
seriously funded so we are not really
small so we actually take a mix of these
people because there is no way we can
solve it if by just having a single
dimensional expertise now what is it
that we can so the question is I often
asked in a mentorship network is venture
I engage in my studied opinion I mean
it's open for debate I think it's good
to check the first six months which
makes a lot of sense however it is based
on the intimacy where the promoter and
the professor or the institution whereas
I actually found more use if it is after
18 months in a start-up journey where
you already have your solution walking
in a customer place we have the data
sets we have things working
sometimes but it has to be more robust
more rigorous more scalable and perhaps
to P word into a different model just to
give you a contrast this particular
model believes that the triangle of
academia product and the team it comes
in that triangle if I talk to a business
school it works exactly the other way we
do deal with some of the retail experts
for example are backing experts and
coming from the accademia but because
they have a customer connect and they
have that data it seems to work exactly
the opposite way so i think it's a it's
an interesting the way to have academy i
don't want to make it only computer
science or mathematics but it's also the
business goals so we find it when you
collaborate with whether it is however
or Columbia School was transferred it
seems to work in a different way maybe
they are coming on the business side
more than the products and hence the
arguments and collaborations and
insights d4 so I think with that I want
to you know pause here and maybe take
the remaining questions of the power
thank you so if we have maybe one or two
quick questions we can take them now and
then defer the rest for the panel any
questions how much do you think is the
historical significance and origin of
the data has you know significance in
their trust your trust model oh maybe I
cannot answer it for a specific
dimension like trust but I can give you
an answer for the overall dimensions
typically we look for two years that
last two years data because the other
one of the issues we found is of course
we because it is also a social data and
enterprise data integration we wanted to
be a little more fresh but most of these
models you know they're built RM and a
Markov model right so if few data points
it won't make a difference but we need
at least eight can put a dimension of
two to two and half years so when we
deal with
example banking sector which is our
biggest sector we deal with we ask for
two years transaction data and and the
social data in the similar way but it's
okay if you differ here and there but
normally we don't go back more than two
ears at the back so you said you want
people who researchers who an expert in
theory I mean mixed people are you able
to find those type of people we can't
find them in one individual but ok let
me give my experience of recruiting both
in India and in Singapore and i have not
have done one recruitment in u.s. in
fact my data scientists is sin by area
is the russian mathematician but graph
theory from a from a number perspective
from volume of people perspective
generally seems to associate itself with
networks rather than mathematics are
such right so if i take people who are
worked a lot in communication networks
especially if you work in the lower end
of the networks like optical a metro
which is topology driven right your
fairness algorithms you are you know
topology discovery they're all coming
from essentially graph theory so
actually those people have they don't
need much of you know interact I mean
they're quite warm in terms of skill
sets they may have a problem in solving
it in a in a database context so I'm
using a graph database whether i'm using
a graph processing but not graph
database so we we have an issue with
some of the people who come from the
comm industry perspective they have a
problem with the data models and how it
works but graph theory in general but
they don't need to understand I mean
they understand topology I mean those
things I understand especially fearing
the mesh networks anything topology at
the network layer they will generally
know it is a different argument that for
large corporate some and I'm sorry to
make a comment in large corporates I
will be surprised if they know what it
means because nobody works in a large
cooperate on topology discovery if you
are in services form you don't make much
money in it
right thank you again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
