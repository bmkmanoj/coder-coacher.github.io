here cream to show you the next
generation of Kinect sensor cream would
you mind joining me in front of the
sensor there you go we've got cream here
and you're seeing him in all his 3d
glory the Kinect sensor has 3d vision
capability about three times the
fidelity of 3d vision than we had in the
first generation sensor you see a lot of
details here you can see creams
individual fingers you can see the
wrinkles in a shirt you can even see his
facial features and it's this high
fidelity 3d vision it's really going to
enable a whole new set of natural
interaction scenarios now in addition to
the increased fidelity we also have a
much larger field of view creams a
pretty tall gentleman he's standing only
about a meter and a half away from the
sensor right now much closer than he was
able to stand with the first generation
Kinect but also have a much wider field
of view this is a big sofa and you can
see the entire sofa is in the field of
view of the Kinect sensor now addition
to its 3d capabilities Kinect also has a
2d color camera I'm going to turn that
on now hi cream now you're seeing cream
in 2d color we've made that color feed
1080p across that large field of view
great for Skype scenarios but one of the
challenges with color color camera feeds
is that they're very susceptible to
changes in room lighting so to show this
we're going to bring down the room
lights and you know gamers they'll often
play a game in a dimly lit room you
often want to watch a movie in the dark
you can see that we've just lost cream
completely in the shadows here is not
very useful anymore so we've introduced
a new technology we call active IR we're
going to turn that on now and there's
cream and active IR we have the ability
to see in the dark with the new Kinect
sensor and the active IRA technology
also enables us to remove ambient room
lighting so creams got a flashlight he's
going to bring out this flashlight and
we'll go back to color feed and this
flashlights simulating different
variations in the room lighting maybe a
lamp off to a side being backlit being
front lip and you can see how those
variations really wreak havoc on the
image make it really difficult to see
who's in the frame when we turn on
active IR we can see that all of that
ambient room light is being removed so
the image is very consistent perfect for
identifying people by their faces</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
