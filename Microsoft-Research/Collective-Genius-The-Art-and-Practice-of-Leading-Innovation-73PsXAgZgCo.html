hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
thank you so much for coming my name is
Amy graves and I'm pleased to welcome
Linda Hill to the Microsoft Research
visiting speaker series she will be
discussing her book collective genius in
which she interviewed the best in the
business to learn how they foster
innovation on their teams
she is the denim sari Donham professor
of Business Administration in the
organizational behavior area at Harvard
Business School where she chairs the
leadership initiative and serves on the
faculty of the leadership best practices
program she has authored becoming a
manager and co-authored being the boss
which The Wall Street Journal named one
of the five best business books to read
for your career in 2011 in 2013 she was
named by thinkers 50 as one of the top
10 management thinkers in the world
please join me in giving her a very warm
welcome well it's quite a pleasure to be
here and it's not only because you have
no snow but I am always happy to be any
place that has no snow we are trying to
break records in Boston and I also
appreciate the chance to speak with you
about something that truly is an
obsession of mine and that is leadership
and innovation and I will tell you that
this is my 30th year being a professor
at the Harvard Business School and
frankly I've been trying to study this
question for 30 years but I only got
really really serious about it about 11
or 12 years ago and what I want to share
with you or some of the findings of a
very systematic project we did looking
at leadership and innovation like many
organizations the Academy is quite
siloed and it turns out that there's a
ton of research on leadership and
there's a ton of research on innovation
but there's not very much looking at the
connection between the two and that's
what I want to speak with you about
today and the bottom line of what we
found is that basically what for many
years I've been trying to help people
learn how to do ie lead then the models
of leadership that we've been actually
telling people that they should be
adopting actually do not work when it
comes to leading innovation
that is not an easy thing for me to say
to you because this is something I've
been doing for a number of years so I
want to talk to you about what I do
think is a model of thinking about
leadership when you want to innovate
when you want to build an organization
that can innovate time and again and
that's the question that's what we mean
by an exceptional leader of innovation
and we looked at both middle managers
and senior executives and CEOs who were
leading either you know teams business
units or enterprises and so I'm going to
be talking about people who work in a
range of different industries and I do
want to say that we did do the project
around the world the other area that I
do work in is on what does it take to
implement a global strategy and I spend
a ton of time in emerging markets so in
fact the research was meant to be pretty
global in its outlook we obviously
haven't covered every country and we
continue to collect data so the data
that I'm going to talk with you about or
from it's really at that point we had
studied 16 exceptional leaders of
innovation in depth for this particular
project and the we really is a
collaboration so one individual Emily
she joined when she was 23 I understand
that she's a millennial I am NOT and
it's very important to have that point
of view the other two co-authors that I
have both are executives or were
executives Greg was at Pixar he was
asked by Steve Jobs to leave next and go
help scale Pixar so he's one of my
co-authors and the others can't align
back who worked in more traditional
organizations as he would put it he just
turned 70 so we represent four different
different decades I just want to tell
you that this is our collective work not
just mine I think that's an important
piece of the puzzle to talk about so
these are the countries we visited I'm
an anthropologist so what we have to do
is spend time on the ground observing up
close and personal these individuals as
they do their work and so that is how we
did our research and then obviously we
have filled notes and go back and
analyze that so I just want to tell you
what the data are and in fact we
continue to collect data and so now we
have probably 26 executives that we
actually have studied I'm going to be
talking about some number of these 12
just to tell you though these are the 12
that are in the book and they all as I
said they represent different different
levels in the organizations some I think
with you would say live in organizations
that are very friendly to innovation
others do not and so I don't know if you
recognize any of those people I'll tell
you about a few of them these are some
of the organizations they come from and
indeed when I'm talking about the
connection between leadership and
innovation if they're not the CEO I'm
not trying to claim that the whole
company is innovative so the person that
I actually studied at IBM was the person
who headed up mergers and acquisitions
for the new business part of IBM the
person at Pfizer is the general counsel
of Pfizer we also have begun to study
what I guess we would refer to as
ecosystems and what looking at those as
well SoCal IT - is the hub of an
ecosystem in San Diego to do biotech and
nanotechnology work so we've looked at
both organizations in these sort of
ecosystems as we began to do this
research and frankly now mostly we're
doing research on the ecosystems and
we're looking in three different
countries the UAE Singapore etc because
trying to combine this innovation and
globalization piece of the puzzle so
first thing I want to just say is I want
to define what how we ended up defining
innovation and this basically reflects
how the leaders that we spoke to defined
it they had a very broad definition of
innovation so they saw innovation as
being both incremental and breakthrough
it could be a product to service a
business model a process a way of
organizing very inclusive notions for
sure innovations are something that are
both new and also useful if it's just
new it's creative if it's not useful
it's not an innovation it's just to
create something that you've created so
it has to be both new and useful to be
defined as an innovation in our work and
so what I want to do first to show you
this person do many of you recognize
this person yes very interesting often
when I'm even in Silicon Valley most
people don't recognize this person which
is sort of curious when you know who it
is you do recognize these people yes
right so that person you were looking at
is the founder of Pixar that is IDI
Catmull he also is the person who just
turned around over a number of years
Disney Animation so he knows how to
build a company that can innovate and he
knows how to turn around a company so I
think we'd say he's an example of
someone who's pretty good at it I think
it's actually very interesting and we
want to come back to the fact that most
people don't recognize IDI and that sort
of tells us a little bit about the kind
of leader
that might be required when you're
leading innovation as well so again
Pixar I think as an organization we'd
all say is innovative and one of the
things and doesn't matter who you talk
to business people if you talk to
artists if you talk to technologists and
my first visit to Pixar was back in 2004
when they were working on ratatouille
that lovely you know movie about a rat
becoming a master chef I must say when I
saw the rat on the little what on earth
is this particular movie going to be
about and you may recall that it took
Pixar 20 years to make the first full
length computer-generated movie and I
think we need to keep in mind how long
it really does take to do breakthrough
innovation since that time Toy Story 2
came out in 1995 they've actually their
15th movies about to come out and it
looks it looks very good I was just
there a couple of couple of weeks ago so
they have been able to do this and one
of the things that they for sure know is
that innovation is not about some genius
having an aha moment now one of the
things that they say at Pixar is that
filmmaking is a team sport and I'm just
going to build this out let's see I'm
gonna build it all at once and just talk
with you about it so when we first went
to Pixar someone should have drew a
picture like this so that we'd
understand what their process was and he
did it reluctantly because he thought it
looked a little bit too neat even
despite all those arrows so for sure
what he said is you know Linda it's a
very messy process is a very iterative
process but there is a logic to it and
one of the things that you may or may
not know is it takes about 250 to 300
people four to five years to make one of
these movies so it's definitely a team
sport it's not about one solo person you
know getting it right immediately it
also is the case that they frequently
have had to change directors so you know
again doesn't always work out as well as
one would like now what happens when you
make one of these movies and many of you
may be in parts of the business that you
you really have lived this is that shots
or scenes move through the pipeline the
production pipeline at different speeds
and they don't move in order depending
on how difficult the particular scene
will be so it turns out for instance
that the scene which is not a very
difficult scene actually the scene where
the little boy hands a piece of
chocolate to a bird and up
you know how many of you have seen that
movie that particular scene took one of
their top animators six months to
perfect now if you look at something
like Sully you know in Monsters Inc for
which they won an Academy Award his hair
is like mine I like to tell the story
because someone actually got an Academy
Award for doing this okay and I know how
hard it is so that feels good to me and
I must confess when I first went to
Google and met people they all asked me
did you meet the man that did Sully's
hair how did that happen it's really
really difficult so that's very
difficult it took ages the shadows under
the cars and that ray-tracing very very
difficult task as well so things move
through at different speeds and one of
the things they say at Pixar is the
whole nothing is done into the whole
movie raps and so what that means is
that things again really do iterate all
along the way and one scene there was a
scene that an animator did and he drew a
sort of a an arched eyebrow to a
character and he showed that to the
director and the director saw that and
said you know well done but not how I
imagined the character so lose it so
lost it went away after all that work
couple weeks later the director comes
back and says where are those few
seconds pulls it out looks at it decides
to include those scenes or those moments
in the film and what they say it Pixar
when that happens is that that
individual animator was able to share
his slice of genius with the director
and as a consequence help the director
have a much more subtle nuanced sense of
that character and therefore improve the
story so the problem you always face
when you're trying to innovate if you
want to get the new you have to figure
out how to unleash the ideas of the
individual but if you want to get the
useful you have to figure out how to
harness those ideas into a solution that
is really you know going to solve a
problem that the group has a collective
problem so how do you get that
unleashing and that harnessing to happen
is what we were trying to look at and so
that's what the process and I'll talk
about some paradoxes that are really
embedded in that unleashing and harness
harnessing process that really are at
the heart of leading innovation so this
process of trying to figure out how to
do this time and time again is what we
wanted to understand what was it how did
about what he was doing that led him to
create an organization that could do
that and what we ended up realizing as
we look through our data is that no
matter what kind of organization we were
looking at whether it was an Islamic
bank in Dubai or a luxury brand in Korea
all of these organizations had three
capabilities and they are organizational
capabilities and I want to tell you a
little bit about about each the first
one is the creative abrasion this
capability is about how you actually
engage in debate in discourse to create
a marketplace of ideas and what these
organizations understand is that you do
not get innovation without diversity and
conflict those are really critical
ingredients for any innovation so what
you see in these organizations is that
they actually amplify difference they
don't minimize it because that
difference or those differences are
again the resource you're going to rely
on to figure out an innovative solution
to some problem you're trying to solve
so what they do again is you might do
brainstorming to get them but in the end
you actually want to have heated debate
and it has to be constructive and that's
not easy so that creative abrasion is
how you begin to unleash those ideas the
second thing you need to do is create a
Vaghela ting and this is about how you
refine that portfolio of ideas that
you've come up with and figure out which
ones you should pursue and here this is
very much like what you see with design
thinking some combination of you know
discovery driven learning where you act
your way to an answer you don't plan
your way to an answer so what you see in
these organizations is one of them told
us is we run experiments we don't run
pilots if you want a pilot and it
doesn't work then something was wrong or
someone failed
there's too much political stuff around
it when you run an experiment you run it
to learn so if you get you know an
outcome that's not quote the right
outcome
there's no right outcome you've learned
from it you take that information and
you try again you experiment again so
the second capability is this creative
agility being able to do those
experiments really pay attention to the
feedback take it seriously and make the
necessary adjustments and then the final
one is create a resolution and this is
about the fact that as you all know and
I'm sure have experienced most
innovations are not
brand-new very dangerous to say you've
discovered something that no one's
discovered before because someone
probably has discovered some version of
it most innovations are actually
combinations of old ideas or old ideas
reconfigured to solve new problems so
you have to have a way of doing
decision-making that will allow you to
do both and as opposed to either other
either/or thinking so if people's ideas
come out instead of one person having to
win you make decisions in a way that you
can combine them so what you do see in
these organizations is that people are
not willing to go along to get along not
in the least
in fact they will not compromise because
that is the easier path they will also
not let one group or individual dominate
so they don't let the people who are
higher in the hierarchy dominate and
they don't let the experts dominate and
I will tell you that expert piece is
actually one of the more complicated
parts of the process how do you keep if
you will the experts from dominating
when in fact you're trying to make a
decision about which way to go so these
are three capabilities that we saw in
all of these organizations creative
abrasion creative agility and then
creative resolution and so when you
build these capabilities this is what
allows you actually to engage in the
innovative process not this gentleman I
don't think most of you would recognize
either but you probably on some level
know about him I think he was employing
number eight or nine bill two in Google
and he was the senior vice president of
engineering at Google and so built the
website and you know that we all it
works pretty well
very rarely goes down 24/7 he's really
good at what he does and I do remember
as a person who's slightly older I was
very happy to see when I went to look at
his group you know everybody wasn't
necessarily young and playing volleyball
they either had gray hair or they were
bald and I appreciated that so Google
did not play when they've tried to
figure out who should build their
website they actually went to Bell Labs
he was one of the finest leader at Bell
Labs he brought over a team added some
people to it to build that website we
looked at them as they were trying to
take on Gmail and youtubes we like to
look at organizations over time and as
you know better than I do that the
storage demands for YouTube or Gmail is
very different than
search and so we were very curious to
see how are they gonna respond to that
and so for sure I was really curious as
a you know professor I was very
interested to see how they're gonna put
this team together to come up with what
to do about this well bill did nothing
he sort of didn't choose a team and said
he said let's just watch spontaneously
and see what comes up and what came up
were two different approaches to how
they respond to Gmail and YouTube one
was somewhat more evolutionary the other
more revolutionary and these two teams
just emerged and so bill said you know
what we're going to let these teams play
out their point of view and he allowed
them to work on these their models or
their solutions if you will or potential
solutions for two years full time and as
he said they were working at breakneck
speed again to remind us how hard it is
actually do breakthrough kind of work
and what he basically did is allowed two
parallel experiments to be run and the
role of the leader in all of that was to
make sure they were honest he said the
leaders role is to inject honesty into
their process and also to make sure that
they debate and so what they were
encouraged to do again would not
surprise you was to build their
prototypes pretty quickly and to test
her bump-up was the word he used their
prototypes up against different users
the next thing that Google wanted to do
the group that would have to get up in
the middle of the night if the web site
you know went down etc so that they
could discover for themselves the
strengths and weaknesses of their
particular approach now while this was
happening the engineers were complaining
because Google actually had a shortage
of engineering talent and they said you
just need to pick or you need to get the
team that's the best team and you need
to let them go at it he said no leave
well enough alone just do the discovery
process eventually a lot of data sort of
coming in about which one's working
better or not as well as the websites
getting a little wobbly are gonna be a
problem so they have to make a choice
and this is the moment he said this is
really critical when you're a leader
because one solution was going to be
selected and one wasn't and so he did
that but in doing that he said this is
where social architecture comes in as a
leader you got to make sure that the
group that quote loses gets adopted by
the new group that is doing the next
generation work so you don't
what they have learned and they feel
like they've made a contribution because
they truly have it's not just perception
so the whole process was to get some of
the members of quote the losing team to
be adopted by the new team that was
working on the next big thing and that
happened very seamlessly and when that
next big thing came out those those
people saw their work so he almost
always did things by having these
parallel experiments run making sure you
don't lose the learning because frankly
most innovations don't work and you've
increased your probability by 2e things
and so that might work when you have two
teams working at it and though many
people might do that is very inefficient
in his mind
extremely efficient extremely efficient
way to actually get done what
innovations need to happen and they
pretty much did most of their innovation
that way having these parallel teams
running experiments and his role again
was to make sure they inject honesty
that they're really paying attention to
the feedback they're getting when they
test their prototypes and moving it
forward so that was the way just to
illustrate the process they went through
you could see the kind of the creative
abrasion that happened there a little
bit of the a lot of the agility and then
the resolution when you combine these
things different combinations get used
in different generations along the way
so what this person told us one of the
engineers was most most adamant that you
know Bill was wasting wasting time and
energy here by doing things this way he
said when he when he wouldn't I finish
this process he said you know what I've
learned is I think Bill's right first
off you need to keep these teams at a
sort of a human scale and if he had made
those two teams become one team they
would not have focused on what's the
best what's the right answer if you will
the better answer
they would have been trying to prove who
was the winner and who was the loser
they would not have been able to work
constructively because they were so
passionate about their particular
approach so for him going back to yes
you need diversity and conflict some
conflicts going to be healthy others
people aren't going to be able to see it
not at that point anyway and better to
keep them separate and run the
experiments and make sure you don't lose
the learning so what we actually did see
about these leaders and Bill was one of
the ones who told us this bill said to
us he said you know I I'm and he I don't
really read
on leadership because when I read books
on leadership they actually sort of just
depress me because in the first page it
says you're supposed to have a vision or
an answer he said the only reason I took
this job at Google is I had no vision I
had no answer that's what gets me up
every morning so I guess I don't lead
these books aren't relevant and Linda
isn't it the case if you're trying to do
something that's cutting-edge and
breakthrough you have no vision I mean
what how does this work so we had about
four leaders sort of say to us this
doesn't work so well when I think about
when I read about leadership because
that doesn't fit what I do so I was
saying to Amy I ended up having to write
being the boss with Kent because then
the models of leadership we had were not
fitting what we were discovering as we
were collecting the data for this
research and so what these individuals
did or how they thought about what
leadership was about is they did not see
themselves let me just skip through
these pieces don't think we they did not
see themselves as being the visionary
who created a vision communicated that
vision and inspired others to want to
fulfill that vision that's not how they
saw their role I will tell you that
every person we studied was a visionary
they definitely were visionaries and it
maybe to be credible in some of the
worlds they lived and if you're not a
visionary yourself people don't want to
play with you so I don't know the answer
to that it's partly because of the way
we slip we selected these individuals
having said that I also want to say
there is very much a place for visionary
leadership that it really is about
leading change but it is not about
leading innovation because if you are
trying to get people to innovate what
you really need to focus on is how do
you create a context in which people
will be willing and able to innovate
because innovation is a journey it's a
collaborative kind of problem-solving
that indeed involves this discovery
driven learning with lots of missteps
lots of even failures and the other part
of it is these combination of ideas and
the final thing that we have to remember
about innovation is it's very
exhilarating work to do but it's also
very can be very demanding debilitating
an emotionally complicated work to do
it's intellectually complicated and it's
emotionally complicated so I want to
tell you one story about Greg my
co-author
from Pixar Greg he we did put this in
the book who he said I can't believe
we're gonna put this in the book but
anyway we did because it's so central to
to what actually happened the history of
Pixar and also to understanding the
story so Greg was the head of systems at
Pixar and you all have read about Steve
Jobs of course and obviously he's pretty
good at what he does if Steve asked him
to go over and take on that role at
Pixar
well they had four or five depending on
how you want to counted redundant
systems for making sure they didn't lose
a movie another storage problem I didn't
realize storage was so hard until I got
into this and now I know how hard
storage is but anyway they lost Toy
Story 2 so Toy Story they lost Toy Story
not Toy Story 2 they had Toy Story 2
they lost Toy Story even though they had
these 4 or 5 redundant systems and you
know if you lose it if it's no longer to
be found on storage it does not exist
because these movies are numbers right
so Greg they look and they cannot find
it anywhere because of quote a perfect
storm there was a problem that maybe you
all heard about at the time - we're
going back in history a bit there was a
problem that no one realized existed in
the way you thought about creating these
redundant systems and they discovered it
so Toy Story 2 was toys Toy Story is
gone this is not a good thing he has to
go tell ed that they cannot find Toy
Story so he goes to tell Edie cannot
find Toy Story it is not here and it
turns out after they did a post-mortem
there was only one human error in the
whole process at the very end the last
copy the port the four other four just
went even though they were doing the
best the way you were supposed to do it
right yes I want you to have nightmares
tonight anyway so what was uh what what
happened was he went to Ed and he said
it's gone can't find it so Ed's first
comment to him was this must be a really
hard problem if you've lost that movie
because you are really good I had no
idea that we were that far out on the
cutting edge and it is not good this is
not the kind of failure you want this is
bad failure right I had no idea we were
there we have to go tell Steve so they
went to tell Steve that they had lost
Toy Story and you can only imagine and
what Steve's first words were this must
be a really hard problem if you
toy story I had no idea we were out
there on the cutting edge like that that
was his first reaction now interestingly
enough before we could hear his second
one they were able to say he had the
same reaction is Ed interesting just
very similar reaction who you all are
really good this how do we lose this
movie they were able to say we found it
and the reason they were able to say
they found it was because of the culture
of the place the willingness they want
to go back to that so they found it
because it turned out there was a woman
who was on maternity leave and she had
wanted to still play and do the movie
right so they paid ninety thousand
dollars to let her have a computer at
home because that's what it costs to
have a computer at her home that would
actually be able to deal with you know a
Toy Story the kind of data you needed
she was on maternity leave and busy with
her baby and didn't realize they were
looking for the movie at some point she
actually went to the computer and his
cell and saw that the movie was there
she said oh you're looking for the movie
I have a copy now if you know anything
about movies and Studios movies don't
leave the grounds right well it Pixar
everybody sees the movie anybody who's
there is allowed to see the movies send
comments to the director they don't all
have permission to take it off the
grounds but indeed she had the movie so
they were able to say to Steve guess
what what we found it and as a
consequence of that when you look at the
credits of movies compare the credits
are very long at Pixar because they
believe that you should be generous with
credit but listed on there you may not
recognize it are the names of babies
born during a movie and now you know why
okay because it takes the village is
what they said to include the babies
that are about to be born to make one of
those movies really get made and when
they actually gave out the bonuses for
that movie as someone had said to Steve
Jobs we should give a bonus to the
people that did Toy Story and he said no
we should not give a bonus to those
people we need to give a bonus to
everybody in the studio the person who
made the hamburgers to the director they
all deserve it and what everybody got
was I believe 13 weeks times whatever
their salary was because again everybody
has a slice of genius they're not all
equal but everybody had a contribution
to make so therefore Steve handed out to
everybody 12 or 13 times whatever their
salary was because everybody matter to
the making of that movie so that's the
kind of culture
they want to build to make sure people
are willing to do this and embed it in
the process of unleashing and harnessing
and I just wanna I'm not going to talk
through all of these things and we can
come back to it with your questions but
those first two paradoxes have to do
with creative abrasion and one of the
things I do want to just plan on about
those first two is if you don't provide
enough support or psychological safety
in the environment people will not share
their ideas particularly when they're
working with other really really
talented people one of the challenges
you have at a place like Pixar or even
Google is you have really really capable
people how do you get then the new
person who's coming in who's just
starting to learn how to animate to
actually tell a John Lasseter how he
actually feels about what's been done
how do you create that creative abrasion
unless there's a lot of psychological
safety or support you also need to have
the confrontation the next two are about
these are about agility and these two
are about decision-making so in these
organizations decision-making is very
clear who in the end gets to make the
decision but it's relatively inclusive
and patient so again what you see is
that we allow people to have input a lot
of input everybody really knows who's
going to make the decisions in the end
but again and we're going to be patient
or gonna let you go for two years if you
will at Google eventually it's going to
become urgent and guess what Bill's
gonna step up and say now we make the
decision it's going to happen and he's
going to do in a very top-down way
because it needs to go on so again
you're trying to unleash and harness and
you're constantly recalibrating across
these as you're trying to think about
exercising those capabilities so I don't
want to these little people move because
you realize Greg is an animator this is
supposed to move more than this I've
taken out most of the movement did you
see how I'm a professor who writes in
words he thinks in pictures but anyway
those little people his people move much
more than mine I will tell you I'm not
going to this is about the community to
sense the kind of culture so the
capabilities are the process you need to
be able to do this is the kind of
culture you need to build to allow for
people to engage in those capabilities
and we called it a community culture
because fundamentally people feel like
they are a part of the community they
care about the collective and at the
heart of it is some sense of purpose and
if you don't have this sense of purpose
it's very hard for people to be willing
to do this work and why should I bother
unless I really care about the purpose
so the person that we studied who makes
luxury bat bags in Korea for instance
she wants you to pay a lot of money for
them one of the things that she talks
about though is that the reason why she
went into the luxury brand business is
that Asian women are the market that
many many companies hope to get to buy
these goods and she felt it was really a
problem that Asian women weren't in the
business because luxury becomes how you
define yourself and she felt it was
important to have an Asian woman with an
it with a different sensibility in that
business to help as you will here's you
know as China etc as that was all
happening that there was a voice of the
Asian woman in the process and when she
that is what her business is about and
actually she has a very large foundation
that's connected to the business as well
but one of the things that's interesting
about this purpose is okay that's mrs.
Kim so as I went to ask other people you
know how they and and mrs. Kim in Korea
Chairman chairperson Kim as they called
her it's a very different culture people
wouldn't even sit they stand when she's
speaking and it's but she had to figure
out how to create this kind of culture
so she does a lot of business on
airplanes when they have no choice but
to sit next to her that's a different
ways to break down break down what goes
on here and I must say when I
interviewed some of the Brits and
Italian men who worked for her etc I
said what do you feel about this purpose
stuff you know I thought that was
nonsense I just wanted to work with her
cuz she knows how to build brands but
you know what as I've been in this
company for a while this purpose really
doesn't matter and it really is
affecting how I'm making choices about
doing the business and there's a culture
that gets built I don't think you'd be
surprised by these values all of these
organizations in very different cultures
but they all on some level have these
values the bold ambition they all have
appetites that are much bigger than
their capabilities so they do not value
risk and they do not value failure I
just want to point that out because they
when you have bold ambition you're going
to take risks and you're going to have
some failures but that's not that's not
valued per se
very deep sense over
responsibilities these are some of the
rules about how you're supposed to
interact
these are easy words to say but
difficult to live one of the most
interesting ones that here that I just
want to mention is that one of the most
important roles of a leader they think
is to make sure that the minority voice
gets heard and interestingly enough the
other project as I said I work on
globalization but one of the other if
you will leaders that I've sort of been
studying was Nelson Mandela who I did
have the privilege of meeting because
I'm you know he's a social revolutionary
as far as I'm concerned very much also
agrees with these notions of leadership
but one of the things that he talked a
whole lot about is making sure that
minority voice is heard and if you look
at actually how they even went through
their constitution process very very
interesting process that he thought
about and what his role as the leader
was in helping with that but this issue
of of trust and respect even for people
who you know obviously were quote your
enemy or maybe didn't treat you so well
was one of the things about him as a
leader that actually made a huge
difference in what they were able to
come up with the other piece that we
didn't see right away is there are also
rules about how you're supposed to think
about problems and this is actually
quite important when you have diverse
people trying to struggle with something
but we have some rules about how we
think that we're supposed to be very
holistic in our approach and we're
supposed to be data-driven and what that
really means is you may not have data to
prove your point of view but you need to
be able to you have to be able to admit
to people that you have no data it's
your gut you just tell people what's
your evidence for what you're believing
about X Y Z and those rules actually
help it make it much easier for us to
get through certain debates that we need
to have about things and also make sure
that when we're looking at the results
of experiments we don't reject those
results and say oh that was the wrong
experiment etc so there were rules about
that just then once you do that you do
get that sense of direction because I
think people worry well if you don't
have purpose is different than vision
it's not about where we're going
purpose is about who we are it's about
our collective identity which is a
different different task I just wanted
to tell you this this man I met when he
was at Fiat he was the CEO of Fiat
when they did the rejuvenation of the
Fiat 500 he then went to Volkswagen and
he was the chief marketing officer of
all nine brands very interesting job as
well as the marketing officer for the
Volkswagen brand he's now the head of
sales and marketing for Aldi
so we've studied him in all of those
different contexts again to see if we
see is it him
if that's sort of making the difference
and this is Luca an Italian who had to
learn German very quickly when he went
to Volkswagen because that is the
official language of Volkswagen and one
of the things he did he gave the Germans
a little bit of a scare this is in and
it's marvel I mean it obviously
Volkswagens quite a fine company that's
Lucca standing here and this is his
first meeting of the hundred and
fifty-three marketing professionals from
around the world they'd never come
together and he wanted them you can't
teach people or have people think their
way into being different you have to
force them to act their way into being
different so he used space has a lot of
the people we said need to do that and
so this is one of their first sort of
strategy meetings and I'm not I use
PowerPoint all the time so I'm not being
negative but they were not allowed to
bring any presentations to this meeting
and as you'll see there are no chairs so
this was a little confusing
it's very choreographed but it's these
are their laboratories so instead of if
you will having sort of strategy
meetings per se they now have
laboratories which would not maybe be so
and so confusing to you and they do work
in a very different way because he
wanted them to get comfortable he wanted
to give them positive shocks to behave
very differently and how they began to
think about things and in different
combinations and this is one of the ways
he used to break down hierarchy and get
people to engage in different ways so
the other thing in terms of purpose that
became very important you have to go
back to the DNA of a company often to
figure out what that purpose can be and
at Volkswagen it really is if you know
the people's car so what they have
decided their battleground for
innovation is really around
sustainability it's this fundamentally
it's actually Volkswagens even owned
partly by the government it's very much
at that kind of model so they ended up
think blue is their sustainability model
and his problem is being the head of
marketing and sales is that at full
swag and it was the engineers who were
the creatives or the innovators not
marketing and sales people but he said
you cannot have an innovative brand
unless marketing and sales are also
innovative brands are built from the
inside out
so part of the dilemma was to show them
that they also were innovators right
again why you need to have that broader
definition of what innovation is about
this man is a fun very fun person he was
the CEO of something called HCL
Technologies and some of you may know
HCL Technologies you do all too well do
you do you work with them
actually no ha ha
so yes so do you know of a neat so
vineet was he was at the time when he
was appointed CEO he was a very young
CEO particularly for India and he was
appointed by one of the founders so HCl
was the technology company that actually
started the computer business in India
and they ended up by 2005 being number
five and about to become irrelevant even
though they founded the business and we
know we all worry about this kind of
thing and so he was asked by one of the
founders to turn around HCl and when you
look at the turnaround that visionary
leadership you see very much in terms of
the change process that they went
through what he tried to create at the
end of it was a different kind of model
of how they would think about leadership
and so vineet one of the these are his
maybe you know some of these people I
don't know they may be a little older
than this picture but he said looking at
the demographics of India what we need
to be able to do is we have to turn over
the growth of the company to these
people this is the future of the company
so we at in as leaders must recast our
notion of what leadership is about it
can't be about setting direction and
making sure people don't deviate from it
which is fundamentally what they had
been taught leadership was about and in
India again pretty hierarchical they
needed to do something different and he
talked about quote inverting the pyramid
and this is one of their pictures and
what you're doing when you invert the
pyramid is you unleash the power of the
many by loosening the string hold of the
few and you know who the few are here so
many people did leave but many people
stayed other people came
it's complicated process that they've
gone through here to try to create a
different way of thinking about
leadership but he said we need to
operate kind of like the googles and the
Pixar's and the whatever's and he
visited those places with me we
introduced our leaders to each other
again no company is perfect but these
are the kinds of results that they
obviously got from the shifts so they're
real they're financial one of the things
that happened over time in this
organization in terms of trying to be
more innovative is they've ended up and
this is what we're studying right now
they ended up figuring out a way of what
they call business finance so they can
show every individual employee who's
working with a client how much money
their work has actually how much they've
helped that client financially with what
they're doing
that meant creating a very different way
of keeping track of the finances to be
able to do this and each individual up
on the website it will tell them what
has been your contribution to this
particular client because what you're
supposed to do now is go quote beyond
the contract you must meet the contract
which I need to do that because
otherwise we're not going to be hired
again that's what we're supposed to do
but if you don't go beyond the contract
this is beyond for this individual then
you haven't really added value to your
customer and that's what you need to do
so in part without walking through all
the pieces of the puzzle right now in
terms of the culture shift and the
change of leadership this is what
they've been driving toward and indeed
they're still working on that I'm going
to stop right now I'm gonna skip this
one as we've been talking about these
ecosystems you all can have all these
slides there's some questions for you to
think about here about you know your for
your particular team what's going on
what I want to do now is just end with
this last piece about the leadership
part of it because I think this is the
part that's a really tricky one and
again I don't think it's accidental that
you maybe don't recognize Edie because
what you do see about these leaders is
that they understand that leadership is
more about being the person who sets the
stage and the person as opposed to the
person who performs on the stage when
you're really really talented yourself
it is not easy to be the stage setter as
opposed to the performer and one of the
real challenges you have and actually
Nelson Mandela talked a lot about this
is how do you create space for other
people when you can take up all the
space
yourself that's really one of the
dilemmas I think that many other leaders
had so I'd like to just end with that
that leadership thought and take your
questions and we can go in any direction
you'd like was that did that give you an
overview of what the basic story is
makes sense yep yes so when you
interviewed earlier how do you actually
decide is because their contribution to
make the company more data or they just
happen to inherit a good people and good
environment so I actually this is
terrible for me to say but anyway I did
I attended the University of Chicago so
I do know about statistics I am an
ethnographer and I have definitely
sampled on the dependent variable right
so I'm very aware of that as opposed to
doing the comparison one of the things
that I try to do is to study people over
time so as I described Luca I've
actually seen him in three or four
different contexts over time I can't
prove it because I am an ethnographer
and tell you that so I would say that
what we did to do this is we went
through our if you will rolodexes in
some ways and said introduce us to we
said who are some of the leaders that
everybody on would say are really really
innovative created these organizations
have been very innovative or ones that
we see are trying to change so when we
met the neat it was when he first
started to take over and try to change
this company into an innovative company
the thing about IDI which has been
interesting besides you know obviously
they've survived and I don't mean it in
a negative way but they've been acquired
by Disney when I met them they weren't
acquired they've gone through a lot of
change he's also gone to Disney and been
able to help turn around Disney
animation so I don't have proof but I
think that because we've looked at them
over we actually committed to collecting
data for about 10 years just to see
right and I think everything is
complicated so we still watch to see
what's going on here right
but I I can't you know I don't have the
numbers for you in that sense yes thank
you so a lot of your information is
about leading top yes right the story
change at all when you start talking
about
trying to show leadership from in the
middle of an organization versus of the
top it so quick answer it the process
and what they're up to is the same so
one of the people we studied was a
relatively middle a middle manager in a
company I act this is a company that
actually told us we could not write
about them the CEO either because they
don't pull out individuals because they
have such a collective notion this is a
manufacturing company that you have many
of their products so the in your home I
was really disappointed me that we
couldn't write about them but one of the
things that I think happens a lot that
we which is not so much a part of the
story I just told you which is the story
and being the boss is how you manage
your network so if you're in the middle
how you manage up and how you manage
across is critical it's true and when
you're at the more senior as well but
that's a big piece of the story so I
must confess when we wrote being the
being the boss the second imperative of
leadership is managing relationships
with people over whom you have no formal
authority which actually these books
don't completely gel this way but that's
a bigger they do that and one person her
boss would do you know your your this is
career-ending for you if this doesn't
work but she thought guess what it it's
going to work and if I do it your way
it's certainly not gonna work because
we're not going to innovate enough but
that managing up piece is critical is
that but the actual capabilities and the
kind of culture but they build a
subculture because that subculture
doesn't fit the culture around them
managing that is really very tricky
right which in the writer if it's if
it's the general counsel of Pfizer she
actually was building her ich was an
ecosystem of the lawyers they would move
to something called the Pfizer legal
alliance 19 firms doing 75% of the work
being paid a fixed cost instead of
billable hours and trying to create
those competitors to be in a community
with that was one of the ecosystems we
looked at i mean having to manage
relationships with the whole company
she's pretty senior the other parts of
the company didn't want you know you've
picked the 19 not my favorite law firm
that i like to work with et cetera so
she also it's not but even the very
senior people don't have to manage the
network they do I don't want to imply
that but for sure
or you don't you know you're not the CEO
so you got to make sure you got these
other people who have to buy in yes okay
he was hoping that she could actually
speak to her experience at Microsoft as
being an innovation leader and then the
second question is if you're not
considered a visionary yeah well I don't
if you're not considered a visionary
therefore no one will allow you to do it
I think you what the person I'm talking
about another person that I actually is
not in this study let me go to a
different person but someone I've
actually studied as I said this has been
a passion since day one so the first
case I ever wrote at the Harvard
Business School because I'm very
intelligent
was about this you'll see what I mean by
this was a woman about a woman named
Suzanne to pass and I don't know if you
know who she is but she was responsible
for taking care of Michael Jackson and
so she was doing Motown 25 and helping
him with the moonwalk and that was the
first research project I did because I
figured if I'm gonna be a professor I
may as well have fun right this is out
so my first case I'm sitting next to
Stevie Wonder and Smokey Robinson and
Eric Clapton comes in to play music with
them and I knew I had picked the right
job right that's how smart I am
so ever since way back then I've always
studied people and worked and done
consulting with people who work with
really really creative innovative Souls
right so that that's this has been a
passion so I again it's something I've
actually been looking at informed some
former fashion for a really long time
and I think in that context I know as
Diane here and yes oh oh my friend back
here yes we were discussing yes so I
think that you want to answer that they
want you to
so you have a fan out in them I think
you could not really said that that he'd
consider is gonna be an absolute leader
in this in this model so I think the
dominant Christiano Suzuki by Christiano
oh okay and he's the one who directed a
TED talk o environment a culture where
they bring people together and have
people heard regardless of where they
sat in my position and I'm either
question about how you manage them from
the middle is quite know that not
regarding people it's not about who is
the person at the top of your chart it's
about wearing the I'm not sure that's
what Christiano is well I think you know
the visionary piece I wasn't saying I
got a little bit off but I would say
that when I mentioned the thing about
Suzanne I've actually the reason I bring
this up is I've always studied people
who who've been done very innovative or
creative things or worked with very
creative people and extreme I'm actually
very interested in you work with
extremely talented people because
there's a theory that in in my colleague
who's two doors down for me writes about
you don't want to have too many cooks in
the kitchen right the problem you only
want to have and I mean II D capital
just laughs when he reads that he's like
you got to have a ton of cooks in the
kitchen if you're trying to do
breakthrough stuff you have to learn how
to get those cooks to cook together
right that's the key and how you carry
yourself and behave is a part of getting
them to do that so one of the people I
studied going back on this isn't before
the study was not considered a visionary
not a very good leader or any of those
things and did this and partly the
problem is you don't stand out
necessarily so she you and she said you
know what it's gonna work and I'm gonna
get credit in the end but you have to be
comfortable with that and people didn't
recognize how visionary she actually was
about a whole bunch of stuff her team
did but her bosses and others didn't so
I don't know that you know they're there
the usual suspect and mrs. Kim most of
her company is actually divorced women
our larger number over the
we'll work there who in Korea don't
really have much standing and again
people that you wouldn't see as being
very innovative I mean a couple of they
have you know Golden Week you all
probably know about they have beat Prada
and Louie Vuitton many weeks this little
company in in China with certain things
so I think that they're often the last
part of our book is about Invisibles
stylistic Invisibles demographic
Invisibles and you know where does
talent who has a slice of genius i think
that what you do see about these leaders
is they're very generous and who they
see is being able to contribute frankly
but if you're not seen as a visionary it
is more complicated you don't get those
assignments right but you if you do your
work in a particular way people see and
are attracted to work with you and her
group grew over time this one who wasn't
seeing that way and really ended up
being quite quite successful yes
creative abrasion these leaders keep the
aberration and those discussions the
debate creative as opposed to just
abrasive that's a very long answer
question one of the things one goes back
to the to be teeth you really do need to
have the culture in part right so if you
are in an environment where we do trust
each other what trust means in this
model is we assume everybody is
well-intentioned you just assume it now
if you could assume that just imagine
how much energy that releases right and
if you behave in ways that you're not
assuming that people are
well-intentioned someone the boss is
gonna the leader or boss is gonna say to
you guess what get with the program it
said so that makes it much easier right
if you assume everyone's well intended
and people will comment or help them
will point out they're not they will
write say these leaders and one of the
times they actually are most likely to
intervene is when you violate one of the
rules of engagement and the other thing
is if you so that but that's only I mean
it's it's not easy the other thing is
you've got to keep the abrasion alive
right because after you get to know each
other really well then you might not
abrade as much so one of the things I'm
just using Pixar in part because we know
it's a bit in some level is they do know
when you need to bring in new people
when you actually need to mix a new P
in that brain trust because you all
become too alike in your thinking so the
leaders are very actively encouraging or
even when I asked a bill at Google what
advice would you give to new leaders he
gave me two pieces of advice to give you
one is assume you're leading a volunteer
organization they are volunteers do not
do not kid yourself people who are
talented and passionate if they're with
you they are volunteering and you need
to treat them accordingly the second
thing is remember that no one wants to
follow you to the Future they want to
co-create the future with you it's very
different and then hey that's what you
need to think about and guess what when
you hire people if they don't argue with
you don't hire them you want someone who
will argue with you on a job interview
and the final piece of advice he gets
gave was keep it fuzzy sometimes you
need to be vague and fuzzy so one of the
things that I know the neat had a lot of
trouble doing when he decided you'd want
to be vague and fuzzy but he decided
that he was answering too many questions
he became very transparent there's a lot
of transparency in these organizations
to create trust he became he had a you
and I where you could ride into the CEO
and he would answer you you all know
that sort of thing finally one day he
said you know what I'm falling into the
trap myself so he now has something
called my problems these are the things
that I didn't know how to do this week
now mind you it's all that he's gonna do
everything you say when you write back
to but this is what I had no idea about
what are your thoughts and so at first
when they all got this they're like what
do you mean the look the CEO has
something called my problems on the
website and he sends those he said it
was it was his favorite email to do or
it wasn't he does these are my problems
so so and so he had my problems and then
you and I which was sort of yours you
know there's a whole set of rules about
how those had to be answered etc but he
said I've fallen into the same trap
myself and obviously we all have
different levels of expertise slices etc
but let me let me push this back on
people I have to tell you which is hard
for if you will the followers to move
into these ways as it is for the leader
sometimes because it does require you
taking on a lot of responsibility and
accountability for your work so there's
a tug-of-war I think that can happen in
this process yes sir
and we talked about creative resolution
uh-huh because that's the hardest acting
of the tree yes particularly in groups
like Microsoft with a lot of creative
people they're doing the aberration
create vibrations much more easy to
create yes yes one team will feel that
the lost art and they either leave or go
to some other group go to some other
company can you give some more examples
where do you work and how does well it
does really work it is very difficult
work as I said these I think the thing
that about it and I'm not trying to
avoid your question is these are
emotionally charged situations which is
what you all are talking about because
you actually care about it right it's
not like something you want to give in
on easily that's that's the part of the
challenge here and I want to tell you as
I said we've looked at many people like
pentagram I don't know how many people
know pentagram is a very high-end design
come these are very talented people who
talk about putting their soul on the
line when they're designed the man who
designed the harley-davidson museum you
know these are he talked about what it
feels like to be in a conflict with his
colleagues about a decision that they're
trying to make I think the why what I've
tried to figure out is leaders are more
made than born that's what the research
tells us but what is it about these
leaders that allow them to be able to
tolerate and absorb a lot of that
negativity and make it still stay
constructive when the rest of us would
fall apart right or not know what to do
and amplify these differences and I I
don't I think there's partly there is a
bit of a constitution or something
they've learned about it you can get to
the other side and I as I said this
culture is an important piece of it what
I guess we saw in these organizations
it's because they know it's usually a
combination and they do more I was spent
a day with Roger Martin who said he's
opposable thinking right so I'm trying
to figure out how do you help people do
a poseable thinking and actually a
poseable decision-making I have to go
spend another date with him he told me
he's gonna show me the techniques they
use so then I'll give me an email I'll
send you what he he sent what I what I
learned but I think what you see in that
process is they don't assume that one
group is supposed to win right so and
that the learning the thing is that you
cannot lose the work if I've worked for
two years on something week
not afford to lose that work first of
all it's just too valuable the knowledge
and if you're in a place where you know
that knowledge is still respected and is
actually utilized and frankly you've
gone through a discovery driven learning
process where you've seen the
limitations yourself right no one else
pointed them out to you bill didn't say
by the way it doesn't work you had a
prototype and you tested it and he's
just asked you well how did it work here
there and the other there is an
intellectual honesty that you come back
to and I really it is it does come
together I think to pull one piece of
this out it's very difficult for me to
give this talk in some ways is tricky
because it is about bringing those
pieces together does that make sense to
you but I am I really have our did spend
one day up in Toronto I'm going back and
I'm going to I'm very curious to see how
you help people really work with the
poseable thinking more actively so I can
give you a more precise answer and I'm
on the website if you email me about six
months I might have something to let
them write writing up about that
seriously yep yes yep okay yes sure well
I'll make it try making a long one okay
the book is targeted these are
properties that companies that are
innovative have in common and yet most
of those companies start with an initial
spark and I personally am fascinated
where the spark comes from but it's uses
focus once you have the spark will help
you Kindle it and make it sustainable
for example John Lasseter mm-hmm at
Disney Android you could be argued
Microsoft 2013 very similar to Disney
1983 oh that was a great of a version
you know just the regeneration yeah when
you got kicked out all right
yeah yeah no no that's this figurehead
right I loved you saying visionaries
influence change but sustainable leaders
for innovation but most of this has the
spark comes from when you're showing the
Pixar map
yeah and it's 200 people take some three
years but people like John Lasseter
originally that's just as mindmap
because he was doing the shading and the
modeling of the characters and when the
initial spark is first formed so when
people are reading your book cuz they're
a company and they want to invest in
innovation but they up have a spark just
creating a culture doesn't mean the
spark is going to Jenna
priori if Isis challenge mm-hmm
where does it start it may be going back
to you so there are a couple things that
I I wouldn't claim to know more than I
know just we Claire right because I was
described but that's why I took the time
to tell you how we do the data I
actually went in fact I was really was
fun
Eric Eric Schmidt has a VC firm so I
went to speak to his portfolio managers
who are these are new companies right
about what we saw here and they and many
of them were restored wait a minute I'm
the visionary right so we were talking
about how the hell they think about
building their organizations over time I
think as I said all the people I studied
are visionaries they really are I mean
they're they're very and I and they're
very talented individuals so I don't
know that I haven't studied a situation
where you haven't had that and it's you
know and I cuz I haven't seen it so I
don't know the answer to your question
so IDI Catmull is the founder of Pixar
right but the three of them Steve Jobs
Edie
and John they actually as a collective
ran that organization for many years and
it was they think it was very important
that the three of them it wasn't just a
single individual who actually but when
you ask people even though you just
brought up John you know wise Pixar the
way Pixar is they tell you Ed you
mentioned John right so I just want to
it's an interesting sort of deal there
but there's nothing particularly and I
think you I find ed very charismatic
personally I think though that most you
know he's most people probably wouldn't
actually number I don't think you'd find
Bill charismatic so the notion of what
these how these people carry themselves
and what they're like
they're not necessarily people you would
notice III or in there they're not in
the model of the charismatic I mean
Nelson Mandela is charismatic but I
don't know if you but if you actually
ask the people who are with him there
were many many people who are more
charismatic than him they would tell you
right who were in that movement so and
I've been looking so I don't know what
to tell you whether you can start it but
what I do see in these organizations is
these people are always described as
very demanding and very generous and
they're very generous people so they
assume that everybody has a slice of
genius right that's a big assumption
right maybe a next communites you want
me to do
what's up do you want me to waiters will
come from in the first time the abrasion
abrasion the actual step marks that then
gets cultivated as opposed to these
people okay it's a collective act I
don't mean some of them are that I dunno
the founder of HCl Shiv I did meet one
of the founders there were five of them
I studied eBay almost since its
inception and eBay Germany in particular
is a piece that we wrote about some what
they acquired it very early in its life
and studied it over time so I don't know
you know I mean the entrepreneur you
have to have that commitment to get that
done but I don't I don't know I see what
you're asking I don't the egg and
chicken problem here yeah oh well last
thing I will say and then I have to let
you go is it actually a number of the
leaders told me they learned to lead
this way once they realize that
lightning doesn't strike twice
necessarily right
so actually vineet said I used to be
command and control etc but when I
understood that we needed to innovate
time and again it wasn't just about me
then I needed to change my mindset about
leadership so he learned it Luca also
described learning it actually I would I
just said and actually there's a one of
the other leader ami described learning
it and she's a litigator and so believe
me right
this was not a easy but she gets it to
the point that if you come to her house
for dinner she makes sure that she sits
in the low-power spot very very aware of
role modeling exactly what needs to
happen here you know but she's obviously
a litigator who will take you to court
and make sure she wins if she's in that
courtroom but when she's leading behaves
in a very different way so learned it
right yep yes I need I need to the go
I'll stick around buddy to let you all
go can I take this last question quietly
okay thank you yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
