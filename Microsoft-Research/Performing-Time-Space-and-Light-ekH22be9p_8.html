you
so it's my pleasure to introduce several
cassinelli Aurora when I met in 2005
right it's a graph and then we did this
trip to Paris know about level and benko
and I had a good time they're showing
our stuff very interesting lots of
stories there anyway so I rose work as
fascinating and I also actually I think
I saw you work before then it was the
your demo it Kai with the fun days and
laser yeah and it that struck me is one
of the most amazing demos I've ever seen
actually it's still to this day is
remarkable so I hope you'll show a
little bit of that yeah it's there a new
version so you will have some live demo
that's actually in this in the slide
this picture right here you would put
these miss any someone city okay and but
he'll talk about what makes it unique
and amazing all that but but just a few
words about Navarro you're gonna go over
your background yes there it is right
there at PhD physics and at university
tokyo today and he's visiting the lab
this week and maybe we'll have him back
again do some more work so thanks thank
you so yeah I hadn't as I was saying
like a kind little introduction about
why why being doing like a media arts
and science but yeah basically when it's
that I was and I'm trying to do all the
address here you're kind of oscillation
between art and science I started
working a lot on yeah laser physics I
was it was doing like plasma physics and
stuff like that and also optoelectronics
when I went to Japan people were using
technology developing things with a very
clear purpose making it faster like I
was showing this kind of robots together
without not really a clear purpose in
mind as you were saying yesterday for
the health of Lee yeah and a hell of it
yeah and I
and that that strike me I mean this kind
of intuition is kind of vision when you
do something and you just start to see
it you know it's a different angle is in
perspective it's beautiful you don't
understand exactly what it will be used
for four and then yeah basically I
couldn't publish this kind of result
only Envy new venues like maybe etech or
KY maybe are tracked as things like that
so I started thinking that yeah actually
doing media is a way of doing actually
research have a platform for having a
lot of feedback in a completely non
control environment and well basically I
consider myself an inventor so I think
many people maybe solve the problem I'm
an artist so I'm a scientist by saying
that I'm just like creating and I need
these feedback you need feedback so
papers whatever feedback so I'm not
laser guy so today I'm not going to go
on all these works because I've been
doing and sometimes are they're
interesting for me and maybe not for
others so just work talking about this
latest areas and working still working
I'm still trying to work which is like
human control faces and you will see
some of these works gaunt like media
arts sometimes or like research
depending on the public only and
something I call the proprioceptive
interfaces which is a kind of extension
of the concept of tangibles into an gebo
beads tanjo interfaces I think more not
just that you touch it but you feel it
with your full body then also I've been
working a lot can you see very well
because I see very well here what the
contrast doesn't seem funny I cannot
shut these lights off do you work here
so yeah right on duck is not good I've
been told many times so mediate itself
is that thing that interfaces are not
just something that you know i'm here
and i will like control something
actually interfaces changes you it
becomes an extension of yourself I mean
completely modify what I am so I've been
working on this idea for altars
in prosthetics and I work with blind
people and tactile feedback keeps coming
and many of their works i'm doing and
then the thing I'm really very excited
lately and that's also why I'm here
because I found like you're young I try
to yeah yesterday we click on the you
name because I always call your bank oh
but i wanted to say like your i forgot
how you said yes you're not gonna make
it easier because it's fun thank you
okay so i was reading your papers I mean
it's exactly what I want to talk about
this here because I'm interesting on
these ideas of what's a display you know
this place beyond the the flat surfaces
and interact this place is no longer at
this place is just not least no longer
something that just produced graphics is
a fool like user experience so three
topics here a minimal display that you
are not projecting just like data but
something different making it like
capable having input two and a very
important zero delay their armies much
spatial augmented reality i will be for
me the future so we're talking so the
first thing likes about this
proprioceptive and synesthetic
interfaces in studying interfaces i mean
like you you move for instance your body
and something it's mapped onto that that
is not necessarily like moving some
object but moving some other like
dimension or something so i will start
by explaining about metaphors actually
can I do something I have like a lot of
information that I cannot read here now
I'm okay yeah
so yeah so I also always want everybody
to do that but I work a lot of like the
concept of have a kind of metaphor some
very powerful idea and I try to make
things that work on that is very tricky
sometimes because a metaphor can somehow
go against the real affordances of
objects and you're using real objects to
make these interfaces but it somehow
frame a lot of work so the metaphor here
is about using space as a container for
data so volumetric data like aamir I
images and also some artworks like this
is actually time-lapse photography you
can explore by touching putting this
data on space in subtle ways by making
it may be two-dimensional image moves in
space while moving the screens and other
thing that I will show some examples
this is maybe the first like I work I
did it was a kind of cue that somehow
contains inside a whole volume of the
movie and by pressing on different part
of the image you will like be able to
control a time locally so she's pressing
here and in fact you're cutting into
this volume of images and painting
literally with time so there are two
things that were like nice intuitions
and did work the idea first is like of
course this idea of playing with time
and breaking the simultaneity of the
under on the on the image and the other
thing is about like having something
that is tangible that you can't really
touch with your hand and somehow have as
I said that is conditioned aesthetic
experience I'm moving something and I'm
doing an action that is perfectly like
you're correlated but it's not about
space so it was very intuitive and
people were doing a lot of comments
about how like can we really touch a
screen at the time with us Western 2004
the first time I try that and you can
see like yeah different generations like
all the mothers telling the child do not
touch the screen and children don't care
just like go
I start to interact with the screen and
pressing so I start having this feedback
well very interesting the surf the
projection surface where we project is
actually the deluxe attention in fact
you know it's not just the display is an
interface on how to sew just quick
question that was for me what's
interesting is like what really
technology was really bringing to this
kind of interactive cookies and
experience experiment because of course
has been done a lot of time like with
digital photography with our genetic
like photography it's called a slit scan
right so I think the point is like you
you have this real-time interaction it
brings the possibility of being doing
performance with that so exploring
having a really very fast kind of
feedback and improvising and exploring
the data is quite important it's not
just you know when you when some like
maybe painting a painter with doing some
work like he needs like years of
experiences to reach you know its own
languages here very quickly you do think
that looks very similar maybe I know
that you decide but somehow i was
wondering is this good or not because
actually all these years of practice to
reach a language you know it's like
somehow disappear now we are making this
up very quickly and now it's that you
cannot really go beyond the aesthetic
that machines like give you so that's
important point I've been discovering
when you make all these things you get
dropped in something that looks always
the same way it's very difficult to
break this you need a lot of practice so
this little square here means like when
it's orange amin science village green
amines like kind of art project and this
is I being a request to buy some
companies here it was a cheap uggs a
nuclear facility where they had ice
proton images of objects inside and then
instead of having time you can see
inside object by having this tactile
feedback or zooming here also other
things so pressure related a
and transform something at this either
like zooming either seeing inside
objects and well you can go like for
millions of strange thing there was
sculpting like volumes by pressing and
starting playing all that so that's kind
of fun but then paper we needed to
publish and that's the paper it was for
this one of the conversing you were off
chair so can we really make these
seniors like you can be really sculpt
like three-dimensional data of fine
things or controlling a card system very
precisely so with my colleague like
which is not here he wanted to come we
developed this which is a version much
more precise of this Chronos projector
flexible screen not based just on some
infrared light if you have a technical
question about how it works a will equal
answer the other one the system was
using some something called vision
Chapman shape from shading this is using
like structural light in real time with
lasers and thing like that so you have a
very very good position and then you can
really manipulate like this this thing's
behind the screen and the metaphor
somehow changed the metaphors that you
have volume behind the screen which is
virtual and then the real world and then
the idea was instead of having a mouse
in which the mapping somehow must happen
in the mind this is a membrane the
screen is a membrane that so this listen
this 3d at axis doesn't change the minis
looks perfectly natural so can maybe
sculpt them in you see like this a
moment in which we try to actually do
something like clay the manipulation by
having always pacified by can passively
feedback was somehow enough oh I didn't
press the chronometer my talk start now
totally task so I saw one this you have
to have a space
the other wise you have a 2d then you
have a time machine yeah do you have any
work to joint space first time
so you're the your projector it's a 2d
it's a video cube then we were kind over
there you manipulate this one is really
object you manipulator so I wonder you
have a 3d object plus the time you have
projects like that
you allow the interactions like this
thing you were doing like listen you the
object so yeah I would love to if we
have X Y Z plus T they may be able to
crash okay I see okay yeah no no no yeah
just yeah pong I don't know how you okay
that's what interesting well yeah maybe
something you have a kind of sculpture
something to touch it and it goes to
some state that was previous state or
something using future really yeah
that's that's interesting yeah probably
yeah okay yeah we'll talk more later on
so yeah but I've been trying to map many
different like spaces like a different
dimensions like was time-space I try
also like maybe more like high level
cognitive like understanding of the
image if the image for instance if
someone was like maybe sad the face will
maybe stop in time so you can do you can
mix all this coordinated but yeah I
understand why I say another affordance
that it's very interesting was given by
the fact that you can i play on on a
surface instead of just having some kind
of linear control on tracks so try this
experiment for a performance at the
Museum of Contemporary Art like 64
channels of video with sound and by
touching different place on the screen
you can control delay and and speed and
then it's like having a chorus of voices
if you touch here and here the
intersections will go faster so it was
you had this visual reason that
correlate with sound sound and was a lot
of interesting things explore
the result was really interesting but
yeah yeah you're talking other nurses
were talking about vision and then well
now a little more serious I was thinking
you know we have this kind of Cronos
screen is a flexible screen and it acts
as a controller but the screen can be
moved in space so here the idea was to
call us a little strange the idea was to
actually move the screen on space the
screen here is rigid some people have
now done that with a flexible screen but
having this discrete on space in making
sense of the content but just like
moving around it was very intuitive and
I try with I had like a discussion with
a radiologist let they say that somehow
I could we may be useful in the future
because not precise enough but still
like it gives at least for students a
very quick like understanding on how how
these different parts of the anatomy are
our place so I've been trying to do head
tracking to make like a little window
fish tank effect on something that's
mobile so there are some like Marcus I
when you you and you include them you
can like even being tracking mode or
slicing mode and and the idea is that
it's a Plexiglas screen so I'm
everything is actually the little is a
small little box with a projector and a
camera and infrared light so you don't
need to fill this receipts here that's
the whole thing and you could that's why
I could like maybe detect like an
infrared pan and also annotate in 3d and
eventually what I would like to be able
to do is actually do like pinching all
this function
hence with their hands I couldn't do it
yet and because but will be needed it's
maybe of course can be done maybe with
her I was going to say iPad a microsoft
surface but the idea it's like maybe I
like that it's any object can be used as
a display and of course if it were a
little transparent if you would were may
be made of acrylic because I'm putting
the light from down maybe I can I couple
the light inside the screen and it
becomes an STI are like interface I
couldn't do all the things but at the
same time the position of the screen
somehow control the content so there
were some attempts to use these for a
kind of performance in which the surface
of the people were actually the screen
intersecting some virtual object and and
having a kind of bully and theater NS
again like putting these images on space
this is this is an art installation like
a mostly like mechanical so the husband
behavior depends on where the people are
on the on the room but this elephant is
always flat but you start feeling some
kind of three dimensionality as you move
because it feels pace it has some way of
moving around that depends on the shape
of the animal so I was very interested
on how you create the sense of a
presence of this virtual object without
using you know goggles or something i
will like really actually show you this
dimensional thing and one thing that
comes to to mine is like well tactile
feedback again so the motivation for
that is like sometimes you have like
people for instance that do actors in a
you know chroma keying set up and they
will collide you know we have the cg
augmented stuff and they collide with
these objects so normally they have a
screen and have to see themselves
interacting with this object so the idea
was to maybe feed them with the small
vibrators
in the joint and then as I go like move
to towards like near some this
dimensional object they will feel the
force field that's a very early
prototype using like a ultrasound sensor
other sound like a custom-made electro
sound like a tracking system that's here
there will be a kind of virtual column
we're changing the color here and we
thought about like using a different
kind of secures like more subtle cues
maybe change in temperature and sing
that depending on the state of this
virtual object so again like a question
how to generate the sense of presence
you don't need more than that I mean
you're not really now exploring some 3d
volume and you need very precise
information but something is there or or
nothing so its sensors presence like
beyond this idea of teleconferencing
seeing something or seeing something
virtual with goggles so that's the odd
part now I was trying to create the
sense of embodiment of being somewhere
of being some presence of in this case
yourself somewhere else it's a small
experiment I mean as you see like I'm
going from lincoln rd things and like
research i don't know what's really
interesting for you not let's just stop
me and say like yeah this is crap go
tell me but this is for me was very
interesting when i start playing because
it's really disconcerting and say this
we are actually I made a little box with
the stereo display I put a display it's
custom-made again nice just to two
screens and some special optics to make
it really true d so what happened is
like if you approach this box and look
here you Philip it's empty or there is
something inside and if you talk or even
watch this actually you get trapped
because there are two cameras behind you
separated by ten times distance of your
eyes and the whole room look exactly
like the box my religion idea to make
the Box exactly but they couldn't really
close it so watch as the corner
so what happened is that the whole space
gap trapped inside with some lead time
delay this is a classic in video artist
since the 70 delay so what happened is
that people you see yourself then you
say oh wow where is the camera so you
turn around you see the camera then you
look here and you look yourself like
looking at in your eyes it's kind of
scary so one moment you don't know where
you are and people get really trapped
literally they can't that's why call box
today so there is a little sense of
disembodiment where I am so that idea
study also to be a very driving a lot of
little expense and researchers in the
lab but where do we place where do we
place our like our South you know where
are we in this kind of interfaces when
you are like talking on skype to someone
else where are we okay well is somehow
we know that okay i am in my head I mean
it's what people would say but with all
this interface will use virtual reality
what is the center of gravity you need
the center of gravity otherwise you get
lost the sense of control you know where
are we where is he in this so this
started like like this kind of peace or
peace and then I start thinking yeah
maybe this may be something that existed
before that produce the same uncanny
effect is a mirror if you wake up in the
middle of the night when you're little
sleepy and you go to the bathroom to get
water I remember once I did that and I
was totally sleeping and I look at
myself and ID like Justin put just like
a jockey I was so scared you know it was
really I had a kind of reaction wow I
was like boom boom boom you know there
is something very testing about mirrors
and we get I mean we don't have mirren
since long time I'd read three books or
mirrors I get complete obsessed up how
can be that we are really not totally
fascinated by mirrors we put mirrors
everywhere and it's the most disturbing
experience you know and we are now doing
that we are connecting calmness and
putting it everywhere like okay so this
center of gravity the self is being
completely destroyed so we need to recon
RT through this interfaces so that's
what i call like interface for me some
extension of the self is a kind of your
life manipulating that you have to be
clear where what are you trying to do so
I was thinking they could be maybe the
future super mirror for instance yeah
but it's a very simple occasion because
this is orange could be this mirror in
which you can see yourself from any side
or using the cameras everywhere in in
the city to have the ability to just
look around to any object people have
them done that on cars this is a whole
call that this AVR AVL system abs system
but you can see your car from as if you
were looking at from top to park right
so actually we work now I can say it
goes it a secret I work we work with
some car company company a girl say the
name of the company I think you know
which which one so the idea was to
extend this concept but actually
networking you know like the plate of
the car to the camera were in front of
the car so for instance it becomes
invisible you can look to cast and there
it was 22 completely network all this
using like tags here was our toolkit so
I just prototype it it with our to get
and some like a wireless adult network
but normally you could maybe do much
more like connect like this see you know
you are in a jam in a traffic jam and
you can see what what's going on like
you cannot see it but just like start
like clicking clicking clicking on the
car this car this car see what yeah so
it's like your routine video so it
became interesting that our like it's
enough PC which may be sure you've had
time which I try to extend that concept
on the whole earth like connecting my
plugs of video then you don't know where
you end up so the small like an art
project so whoo I'm think I'm very late
by anyway so about this interface is not
more concrete now no more cooking in the
face not just about like vision but I'm
being trying on extending what we call
or creating new sensory sensorimotor
contingencies that that's really the
much more classic work on augmented
perception so creating poor innocent
like x-ray like vision whatever that
would be extending senses so very
completely that the metaphor I've been
exploring since long time is this this
idea that you know we are relying all
the time on vision vision something that
really appear quite late in evolution
evolutionary terms before animals like
cells were only concerned about was
really really around them you know some
millimeters and chemical something
centimeters and we are extending this
range vision extended very much now we
are extending maybe with internet we
know like something is happening like
some million some thousands of
kilometers from here but still it's not
a physical very direct interaction so
the idea of extending the physical body
with with like Celia antennas and sing
like that so I explore that from both
from machines so how you know you have
like phones and people now I'm playing
by putting a camera here to be able to
track hands but you know we saw is a
very short-range interaction so why not
like having hairs Haley kind of
electronics so and also for people that
will be so for people I was a
interesting about this idea of maybe we
can't have like this Celia this
extension of the of the surface of the
body through two rays of light so not
obstruct reserve but they are actually
rangefinder and the feedback is that is
act act I'll you know about this work
right so it's a new sensory modality
it's not ductile to visual substitution
system is a new sensory modalities a new
like a sensory motor loop because this
tactile is range to tactile is not
vision to tactile is my body is much
more like a distribution my skin has
been extended I become very fat and well
that's just one of the first prototype I
was just playing
really not seeing so i have only one
module and i start like actually moving
a lot to try to find you know i just
feel something the strength depends on
the range and and you start having us a
special kind of behavior so this is your
theory behind all this kind of research
is called like action in perception that
the perception is never passive and then
you start doing some kinds i know i put
this this is my niece because that's how
this project started she had an I
problems on my I've worked during my PhD
on artificial retina in fact kind of
vision opt electronic processors for
post-processing like processing like a
better visual data but it's not really
an artificial for dinner and he said
like maybe you can make that for my
child and the first study i had is this
like he's not possible you don't need
that you need and then it become more
serious this is a real experiment with
50 blind people in Brazil so here the
headman contains only six of this range
finder and you'll see that sometimes
they decided to light there because they
are actually feeling it and they move
and they feel that there is something
something that I mean she's professor
Liang sampai refuse specialist on that
work with buck and Rita you know the
first leg experiment on putting on the
back and and she did a lot of trials I
did other strikes when she sent me this
video first I was saying now this is not
normal he doesn't have the cane is so
distressing you can't feel that he's
like this he scared but he try with
Kanan without cane and this is a
compliment for the cane it's not a
substitute but it worked pretty well and
they want to continue doing that they
want to do them to harvest the product
since then that was 2006 and a stabbing
so many projects are very similar
yesterday had to review two papers will
present exactly same thing in the WebM
project with using Kinect I don't see
people having a connect on their head I
mean unless I'm sorry yeah I see people
having connected
only on the shoulder now but not not the
problem really here is like it must be
super cheap super invisible so we
thought at the end maybe at least four
children we could maybe just use some
kind of plastic litter antennas because
the problem with child she was telling
something telling me something terrible
when a child is born blind they are
scared of bumping their head like in
front so the style I walking backwards
star really always protecting the face
and if you start like your life walking
backwards I think it's very good so very
early in life you have to make at least
some very simple wellness of what's in
front so people put your hands or or
maybe really having some plastic or and
that's the Japanese version how I'm
showing this for two reasons first
because it's quite fun and second
because everything we'd only love I mean
really now eighty percent goes on TV
because we becomes kind of one ounce
calabogie chemo so I was asked like to
show this and it's interesting because
the public gets you know we were talking
about acknowledge how people perceive it
in in Japanese and countries and it's
always a joke so I was really angry at
first and then like maybe I got it you
know it's the only way like people get
used to these things to division since
they don't read people read the paper so
you see that and say oh that was kind of
stupid but it could be may be used for a
blind person you know it really goes the
other way and they make very nice
graphics so I don't have to make myself
well I mean it's a long video because
then there is a detective at put this
and start like moving very weird but
yeah I have is I could do my whole
presentation with this kind of tedious
it's like people the other is this how
do you differentiate different quality
of the teacher you don't want to avoid
that board maybe we can go through that
pic of all kind of feedback sensing it's
a dedicating I mean I we're writing a
big paper now a real paper so i will
explain that later there's a lot of
things because it's not just above
raishin said Stockton's we're trying to
create a kind of stuck thai language and
it depends sometimes the signal I goes
to zero too quickly it can be because of
the surfaces is a corner or maybe some
how many depends this it's exactly like
it's a kind of very simple optical
processing mean this is no camera but
you have all the effects of your
reflectance of the surface and you can
couple with ultrasound sensor to which
have much bigger kind of not range but
the field of view so we are trying to
cover both of them but yeah what so when
we were doing this project when we
notice is that the only way to see if
the blind person financial was really
getting some feedback was to actually
see this little LEDs then I made a
prototype in which you send all the
information to the computer you see all
this stuff but I was very interesting on
that idea ok I'm here so you get close
to me you don't notice me you get close
to me and then something flashes so you
do like oh sorry I'm the one who may be
looking at my phone get too close to
someone and without even saying anything
I have some feedback you know not this
feedback which this is the haptic rather
project but a feedback to the
environment I am here it's like lights
on the car you know so I was trying to
think about that and I was taught
collaborating with an artist also in
Australia about this project that was
about extending the body in time and
space through this really geometrical
like lines so we put like a lot of
lasers on people actually dancers
professional dancers are plans with in
the company of foresight so and we'll
just try to see what happened if you
have a body that is extended and somehow
interconnected because it has a lot of
motors here they could move like up down
it's really sure and they move not
because he's moving them but because of
the other guy this partner can move and
the map it's mapped onto onto this body
so it's like having an extended body and
share body that was really open open
kind of research no it's no at all I
kind of very serious research on that
and was just what happened so when what
the most interesting result here was
that the can't believe like he's not
working Technologies technology it was
that when you don't see the dancers you
see all the projections on the building
little lights and you see that something
is moving here so this is a kind of
projection of motion and another thing
that that was really pain like it we
really put a lot of LEDs on the best and
made a model of some kind of light
substance that can go on your surface of
your body depending on how you move like
you will maybe rotate and do things like
this to extend it temporarily the
motions you know if you've run ladies
are you ladies start like spinning
around you so the idea was trying to
make that effect like very strong like
visual kind of inertia a kind of blur
motion like nervous thing stopped very
clear so we may many prototype and so
that's the first one when I was not very
fat now I kind of put now really
happening I ya know
do what I'm showing here because I for
seeing the laser you need some Hayes's
smoke smoke machines so this was how was
exhibited a kind of pigs pile with a lot
of speakers so there was this lasers
when people will move it wasn't a kind
of so dancers were inside but it also
works a kind of public installation so
as you move it you your motion was
detected like the like the elevator pack
3.0 so much better it works now sorry
when it when it detected you your
acceleration is talak spinning sound
because they were eight speakers so you
the worst flow of water going a kind of
spiral you know we were trying to bring
this space which is very very kind of
urban feeling of nature the power of
nature so this was a big sound and one
week later was the earthquake so yeah it
was a kind of wow we just involved the
power of nature so yeah not so fun well
I'm don't have a lot of time so really
go quickly that was played lot of things
like face vision and another video now
this be seen you know who knows her
companions she's yeah it's moyna
Lumley's solidity fables this she was
but at cstone someone really famous
movie a kind of program season 2 that is
one of the gate bond girl and she was
make yes sorry dawn looks here she was
making a promo problem programmable cat
and how like hats have actually an
extending body through the whiskers so
how can I have this so she she I made
for her this kind of strange mask and
she she's very polite in the video she
said loudest an interesting how with
busy accent how God can see in fact she
was in fact is also i will never do that
again
this really now is because it's a
terrible thing you feel like Hannibal
Lecter and you see a lot of vibration on
your face you know so here you have all
these kind of her vital signs so see
everything is like a sand like the sound
is very though ok so now it's just fin
de Matos see British accent yeah the
mask is sending everything wirelessly to
this computer so I try to approach your
handle yeah how many mouths so this is
that's essentially near your mouth oh
how can I try it out well we will try
that from the corridor cat I can't
whiskers are the most incredible bits of
Kent there Susan disclaims Justin
actually so learn think they can even
detect like so air flow and blind people
can also detect air flow through this it
was this controversy people thought they
had six cents like buying people
actually was we were able to detect like
it's called phase vision they do that
they do that no if you did yeah well
yeah that's our cydia let us at the end
of this technology electronics exactly
exactly
I closes good have this kind of a
villain you know to feel like yeah very
good fortune cheers I read an article by
a the ACM I don't know it was
interesting he he he went bald and he
said like start like bumping my head
like 10 times more because you feel when
you're approaching something small like
yeah yes that's the only thing she said
well this is long so again like more
about this extension I'm being and eat a
lot of experiments and now the idea is
to decouple like sensors we're on the
car we never try in a real car and by
the actuator was on your forehead so in
fact somehow see that's what I'm saying
some stimulii to the external world even
if this person doesn't know that this
person is getting close you have another
testament people don't do that now
people were thinking okay I have to like
do something to tell the driver to take
action but these things could work in a
kind of reflex arc but never like
somehow gets the brain of the machine
like aware you know the arrival does
need to know that the car is taking some
very low-level actions so that that's I
looked this thing it was control with
the eye closed because you feel when you
move the car but that you are like some
some pressure
and well I don't know actually would be
could be may be used in a real car I
think I don't have a driver license nice
sort of thing that if i had a car i
would like to have that somehow know its
true like it because you know I for me
it's magic how people park their cars I
don't know I don't understand this is a
sixth sense for me so I need to build my
own this is really escape your hippos
doing a lot of things and stopping
you're not seeing ah that's too easy No
so yeah one now let's go now to this
more like the last point the thing that
really am very much interested in this
idea of what what's a display what's
really why we are trying more with two
other as somehow the neocortex like when
I'm sure all reading you know it's
uploading and so much data so thinking
of this ambient display so this is very
fun and but you need very precise very
concrete like cues and you cannot also
be looking at the screen for having
something that even is if it's a simple
q you have to read to look there you
need to have this placed of course
ubiquitous and there are also the count
the content is related to where they
appear so we'll show you some examples
this is something we could also be a
kind of extension of the self called the
laser or the idea was like you know in
Japanese unexpressed a lot in the office
but but that was wondering you know I'm
working I want to know how can I
interrupt you or something that is you
know like you in social network you
always have like available not available
something like this but you don't it
doesn't happen anymore in the physical
world why because we assume that if you
are there I can like hey maybe no maybe
I don't know yeah yeah me yes yes
exactly so the idea was to show
something around the person this kind of
aura
the experiment here was very simple we
try with some mindflex to try to measure
some EEG signal day and really work and
then like arousal through skin
conduction at the end it was just like
sensing the vibration of the chair
because he was like stressed she's
talking to me so you have this kind of
aura right and the oreck me like this
minimalist display could show a lot of
things about social like distances
emotions and I want to go to toilet or
objects I where is my banana this is a
chest shot yeah exactly where is the key
so that's what that the comment that you
read did you ready by a Bruce Sterling
bruce sterling is his famous like a
science fiction writing and he has
actually commenting about this project
all the things he start reading that and
he gave me a lot of interesting friedman
its true like don't inflict margin in
conventional reality a laser pointer no
it's so nice keep it always click for
hours and run out buddy so then what I
say minimal displays as a minx more are
by no means so this is another
experiment we did on a on a mountain
Finland actually Oh what is the video
just ok I want to show the video ah ah
close your eyes for 30 seconds listen I
know I can't believe I don't have the
video well anyway I don't have time
either so ok so nevermind nevermind so
while we try to project like interactive
graphics on on on ski ski ski wat ski
ski slope ski Joe and Japanese always
ask you Joe so
here it was a kind of you can see that
on YouTube is a seashore and people can
play with the seashore so we used to two
ways of tracking people make this
interactive was like either like with a
camera or using the laser centering
technology that will show in a moment
because the problem with all this
kindness interactive displays iconic
iconic displacing that is like in
particular for games and 44 really
interacting with people as if there is
something there that has intentionality
that reacts to my actions then I believe
like very much that you don't you cannot
afford having this much special with my
short time like delay so it's very
important to have some key technology
for that anything of course they're too
two ways to do that one is like smart
sensors all these things have been
developing I wish shows an example and
the others of course vision-based and
the technology will evolve and they will
converge so but the goal from is not
really the goal is something that will
happen but they will change things
radically and people will start thinking
differently about up so some project
about the smart sensing technology with
lasers i will show now quickly the book
flipping printing or skin games and this
idea of a robot made of light you see
how it goes this idea of the robot made
of light because of the display and the
place where the display the graphic make
is part of the message you know it's not
a half display here you can put any
information what I'm projecting may mean
something it's like a person you know
I'm talking this person saying something
is not the other one so I think that
somehow it becomes a kind of living
being that's also very much when I read
your paper were like be matron be
Maatran the idea that you are
location-based like a display it already
have a lot of meaning doesn't care what
you are projecting it depends on where
and how it reacts so for the more like
technically inclined same line okay so
it's just a word about how this laser
sensing display LSD technology works
you have a two or more like laser at a
completely collinear one is for sensing
and access a range finder actually more
it could be also could eat X
polarization could you text like him a
lot of things like color and and the
other is for displaying the color so
that means that when you are like
drawing here for insta here you have
abnormal project honest you'd is not
aware at all of what it's doing is like
a blind projector here it's actually
being able to sense the same way when
you write or you do like calligraphy or
whatever you feel the surface so that
was a key point you have something that
actually feeling where it's read writing
but per pixel is not like okay I will
write full letter I close and then I
look oh no it was curved and I have to
stir again that's likely vision-based
now he works and have to scan for the
surface is that right now I'm correct so
here is like each pixel they know where
I am out I'm not touching it anymore i'm
not at the right distance i have to
maybe pre-warp or whatever so the
technology works like is just this idea
of having a beam that comes at the same
time sense and I apply it for machines
gives you these for instance and what I
call the markers less laser tracking
that was 2004 technology so here you
have like a galvanometer sand one photo
detector so there's no no image here
just detecting the reflection by doing
some synchronous photo detection been
able to somehow measure distance was a
quite good position at about one meter
about like millimetric position and of
course like this constraints were short
position is very good that's what you
saw in KY so that was the first idea was
to make this kind of minority poor thing
because it was the year of minority
report and it was fun not no markers you
know the guy had Marcus so I felt so
good for for a year but nobody knew how
it is working now we have six cents with
markers but the
I still think that could be interesting
to do something ladies because I not
necessarily with galvanometers but maybe
with a big seller race with men in our
race again same idea you are in only
interesting on a short-range interaction
so you can have like a lot of hairs like
exploring the world around and then
measure the size of shape of your hand
is basically a range fund a rangefinder
camera people are now doing that so yeah
we all could contribute a little part on
this kind of reflection and then it's
very quickly obsolete this is another
like application more inspired maybe on
a blade runner as one moment Harrison
Ford is controlling his zooming on
something by just talking and it's
completely non-functional she saying
like to the right 10.5 centimeters I
don't know how he knows we know it's
like about like like yeah speech control
interfaces you are like you know exactly
how you want to do it's not doesn't work
you need painterly interfaces has gone
on live in size always like something
that is like more like an improvisation
and you have a very fast feedback so
here is controlling like six degree of
freedom which has one finger no Marcus
zooming doing some very simple like just
a recognition for zooming and assuming
so that was for machine so I said like
yeah you know like having hair and kno
how much time and you have if i have
time so also yeah are you sorry the demo
is just like a week and i just need time
it just press upon so see this is this
system working without calibration on on
anything like touching their measuring
doing a local scan and giving a lot of
information that's the thing i was
explaining our is not here today too so
doing for instance Mike
and then this is this exactly shows my
point about like perfect registration in
time and space this is a raster scan
based system maybe you saw it knows this
is totally different technologies a
mems-based system and you have an
infrared laser and a red laser so the
red they are collinear they're moving at
the same time when the infrared laser
and one photo detector when it senses a
lot of absorption in particular and
veins absorb infrared then delay the red
laser is turn off in real time per pixel
so you have a kind of event viewer now
this a company has made that by
calibrating a projector and a laser and
a camera infrared camera but here this
no like plane of calibration because the
O's always use a mog refuse I'm not sure
I calibrating the stuff they have no
market here it's impossible to loosen so
this word I call like low-level image
processing ein own reality so on the
real world you know like contour like in
handsome and nothing let up so you could
have mean maybe on your glasses
something like that and enhance the
contrast something like that without
needing to actually acquire the images
and then project something someone who's
not seeing very well could have this
intelligent light that projecting
somehow like prepare it was so we'll
show this so I don't need to do that so
it's colitis art installation I'd use
this technology to perform to make sound
so hot CC I'm moving your thing and he
never liked loses the tracking
when to make music I don't know I'm not
responsible for the for the sound part
but it just the first step we're trying
to create our kind of language of may be
related to the behavior of light and we
never really finished this one isn't
working progress but you see it looks
alive and you can like play in real time
and yeah that's what I showed you at it
ideas so was I'm not sure it's possible
to do now with camera and projector
calibration this will be a little tricky
because these really react instantly
when it touches something so what just
kind of idea is really early stages as
you can see i'm always projecting a
little circle it's not that interesting
but imagine if you can't project like
full graphics on your surface of your
body make like know some full
battlefield on your body and control
things and plastic think it could be
really interesting I mean it's open up
so many possible so yeah okay you'll see
something like this now so i'm finishing
it's almost over so for vision-based
vision-based like camel projector you
have to calibrate that this is a this
were talking that yesterday why they put
it here it's a camel projector
calibration tool key that i made for
open frame box in you calibrated in one
minute camera and projector to start
like doing ladies it's an open CV is
based on kyle mcdonald is open from of
community and second extension i made so
you like this at the end it's calibrated
instead like doing augmented reality
without a kinect of course now we have
clinics so you can do much more we can
combine this is a normal camera
and camera and projector doesn't mean
that you don't have anything else so
here this is a I'm showing this because
he sent me this yesterday is the latest
version of the so-called book we've been
scanning that is being developed in the
lab so here uses some structural light
very fast cameras a lot of processing
and scanning at 250 pages per set per
minute a book and when I said scanning
is really having this exactly the shape
taking many pictures us this thing is
moving using shape from shading knowing
like you can't even measure the
reflectance of the surface so it's not
just cunning and making it perfectly
flat but it's also your recording the
reflectance of the books every one day
you want to print it you can even print
it in the same material we are acquiring
a lot of data so it's a kind of cloner
of books Wow okay so now I reach one the
mid of my presentation now but almost oh
my okay this is something i will talk
maybe maybe with you later this is what
i'm working on this idea of whole a
collaborative 3d space no no more time
now i will kill everybody so i already
explained this area of the roads made of
light being like playing with that a lot
making this little beast that will show
now oh and let me see I think we're over
lat I'm sorry the last like slight oh
you want it to see very silent
yeah there were mania one is was
actually shook to shore some very
Caribbean and projected in Finland and
then you make it yeah and then the skier
somehow projected on the under on the
owner on the beach but here is
completely simulated it's a water line
so meta meta meta balls people yeah yeah
yeah everybody was no no I did all the
calculations I was seized see this see
this guy I was very serious about it no
really this is this was max maybe the
maximum was 500 millivolts because i was
super concerned in fact is too
conservative now people yeah use laser
like five watching lat it's the
important things are the optical
parameters like divergence of the beam
etc how it moves that no it's safe and
they try that much better light lighting
okay last project and last sorry the
whole thing like points to the idea that
we're now always playing with projectors
and you know trying to make things
appear in places that somehow augment
the meaning of the message that we are
project what's always visual so the idea
will be to make something as a function
projector you project on some surface or
on some object some function here was
very simple idea here was like
projecting sound through this kind of
parametric speaker on our own object
like a banana that looks like a
telephone so you can talk on the phone
and really the sound come from the
banana so they're able to project
function on objects is a multimodal
display or we having us and kind of Pete
and it becomes a video player and you
can like he was my working with with me
student I mean under student technical
assistant in the lab for for some years
who have a lot of fun laval virtual of
the winningest last year so two years
ago so this is our very cheap version of
something like the B madryn we sound and
I think our like the mottos were like
several models were were fried every
three hours something wrong so I want to
know how what you've been using is much
better so but DC the idea I was thinking
at 0 things can be augmented from the
outside this the extension of the
concept of spatial augmented reality
it's not just spatial augmented reality
with sound with images with sound maybe
functions may be complete functions
which brings me to this last idea now
I'm in the indie India in the idea area
because it's the end of the top I've
been working on his book flipping
scanning you saw and book I mean he was
this work was working an L also work on
books living printing trying to print a
book in real-time using photochromic
wings so you are like changing the
affordances of the above objects by
projecting with this kind of extended
projector from the outside that means
that yeah affordance has become things
that you can like switch it on and off
on objects so this is a kind of joke you
know a hammer I could be rechargeable
but it's not so much a joke when you buy
a CD now today or is it not also amusing
you are not allowed to copy into another
computer something like that right but
you can physically you can but you
cannot because this illegal same thing
here if you use it it will be legal
let's just be fine so think about that
it could be and maybe the hammer will
become all completely like you know
doesn't work anymore but if it breaks it
will be repair for you because it's a
service you're paying the service same
thing with everything well thinking that
could be a strange to stop in a European
future in which you don't owe things
that have affordances someone else can
control them so that's why reflecting
all this is matter we can make a lot of
mistakes and get trapped on cigarette
and that's the end of my talk because
yeah so I've been advocating this idea
of reality Center interface design which
I thought it was my idea and of course
as being like like described like years
ago what many like thinkers about this
kind think so and also this idea of real
space of organizing scuffle for data
versus this idea of the cloud that you
don't know where it is well in cielo you
know what it is outside but in general
you know i need some to place things
somewhere organize my data through space
and generalizing is rules of physics as
you were talking you talk less intuitive
physics for trying to grasp things you
cannot really because it's not really
real object so you need to make
something that makes sense and i agree
with you and to date i didn't see
anything that makes sense so completely
the closest is like what McGonagle
calling is cancer magic walls which k
you have maybe some gold at harry potter
with a stick in one and have some kind
of power that does something and then
okay you know that you have something
has power like a remote control but it's
still too basic you know and i believe
in very much in this that the d don't
people put too much he fought on making
something that looks very nice and you
press buttons and that's how you
interact with the design interface
basically and i think that even if you
try to make it as simple as possible
into it even etc you need to learn some
kind of set of rules that are fixed
instead if you have someone you modify
the system as you interact poor people
have probably tried that already but
really it's like how people learn things
in the real world interact with someone
you learn about the other by interacting
so trying to create a physical engines
agents instead of knobs that have a
behavior that little animals I cannot
communicate with them and train them my
interface that was about one hour 20
minutes much more than expected sorry no
before leaving I have to make it work
they are gonna hear there after dinner
oh no I'm singing they were like all of
the t-shirt Daria please please you
can't put it ok it's not again you just
I'm just show you something really
simple
so you can move this no calibration so
maybe the bigger they're fine
so we can bounce a kind of many many
things this
if you don't make it flat to make it you
may get a pitch release of this yeah
well it has me on the line of sight of
me means this case right I just like to
practice this matter before yeah delek
it will well I kind of work because I'm
protecting from here but yesterday we
were talking behind me some solutions
what were they all balls for ya
billabong booze is because I modify the
code to be able to attract me so you can
really throw in there Zach working with
the size i hope so but i didn't modify
it that's all so what is this device
here this is a another land photo
detector is detecting how much light can
reflect on the object that's it that's
the only permission huh and now it's
little circle contents about like 20
point is made about two milliseconds to
stunning and very first locals can sort
of our game of us came back yes I'll
show you I wish me sweet one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
