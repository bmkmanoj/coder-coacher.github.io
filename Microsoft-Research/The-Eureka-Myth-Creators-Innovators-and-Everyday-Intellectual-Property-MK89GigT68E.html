you
get started and let the stragglers
straggle on in thanks for being here
we're super happy today to have Jessica
Silby from down the street at Suffolk
University jessica is a law professor
who also has some Media Studies
interests and has written this fabulous
new book which you can see right here
called the Eureka myth about the role of
intellectual property in the everyday
lives of people who make it like us and
I'll hand it over to her so great well
I'm really glad to be here I met Nancy
several years ago when at a IP
conference of video gamer researcher
asked me if I knew her because she was
doing this qualitative empirical work on
musicians and I was doing qualitative
empirical work on a range of creative
and innovators and so we got together
and started chatting and had a lot of
similarities so um Nancy's right so my
background is as a lawyer and law
professor i also have a PhD in
comparative literature so it's not
communications it's really narrative
theory and film theory is where my my
other discipline overlap is and as you
will see from this project i spend a lot
of time thinking about language and how
language matters and how we create our
communities how we get meaning between
in relationships etc so this project
started out with um a i want to say an
annoyance but thats that makes it sound
not as fun as it was so in in law in law
practice and in law doctrine we say all
the time that intellectual property
mostly patents and copyrights although
we are starting to say this with
trademarks as well that the exclusive
protection that IP provides motivates
and enables the making and distribution
of things that are protected through it
so you wouldn't write a novel if you
didn't get copyright you wouldn't make a
movie if you didn't get copyright you
wouldn't develop a big drug if you
didn't get patents etc that it it
facilitates the recoupment of investment
in that work that's what we say all the
time there are however many
other ways to explain how this work gets
done why it gets done and I wanted to
figure out how those stories and those
explanations matched on to the story we
have in law I wanted to figure out where
there were contradictions complexity
supplements and and whether they were
going to be meaningful for the debates
we were having an intellectual property
today and so one of the ways i was doing
i wanted to do that is not what
typically law professors and legal
scholars do which is look at all the
cases in the dispute sort of the one
percent of where all the legal doctrine
is coming from and really look at the
ground sort of who who is making the
stuff in what kind of organizations what
did they care about and what motivates
them how do they explain how they do
their work what enables their work what
hinders their work and so I decided to
start collecting these explanations by
doing long-form qualitative interview
stand a long-form qualitative interviews
study and so what I'm gonna do is share
with you the results or partially the
results of those study which as it Nancy
says has just been published in this
book which is I think a fun I'll say a
pitch it as a really fun book to read
because it's full of these stories so
you know my analysis is in there but I
know what people are enjoying about this
book are the characters the people that
I've interviewed who are all throughout
throughout this book you sort of get
close to them and I think it's helpful
it's helpful to animate the debate so
I'm going to give you sort of a taste of
some of the some of the interview quote
quotes from the interviews to give you a
sense of what's going to come later and
then i'm going to set out the
methodology so tell you a little bit
more discipline airily how I how I
teased out the analysis and then I'll
walk you through a walk you through some
of the findings so here is all the names
are anonymized it was a confidential
study for reasons I can explain soon but
um so this is Joan she's a visual artist
and she's described that she wanted to
make paintings and she wanted to publish
them this was in the response to a
question about about
whether she keeps track of all of her
work I asked a lot about I think the
background of this was what is one of
your biggest problems in your work she
says I just don't know where to put all
my stuff I make it I don't have a place
to store it it's pretty big and we
started getting talked about what
happens when it goes out and she says
well you know it goes all around and
then she says you know I really wanted
to make paintings and she made really
big ones really small ones and I wanted
to publish them but I didn't want to own
them so owning them having them in her
house was a real problem it's like
having a litter of puppies and you find
a good home for each one of them that
was one of the ways she was explaining
her ideal form of distribution of her
work this is dennis he's an in-house
patent attorney in biotech he's been
working in biotech his whole life he's
in his late 50s so he's seen a huge
change and I was asking him about where
great invention comes from in the
companies that he's worked for and he's
worked for some of the biggest Pharma in
in the United States and he says well
you know steve jobs and wozniak they
created the personal computer all right
Cohen and Boyer they created biotech but
most of the rest of us mere mortals just
you know you learn from other people and
then the frontiers of science or push
back gradually through similar ant-like
persistence by scientists so in these
two quotes you start getting a flavor of
how people explain what is good work how
you want to claim work their
relationship to work there's gonna be a
lot more of this so I start the book
with these two quotes because sort of
paintings as puppies scientists as ants
they're sort of something funny going on
here that does not sound at all like the
intellectual property law I practiced
for years or in fact I teach in the
classroom so what did I do I first
interviewed many many dozens of people I
interviewed over 50 people but I only
coated 50 50 interviews the the
classification of the interviewees are
stratified over what I think are
relevant categories i can tell you what
those categories are if people are
interested in it in it but i had to
stratify them to get to get to a sense
of relevance it's a standard interview
protocol so i asked the same questions
of everybody the interview protocol had
to be had to be blessed by the IRB but a
lot of people would answer very little
from some question and answer
a lot for other questions so they were
flowing conversations the way they
should be i always ask jet more general
questions and then narrow down to the
more specifics you let them direct the
conversation all the interviews are
transcribed and then I code them i use
atlas TI as the qualitative software not
in vivo i prefer Atlas and I could
people are so that we could talk about
that all the all the transcripts are
loaded onto the software and Atlas
allows you to search and sort and figure
out where codes are showing up and where
codes are not showing up and it it gives
you basically a database of language and
relationships Atlas is a software system
that allows you to create relationships
between documents and categories and
then produces suggests more
relationships that you aren't seeing to
help you analyze analyze the qualitative
data so there are lots of different ways
you can slice and dice this data as you
can imagine the primary thing I was
interested in is how does intellectual
property as an exclusive right function
in the lives of these people both
creative and innovative professionals
and they were artists and scientists and
engineers from individuals but they were
also people who were member of
organizations they were lawyers and
business partners and gallery owners and
managers so there were people and for
both sides of what you might think what
otherwise have different views on the
distribution and creation function or
the monetization function for example so
I I interviewed variety of those those
people and I wanted to know how I p
worked for them or didn't work for them
and the more general question I was
interested in is that the motives and
mechanisms of their work i mean we say
intellectual property as opposed to
facilitate is a mechanism and a motive
and i wanted to know if that's what i
was hearing I never asked directly about
intellectual property in any of these
interviews until the very end that's
just not the way you do these kind of
interviews but at the end you do i do
ask and that's to check sort of what did
they think they were claiming when they
were claiming sort of adorable property
right and um and how does that compare
to what they think intellectual property
is for example and those are those
misalignments are pretty interesting
although they're not very much in the
book so um the the book has six chapters
uh the first three are where I'm going
to spend more of
time today but the last three are pretty
interesting and I'll say reputation is
is an important chapter because
reputational reputation is super super
important to most of the people that I
interviewed and reputation is very hard
to regulate as a legal matter it's in
fact it's very very slippery and yet it
is the thing that is it is one of the
major mechanisms and the major motives
for doing a lot of what they do and it
is not covered by intellectual property
at all so I devoted a whole chapter to
this absence in an intellectual property
law for something that was super
important to the creatives and the
innovators that I was and I was
interviewing all right so inspired
beginnings so when I when I talk to
folks about either how they began their
work in creative innovative fields or
how they began a particular project that
either made them who they are sort of
define them and put them on a path there
were four major categories of beginning
sort of origin stories as I as I deem
them and they are serendipity or luck
intrinsic or natural forces player
pleasure and neater urgency these are
actually categories that folks in other
fields have already determined our
reasons for why people engage in
creative innovative work I did not I did
not impose this on the data this came
out of the data and so I was very happy
to see that these categories of why
people began in the fields or why they
began the work that that they are so
proud of is here because it confirms the
robustness of the data what's
interesting however about these
categories and I'll give you examples of
them in a minute animate them is that we
don't talk about this as relevant to
intellectual property that we talk about
intellectual property as being a carrot
in front of a lot of people who are
going to be engaging and burdensome and
hard and time-consuming work we don't
ever talk about these significant
psychological and cultural categories or
reasons being how people engage or why
people engage in the work so this is
absent from the legal literature it's
absent from the legal debate and yet it
is ever present in the people who are
engaged
Union work that's protected by
intellectual property so let me give you
example so here I began as a painter but
ended up a sculpture because my paints
were lost in the mail so this is
serendipity this is a woman who is known
for her giant giant sculpture she makes
his huge sculptures that are really nets
and wire and they flow and they're
connected they connect big buildings um
internationally known sculptor but she
started off as a painter and when she
had a Fulbright fellowship in India on
when she was young she went over there
and she's supposed to do a big show she
was waiting for her paints that she had
just bought after grad school to come in
the mail and they never showed up and
she's walking the beach and she's
walking the beach wondering what how am
I gonna do I have to put on the show and
I don't have my equipment she's walking
with another woman there and she saw all
this found objects and the woman said
well I don't know you know a lot of
painters ended up being sculptors maybe
you can make something and she's like
yeah you know I can make stuff with what
I found here and she has four ever
actually been the sculptor who makes
things with nets and rods the kind of
things that were on the beach in India
so that's serendipity um this is this is
neat or urgency this is a an oncologist
who said I was always fascinated with
the eye and blindness especially after
my mother was diagnosed with AMD is
age-related macular degeneration and so
I combined my on ecology background with
ophthalmic so this is a woman who
started off as a biologist she started a
company a biologic company and it has a
blockbuster blockbuster drug that treats
AMD and to talk about the origins of
that drug and that business in this way
is problem solving this is a VC in a
small energy startup that's no longer
small anymore great science comes out of
labs from people who have the freedom to
play around i call them juvenile
delinquents so I asked him tell me who
in your work generates the most
inventions like who are the people in
your company who either you're getting
you know a lot of patent filings from or
they're creating the stuff that you're
really able to commercialize and he says
they're the people who are always
breaking the rules as long as we give
them some freedom a lab space and some
parameters if
they will figure out a way to get around
all these other things break these were
and they're the ones who are generating
the most important stuff so that's
player pleasure and this is intrinsic
the song just came to me nearly fully
written so this is a song a
singer-songwriter all of the
interviewees by the way do their work
pretty much full time but not all of
them make a good living out of it so
there are people who are you know very
very well off some of them who are not
that was one of the categories of
stratification um so uh she talks about
how one of the songs that she's made a
lot of money on was one of these things
that she just first it just came to her
not all of her songs are like that but
that was the origin of one of them so as
I said these categories are not really
very surprising from the perspective of
creativity theory in psychology or
sociology but um reasons other than
property entitlements are given for
beginning work that makes sense for
everyday people the fact that IP is not
present as an instigator really disrupt
dominant legal theory and legal policy
however that IP is not there at the
beginning in the explanations is
something that when I speak to a room
full of legislators for example or I
speak I speak to a bunch of judges that
is strange to them they that's because
that's not the way they've always
understood the reason that and the hell
off functions and then the next question
that is always asked is well what about
everyday work so maybe it's not there in
the beginning there's this inspirational
thing or this there's this problem what
gets you working everyday over the
hurdle of the inspiration hard work
everyday there has to be an incentive
there the idea that you'll be able to
recoup through an exclusive right that
that's got to be where IP is right and
so of course that was one of the next
questions I asked cuz that's what i was
thinking like i don't go to work work
hard every day i'm not for the money
like I sometimes too great a stack of
exams as high like you better be paying
me myself ready right now I'm so where
where does it come from there and so
when you talk to them about their
everyday work we you'll hear in the book
is there are certain tropes that they
use for what facilitates everyday
constant stable work what enables them
to get the work done
every day so they talk about time and
space a lot that is the trope of having
enough time and autonomy over their time
so I need eight hours of uninterruptible
romantic idea of Virginia Woolf's room
of 10 one's own kind of thing they talk
about their studio they talk about their
lab they talk about the cubes the open
space for example they talk about the
importance of the space and time
configuration in the flow of everyday
work and the rhythm and propulsion of
everyday work that is just work makes
work once I'm started I'm going to keep
going there isn't there is a an everyday
nature to the rhythm of it that is what
motivates them it's and I wouldn't say
motivate like I'm looking for an end
point they really are what they do not
what they make that's the sense i got
from most of the people that I was
talking to that they define themselves
by the everyday work that they engage in
rather than the output and that again is
disruptive of intellectual property law
doctrine that is we talk in terms of
work the work in intellectual property
the copyrighted work the patented
invention what these people are talking
about is labor they're talking about
everyday work working rather than work
um and you know they they talk about um
work being really really hard uh and
it's not a burden like you know holding
you know walking around with this big
boulder on you the everyday work of
working really hard is is glorious it's
sort of like it's sort of where they see
the value the dignity in the in the work
so they talk about the dogged pursuit of
a novels ending for example how crafting
a story can be painfully mechanical
creating software program mill is like a
military operation creating music is
like bricklaying putting these pieces
together so these analogies are these
metaphors of durable hard laborious work
to intangible products was actually very
interesting and to me that suggested
what they really cared about where they
this is where they saw the value
of their work so here's an example I
think of writing having some
similarities to exercise it being
something that I need to do every day
there's the everyday nature of it what
gets aren't working every day it's not
really explicable there are plenty of
people who don't have to exercise every
day but when I do I feel better so what
makes her a writer how does she work
every day it's the kind of thing that
she just has to do and it's like
exercise its physical for her here's an
example of time and the value of time to
this artist I usually work pretty small
just in notebooks and my agent was like
well you got to make bigger ones and the
gallery said yeah you need to make
bigger ones there was laughter in the
room because the gallerist was there it
was like yeah but you know I could spend
a long time working on the little ones
so you could charge for them that's what
the artist was saying and they're like
that hurt her agents no it's that size
it has to be that price and she says I
just don't understand it so she says the
value of her work is how much time she
puts into it how hard she's been working
on it but the art market and the art
market is going to be determined by
something that she just doesn't
understand so time for her is what is
meaningful whereas the the way the
market is going to value it is quixotic
there were a lot of natural metaphors in
their explanation of everyday work they
would talk about harvesting inventions a
vice president of a company with harvest
inventions through a chain of command
seeding ideas to scientists writing is
like fishing these are natural metaphors
and for those of you who don't know
intellectual property will not protect
natural things does not protect facts
does not protect ideas does not protect
laws of nature so the idea that where
they have they are describing what is
being made in what is valuable in
natural terms is is the beginning of a
misalignment a profound misalignment
between how intellectual property maps
onto creative and innovative work and
how they are describing their creative
innovative work other metaphors resonate
with the family structure and this once
I say it it will be obvious to you
people talk about their work like
children or like family or like puppies
for example someone comes to us here and
says I have a story about as a boy and
his dog this is a company who takes like
toys or media
properties he calls them like the Star
Wars property and figures out how to put
them on lots and lots of different
platforms and monetize or commercialize
all those different platforms and his
company creates those other backbones to
the other platforms he says so he has a
lot of creatives on staff who are
creating these other stories he says
listen they come I have a story about a
boy and his dog and we read it we go wow
it looks great unrelated to a client's
work we partner with them we don't take
it over we're different from other
companies where we don't say all right
now we own your property because the
work for hire doctrine would demand that
the company owned the property we
partner with them we take it out
together it's an ethical thing for us
it's their baby it's their child we
don't believe in taking it away from
them we believe in partnering with them
now this is an example in the interviews
when he said this I had my sort of
lawyerly moment where I like yeah right
you know what he's saying he's ethical
he's not like all these other people he
partners with them I want to know
exactly what he means when he says that
what kind of property distribution is he
talking about so that I want I want the
people to know that when I engage in
these interviews you know there are a
lot of follow-up questions two moments
like that and so I got the split
agreement that goes with the employment
situation here and you figure out what
exactly is he talking about and this
company really does consider the work
that people do the creative work so part
of who they are that they're not going
to the work for hire doctrine applies
very very loosely in this company now
not all companies that I talked with had
the same kind of same kind of
explanation for how they how they divide
their work but many many people talk
about what is that people feel towards
their work the way they feel towards
their children or feel towards their
family on that it's very it's an
emotional connection and that of course
leads to overreaching a lot of
overreaching in the in the cut in the
property context other metaphors are
with regard to tangible claim so when
they start talking about how they own or
how they claim or how they want to
divide what's theirs from what it's
others so this is property talk there's
a lot of putting your hands on things
value you can put your hands on that's
like a that's a patent portfolio he's
talking but one of the reasons we put a
patent portfolio together for investors
its value you can put your hands on
wilton
not that's not at all what it is but
that's the way he's describing it
breaching DRM is like shoplifting
patents are chips for trading taking
idea is stealing someone's homework I
love this one plagiarism is standing on
someone else's scaffolding the idea of
taking someone's language is standing on
the scaffolding of something and got
things like what is the scaffolding
around it's sort of an interesting
metaphor and what saw what's interesting
about these again is that so
intellectual property protects
intangible things it is a random largely
policy-driven line in the sand between
what is protected and what is not what
is not we could change that line with
just a flick of a switch in Congress and
yet the way they're talking about is in
terms of tangible things where the line
is pretty clear the difference between
mice you know my bag and the rest of the
property in this in this room is pretty
clear my house in your house tangible
property claims are not ambiguous but
intellectual-property claims often are
and so they're putting them into these
terms that are antithetical and really
don't fit onto intellectual property
regimes and so what I'm hearing all the
time is this misfit between what I know
to be IP rules and the professional
values of the people who are governed by
them and so one of the things that then
one has to wrestle with when you see
this misfit is what does it matter how
is the misfit you know people are
getting along along maybe anyway and we
have a lot of we care a lot in legal
regulation that there is an alignment
that is optimal between the people who
are being regulated by the law the
reasons for the law and how it is
operationalized and if there is such a
big gap between how people imagine
claiming and in value and the way IP
talks about itself I can't help but
think that there is there is some sort
of problem which I think we are actually
seeing in in the public debate so how
does this mismatch manifest the mismatch
manifests primarily through over
enforcement and under enforcement and
often also by mistakes this mistake when
they before they understand how it works
so in the mistake context you'll hear
people say things that are wrong but
that reveals
they care about and then when they do or
do not whether they know or do not know
they will then over claim or under claim
what they have which also gives you a
sense of where they would draw the
boundaries so I'll give you some
examples of that this is important
because the balance that intellectual
property strikes between exclusive
rights and what's in the public domain
is a balance that is supposed to protect
the public domain for everyone to work
with it and optimize private rights so
that you will recoup what you made we're
not going to give you private rights if
you don't need them intellectual
property is otherwise wasteful so over
enforcement and under enforcement is a
problem from regulation standpoint so
here is a painter look ultimately I
paint because I want to share my visual
sense of how I see the world how I see
color with other people I think I've got
to not be totally possessive about that
so this is in response i always ask
questions that tested the tolerance of
what would otherwise be infringement so
i asked him how would you feel if
somebody put paintings on a t-shirt and
started selling them on the corner he's
i gotta not be totally possessive about
that like that's my work is about
sharing we're just sharing my sense of
the world so long as someone is doing it
in a way that I felt was up to quality
you know so now he's switching so on one
hand he's under enforcing his his
copyright and here he's going to over
enforce cuz if it's doesn't he doesn't
like the way he's doing it if you think
they're degrading your work that's one
thing all of a sudden he's going to want
to assert some control if there is some
critique of his work or it's a way he
doesn't like it now both of these this
is this is under enforcement he's not
enforcing the full extent of it putting
a painting on a t-shirt would be
copyright infringement if it's a
verbatim copy this is not enforceable
this is probably a fair use a derogatory
or a critical representation of
someone's work is probably within the
fair use context but he wants to enforce
it so that's an example of both this is
a venture capitalist in the telecom
industry who used to work for Microsoft
actually
I think that's the first time I've been
able to say that but a long time ago um
we talked about like in that you know in
the context we talked about patents
we're filing all the time and you say we
just can't believe that some of the
things are novel and not obvious but we
feel like we have to have them at the
very least so that we can wave them in
somebody's face even though it's a kind
of nuclear war so this guy's not making
any mistake he knows exactly how the
patents work how the patent system works
the meme of nuclear war and patents is
at this time wasn't so common this was
many miss was four years ago it has now
become the thing that we are all talking
about but um but he's going to use the
peace and over enforce ambiguous and
over broad patents just to stare down
competitors even though he thinks they
are unenforceable here is a musician who
says ripping cds is just free marketing
i mean because people who that actually
buy CD is going to still be there you
know but I feel like if you're not going
to buy it and you're going to give it to
a friend great so there's the under
enforcement she's gonna let people rip
cds for good reason um if you're going
to give it to five friends that's fine
cuz I'd rather you have it if you're not
going to buy it I mean I'm not saying I
want everyone to do that so she's not
saying she always wants that to happen
obviously because like i said i'm still
depending on the sales but i mean i
discover a lot of good stuff like
someone just bringing me a CD you know
so she's striking her own balance in the
over enforcement and an optimal it to
create an optimal enforcement and she
said she thinks she's in control of that
balance now why is she changing the
balance that copyright has otherwise
struck for her why is she doing that so
this is not the how of the mismatch but
the why of the mismatch and you can see
in this in this quote she's doing it one
to build an audience she wants to build
an audience we can either call it market
share or relationships with people she
wants to build an audience she also
understands that sharing is as
productive of other of other goods that
there is a productive element to sharing
freely but she's also doing it to make
money so the more building the market
share is to make money and the building
the market share is to have
relationships people so these are the
these are the three primary categories
of why people rejigger the balance for
themselves insofar as they are in
control
one of the things I say at the end of
the book is your lucky if you're in
control I mean most people are not in
control of how intellectual property
affects them and in it's naive to think
that we are in control of that we are
really at the whim of it but so people
mismatch over enforcer under and forced
to make money they over enforce or under
enforced build relationships usually
it's under enforcing to build
relationships and they often um over
enforce or under enforced to enhance
autonomy over there over there
professional trajectory and that's about
the time in the space they're doing it
to create their own situation as best as
they can so um here's an example of
in-house publishing company saying
something like that um he's counsel at
an in-house publishing company a
for-profit publishing company and he
said we took all of our drm off because
it was driving customers crazy and I
don't blame them this was a really hard
decision for this company he had to
really lobby for a long time to take the
drm off their content because people
were worried that stuff is going to get
steel and was going to be to leaky and
they were going to lose money but he had
said we had to customer service people
doing nothing full-time but holding the
hands of customers who pay for the stuff
and couldn't use it I said this is not
so we lose so people shoplift you know
what happens it happens it turned out to
be a great choice for this company they
didn't lose nearly as much money as they
thought they were going to lose this is
an example of under enforcing letting
leakiness happen in order to build the
company stronger um so it's about
relationships with consumers and making
money here this is an in-house patent
attorney who's trying to convince
scientists to engage in patent
disclosures to file patents with him he
says to science what I want is something
i can trade that as the patent will help
me trade I'm not interested in asserting
these against anyone so I'm not
interested in using the patents to claim
rents from somebody else I'm looking for
something that either gives me a quid to
trade there's the quid that is you have
something I something let's collaborate
and trade that's cross-licensing people
do that a lot or we patent it first so
that some other company can't patent it
and then come to us for a hundred
thousand dollars you're royalty so some
other person can't use it offensively to
prevent us from doing what we're doing
so he's using the patent system
explaining how the patent system is
going to work to help scientists keep
doing what they're doing this is
basically a justification you want to
keep doing your research I need to get
these patents filed so that you can
continue this is about autonomy
professional autonomy and everyday work
and it's a form of under enforcement
this is not how patents were initially
imagined to be used people use patents
offensively most the time to get rent
from them not defensively to protect
other people from attacking this is a
blast example from this category uh this
is an author who says I never sell a
book until it's finished I don't take an
advance because it's too nerve-racking
to have a deadline I've worked on
deadline for years as a journalist but
that's a different matter cuz I'm always
terrified with a book that I won't be
able to finish it I mean because it just
means i have to work my ass off doing
something else well not anymore cuz now
i live off my royalties notice like
she's figured out a way to manage it um
but in the past I just kept doing for
example I might have a weekly column in
a newspaper or something like that I
could not get off in a day and a half
and the rest of the week I could work on
my book so she is under exploiting her
copyright she could transfer her
copyright for a lot of money today and
then to a publisher um but she's not
doing that is she initially as an
advance she's not doing that because she
wants to be free to write at her own
speed at her own time and so by the time
the manuscript is done the trick the
advance might be different it might be
less it might be more but she doesn't
care that much what she's doing is she's
trading whatever advance she's getting
for control over her time so that is the
under enforcement to establish autonomy
so I think what these this misalignment
the under enforcement and over
enforcement exposes are other stories
other stories that I've mentioned at the
beginning values of collaboration and
sharing and cross-licensing for example
and self-determination in the breach of
what is otherwise an orthodox IP story
is that we need IP just set devised the
production of more stuff because we need
to recoup through IP the value of our
investment there are lots of that is
just not the story the dominant story I
am hearing I mean it's not the only
story definitely not the only story I'm
hearing so these other this mismatch
tells me more now what you do in
qualitative work is you
I figure out what some of the
hypothetical relationships might be
between these categories so I'm
hypothesis-generating i'm not drawing
conclusions because i can't i can't make
a i can't say how this stratifies over
larger larger population but this is
what I'm seeing I am seeing so not much
misinformation to make money not much
over enforcement to establish
relationships but in all the other grids
of the forms of the mismatch and the
reasons for the mismatch I I can I can
see them correlating and predominantly
under enforcement is the major form of
mismatch and autonomy enhancing freedom
over your own creative and innovative
work is so important that they the mist
the misalignment all three versions of
the misalignment occur so um under they
under there's too much IP essentially
they need it less than they that's less
than they have and freedom sort of the
dignity to be free to work as you want
which is not what we talked about
intellectual property as being at all is
one of those things that is so important
that they are squishing it and
stretching it to IP to to achieve it so
that to me is pretty interesting and
what it tells you is that IP is just one
small piece that IP as as traditionally
conceived is really one very small piece
of scientific and artistic progress
which is what the Constitution says IP
is supposed to be for and if you figure
out how do they make money that is how
do they make do which is that what we
think I p is for is to make help you
make money IP is actually at the very
bottom of the way they actually make a
living even folks in pharma even folks
in filmmaking um the way they describe
earning a living and building these
relationships and growing their business
is through contract through first mover
advantage complementary products
building a market share by giving away
or under enforcing personal
relationships loyalty and reputation is
dominant among the stories about how
they build and why their company is so
successful and they do talk about
defensive uses of IP and
offensive use of IP but really not as
much as one would think and so the
diversity of revenue streams here is
really an old-fashioned way of doing
business you know when I speak at Sloan
next door and I put that thing up that
slide up there like of course that's how
business works like what did you think
and then I said then why is everyone
talking about IP as it is the essential
mover in our digital age why are we
saying that it is a cornerstone of
technological innovation it really is
not if my data is is the beginning of
what I will find if I do this more and
more open and fair competition is really
where a lot of the innovation comes from
not lock down technologies community and
identity centered innovation that is
innovation that happens in
collaborations rather than in the Eureka
moment in a garage for example IP is
present but is really not uniformly
dominant and so the incentive story I
think is really replaced by these other
stories or at least it coexists in a
very robust way and so one of the
mysteries to me as someone who lives in
the legal world is why is the incentive
story so persistent that is we talk
about it all the time this origin story
and what IP is for you can't read an IP
case without hearing a mantra and so I
have two hypotheses but they are just
just guesses one is that the incentive
story is a simple one it is a simple
care in the stick rational actor model
where law and economics has dominated
the study of law and regulation for 50
years it is a simple story and the story
that I'm telling us much more
complicated it's a much more complicated
story about how people work why people
work what facilitates work and as
between the simple and the complex
people just default to the symbol the
other suggestion is that default to
money that is we need IP to recoup
investment just feels more objective
everyone needs money we can measure
money how much money goes in and out and
the objectivity of that baseline feels
like we can all agree on it but when you
talk about relationships we talk about
autonomy we talk about collaboration
that feels fuzzy and subject
if it feels like something that maybe
people will have different levels of
tolerance for and money is one of these
things that is a common denominator
everybody needs it I'm you know maybe
you have some other suggestions I am
open very open to the persistence of it
I mean I have some cynical ideas too but
i won't i won't talk about those here so
one of the things that i'm working on
now is trying to figure out how is I how
can i pee be better aligned but as I
think we need to keep our systems leaky
that is perfect alignment is a bad idea
perfect enforcement of law generally is
a form of dictatorship if you can't live
in a world where law is perfectly
enforced so then the question is what
amount of flexibility should we be
building in the system and who gets the
benefit of that flexibility currently we
have fair use regimes we have exceptions
and we have private rights there's a lot
of critique that those fair use regimes
amend the exemptions are not clear
enough to give the flexibility to users
and prosumers and that we should be
rejiggering that balance what you know
what is the kind of flexibility we need
in which would this this study suggests
that people have too much they don't
need as much as they have we could
easily roll it back and not affect
whatever incentive might actually exist
so uh there's a Howard Gardner over the
Harvard School of Education talks about
good work being about alignment optimal
alignment between your work and your
place of work and the regulation of your
work and I think that's what I'm
thinking about is that optimal alignment
really is something we need to work more
towards and ironically that's what IP is
about it's about balance intellectual
property is about striking a balance
which makes it different from property
real property for example um and I think
that these these interviewees are
talking about how they strike a balance
and we should probably listen to them so
that's the first three chapters and I
would love to hear your thoughts and
questions or hypotheses
do I do the calling music okay rotten
yeah thank you for that and I'm with you
on the instinct to say IP often doesn't
have a particularly new on sense of why
people do things where creators and
artists and bruises do things I feel
like there there's two thoughts so one
is I have a different answer for you for
like why I would like to hear in it and
I'm thinking of like mark rosas book
authors donors yeah right so it's like
maybe there was this move in 1710 that
said this was always a law that was
actually regulating distributors and it
was like why would a distributor want to
invest in a creator but then they pinned
it to authors and ever since then it's
like it's always had to justify itself
about creativity and creativity is
multi-dimensional and money is only a
part of it in fact artists off and now
they're kind of contentious are
ambivalent relationship to money and so
this distortive quality of like look
there's production that reputation
there's meaning there's expression their
sales but then we take this mechanism
but the mechanism was really about why
would a publisher yeah say I'll take
your book and I'll make a thousand
copies in the guy next door and then
make a thousand copies on the cheap
right right so it's that weird yeah so
in some ways asking like is this
matching what creators actually do like
mrs. effect this was never really
formulators in the first place mm-hmm
and so maybe we're still hanging on to
this like you know 300 year old yes
swamp a little bit yeah but but the
other thing I would say is I wonder if
there are moments in here where when
you're talking about over enforcement
under enforcement it's not it's not
exactly the premise of IP that they are
either using misusing over using its
business models that have built
themselves on IP so for instance when
the guy says I strip the drm because it
was annoying like customers I'm zone pay
for the problem mm-hmm there's nothing
in copyright that says you have to
impose drm that's one model for how you
would extract revenue based on a
financial relationship that's then it
will equip with DRM and you know
to try and write up right after all that
stuff right and some of the things about
the advance right right it's not that
when you get an advance you exchange
copper at that moment that's a contract
that says I'll pay you twice yeah for
the exchange of information you know the
the right exchange that happens when you
hand me the book right so saying I'm not
gonna take in advance because that gives
me more freedom it's not actually an IP
adjustment it's a I don't like the
contractual model that my publishers
offering so I'm gonna forgo that model
right because i like the independence
right so i'm wondering if their moments
where like yeah yeah I don't want to
argue like to defend copper because
there's a million problems way the idea
of like we thought of copper it as this
is going to be a right to assignments so
that in certain conditions people can
act on it mm-hmm one of them's we've
seen in two hundred years is we went
from you know lots of people in the
eighteen hundreds think you know it's
not bothering with copper register right
to this thing of like if you have a
copper you're supposed to act on every
soon copy every little moment right
right it right and then authors and
artists and producers saying well
sometimes and i'm glad i can make an
income but I don't I'm you know and what
they're struggling against is either the
application of copyright modern
application of concurrent or these
business models that premise on
copyright yeah had a whole bunch of
other yeah I like this idea of industry
structure pre pre channeling certain
uses I think that's helpful let me just
I'll get that so what you say is true
mark rosas book is very important if
that's going to my cynical response at
some level and I do think there's some
good theoretical work out now that
suggests that how intellectual property
actually works today is a form of
post-industrial capital that that's it's
a form of shareholding and it's and that
we should be thinking about in terms of
a trust relationship and that it really
is a corporate asset rather than
anything else and i would agree i would
absolutely agree that is how it is
function that has lawyers that's how
lawyers collected um but it no bill will
pass Congress or even get past a
committee if we say what I p is for is
for the company's of the world it always
boils down to the employees facilitating
certain lifestyles it's about
authors and inventors and that's in part
because that's what the Constitution
says authors and inventors is because
the ideology of American individualism
in the United States it's got to be
about that one person or that one
individual if we were to accept that it
is about corporate ownership what what
we would then have to wrestle with and
I'd be fine with that that would be more
honest truly what we would then have to
do is okay all these individuals who are
either parts of companies or independent
we still have to motivate them to work
and what do they care about they care
about the terms of their job they care
about terms of labor so what this then
becomes is a question about labor
relationships that is a super important
move because no I mean you know I've
been accused of being a Marxist when I
say things like that but that's really
what if this is really about labor
relations we need to worry about how
these contracts we have no control our
have we negotiate these contracts
non-compete agreements for example I
mean there is the myth of consent and
negotiation over these things we have no
we cannot negotiate these things and yet
that so I think it would be very healthy
move to say what this is really about is
about corporate assets and company
ownership but I really doubt that that
is where the pot the political
conversation will go especially since
the most recent downfall of strong IP
which is SOPA and PIPA in past 22 years
really came from this ground swell up of
Internet users and so that just fomented
this idea that lots and lots of
individuals really care about
intellectual property in a different
kind of way and to sort wrestle it back
from corporate ownership but I agree the
other thing I'd say though about this is
when i interviewed corporate entities
under the guise of confidentiality which
is why it was so important they
confirmed that intellectual property was
not all that critical to their corporate
welfare that pharmaceuticals they need
patents a lot of the time but not as
much as you would think and what makes
the what makes the drug so expensive has
a lot to do with direct marketing to
patients and so even the even if we buy
that distributors claim to need the IP
to do it why else would they do it
that's not really what I was hearing
most of the time
I'd say they they do it more but not it
not as much as one would think yeah so I
think I've sort of answered the the
industry structure there are a bunch of
people so one of the things I could do
next is and some people are I doing this
it's figure out how different industries
structure their relationships with
creators and see how that manages the
different people have done that with
Hollywood people are doing television
you could do it a lot there's a lot of
work on that bench scientists uh I what
you would trace is how the exploitation
or non exploitation of whatever right
you might have changes as it goes up the
chain in the industry in in the
organization that would be really
interesting but in the end of the day
what I am seeing is that people are just
not using as much as they have so that
author is not exploiting what she has
she's rejiggering it most of the
companies are doing that too and in law
when you have more than you need it's
called waste an intellectual property
it's particularly bad if you have more
than you need because the people who are
the losers if you have too much there's
a whole group of people in the public
domain who are excluded from something
that you claim not to need but you can
control and it's totally at your control
whether you get that cease-and-desist
letter is totally up to the property
owner not to you and so if the the
boundary is drawn too large and people
are under exploiting whenever they want
there actually is a tangible harm to the
rest of us and in fact to them when they
are users themselves we really we try
not to draw the lines too big an
intellectual property for that
particular reason because it's so hard
to know when we are when we are
infringing somebody else yeah yeah it's
really fun stuff I mean condrey and
anthropologist at MIT oh great and yet
really enjoyed it I follow up a little
bit here on this question because that
was my cynical view too it's just ways
for companies to extract rent and
they'll call it whatever they want it's
already set in stone and and the lawyers
enforce it anyway it doesn't matter what
the Constitution says about fair use for
today um but then I was I mean so I the
comment
art is to say I'm not entirely convinced
there because we're are wondering
there's a quibble they shackle but the
wind Jack Valenti is argue against VCRs
he's not arguing for the creators of
movies as much as for the destruction of
an industry by the evil Japanese right
and I think a little so too with the
Mickey Mouse infinite extension of
copyright that Walt's not worried about
Mickey Mouse anymore yeah you know but
so the idea that it should be for a
company is not so far it seems to me
from where they're enforcing copyright
but I don't know the legislators
probably have a hard time saying it but
it is it the yeah sure feels differently
i'm not sure yeah i mean i think you're
right it's a bait and switch the yeah
innovation and creative idea but there's
leakage even in that logic but my
question and i was sort of thinking like
I'm totally winded it is wonderful stuff
I thought one way to extend it perhaps
and if part of the mission here is to
say look we need a better understanding
of how I p works and and one part of it
is motivating people artists and
creators inventors the other part of it
it seems to me they could get the
corporate side a little more sympathetic
is the notion that in fact like the DIA
anti drm guy saying we got to open it up
or else it's bad business yeah even that
in fact and I you know you say well
where is there any test case of this we
say music is the texture days where
Napster becomes free now it is free yeah
but and anybody can get it for free but
there are ways to make business even in
the midst of free n 10 so that's it
seems to me that's a way because the
companies themselves I think they know
this yeah they're not then I'm going to
writers and saying hey will enforce your
IP that's why you should be with me so
doing my way right say that broader yeah
so what's so interesting so what I want
to say about Disney and Jack Valenti is
that those were really identity claims
they sounded in property claims what I
made this real
the important thing I should be able to
keep it as long as I want and whatever
value people get at it I should reap the
benefit of that but really Disney didn't
want Mickey Mouse didn't want porn
Mickey Mouse he didn't want derogatory
Mickey Mouse he wanted to be able to
control Mickey Mouse because Mickey
Mouse was his baby and we have lots of
good historical evidence suggesting that
the reason you want to extend copyright
to save Mickey Mouse was because you
don't want anyone else touching Mickey
Mouse he knew that Disney was never
going out going out of business and
that's an important thing the question
whether we need IP to protect the
business what I think you said is true
there are I mean I was just arguing with
this student the other day about this
who was complaining that the video that
film is going to go the way of music and
I thought I don't even know what that
means because the way of music is pretty
good right now I mean it's some people
there's a lot more music and a lot of
people are listening to a lot of
different music so when you say the way
of film is going to go the way of music
do you mean that the film industry is
going to change and disaggregate the way
the music industry has done and yet that
really upset him he didn't like the idea
of the big six movie companies not still
controlling the making of music of
movies and when he thought his people
were going to sort of the value of the
product was going to was going to be
lower because it wasn't housed in this
glorious space um but what I said to him
is jut mean it is inevitable that
industries shift over time and if what
we're seeing is the renegotiation of the
intellectual property line is that it is
promoting the shifting of industries in
ways where innovation is occurring I
think we should embrace that and the VCR
is a perfect example of that the music
industry is an example of that I am sure
the film industry is going to go that
way I mean just look at netflix and
amazon the way movies are made
differently now we are going to see
different industries building up around
it and one of the interest i mean i'm
not a cause and effect kind of person
even though i'm elora I'm more like an
exciting to be an explainer it would be
fun to try to figure out how the change
in intellectual property relations is
related to how these industries are
developing out from under them I mean
it's not that musicians don't care about
exploiting their copyright they still do
you hear all the arguments about pinned
or royalties and stuff like that
but it but the importance of copyright
in those spaces for the distributors is
really quite different today than it was
so I do think industry specific studies
like an anthropologist could do better
than I can would be really helpful to
compare I mean the pharma industry is
just right but you can't embed in pharma
they don't let you do it it's just been
tried and it's not getting anywhere yeah
what you just said about um musicians in
Pandora it seems like a lot of the
argument about trying to enforce IP for
songwriters with pandora is actually
sort of a different space where it's
it's almost like um if the CEOs of
Pandora were not taking home hundreds of
millions of dollars but we're earning
60,000 a year I don't think they would
care so much it's the sense of other
people are getting rich on it and I'm
not getting a fair cut it's an it's a
fairness argument fairness argument
about where did the assets right an
intellectual property has nothing to do
with I mean on the one hand we can say
an Electra property has everything to do
with fairness because the way we strike
that balance has to do with equity it
has do distributive justice who's going
to get to use things for free and who's
going to have to pay on the other hand
we've never talked about intellectual
property property rights in terms of
like equality or and equity you don't we
and and what you say is true i mean i
see all over the dado the kind of
infringement that they tolerate are ones
where they can sort of explain both
sides there's like a fairness well they
couldn't pay it's okay it's not a big
deal you know but where you know that
gallerist that gallery is taking home so
much money and i still can't pay my rent
like that's wrong you know that doesn't
that if you brought that to a to a court
like they just think that it has no
relevance to intellectual property law
and yet that's exactly the way the
artists and in fact the business people
think about it so one of the projects
that I've started doing is trying to
attach progress the notion of
progress in the Constitution to equity
to notions of equitable distribution it
is not in the history of the
Constitution but i think it is shortly
after we think i think you can make the
argument that the kind of progress of
science and art that people care about
is related to equitable distribution of
goods via access and ownership and that
would be you know I've been accused of a
lot of things that would really start I
mean that would that's trouble that's
trouble for for property theorists you
know but I mean I think that's really
what people do care about you know and
as a lawyer I know that I can convince
people not to bring cases if you can
settle on fair terms when they're really
going to push it even when they're going
to lose is when they think it's
profoundly unequal that's when they're
gonna do it even if they're gonna lose I
want to skewer you in the media I don't
care because what you've done is wrong
according to my rules yeah so I really
appreciated yes you had all this your
engineering people and they expressed
maybe a interpretation or understanding
of hungry that's closer to what we were
just talking about where they their
belief about how it works or opt work is
different than how you know it does work
yeah how did you handle those moments
alright so that's really hard as a
teacher that's a really hard thing so
usually the way I literally handled it
was I wrote down on the piece of paper
and then I turned out that at the end of
the interview I turned it off and said
let's go back and talk about how you are
confusing plagiarism and copyright law
for example right so because I thought
it was my some level I wanted to help
them you know uh the where it happened
most with with copyright was attribution
problems like they thought the copyright
mandated attribution and that failure to
cite plagiarism was a copyright harm and
that is just not even close to what
copyright does you know you attribution
is not know we're mandated anywhere in
any of the intellectual property
statutes except possibly trademark but
really loosely so that was one of the
major misunderstandings and they were
really upset about that that really
upset them thought was just wrong
another one was in in terms of a lot of
people talk about ideas stealing took my
idea so a different kind of plagiarism
and ideas are not owned non-patent non
copyright but they I have a hard time
when i read the interviews trying to
understand what they mean by ideas
really um but they don't mean what we
they clearly think they own more I think
then the intellectual property statutes
would allow them to so it's interesting
their flexibility and some lots of
flexibility lots of tolerance also gives
way to very sort of strong moral claims
otherwise which I think have watched
with personality issues rather than
anything else not really it's not about
investment although sometimes it is
yeah kind of a methodological question
so you've got a tricky situation where
you're trying to counter a story the
incentive story that's being imposed on
the messiness of creativity yeah but
you're counting on people's stories
about how why they made stuff which is
itself a story so I want yeah how do you
deal with the moments where you're like
there are stories about why you create
them yeah so awfully so you know like
yeah just spray okay right right right
right people or I just want my don't
want to own things I want to give them
more like puppies like what is that
right that's a important question so all
right there places where you sort of
where you worried that you were right so
um i usually get that from the
economist's in the room so this is your
tongue what people say not what people
do kind of question and so fair enough
it's an important question so I'll say
just first of all I really care about
how people describes their life I really
think that the language we use and the
way we assert ourselves through
discourse is really a primary way of
constituting ourselves and our
relationships so I actually think the
way we explain things matters a lot
concretely a lot that being said I
really try tried and this was from my
training not as my training as a
qualitative researcher actually came
late in life my later in life my
training as a lawyer was really helpful
here I really treated this as sort of
depositions they would say something I
would then try to get try to test what
they said through other mechanisms so in
in when you're collecting facts in in
litigation and you're doing a deposition
you want to make sure that it's not just
a one-off that they're going to repeat
what they said over and over again in
lots of different ways for different
examples just to sort of nail it down
and so I would do that so they would say
like I didn't really want to own it I
want to give it away like puppies and
then later on they'd say something and I
would try to ask a similar question that
I think would get a similar answer and
see if they gave me the same kind of
answer so are they consistent rather
than just telling me a tale that said
narrative arcs like the way you
explained things like where you came
from why you know why certain things are
important to you though head out those
have explanatory force in the world and
that's really what law is all about
generally speaking unfortunately so
law is about the persuasive story and so
I I think in so far as that's what we
care about in law and that's how we make
laws and that's how we adjudicate laws
we should be listening to their stories
to you know their story should matter
just as much as the one that lawyers
craft so then it's just a tit for tat
but I i agree i did collect a bunch of
documents and i asked a lot of questions
about what people how people behaved
rather than how they explain things so
tell me about you know how you
negotiated that contract and what were
the deals you know so I I asked a lot of
factual questions that would describe
behavior as well to do that so but yeah
it's an important question for method
for methodological purposes yeah yes I
know we're over time but in terms of the
three categories that you mapped out on
your matrix um the three different ones
right so the the different kinds of
mismatches and the what and the reasons
for them yeah um for making money
establishing essential relations and
enhancing freedom are you I might listen
true categories yeah yeah um so I work
with Nancy and we do methodology stuffs
or Annette called yeah so as a
qualitative researcher I'm going but can
you give us some of the backstory on
which yeah but what were like two or
three categories that didn't make the
final three yes oh you mean what what
how did I pairs no perfect that's a
great question okay so that so right so
I had when I'm trying to figure out what
are the ones I'm gonna showcase there
are all these ones i didn't i didn't put
in right right right like fairness right
or however one so i am very insecure
about these categories i should say so
it's all it takes a qualitative
researcher like the whole apart you know
make me naked in front of you all um so
one of the things one of the things that
I am Allah right now one of the things
that you know I still have those dreams
as a professor I show up on one of the
things that I am working with is making
these more granular so I mean I do have
a list and i gotta say i'm not gonna i
can remember what was also there
oh oh oh um a competency so like um
improving your own work that is
challenging yourself to do better for
example and that actually becomes a
category later on in the book in terms
of distribution but i think it probably
could be here to them establishing
essential relations can be pulled apart
in lots of different ways I mean and
really as a as a first stab at the
analysis of this data this is crude I
mean look at this chart like you know I
mean you know stata could produce
something like really big beautiful
thing if I was doing it quantitatively
this is sort of you know rudimentary but
um yeah these are these are large
categories and if you can imagine the
way I would code it so I have a code
book on Atlas that has has 300
categories it has you know it has
litigation patent copyright it has
license and all these terms and but also
has dignity fairness abuse reputation it
has like all these other things which
you're not hearing right but if I I
could sort my those are all things that
I added as i was reading and then i
would start attaching those codes to
different parts of the transcript and
inevitably what happens is they start
clumping and i have to give the clumps
names but in those clumps there are
there's lots of codes attached to them
so like last night i'm giving a talk in
a couple weeks to celebrate the 20th
anniversary of one of the big fair use
cases campbell versus acuff-rose about
the 2 Live Crew a pretty woman song and
I've decided I'm going to talk about
this fairness thing and so I started
looking at all the parts of the
interviews where people talk about
unfair and fair those codes in
particular and what I'm seeing is what
those codes are next to you know how
they're how they're clumping you know
it's a difference I'm getting something
different not unrelated but it's it's a
it's a new dimension to
analysis really what this is about is
how does the IP story the Orthodox story
math on to these folks and I think the
crude mapping is good enough to make the
case which I want to make which is we
need to reform intellectual property law
and we need to stop talking about the
way that IP is working when it's not
that this is enough but I think to sort
of tell more specific stories about like
you're saying to get more granular right
you got to go back to the data and tell
see what else it's telling you but right
so competency was one of it challenging
yourself competency the fairness fair
and unfair was there i think i had a i
think i had with reputation I had like
dignity harm and like derogatory dignity
like different forms of reputational
injury was in there so reputation as a
whole chapter but there's lots of
different ways that reputation can be
injured so that would be an example of
one category getting more granular
that's a great question ok we have
treats outside oh the south side and you
can continue chatting with Jessica thing
