you
great so next up I feel like I should be
queuing the Samba music for Brazil is
going to be talking there with SD and
Brazil and they're going to be talking
about platform a collaborative
information system for subway stations
hi thank you very much for coming here
today we are design students from su rio
de janeiro brazil I'm makita my name is
jaquel clatter is also part of the team
but she couldn't be here today let me
really take you through what will be
present today first we are showing our
motivation once identify the problems we
will then explain the proposal then
we'll take a look at the research and
finally we will show you a video that
simulates the project when we began
thinking about the overall theme of a
billion sensors without that senses are
already a reality in your lives so we
decided not to draw inspiration from
technology itself but from salvation of
everyday life situations where you can
use technology to improve public
well-being that when we turn your
attention to the situation of common
people waiting for public transportation
and then focus on the subway platform we
observe three things first of all
waiting is boring and subway platforms
you have nothing interesting to do to
read or even to watch the weight is
experienced as a waste of time that's
why we use our mobile devices we look at
our last emails Facebook and tweet
Twitter feeds in order to stay connected
then we observe that people along the
subway platform tend to be disorganized
passengers embarking do not respect
people getting up the trains they tend
to cluster together and all know the
best place to stand
then we noticed that the security yellow
line between the train and the people is
mostly neglected in its basic function
and in the space itself we thought then
why not use this neglected area to do
something interesting so the idea is to
use this yellow line as the main
elements of an interactive system to be
sponsored by government funding this
system identifies and understands the
different flows of subway activity from
multiple sensors the lines now use it as
a display area that could be made with
LED a viable technology even though we
haven't go into detail how this sensory
we walk we foresee that the season will
be composed of a GPS to show where the
train is and how long do you take to
arrive presidential sensors located at
the darts able to read how many
passengers are coming or out of the cars
make it possible for the system to know
which cars are more or less crowded so
can better position yourself a movement
sensor that could also recognize hand
gestures able to control the content
shown on the lining we are assuming that
the system identifies holding charge of
this particular section of the lining
then it reacts accordingly the line
adults have a pressure sensors in order
to identifies if any passenger stepped
on it unintentionally in this very
platform operates not only as an
interactive sync information system but
also contributes to users overall safe
leads our search began going to bust and
subway stations and observing the users
behavior the context we have available
to work with well real Janeiro subway
which has you lines and predictable peak
hours consider in this context we
started doing sketches to register the
situation problems and we started to
imagine different interaction solutions
such as moving information along the
line
ways of controlling the it flux and
invention the opening of new connections
and possibilities considering the
legibility requirements of our chosen
context we choose to use simple and
basic high contrast vibration graphics
our main spiration was indigenous
artwork from different origins with its
use of simple elements like arrows
crosses and entrepreneur fake figures we
tried a lot of representations until you
reach a desired shape for each function
we started drawing abstract shapes like
crosses cubes and lines after the first
solution we took these drawings out to
the streets to observe the user
reactions then we arranged to the X of a
subway station and gave you 25 user is
showing them our prototype made out of
fabric right pasted white stripes with
different greg's we asked some questions
like which letter side was more legible
we test the proportions between the line
and written words in greg's we also
asked the users what kind of contents
that you would like to see on the line
it had some interesting boots from their
inserts using the think aloud technique
as most of you but no think aloud is a
technique where users say you are they
think why was paramount in the prototype
those boots have you entered our final
design a decision in order to visualize
the interaction in a more complete way
and to present the whole system we
decide to create a video if simulations
of the movements on a real subway
platform to do that we had to hide the
camera it will disguise the shooting so
let's see it
we haven't finished we do believe that
platform could be applied to other
subway system for instance Paris or
Beijing could develop their own
particular relevant content and cultural
style in short platform as a system
designed to happen in a public space it
provides real-time information on the
functionality of the whole subway
activity it makes use of existing
neglected areas instead of adding yet
another object in the world already
saturated it educates people to behave
better collectively and it feels with no
shared and useful experiences the
otherwise out idle and boring waiting
time thing thank you very much excellent
when Mike do you've any comment Freehan
loves it I think it's a really nice
design idea and I could see obviously a
lot of possibilities with it one thing I
was curious about particularly in your
video there's a moment where the woman
waiting at the track is sort of waving
her hand to the next piece of
information and you chose an interaction
modality there that tends to work well
in non noisy environments but tends to
fail pretty badly in noisy environments
and I'm curious how you research that
that choice in the video what what made
you feel like that was the right
interaction choice for it based on the
other activities that happen around the
line and we think do other kind of
interaction like stepped on it to chose
the information but we thought that this
maybe was dangerous to the passenger so
we think in this way with their hands
and with a sensor that can recognize it
was the best option and I think this is
really well done it made me think of
some work by Tesco which allows you to
go into subway systems and actually
choose buy food virtually and then you
get home your food is delivered to your
home so I think it makes really use
really interesting use of a time like
you said a boring waiting time my
question for you is this things seem to
do everything it teaches me it it tells
me how to behave with others it
entertains me it probably cooks my meals
if I wanted it to what's the what's the
single most what's the what do you think
what need is the highest priority does
that make sense the priority the
priority so right now it can teach me
about things that are going on in the
subway can it can entertain me it can
show me how to act if you were to pick
what the most important need that you're
feeling is what would you say that was I
guess it's this feedback when you step
on it it's just evaluate the safety mr
to organize the platform i think is the
main okay so to keep you from going into
the platform thank you very much so I
don't know it really bugged me your
presentation because you have no
business doing that mature of a
presentation at this stage of your
education that was one of the most
professional presentations I've seen
about a concept and what it did is you
had a you you you you motivated but you
arrived that but motivated a really
clear design language and it pervaded
every single part of your presentation
from the fonts from the graphics between
slides everything that reflected what
was in the design itself and that
clarity and unity gives confidence and
everything you're saying and there's any
had established this kind of confidence
and but also very clear brand value
that's unique to the place and I like
that that was context and I'd like that
you were conscious of that and also said
you could do the same thing but have to
be very different as I
in a different cultural context and so
and and and just the video at the end
trust my worked in this industry you
could you could get a job in a feature
film visual effects house if you can do
that kind of visual effects that you did
there again the film production itself
is worthy if somebody is a graduate
student in film school and and so I just
it reflects on you your other students
who clearly helped work you work on it
and the faculty in the School and I
think that your credit to all of them
and you did a pretty good job especially
in a plan thank you very much thank you
and I see the professor's again
videotaping away Marcos and Ellie on up
there can adjust wave really quickly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
