great thank you very much so it's a it's
really a pleasure and honor to be here
and I I like the freedom to be able to
wander around so it's a it's really
great so my name is Peter Lee I am
extremely pleased to see such a great
turnout for our faculty summit Latin
America is extremely important to us
what I wanted to do with this opening
keynote is to give you an idea of how
Microsoft Research operates and what we
do and the role that research plays in
our company and so let's start the story
I like to tell about research at
Microsoft goes back a long way and in
fact starts with a particular image we
can which is this a stack of pancakes I
realized later that maybe this might
have been better to to have a stack of
tortillas instead of pancakes but but
we'll go with pancakes so so some of you
in fact many of you in the faculty here
and then some students might be familiar
with a classic problem in computer
science research known as the pancake
flipping problem and if not let me
explain it very quickly so imagine a
stack of pancakes and the pancakes are
burned on one side and so when you stack
them you want to make sure to hide the
burns sides and have only the the good
side on top and so now you have a single
operation you can take a spatula and
stick it into the stack of pancakes
anywhere you want and flip those
pancakes over and so now the question is
given a stack of pancakes maybe of n
pancakes minimally how many operations
does it take to reverse the order of the
pancakes and end up in a state
where only the where all the burn sides
are facing down are still hidden now
this is an old problem actually has very
direct relevance in several network
protocols in some resource scheduling
problems and it's actually quite
difficult even after several decades of
work there are closed form solutions
known for n only up to 13 and not beyond
that reason i'd like to show this though
is that the very first research paper
significant research papers published
here was written by Bill Gates in 1979
and this was a back when Microsoft was a
very very small company still as you can
see here from the address in albuquerque
new mexico and incidentally a
co-authored with christmas papadimitriou
who is still a quite a distinguished
researcher and professor at Berkeley who
we still collaborate with today the
point of this is that from the very
beginning even from the very very early
foundations of Microsoft when Bill Gates
was starting the company the idea of
research and the idea that research
could be important to the success of a
company has been there from the from
really early on and as soon as Microsoft
became big enough in milla Gates's eyes
about the time they reached 1 billion
dollars in annual revenues bill set out
to create Microsoft Research with help
of Nathan Myhrvold and and then
ultimately Rick Ratched this importance
of research has been very much in the
lifeblood of the company in fact this is
a quote that I really like from Bill
Gates back in 2002 where he says things
like even software verification then
this is a very deep research topic as
you know even today things like software
verification which has been the holy
grail of computer science for decades
but noun some very key
areas for example driver verification
we're building tools in fact we're
shipping tools today that do actual
proofs about that software how it works
in order to guarantee reliability and
security today and so research is really
something that's just very very deeply
ingrained in in our company what is the
mission of microsoft research since its
founding in 1991 microsoft research has
had the same three-part mission and i
think of this is really three equal
parts of our mission first we have the
mission to advance the field in the
areas we do research and so that is
essentially statement about our
commitment to basic foundational
research second when we come across good
research results we're very committed to
trying to transfer those into our
products and services and then third to
act as a kind of early warning signal or
an insurance policy for the company to
give the company the foresight to look
ahead so that the company will be less
susceptible to technological surprises
to be able to be first ahead of our
competition in the future and thereby
ensure the future for the company on
this products and in our lab we really
look at this as a is a true three-part
mission each one given equal importance
now I mentioned about ensuring the
future for Microsoft and its products
and for that I sometimes have a hard
time explaining to people what does that
actually mean so imagine going to Steve
Ballmer and trying to explain what does
it mean for research to ensure the
future and so for that I actually use a
simple test and I'd like to try that
simple test with all of you here today
so what I'm about to show you on the
screens here is a picture and the
picture will contain several circles and
dots of different sizes in different
colors and what I want you to do is to
determine how many red dots are there
are so how many red dots and you will
have five seconds to complete the task
okay everyone ready all right here we go
one two three four five okay next so how
many blue dots were there does anyone
know one knows he's a researcher so
what's the point of this well our
product groups are exceptionally focused
in disciplines they study the customers
needs and develop a product plan an
execution plan they line up the
engineering development of the marketing
and sales and show exceptional
discipline in just maintaining a sharp
focus on completing those missions and
those product developments and
satisfying our customers needs but
sometimes the world changes and
sometimes there are surprises and in
that situation it's important to have a
part of the company and microsoft
research worldwide represents just one
percent of microsoft to have that part
of the company that has the ability and
the curiosity to think more curious
thoughts and if necessary be able to
step up and inform the company's
executives to be smarter decision makers
and also to solve problems and provide
new technologies and new inventions new
innovations for the company in response
to changing worlds so for that purpose
microsoft research has a global reach we
have seven research labs around the
world and three advanced technology
laboratories and several research
outposts I work in Redmond but here you
can see that essentially the Sun never
sets on Microsoft Research in total
around the world we have about 850 PhD
researchers and
years all really engaged in advancing
field in transferring new technologies
into Microsoft now how do we operate and
what do we do there are three I think
main guiding principles the first one
and maybe the most important one for us
is to hire great people and once we hire
those great people give them all the
resources they need to do their work and
then stay out of the way my boss the
chief Research Officer Rick wretched
tells me almost every week Peter you are
not allowed to tell any research or what
to do and so in that sense I have the
easiest job in the entire company I just
have to make sure we hire good people
and then stay out of the way we go to
great great lengths to engage with
people to identify great talent and to
hire them and we do that in many many
different ways we go and visit
universities around the world we also
develop new talent through internship
programs and through graduate
fellowships and one of our fellowship
programs that we're most proud of is our
fellowship graduate fellowship program
here in Latin America and I'm extremely
pleased that we have a new PhD graduate
fellow from Mexico with us today and
that's Alisa Sheila would you stand
please so I'm going to give them some
graduations
so ELISA is one of only 10 graduate
fellows this year in the in our global
program she is a PhD student at the
national Polytechnic Institute in Mexico
working under Alexander gelb oh and i'm
just very thrilled that she'll be
starting a 12-week internship with us in
redmond i think later in june so i look
forward to seeing you there so thank you
very well much congratulations we have
that form also of engagement with
academia and in fact this faculty summit
is another form of engagement with
academia but really our most important
form of engagement is in our policy to
publish openly almost everything that we
do in the research labs is done in the
name of scientific research and we
contribute greatly in fact several
thousand research papers a year into the
scholarly literature and then finally
our third principle is to embrace
diversity in research and this is a
little bit of a strange notion so I'm
going to come back to this a little bit
later in my keynote talk here all right
so let's go on let's talk a little bit
about research and let me get to one
specific area of research which has to
do with audio processing so one of the
areas of research that we have in our
lab is in trying to do signal processing
for the purposes of better speech
recognition better audio quality and
input but also just to satisfy our
curiosities and so we in fact do
considerable amount of theoretical and
engineering oriented research in various
parts of beamforming audio ray
processing echo cancellation and the
like
and these are just some images from some
recent results in beamforming using a
small audio arrays now we take such
basic research which is something that
you might refer to as blue sky research
something that is just really motivated
by the desire to know more and to
understand more and is oftentimes
largely curiosity driven but then it can
happen that we have ideas like this that
we think can be made practical and be
made as useful tools or technologies
possibly for our own products and
services and so the research team that
was doing work on this beam forming
developed this device which is a test
rig and this is a test rig that has nine
microphones and then has some back-end
processing so that with nine microphones
it's able to calibrate itself
automatically in an arbitrary say living
room or bedroom and then have the
ability to process the audio so that you
can focus its attention on a single
point in the space of that room and so
this is a test rig actually that was
developed as a part of a project called
natal and was tested in about 500 homes
mostly in the in the Seattle area and so
this is an attempt for us to be go from
blue sky research to something disrupted
to try to do something truly new once
that happens then there can come a time
where we become very mission focused
we're a product executive says we want
to turn that technology into a piece of
project and that technology in fact is
in the technology of the Kinect and so
what you see here is a great product by
Microsoft called the Xbox Kinect and
Xbox Kinect is this magical experience
because you can interact with a computer
without any need to hold a controller or
keyboard or a mouse just using your body
and your body motions and by speaking
to the computer you can have complete
control well in fact in that connect is
a four-element microphone array that
uses the adaptive beamforming in order
to allow a person to speak from across a
living room to the xbox with perfect
clarity and think about what's required
there there's no button to push to say
I'm going to speak now you're in an
arbitrary living room it's a very noisy
environment with all of your friends
playing and shouting and laughing and
with the television making it itself a
lot of noise so to give you an idea of
what that sounds like well we listen to
this
but what you hear there is just the
noise in a living room with people
talking and all the music from the TV
blaring and there is actually hidden in
that audio someone actually trying to
speak to the xbox with the beamforming
technology we have this result from the
same audio stream
so you see there's just this amazing
kind of magical clarity and for those of
you that have experienced interacting
with an Xbox through connect and you
wonder how can it be in this noisy
environment that the Xbox sees me and
can actually focus on my voice much as
you might focus on the person's voice in
a crowded room it's this type of
beamforming technology and all of this
helps contribute to the creation of an
innovative product that ultimately when
it came out in 2010 became the fastest
selling consumer electronics device in
all time so as we move on the I
mentioned before that as we operate we
operate as an open research lab so we
publish openly and so in fact the
research behind that audio ray for
Kinect was submitted for publication in
2009 about a year before the the product
was on the market but for that reason
the researchers were not allowed to
mention connect and the primary
researcher here is Yvonne Tasha but we
also have Alex acero and Alex acero is
here today with us attending the faculty
summit and the student intern and so
this paper in fact I just recently
finished reading it it's a brilliant
paper it really sets out the paradigm
for this type of array processing with
very small microphone arrays and of
course we see the results in the Kinect
a funny thing though about this paper is
that it got rejected
and of course many of you here are
researchers and so you've all
experienced this I took some curiosity
on this since connect is one of the
things we're most proud of in our lab
and I read the reviews and the reviews
are quite revealing one review says that
the solution proposed does not obviously
solve the problem at all and the other
reviews are similarly brutal I like the
one that says the paper comes up with an
idea which has serious drawbacks for
realistic scenarios of course the
reviewers couldn't have known that the
papers ideas would be in over 16 million
homes by the next Christmas now there is
a point here though about this and in
fact when I first encountered the
research work that Devon and Alex and
others were going through the they were
showing me their research and I also
didn't know too much about connect and
so I remember leaving their lab thinking
well i'm very happy they're doing such
interesting research but boy they seem
very very optimistic about what they can
accomplish and there is an important
point there and that point is that
there's a very very thin line between a
visionary product concept and science
fiction and in fact as researchers as
faculty members and as students we are
trained to try to understand this
difference between what's a visionary
product and what is just fanciful
impossible thinking and so as sensible
researchers we find over and over again
that we try very hard not to do foolish
things I try hard not to do foolish
things and so part of the magic that I
find at Microsoft Research is that we
can have
generic product designers and developers
who say I would like a technology that
allows an Xbox to hear a voice clearly
from a cross of living room in a noisy
environment and it might take a while
for that visionary product designer to
find researchers willing to try but the
very fact that that discussion takes
place gives the conditions where
something really magical can happen and
in this case with the Kinect magic
really did happen now as I think about
this the way that I organize our labs
research activities is in something
called a quadrants model and this is
something i've been using for the last
few years of research management jobs
that I've had the quadrants depict a
space of all research activities so on
the x-axis you start with research
activities that only make sense to do if
you can get a quick payoff and then as
you go out from the origin you have
research activities that demand patients
then on the y axis we have choices of
problems and so near the origin you have
what I call reactive problems so a
product designer comes and says I need
to be able to solve this audio problem
for this machine vision problem for this
software engineering problem or this
augmented reality problem and we try
hard in those situations to react and be
responsive and solve the problem and
then as you move up the y-axis you enter
into a realm which is the more classical
open-ended search curiosity-driven
search for truth and understanding and
beauty and so now in this space you can
see in the example the day just gave
with Kinect that the
this is a cycle that sometimes we start
with blue sky research ideas but those
blue sky research ideas at some point
turn into a technology where we're
really trying to invent something new
and that technology then can become a
mission for the company to actually
build a product and try to make it
successful and then once we have that
success then we can try to sustain that
success by keep building on the
technology and improving it and making
it better and better and and and more
and more impactful and so this quadrant
model is something that I've taken and
this gets back to the guiding principle
of embracing diversity one of the
wonderful things about computing
research is that it is so diverse we
work in mission focused areas where we
identify a societal or company problem
and try to solve it we work in a
sustaining mode where where every day
trying to improve what we do and make it
better we do research that is blue sky
where we just want to satisfy our
curiosities and just push the frontiers
of human knowledge a little bit further
and we try to invent new surprising
potentially disruptive or game changing
things and so it's just a wonderful
thing in computing research to be
engaged in these things and as computing
educators to try to teach our students
about this wonderful diversity in
computing research and so for that
reason I think we're just absolutely the
best place to be I'm extremely anxious
over the next two and a half days to be
have a chance to interact with as many
of you as possible and hope that we can
share all four quadrants of computing
research together so thank you
thank you so much leader like to invite
