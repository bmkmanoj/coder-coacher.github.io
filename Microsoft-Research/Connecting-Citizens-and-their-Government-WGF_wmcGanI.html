hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
so today we have a jorge Soto who is
going to be our first speaker of
hopefully a series of talks around the
topic of civic media Jorge is the
founder of City box and he's been
working on technologies that empower
citizens to communicate with one another
and with the government's he was named
one of the 35 innovators by MIT tech
review in Mexico few months ago so he
has a lot of really interesting stories
around these technologies in many
different countries so Carly well thank
you very much so we we have this I have
this company this startup called CD box
and we've been doing it's we using
technology to provide tools that engage
citizens to participate to collaborate
between each others and also how they
can t connect to their governments and
it also how the governments or
institutions can receive citizen reports
manage that information and turn them
into an act upon that information I'm
going to show you a little bit what
we're doing how we are doing it but
first of all it it all started during
the Mexicans 2009 elections we were at a
time we had we have found another
company at the time it was an SMS
gateway we provide all the
infrastructure for our companies to send
SMS between each others and we decided
to develop a project to track and
monitor a Mexicans midterm elections it
was the first time something that
happened in in the region what we did is
we put together all the infrastructure
I've already had with the SMS gateway
and we put together a map for citizens
could report and just send all the
information that was going on during the
elections it can be somebody asks you
how to how you vote it or give you money
for your boat which is very common in
Mexico that kind of practice still that
project was called quedamos al rato
which means let's protect the vote and
it was very successful at a time it was
replicated
insert the methodology of that was
replicated in several countries in Latin
America and were the first time that we
realize the real power of the technology
that we had and how citizens really want
to participate if they have the correct
tools for it it was very simple at the
time it was just sending an SMS
validating the information up later in a
map neural analysis of the information
no tracking of the information however
we received around we received around
15,000 reporter would forwarded to the
to the police of those reports
unfortunately back in 2009 the nobody
responded what happened to those reports
but well we've learned a lot from that
process then also in 2009 came also the
Mexican the Mexican government there was
a proposal of taxing the internet there
was a proposal that said that there
should be a three percent extra tax of
using using the internet we was it
wasn't in November 2009 it was a very
stupid idea it was exactly the opposite
of what other governments were doing at
the time so there this academic from
from dunam from the biggest university
in Mexico created a post saying that
internet is a necessity and complain and
with very clear data why this this tax
is regressive they interviewed
congressman and they asked him what do
you think about disposal says our
internet is a necessity and he said
internet is only a necessity to watch
porn and that kind of that came of
comments generated this conversation on
Twitter word with the hashtag internet
cesario which means internationa sesa t
we started collecting all that
information on twitter it was it was
2009 Twitter wasn't a big deal in Mexico
but were the first time that people
understood that that Twitter wasn't just
for saying I'm meeting at this place or
I'm reading this kind of book it did
really help for citizens to express
themselves and to organize themselves
even to order the streets they created
that March called not the case in the
hashtag with means don't stay on the
hashtag let's go to the streets and and
we received around 120,000 different
comments of why Internet's and necessity
we process all those comments we send
them and to an email to every
congressman and woman in Mexico we ask
that Congress a senator what does she
think about his Twitter movement and she
said I don't have a twitter account
because I do have a job so this kind of
this kind of thing really showed that
the initial disconnection of this new
society that was emerging or these new
connections of citizens and how our
government was responding this ended up
for us receiving an invitation to
discuss the this law in the Senate and
eventually the law wasn't approved it
was the first time that that we
understood the power of social networks
it was the first time that politicians
understood the power social networks and
since then the use of Twitter the use of
order or a kind of detail technology has
been used a very very much Mexico to
connect citizens and to alert about
different topics then a 2010 a violence
spread out on entire Mexico I'm sure you
heard about it he didn't happen suddenly
it either it happened very slowly but
the truth is that there was Barry a lot
of indifference from society at the
beginning and then it was resignation we
didn't know what was happening we didn't
we didn't know that the situation could
get so much out of control as it has but
citizens I have eventually started
organizing themselves and creating this
kind of networks to alert themselves and
to come to contrast all the oldest all
the situation there are there are a lot
of movements right now mainly in social
networks that they are trying to tell
the story they are trying to tell the
stories of people is not just 50,000
dead people it's 50,000 names
fifty thousand suns 50,000 brothers and
but the truth is that there are there
are some cities in the north of Mexico
mainly that are one bullet away of
losing their mind there's a lot of
characters lot of panic in several
cities a lot of people don't in anymore
don't go out anymore and nights but what
has happened is they started using
Twitter they started using local forums
to alert themselves and this kind of
self-organized communities emerged
mainly in the north of Mexico and
through particular hashtags people
started alerting themselves around where
they could go out or not for example in
Monterey the north of Mexico there's a
hash tackle empty why follow and at the
very beginning people started saying
there's a gunfight at this place hashtag
amity why follow so whenever it was it
was it was amazing when you go when you
go into ray and everybody's had our bar
or a house of someone and you want to go
back to your place the first thing you
do is you go to twitter follow the empty
way follow hashtag and figure out you
can go to your house and which road to
take this kind of networks are to be a
to b to be honest are very are very self
controlled they work in a very
rotational way to seems to say one thing
but it has worked and it has connected
it has connected citizens and in some in
some in some way i think this kind of
this kind of interactions are
reconstructed social fabric in mexico
it's totally based on trust and we are
understanding that being a citizen
should not be a passive passive function
anymore we are going out to the streets
we are reclaiming our streets back again
and we are filling in the gap where the
government has failed to provide the
services i think new generations we are
not thinking in here kids anymore we are
thinking in networks and we want to see
our governments and our institutions as
nodes with within that network and they
are still our governments and our
institutions are responding this is how
they are right now this is this is the
Department of Administrative
modernization of the mexico city
government
this photo I could have taken this
picture back in 1992 what I took it in
June 2012 so there is there's clearly a
deficit in the agility in the innovation
and in the capacity of our institutions
to respond on how citizens are already
we are connecting ourselves this is how
they are doing analytics this is how
they are managing all the citizen
reports and this is how they are doing
real-time mapping so on the one side you
see you involve a role and governance
across the spectrum is that yeah I
across predict expect I mean all day all
the institutions not only in Mexico I
will show some work or exact examples in
other places not in American a freak
and on the one side we have we have we
have our government we have citizens I
don't trust the government we have a
government that won't cross the citizens
we have a media that is not that is not
reporting what is going on anymore I
don't know you heard borders there was
this major newspaper of Ciudad Juarez in
the north of Mexico that two years ago
there first the front page they said
okay drug dealers we give up what do you
want us to say so these these kind of
things but has and then the government's
also the government doing a signing
actor or promoting this kind of loss
that censor the Internet in some way so
citizens we are like in the middle of
this spiral of fear and how can we we
have no institutions to connect we have
no media that we study the situation and
citizens are empowering themselves and
go into the social networks to connect
and to create these distrusted networks
what these kind of things show for
example there's there's a state in
Mexico call Vera Cruz which is on the on
the east and there's a law right now in
Veracruz that if you report a rumor on
Twitter you can be charged to five years
in jail how do you validate that is
rumor or not it's completely arbitrary
right now so this kind of thing not only
not only hurts the internet which does
but it shows a radical rich connection
between how citizens we are we are
already talking between each other and
how our government is responding the the
truth is that we have 21st century
citizens that are trying to talk to an
23rd 20th century institutions however
and as I told you power structures are
changing and we have a chance to reframe
rejuvenate our institutions and society
shapes technology but the use of the
that technology is shaped by the
conditions in which that society
lips for example Twitter I don't know
how you do you use twitter here in
Seattle where in Mexico is a life-saving
thing it's a it's not a place where i
reap what i say that i'm partying at a
particular place it's a place where i
say don't go to this particular place
because something's going on and just
going ahead of all this context that I
just gave you I'm going into what CD box
is doing so we're taking advantage of
all the situation and we're creating
tech tools for civic engagement we our
main objective is to through technology
to bridge the gap between and among
citizens and their institutions we have
three types of a three types of of tools
when is oriented totally for
decision-makers one is for citizens for
participation and the other one is for
accountability we are in we are in
around ten countries right now mainly
Latin America where we have made some
projects in a Eastern Europe and Africa
and we have work with 50 organizations
1.5 million reports let me let me show
you a bit about this so the first the
first thing it's it's a platform that we
developed its oriented for decision
makers and the main of the main idea is
for them to turn reports into actionable
information so what we are doing it's we
are getting all the detail detail
information that it's already out there
or if it's not already our we try to
encourage their institutions to go for
the information for example open up an
SMS channel open up cause an IVR a
facebook website an email a Twitter
account and then how can and then we
provide him with a platform so they can
manage that information in a much more
efficient way so and they can analyze
also all that information in real time
this is this is the platform so what we
are doing it's integrating different
reporting channels as you can see here
you can see that it can be on facebook
it can be twitter it can be directly
from the web or email or whatever
we are it's like a gmail like interface
where the where the institutions can
actually process the reports validate
the information respond to the seasoned
in a confidential way and analyze
information in real time as you can see
here the reports can have different
status it can have different categories
can be suggested but they create their
own categories and it can have media or
not depending on the on the reporter at
the end is the main objective is to
close the feedback loop the feedback
loop it's this involves this several
stages of the first one is data we need
to measure capture and store data how
can we put the data into context to make
it emotionally resonant then there must
be consequence how can this all this
information illuminate pads for action
and finally action and retirement and
feedback into into the platform once
again each each report as you can see is
you attack it can have pictures you can
have a conversation with with the sea
with the citizen you can have a high
priority or not you can make it public
or private if you want to and it can be
verified or not i'm going to show you
examples of how all these situations are
using it the premise this is all these
that i'm showing you is what decision
makers are looking at its decision
makers can be a government institution
it can be an NGO it can be a company but
this is squared all day all the all the
information are coming through and how
they are responding to an information we
are providing also real-time analytics
so it maps heat maps trends a real time
analysis of all the information and well
this is an on-site complete or
everything is based on comparative
statistics so the main objective is for
you to understand in a in a single view
what is the problem where is the problem
and one is the problem and there's also
the main objective it's for this not to
make much more better if it better
decisions based on real data and not
based on perception zone there was one
example for example that there was this
a major of their of the north of Mexico
that said I want citizens to send me all
the information I want to test this
these tools for and I one citizens to
tell me how should I named in the new
school that I'm building and around
eighty percent of the reports said first
of all saw was the water problem that we
have so it's cool always to read Twitter
school nobody will reply will deny that
we need more schools but there's there
are priorities from citizens and well
there are several views that show you
for the main objectives to make a better
decision so this is all all the data
ones that had media and also one one one
one other thing is that the conversation
is already out there so on the one on
the one hand you have older all day the
channel that you're opening up for
citizens to report and on the other side
all the conversation that is already out
there in Twitter so how can you grab all
that a conversation and also listen to
that conversation so for example if you
if you look at here we are tracking
several hashtags in Monterey nty follow
CAC CAC communities security etc etc and
the idea is that on the one side you
have all the reports are contacting you
directly the other side you have houses
and center in a in collaborating between
each other and that you can also analyze
our conversation and trying to
understand the communities that around
around that conversation so what you're
looking at right now it's it's an
example of all the conversation that
happened during the Venezuelan election
and
well with this the platform we've
implemented this this is the decision
maker platform I'm going to show you
some examples now but this platform is
in Spanish in English in French and
Portuguese in Arabic it's it has AP is
to receive information and to polish all
the information also so there's a
politics there can be a public site or
public applications for citizens to to
also consume the information and it's
centralized is regeneration we've
learned a lot in terms of security the
one that is receiving the reports that
know the identity of the reporter but
they can respond and create a
conversation with citizens and there's
just a public side of this so I'm going
to show you some examples so the back
end the one that I showed you is exactly
the same for all our customers but the
front end is different so for example
this is Venezuelan elections in back in
October 2012 we worked with a group of
young people a younger agron
organization with young people to track
and monitor minus one and selections
there was a call center everything must
be a call center or via Twitter and we
train them on how they should validate
the information how should they take
care of the information or another
themselves and and we work together with
international institutions for that also
the Mexican the Mexican elections here
we work with the it was the same the
same example where we started the
company back in 2009 with we Demoiselle
water but the water 2012 project we've
learned a lot since then we try to work
with with with the official institutions
the Mexican institution that solves
election crimes it's called flippidy is
the Mexican bit like the Mexican police
thats all sorts of crap all crime and
related through elections the problem
was first of all when we when we try to
work with deaf eppadi they and we told
them we're going to create this platform
precision to put to report on to
participate and the first answer was but
that means that I'm going to
then I'm going to receive a lot of
reports and then I'm gonna have a lot of
things to do but that's that that was
the idea received to receive a lot of
reports and for them to encourage
citizens to monitor their own elections
then when they when they agreed that
this was going to happen with or without
them they decided to participate and we
said okay let's let's connect our
platforms give us an API so we can send
you all the information in real time
once we we will be responsible of
validating all the citizen reports we
will do that so we created a theme a
team of around 50 people that were
trained that were receiving all the
season reports once they were able to
validate the reports it the idea was to
forward it to the fa pally in real time
they say give us a couple of days this
will appear till we figure out what
about the API they came back a couple of
days and said we don't know what an API
is and so why don't you just send us an
email every to every two hours so the
elections in Mexico go from 8pm to six
to eight a.m. to six pay p.m. and we
decided we were gonna send in an email
with all the validated reports every two
hours at 12pm we received an email from
the service saying our email is full we
we will not be able to receive more
emails and it didn't worked until next
Wednesday so that's how institutions are
in Mexico or in Latin American general
at the end we received a lot of reports
with it seemed like more than 100,000
reports and they were able only to
validate 700 of those so it was it was
the first election that there was a lot
of participation in social media in
Mexico and these other institutions are
still 20 centuries institutions and
sometimes with 19th century processes as
you can see we worked with inter news
with this international organization to
track Ukraine selections also hear it
was a little bit different we have to to
kind or two different kinds of season
reports the first one was a official
observer reports and the second one was
citizen reports
so the official observers were were
validated by default I'm being polished
by default and citizen reports required
someone to validate information and if
they decide to make it polish then it
will make public public they created
this campaign that was that went viral
in Ukraine I don't understand the ad but
it's something about zombies it's a very
cool at visually it says something that
you hear on both your zombie something
like that but it's all the city going
out working at zombies I was a viral
video in you can facebook and twitter we
also this is one very very interesting
we we also track geminus elections and
last year here it was very interesting
for it was not a real election because
there was only one candidate and he was
already the present but but that it was
a very interesting exercise it was the
first time in 35 years that people were
able to vote although they were going to
vote for the same guy but they were able
to vote and it was the first time also
that women were able to vote so we
received a around 9,000 citizen reports
via SMS 9 heard one hundred percent of
the reports were via SMS to the to this
shortcode here and what really got me
thinking is that these people although
they don't have they never live
democracy the way that we have they are
they already understood that elections
is it's it's much more than just going
out and feeling on a paper they were
reporting they were empowering
themselves I'm participating and
something very similar happened this is
not real election tracking but this is
something also that happened in Egypt
that we were involved we integrated with
facebook and it's the the Constitutional
Assembly of Egypt in last last year they
may publish the Constitution draft and
they are citizens to participate and to
our season to participate and to give
them their comments and opinions in five
main a main subjects on this day on the
Constitution it was integrated with
facebook it's a very big deal
facebooking in Egypt also the thing that
I like about about about this project is
that people were the kind of topic they
were able to participate worth something
what should we do with the separation of
the church and the state why should we
do with the right to to protest why
should we do with the right to women in
politics and those kind of things but
one very interesting thing is that the
dynamics of Egypt and Mexico are very
similar we have around Egypt efficient
population is 80 million people they
have around thirty percent internet
access very similar to Mexico and the
other example the other example that we
have prior to Egypt around election
election crowdsourcing West Iceland a
nice line is is it's like a small city
there are 200,000 people everyone is
connected they have a very high economic
access believe no and in even though
being the case sixty-eight thousand
people participate and 981 articles were
edited in the Constitution thanks to
citizen participation since it was
integrated on facebook we have
demographics we know how many female how
many male participated and how while
ages they have there are other kind of
projects that we have our governance so
this all these that I just show you our
election tracking and monitoring this is
governance governance is where we work
with we work with governmental
institutions so for example we just
launched the opener on a platform of La
Paz Bolivia where seasons are reporting
and and they call it a closer government
nor open government which I think it's
much better because open government we
are understanding open government as
just point out data and that's it that's
an open environment and I think that's a
very very basic thing to of the world
opened
and means it means that we it should be
useful for citizen so here is a place
where the people of La Paz our
understanding can be aware of where the
garbage truck will go to pick up your
garbage when are you going to receive
water in your house so these kind of
things that really concerned citizens is
a place where the government is working
as a platform for them to to understand
better the dynamics this is also very
interesting one is the Mexican FCC where
you can report all the problems in terms
of telecommunication problems one very
interesting thing is that we have we
have analyzed that telcel which is a
major operator fails the most on
wednesdays at 6pm we don't know why but
that's when all most reports happen and
there's a bike always wednesdays at 6pm
so it there's a probability that you
will not be able to make a five minute
minute call that at that time there was
this there was this case we went el cel
failed in Mexico City a few months ago
and monitors one is the chairman of this
institution he is very active on Twitter
and every time there's a there's a
problem in little in telecommunications
everybody goes to Twitter and criticizes
him and this time when it happens he
said okay if you keep on with sending me
on Twitter your complaints I can don't
think i will not be able to do nothing
go to the website and actually report so
i can i can have the tools to do so tell
cell or do something about it so this
was on a Wednesday and on the next
Monday the political pressure was was so
powerful because of this and in this
official platform it was evident that
there was a major failure that tells
hell decided to reimbursed around two
dollars to every user tells a user in
Mexico City which is a lot so a peer
pressure or public shame is very useful
sometimes tools and
there's another project that I wanted to
talk about to talk about very quickly
it's in Bogota Colombia I this one is
called as a most lat e double time let's
let's make it about a bit the idea here
is to you report minor crimes but the
most interesting thing is that they
don't care about the minor crime they
care about the context of the city when
that happened so when you report that
someone is told your cell phone they
will say okay how was the city when that
happened was there light or not for the
garbage or not was zero graffiti or not
so we're trying to analyze the context
of the city with what happened and with
the very philosophical theory that if
you solve the context you solve the
problem we would still have the dell yet
but we're working on it and the third
third one the third kind of projects is
what we call civic innovation is where
we work with NGOs or we group of people
to make their message much more evident
and also to make most cities and
participate so for example last year a
they they the US there was a documentary
film called waiting for superman about
talking about education problems well in
mexico we have our waiting for superman
is called the pants ah so it's exactly
the same it's it's talking about all the
problems that we have in mexico which
are very different what you have here
here but we have the largest union in
latin america which is the teachers
union and they are very very powerful so
they create this documentary to exhibit
all the problems and all the corruption
that's going on in that in that in that
union and then they launched this
website were also they encourage
students to draw their smartphones to
film whatever is going on inside their
schools and to make to make it public
and um it has it says grow this movement
has rolled very much even though and
even the new president of mexico in his
inaugural speech said that he will make
an education reform in the in his first
year let's see what happens but this
kind of technology is also combining
a traditional to traditional tool like a
documentary film and also for opening up
spaces for citizens to participate we
have also this project as you know in
Mexico it's the second most dangerous
country to be a journalist in the world
Rana after Iraq it's Mexico so we have a
couple of projects they're working with
article 19 which is an organization that
that protects journalists and and one on
the one side we are making public and
all day where most problems happen
against journalists in Mexico and
Central America and there's also they're
about to launch like heaven that like a
whatsapp app that is entirely a focus
for journalists so the idea is that you
will open the app on your smartphone and
will and it will ask you what kind of
investigative journalism you're doing it
that particular place and based on the
kind of journalism you're doing and
where you are standing it will tell you
okay you have a risk of something take
care and there's also an internal
network of city of connecting
journalists where you can keep on
monitoring and tracking each other and
alerting each other so they are also
using this kind of tools to protect
themselves and then the Monterey project
Monterey it's the second largest city in
Mexico it's in north of Mexico and it's
in the last three or four years violence
has spread thoroughly in Monterey
citizens have come out and they created
this institution called Center
integration cylinder which means Center
for season integration it's it's an
institution financed by the businessman
in mex inventory and they are connecting
all the all the Twitter conversation the
mty follow hashtag and other channels to
the official institutions to the net
municipality of Monterey to the military
and to the stage and and they are also
providing free legal and psychological
assistance to everyone that has ripped
the reports to the platform and once it
they are combining traditional channels
to 12 ER title
like soccer matches or a physical space
in the malls and there has there has
been excellent examples of how citizens
are engaged in the government another
way around for example there was there
there's they are making public once once
a month in the major newspaper of the
city how how many reports have they
received each municipality of Monterey
how they are responding and if they are
not responding so they are putting a lot
of pressure on the municipality is to
engage one one example that I love is
some what somebody reported that they
they have stolen their car and they
taste the comedy community started
retreating that information and
intelligence in your car here I've seen
your car here and it took 11 minutes
until so much that your carriage park
here so that that really talks about the
sense of community and and the sense of
social fabric been reconstructed we
generated that the that we all that I've
shown you so far it's some examples of
what we indeed doing in the last two
years now we will learn a lot we are
constantly open to in up to to failure
that's why we are innovating and and we
are experimenting a lot I'm seeing all
the results of it that that that we're
having but as you can as you have you
seen all that all those dynamics that
I've sure you are all in Latin America
or Middle East or Africa we have one
project yet with dynamics with the
dynamics of a developed country like the
US the thing is in Mexico Eddie in the
US eighty-seven percent of Americans
participate in us in a sport group in a
academic group in a religious group or a
neighborhood group or whatever the
eighty-seven percent of the u.s. of
Americans in Mexico it's only around six
percent so we don't have a culture of
participating not only in Mexico not in
entire Latin America so there's no if we
don't participate we don't know each
other we don't
trust each other and so on so so the I
think the best tool is the best tool
still that has been used for titties for
neighbors mainly for neighbors to
communicate between each other and to
make better decisions has been since the
nidus yahoo groups and google groups and
this tool has been involved since then
that's where chili for your brain your
neighbors are organizing themselves how
how should they decorate the street on
Halloween or who's the next on the car
in the four to take the children to
school or whatever so right now what we
are doing it's where we will just have
we haven't launched it yet but we just
approved get up got approved and an app
on the Apple store yet we haven't
migrated to other platforms but we want
to foster self-organized Civic
interactions we want to create it to
created tools for citizens to create the
same dynamics that there are going on on
yahoo groups or google groups and to
create communities so what we are doing
it's it's our servers first consumer web
application if you have an iPhone and go
to the apple store you can download the
CD box up the idea is it is a citizen
centric approach when we are trying also
to control the source of information and
to create a platform where citizens can
can create their own their own
interactions whatever they want the idea
for here is to carry with everything sin
to create a community to invite people
to join their community to geotag the
community so the community can only be
discovered in a particular place so for
example we can have a community of red
one and if I go to Seattle I will not be
able to see that community only when I'm
in redmond I will be able to see it at
MIT so the main object the main idea for
this is the idea behind this is
institutions a being private or public
we cannot make better decisions on how
to improve people's lives if we limit
public participation to bowling everyone
you know well we need to be tools for
citizens also to collaborate at to
engage twitter has been the best tool
right now i think they're there are much
more civic interaction in twitter than
in any other platform combined of civic
platform combined however twitter is a
very noisy monologue and i think there
can be there can be better solutions
replica basing replicating all the
dynamics that is already happening on on
yahoo groups or dual groups so this is
this is a new thing that we're doing
it's a consumer web app if you if you go
to your to your app iphone if you have
one it would be great to receive
feedback from you we haven't launched it
yet i think it will take a couple of
months we launched it and finally just
just to wrap up this i want to talk a
little bit about open open government
and open data and all that we are very
important bobbling that where we
organize a lot a lot of hackathons in
Mexico Latin America open data
hackathons where we put together we put
together developers designers and
journalists and government officials for
36 hours in the same room and seeing
what happens if they dive into error
we're actually collaborating with
Microsoft in the next high cotton which
is tomorrow Microsoft Mexico but one
thing is that the idea that the idea
that transparency will restore public
trust in democracy rest on the very on a
very fail very very fragile assumption
which is if only people knew everything
will be different and we we have find
out is that people we don't sometimes we
don't want to know sometimes we don't
care if we know so the idea that if I
know how much money was spent on the
street outside my house and the street
has a lot of potholes it will make the
idea is that it will make me and it will
make me anger and it will make me wanna
part 1 wanna participate in say date you
should
but that's not always that's not always
the case sometimes the end of government
secrecy with this open government and
open data movements does not mean
doesn't mean necessarily the birth of
the informed citizen not and when we
need to find ways how to really engage
the citizen and how to see it and really
engage with the government's and
participate with the government I'm not
saying that this kind of efforts are
wrong we're we have done this for for
the last two years we will continue
doing doing it because we're trying to
create a community of Civic hackers that
are participating with their governments
in the in the in the 20th century the
hackers of the system were the lawyers
because they knew how the system worked
and they knew the the problems on the
system the hackers of the system were
21st century arts are engineers because
because that's that's that's how the
government is moment so we need we need
to create this community of developers
run hack or that want to participate and
to to make all other cities great tools
for governments opening up and
participate anger and also citizens to
participate transparency is not only
government's opening up it's also pick
citizens asking questions so we need to
create those platforms this is this is
the this is we as I told you we doing
we've done two kinds of hackathons the
one is in Mexico Charlie in Mexico and
the second one we're part of this
movement called this a virgin america
latina which means developing Latin
America where we put eight countries a
different countries a lot in America we
hack together during one the first
weekend of December and we compete
between each other and find the best
solutions between each other tomorrow as
I've told you it's the first hackathon
that we're doing outside Mexico City it
will be in Monterey that's why I have to
go back so early but but mainly is that
in nineteen America in Mexico in the US
I think
this open government stuff it's it's
great it's a great movement that needs
that we need to pursue but we haven't
seen results yet and sometimes it's very
frustrating when we don't see results
and it is been around for two or three
years and this hasn't been like really
life-changing results and in the kind of
democracy we're living but perhaps it's
the same the same thing that I was
discussing yesterday with a friend that
speaking the truth is not everybody
knows in Mexico who the drug dealer ER
everybody knows in Mexico who what who
are the cool to corrupt politicians and
what kind of side businesses corrupt the
politicians have everybody knows if you
want to know where el chapo guzman is
living as the neighbors they already
know there's a difference between
knowing the truth and speaking the truth
I don't think week the wikileaks cable
actually said something that you don't
know already we already knew everything
that wikileaks cable said the that's
doesn't mean difference and we need to
create tools to protect citizens and to
encourage citizens to take personal risk
and confront the powerful and speak out
the truth and hopefully eventually this
can lead to real change in our cities
anywhere in our democracies thank
Weston's so to what extent do you feel
especially in the context of elections
because that's an important part of this
that the government's that you work with
are willing to be partners
well what if I have found out also is
that during the election when one more
interesting thing is that during the
election day it's very complicated now
22 actually reseal to actually
governments to to to create a major got
a electro proud fraud it's it's it
happens before if it happens so we we
also need to to to create tools that can
monitor elections before another any
degree in the elections we can generate
elections there's a lot of eyes looking
at the election there are a lot of
institutions looking at the elections
but the government's governments where
we have worked sometimes it can be
complicated like the Venezuela case but
mainly its candidates the ones that they
don't want to use this kind of tools the
candidates in Latin America in the Latin
American context they are using all they
are using this kind of tools but to
click to for election purposes
exclusively for example there's there
was I was I was telling yesterday that
we had this project in the in the west
of Mexico where we have we've been
running this pray for a couple of years
about chasing reports and all that and
when there were elections the candidate
used it that the one that was the
governor use that data base instead of
user database to set a vote for me and
that that that really heard the project
the platform and if we lost trust with
with the citizens so they are
understanding this kind of tools that
there's always to this kind of tools in
Mexico Twitter was very there was a war
on the hash on hashtags on Twitter but I
don't think that it was really changed
the mind of people there's a
conversation that going on on Twitter
that does not does not reflect the
conversation of their real polling
stations slightly different kind of tool
and that is if a government is is
willing to participate in doing so it's
possible to build an election cyst
such that citizens individually can can
check on their own and see if there's
fraud and see if the election is run
properly and see where the fraud is if
there is fraud but the government would
have to be a partner in building the
system and do you think from your
experience that the government to go
free we'd be willing to build the system
that allowed citizens to see witness
fraud well most of the time this kind of
praise when we're talking with
governments first of all what we needs
is political will because the tools are
already out there the city so it needs
our political will but they may also
need to understand that if in Mexico I
don't remember one single election that
hasn't been questioned never and it can
be a great tool for the government's a
day you want to question then in the
next election let's let's do it open
this video's open as possible and you
will see that not there's no problem
with elections so it can also be a tool
for them also to to open up and to talk
to citizens but they they need the
political will and I don't think then
Latin America will be the first anyone
in Latin America will be the first
country to do that I'm thinking
something more specific we should talk
about this offline so what's the model
that the cbox uses you you approach you
know government to these public
institutions do they are you like a
consultant they hire you when you head
to this design work what it's a business
also it is it that business model is
there not for profit kind of an
organization or when who funds
organization is if that the clients
foundations of the we are for-profit
business and yeah they pay for the
platform that's how i made business
model so the government's for the
institutions or the decision-makers in
general wants to use the platform they
pay for the platform it depends the
pricing it depends on the level of
involvement we can be very much involved
in the industry idg and implementation
of this and we can only provide the
technology for them to create and they
created strategy so that that depends
the new product that we're launching
that is pro consumers it's it completely
for free we want we want first of all to
understand the dynamics if we are really
adding value or not and then we will
figure out
how can we make money from that but yeah
most of most and most of the time they
they contact us or we sell them the
services see your project
yeah we did we did a bending selections
Benin's we covered bending selections in
2010 11 I think and we work with our
organization called for selection and we
trained a peep the people from bending
in Washington DC and then we they went
on the field and they we connected to
frontline SMS for us to receive all old
incoming SMS there was a power out a
outbreak the first there were two
elections one was the the person under
what was the parliament and the
precision elections there was a party or
a break and we lost around 17,000
reports but we learned from that and
three weeks later when we was the
parliamentary the legislative elections
we created all the their replication of
systems and security that we needed now
receive around 30,000 reports but it was
completely sms-based it was a very we
have all the case study if you want I
can say to people Detroit
trolls to for example in the case of
fans are so I'm assuming that perhaps if
the union would have noted try to meet
the rain
how well first of all the reports are
coming through Twitter we are we we have
a couple of algorithms that doesn't let
but Twitter BOTS to to participate and
also that doesn't let replication of
tweets so you already said something
that the next one will not come so
that's keeping it a little bit clean but
the institution that is receiving the
reports needs to verify the information
so all the reports are not be made
public a well they can decide if they
want to all of them made public at the
beginning or private but if they is a
reserved the reports they validate the
information and they decide if they they
make public each report however that
does not affect the the internal
internal the internal analytics there's
there's a particular we have an option
for each report to be marked as spam if
you mark it as spam then the system
starts learning that that kind of that
particular person or that combination of
words a it be happen again it will be
marked as spam so the system is learning
but it needs human interface right now
for to Hoffman there
you have talked about the problems are
the frustrations of having open
government solutions in place for a
while and not seeing results and
yesterday we were talking about one of
the things that you think is a
precondition for success is to create
greater trust in the community and that
will make these institutions more
legitimate and more effective is there
some data metric that you are looking at
that is a proxy for increasing trust so
that you'll know if you're being
successful or you just monitoring
participation is there some measurement
of an outcome of increasing social
capital that comes out of this system oh
well right now we're measuring
participation and how has it changed a
increasing or decreasing we're also
measuring the response of the
institutions if how they are responding
and it has if it has changed their their
processes or the way they are thinking
it it's very complicated to have a
quantitative metric of this kind of
these kind of things are at the end it's
it's all intangible capital it's it's
how are we trusting each other we
innovating processes are we opening up
spaces I think open government and the
the use of all tech tools for civic
interaction we are in a very very early
stage we are we are all learning there's
no silver bullet and if we are going
into this space I think the problem is
that eight nine thousand reports in
Yemen is that a lot or is that a very
little light I don't know it's it's a
it's a much bigger population but or
64,000 reports in Egypt in an 80 million
population is that a lot or not it so it
depends it's the other way of the or the
kind to see it 60,000 people that
wouldn't be able to participate division
you don't have this tool so I think
we're still learning and eventually I
hope we will be able to to
qualitative and quantitative metrics
that can tell us if this is working or
not working yeah how are you letting
people forming the groups yep just like
whatever within one this in the area or
whoever the group they want we are not
controlling the platform right it's we
want it to make to be very open and to
see what how are they participate yes I
can reply although it's populated
twittering broadcast it's the ones that
are in inside one community you can you
can discover communities and you can
join a community and if you're in that
particular community you will receive
the information oh one more um so one of
the problems we seem to face and in our
area is that there's so much data
available online and so few people who
have the skills to analyze and decide
what's meaningful and you know the news
media professional news media is just
didn't decline because their revenue
model almost is going out of existence
and so one of the things that one of the
groups I'm involved in is thinking about
doing is actually doing workshops and
training to teach ordinary citizens more
about what to look for and how did how
to dig through the data the government
provides and I'm just curious if if
you've looked at doing anything like
that to create more citizen activists
who are willing to to volunteer to do
the analysis that the professional news
media is not capable of doing it yeah
we're seeing a through through these
kind of tools we're seeing a lot of
people that are really analyzing the
information and and doing the work that
journalists are not doing in Mexico that
the thing that we have is or were they
don't we don't have investigative
journalism we have we have we have press
releases so the media are working as
press releases and but one very
interesting thing is that they they take
a lot of their information from Twitter
so Twitter although it's a very close
community in Mexico around on
around there are two million accounts
something like that all the information
that happens in Twitter the media
replicates it and then goes to the TV or
goes to the newspapers and that's how
people are analyzing or receiving their
news but there are people out there
there there there are people ordered are
analyzing all the public data of the
crime related numbers that are out there
and they're they're there or comparing
the how people are buying how the
government's are buying stuff up to whom
so they are doing it just for fun I
don't think there's an institution that
is really doing this kind of work on a
regular basis in Mexico but at the end
this kind of tools what they are hoping
up it what they're doing is they're open
up spaces for more amateurs more people
that go out there and play with the data
and then perhaps cover something and
through Twitter making it up making it
up available to to everyone what's up
everyone for coming and we're going to
be hanging out for immunity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
