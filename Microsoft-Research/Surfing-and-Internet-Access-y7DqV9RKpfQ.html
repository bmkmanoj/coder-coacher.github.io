just as we're getting set up here how
many people have actually tried surfing
how many of you consider yourself
surfers okay what bodyboarding a body
surfing yeah yeah for sure yes so you
for you guys i'm going to say a lot of
things you already know but i figure
there's enough people who don't have the
experience that I'll do some enough
intro stuff and I won't try to use too
much jargon because I know that can lose
people a little bit so what I want to
talk about is just a little bit about my
story of how I started surfing I got a
wetsuit and to surf lessons for my 40th
birthday it's something I've been
wanting to do for as long as I can
remember but I never really had the
opportunity to do it before until I
moved to Southern California and my kids
were old enough that I you know felt
like I could reclaim some of my time for
my personal stuff so luckily I did have
a cert you know I have friends who serve
and I had supports but I clearly thank
you I clearly did not grow up with surf
culture and I clearly don't fit the
traditional demographic of a surfer oh I
didn't stir my so it's been an
interesting journey because for those of
you who even if you've just tried it
realize surfing is really really hard
and I you know picked up skiing pretty
quickly I picked up rollerblading back
when that was a thing pretty quickly I
thought oh god it's got to be kind of
the same thing and it is not it is
exponentially harder because of the
simple factor that the surface changes
not only by the day but by the hour and
by the second and you have to learn so
much about the environment and
how to read a wave and then there's this
added thing which is really the focus of
what I want to talk about today which is
that you're competing with a whole lot
of really athletic 20 year old males for
the same scarce resource which is a good
wave it's a scarce resource at yes your
ski runs get crowded and all that but
this is different because that resource
pops up it's a two second window to get
it and if you're not in the lineup at
the top of that peeling wave you're not
going to get that wave so there's a
whole social protocol and culture around
surfing that has grown up around the
regulation of this scarce resource and
that's what we think of as surf culture
and localism and the whole aphorism
around surf culture which is really
centered around locals rule and there's
a pecking order and on hierarchy and a
set of people who belong to a particular
break and a set of people who don't and
of course there's all those social
labels and hierarchies now what's
happened after the internet came along
is people like me can learn how to surf
now and so this is sort of the tension
that I want to surface because I think
it's a really good example of the ways
in which the internet empowers new
actors to enter a previously
exclusionary practice and community but
it also complicates and troubles the
existing sort of set of norms and a lot
of what was wonderful about surf culture
is sort of being denatured and destroyed
by a lot of these technologies so the
site that gets the most heat around this
as surf line calm which it's not
pervasive in all regions but in Southern
California you really have very good
coverage I mean there's a ton of
information news photos blah blah blah
but the core of what has transformed
surfer practice is the fact that there's
a network of forecasters and surf
cameras so that their motto is know
before you go so in the days before surf
cams you had to be
part of the local beach culture you had
to be at the beach every morning and you
had to have friends who you relayed this
information about when there was swell
or not and now like any 40 year old mom
can check the internet and know when
there's a wave and a swell coming and
it's incredible the amount of knowledge
that goes into this so of course sort of
there's live streaming high definition
cams for all the major breaks there's
reports and because surf forecasting and
surf science is fairly complicated
there's a ton of data right so of course
while height that's wave hi it is
obvious but swell Direction tides winds
swell period these are the things you
have to look at when you try to
understand when your break is going to
get a good wave and so you'll see here
this is one of my home breaks of Porto
and Manhattan Beach where it explains
for any damn noob what swell Direction
works in El Porto so you don't go to El
Porto out porta is actually what if this
is a bad example because it works on
almost every swell direction but there's
a lot of breaks that only work on a
north-facing spell or a south-facing
swell and noobs don't know this it's the
people who've lived there for
generations and kind of know like the
contours of the sandbars and points and
breaks in the region that used to know
this stuff and suddenly it's become
blown wide open and accessible and there
is no way I would have learned to surf
without this information so surf line is
amazing I think Brady brought up so this
is this is my morning routine as I'll go
on to surf line and you know I'll scroll
through my breaks to figure out which
one is working in the morning you can
set up your quad cam so you can watch
your for most frequent breaks at the
same time and figure out which one's
working the best and then after your
sesh you go on to surfing calm where god
I don't normally sign in so where you
you can get even more data
but it is I'm running out of time here
anyway I'm not going to bother with the
other site because I'm out of my five
minutes but you know again there's like
for every session you can log your spots
and give you a detailed breakdown of
what the actual conditions were so again
it's this incredible learning tool and
it get it provides that information
which was once very local and exclusive
in an openly network format what this
meat has meant that the popularity of
surfing has skyrocketed the
accessibility of surfing has skyrocketed
that the whole sort of local culture
around surfing is breaking down in a lot
of areas except for you know places that
have put in protections like most of
Hawaii does not allow surf camps there's
a lot of exclusionary practices to keep
Outsiders out if you read like a surf
travel you know they'll say hazards sea
urchins coral reef localism and you know
which breaks to take stay away from if
they have a strong culture of localism
but the reality is that it's breaking
down because it's not sustainable growth
is not sustainable because you're
inherently dealing with a scarce
resource so it's a really interesting
dilemma of internet culture and like I
feel implicated in it because I'm one of
those people who would never have
learned to surf before the internet and
I think it enriches surf culture to have
more diversity but on the other hand
it's really really crowded really
dangerous there's a lot of cooks out
there now who shouldn't be in the water
and it's really the Internet's fault
