Vanessa in front of Stanford coming from
the biomedical informatics department
but you'll see immediately from her talk
it's about everything except for final
night with Maddox it's for not she's
doing all kinds of interesting things
like run a science podcast at a stand
for the last couple years and
contributed to open large projects is a
full stack developer from dr. out with
interfaces and in particular is
extremely curious and interested about
people use information and all of the
kinds of projects that we're doing so
yes cool thanks so uh I first want to
say thank you so much for having me here
today I I don't think andouille express
in words how excited I am to be at
Microsoft Research yes i am vanessa and
I'm unfortunately we are not a
department where program in by metalink
informatics but it's just as good I just
defended my dissertation couple like a
week and a half ago so i put the PhD but
i don't officially walk until until june
so i kind of feel like i need to do
something like that i'm not really sure
when the official time is when you
actually get your PhD anyway so i'm here
today i prepare to talk for you called
graduate school between the lines and as
you sort of have alluded to i am not
going to be talking about my thesis work
the interesting thing about graduate
school is it's really this amazing time
where you can just try new things and
learn and take risks and a lot of people
probably don't realize that i was lucky
to sort of realize it early on so i just
have had a ton of fun trying out random
projects to learn and so today I'm going
to be presenting you sort of a random
sampling of some of these projects and
my goal is really to try to give you a
sense of how I think about exploring
data how my own train of thinking has
sort of evolved over time and just how
fun this sort of work is so I want to
open up with a little bit of a story
when I was a very tiny Vanessa I just
love to run that was my passion and what
you're looking at here is my first
little award I ran a freshman race 2
miles and I got seven place and the
realized that the reason that I loved
running is because it was just really
really fun it was challenging it was
always a little bit different
and so today I want to try to convince
to you that graduate school really has a
lot of parallels with competitive
running so you know here we're at the
start this is where you're admitted and
you're just totally scared you're a
little bit anxious but you're really
excited you know the first Queen you
make it through the first quarter of the
race and you don't have a plan and
you're not really sure what's going on
that's probably the hardest part then
you get to this qualifying exam that's
where people probably drop out maybe
they don't continue on the race but then
once you make it through there then you
have a little bit of a plan but you have
to make horribly articulate that at your
proposal so you stand in front of a
bunch of people and you make to say this
is the interesting problem that I'm
going to be working on you make it
through that interesting problem and
then hopefully the remainder the third
card the race you're cruising you get to
that defense you do your defense you
pass and then hopefully you graduate and
so here we so this is sort of the
framework that I'm going to be taking
today as I talk to you about some of
these projects here we have our little
runner and so if you can imagine being
on the starting line what would be the
question that is in your head how long
until graduation yes it's something like
that fritters are my shoes time that's
another important thing so at the start
of my journey I was at the starting line
and I wasn't really thinking of hard
questions at that point I said do I have
what it takes to do this do I even have
what it takes to essentially get to the
end of the race so I said well let me
see if I can use data to answer this
because I didn't really have a good way
so I came up with so these are the four
criteria that my program requires for
sort of to be a good by medical
informatics 'used you need domain
expertise programming essentially sort
of methods machine learning and that of
course communication so I put together
all these criteria and for each one I
had a very specific set of rules for
example this is for domain knowledge and
for example in domain knowledge if you
have impact you get a score of one if
your mom might be proud of you if you
wrote a paper about it you get a score
of four if you get a nature paper and so
I scored myself all on this and in the
first quarter we're also learning this
new programming language called are so I
wrote a little script that I you know I
to calculate my graduate student avatar
and I calculated I visualize my progress
and so green is what I've
accomplished blue is what I have to go
these are different things programming
communication etc etc mrs. how am I
progress and I figured out really
quickly that I had a lot to learn I had
a lot to do however this is okay like so
this was the first quarter of graduate
school and this is a really hard time in
the race because you're Stanford courses
are hard and so you're taking a lot of
courses and I was doing everything that
I thought I was supposed to be doing I
was identifying this this important
question so I saw my quads lepa head and
I sped through those calls I got through
the calls but something happened I I had
a problem and the problem was that I had
doubt I said maybe I don't have what it
takes to be a researcher but it wasn't
really just doubt alone it was this
realization that the problems that I'm
working on they don't seem that
interesting and I'm not really having
that much fun and so sort of lying there
on the little track and I'm saying what
is my vision because up to this point I
have done everything the way that I'm
supposed to be doing it and I feel like
I'm following a template a conveyor belt
and I'm not really sure that I'm
following sort of my gut maybe I could
have more fun why isn't this fun it
seems like I came to graduate school
because it's really passionate about
these ideas in this research and this
isn't what I thought it would be and
maybe it's the case that I should kind
of throw away these rules and things and
we'll still need to do them to some
extent I need to graduate but maybe I
should be taking more risks maybe this
would improve if i took my risk so stood
back up because look at their just
stayed lying on the track and just had
someone like wheel me away but I said
back up and I decided that I wanted to
move forward and I wanted to take more
risks and really try looking at some of
these problems that just seemed like
they wouldn't fit in line with the CSIs
so the first interesting question I
wanted to ask can I learn about research
practices from brain coordinate data and
this was a data set that I was working
at the time let me give you a little bit
of background about how neuroma doing
results report results so the idea is
that you have some statistical map it
has this coordinate of sort of a maximum
value value for example this has an XYZ
coordinate and you can't really take
this big ugly data object and like embed
it note paper and so what researchers do
is they report the coordinates
tables and so very sort of sophisticated
methods for meta-analysis have been
totally developed toward reproducing
these brain maps and then saying like
what the literature has to say about
them so I looked at this data and
everyone is using this is sort of data
that everyone is using the same way over
many many years and I noticed something
else specifically I noticed that there's
also information about the people about
the researchers the authors and I said
huh maybe I can take this method and I
can sort of twist it a little bit and so
what I decided to do is instead of
representing for example a term in a
paper so the idea is that when you look
at these coordinates they would
associate these coordinates with values
from the text so a bunch of coordinates
associated with the term anxiety would
probably have a brain map that
represents what the what's going on in
the brain during the experience of
anxiety so said whatever terms I'm going
to look at a certain set of coordinates
that are associated with an author so a
modder re I worked with him at Duke and
so these are his coordinates it's ok
that was a start but you know obviously
this just looks like a ball of like
whatever and it's not very interesting
so I knew that I needed a novel way to
sort of visualization to visualize this
because someone who doesn't know about
brains doesn't know about imaging it's
going to want to try to answer the
question what does this researcher study
in the context of behaviors and so I
came up with this visualization that I
called the brain lattice and so what the
brain lattice is I start out with 525
different brain maps so each map
represents sort of what's going on in
the brain during the manifestation of
some behavior anxiety working memory etc
etc I then generated a self-organizing
map with those maps and so the idea is
that if you have a grid of nodes to each
node is mapped some set of behavioral
terms and then distance in the map
represents similarity and then what I
could basically do is take my author
brain map those author sets of points
and map them to the nodes and that would
calculate a similarity score I could
then color it by the similarity score so
let me just show you what this looks
like so it makes more sense you can't
read these little labels here but this
is the this is the map for a mod hairy
and so the hot spots in the map so what
what you can't read on
here are the little behavioral terms so
hot spots in the map down here terms
related to anxiety depression sort of
and not is exactly what Ahmad studies he
also does a little work in decision
theory in science so that's this other
hot spot here so this is really cool
because I can now represent all of the
authors contributions to neuroscience
based on this one picture and so another
thing I thought would make sense as well
if I'm sort of a student and I want to
know what lab to go into I'd want to
find you know the anxiety researcher you
can you can explore this map bike find
anxiety clicking on it and then it will
retrieve from the database all the
authors and show you what they study you
can click on an author to explore more
fully and so the other interesting thing
I could get from this data is the fact
co-authorship so I realized I could
figure out sort of luck I can make an
author collaboration network and so I
did exactly that I made an author
collaboration network where I could for
example search for a Mont hariri and so
I type it up there I search for the map
and then nope there's is node and then I
can say oh who does a mod work with and
that should be that's James gross who's
another anxiety researcher and so then I
would want to basically put these things
together I would want to say okay for a
mod hariri what I can figure out now by
putting these things together is who are
his collaborators it's sort of like a
collaborator finder because I can rate
what you see here is a ranked list of
authors based on having similar brain
maps to a mod and then this dot here
represents the similarity and the points
in red represent the authors that are
the other authors that are actually
collaborating with him and when I found
across many of these neuro scientists is
that the people were doing the most
similar work to them they weren't
working with them they weren't talking
to them they had never published a paper
with them and so I learned that Wow I
mean it wasn't surprised but you know
researchers don't talk to each other
okay and this was really cool this was
actually a we project that I did for fun
on a weekend and it was really cool
because it turned into a paper and it
was the first sort of kind of fulfilling
paper because i felt like i had had a
cool idea and built a tool and then had
something that i could offer to other
people to use it okay so what did i
learn
so the actually there's a really
interesting component of this work that
isn't represented in the paper after or
right before I was about to publish it I
went to my advisor and I said you know
we can learn so much more about these
authors you can go to a database of
grants and funding find the author
figure out what their funding was and
then look up their publications
basically figure out how well they
utilize their resources the other thing
you can do is that you can basically
extract different kinds of methods and
statistical Corrections they do from
their paper and be the sort of
statistical police and kind of point out
people like oh this is bad practice and
it seems like it wouldn't be likely but
there's actually a lot of still really
bad sort of even just simple like you
know not correcting for multiple
comparisons kinds of things going on so
I want anyway I took these things to my
advisor and he said Vanessa if you do
that you were going to be hated by the
community so I didn't but the point is
that there is really more interesting
stuff to look in terms of what I learned
obviously communication academia isn't
great maybe we already knew that one
really cool thing about this project
this was the first time that I had
really taken everything because what you
don't see sort of on the back and
there's a lot of Club computations it
needs to happen sort of on a cluster and
then there's scripts to make the
visualizations and then there's the
entire web interface itself I wanted to
make it all just totally transparent
reproducible so I wanted to share
everything on github and then finally
this was the first time I really sort of
got into d3 and I realized just in the
same way it's empowering to be able to
program and to like build anything that
you can dream of if you know how to make
visualizations custom visualizations you
can you can really do anything
competition problem was it what a
competition problem it was just you know
there's another person is not like me I
don't know because I just want to get
glory myself I think so researchers are
just very hesitant to kind of even talk
to each other because they're afraid
that if they give someone else you know
their idea then they get scooped and
they lose the publication incentives we
can talk about this later incentives the
academia are just totally screwed up
where they really should be just focused
toward like solving the scientific
problem doing good science but it's
anything but that unfortunately and
there's this other layer of challenge
in basically taking this really
complicated analysis thing and then be
able to synthesize it into a
visualization into something that is
digestible and cohesive that so this is
the things that I started to think about
so from this I realest oh god we're in a
really bad place nobody's talking each
other how can I help the neuroimaging
community and so at the time
neuroimaging community was sort of
centered around Python it still is is
called knipe I and this is my pod org
circa 2011 thanks to the Wayback Machine
and it seemed to me that this just very
simple organization was a good place
where I could sort of I if I could
change even just like the website and
the way they do things i could get
people more talking to each other and so
what i did this is my pot org today i
made them a totally new site this is
hosted on github pages it's a Jekyll
site it has details about the code of
conduct and then how do you actually
contribute it also has a blog that looks
like it's integrating to the site but is
actually an embedded tumblr blog so
anyone who doesn't know how to code can
go in and write and blog about their
research sort of things it's totally
tested has continuous integration and
then importantly everything that happens
on here it's immediately pushed to the
nipe I'd Twitter which you know everyone
in their grandmother using Twitter so I
didn't see why not I wasn't using
Twitter and so this is so now it's
interesting these very small changes
have just really improved sort of
communication and sort of the feel of
the community when you search for knife
I you find this that we that we have
sort of a place and so in in that same
thread a couple of years ago one of my
friends named david zhang he was
throwing around this idea about making a
science podcast and he and I said you
know what this is a great idea you sort
of do the hard work recruit the writers
i will put together sort of the branding
and the vision and all the back the back
infrastructure so that it works on
itunes and we can push ups odes and I
made our goggles guy you can't see his
mouth he's actually like the top of a
microphone wearing goggles and so a
couple years ago no in November of 2013
we made goggles optional which is a
podcast run by Stanford scientists and
our motto is we put on the goggles so
you don't have to and this is a really
important thing because at least for
communication about results in the media
they're often like
were sensational eyes are just totally
misrepresented so we take real science
and we explain it I'm at a level that's
sort of understandable we also make it
fun and our podcast has been really
successful we have the tank just over
60,000 downloads we're on our 130 second
episode and this is really empowering
for me because I realized that having
impact goes so much farther beyond what
you think it would be which is just
having these publications and so after
after these two little things and I'm
obviously very into sort of making
web-based tools it's very apparent to me
that everything that happens anywhere is
sort of happening in a web browser and
unfortunately for neuroimaging
everything was still happening on
people's desktops and so this next ID i
said you know what can I make web-based
tools to explore neuroimaging data this
seemed like a really important thing to
work on and so my first effort was a
functional brain imaging connectome in
your browser I would basically do some
processing of functional data so you get
this interactive viewer where you could
explore the nodes and but the problem
was this was that it took a bunch of
pre-processing and then you'd have your
data and then you and this didn't seem
like the right thing to be working on at
the time I wanted to get this raw brain
map which is basically a 3d map of
numbers into a browser and so I first
decided that what needed to be done was
make it just really easy to have a
folder of brain images and just open
them up in your browser and so no Jas is
seemed like the right solution because
you can make very little easy
applications with it so my first thing
what's the brain browser and it's really
simple you just type vb and it opens up
on your console and then you you can
explore different frame maps you can
search you can download them but the
problem with this is that a lot of data
that neuroimaging scientists work with
isn't always going to be on their
computers right might be on for example
a web server so I said huh can i
optimize not just like make a tool for
see stuff but can actually optimize a
web server for showing brain images and
I had this idea because of this this is
sort of the Apache default view index
file index and it meets and I and I knew
that this existed because I'd so many
times gone the htaccess file and just
turn
it off and it made sense to me that this
had to be some sort of default view that
Apache knew how to render and so maybe I
could just change that default view and
like plug a brain map into it and so
what I did is I dug in a little bit and
I found that this this module is called
vaad auto index and you can of course do
things with indexing here but we can
also do is you can also specify a
specific file to do the directory and
Rex so I made my own this one and you
can either specify it so this line mean
to it would be the entire server or you
can just do it for a single folder and
so so here's the little file actually a
you can even read that so basically what
you all you have to do in the PHP file
is expect that a couple of variables are
going to be sort of like your server
address where you are and then basically
read in the different files parse out
the extensions and stuff and then later
in the script do whatever you want with
them and so I created the Nifty index
this is running on my little server and
so basically it's the same exact thing
you can go into sub directories click
around go on a brain map what I got it
downloads right to your machine because
that seemed like the functionality that
the users want you can also click decode
and it sends the map to this external
database called neuro sins which will
give you sort of behavioral terms that
are associated with the map so I but
unfortunately neuroma doing researchers
are even lazier than that I wanted to be
able to take a brain map and just drop
it on my browser and just like have
magic happen and so I wanted I also
wanted to be totally static not having
any sort of things running on the
backend and so this was on when file
reader was sort of coming out and so I
developed the nifty drop where you just
saw what happens you take the nifty file
you put it in the drop zone the drop
zones listening for the file it loads
the imaging data here and then it loads
the header information here and it just
works and to show that this is actually
static it's running on github pages and
so if you look at one of the things my
lab has developed as a database of brain
maps called neuro vault I've had a huge
impact I've put all of my viewers into
neuro vaults to immediately empower
researchers for example here's a version
of what I just showed you except now
I've made it so that you can click on
different buttons of activation and
we'll take you to that coordinate in the
brain map and so all of the solutions
that I've studied thus far are about
taking a brain map and then rendering it
as
is but one thing I really like to do is
for example custom visualizations with
d3 I'd want to be able to make some kind
of graphic rendition rendition of the
brain map so that was this next idea and
so there was a software at the time
called nylon and I learned how to
function to produce this orthogonal view
so what you're looking at here is an
orthogonal view of a brain atlas so each
region is sort of associated with a
certain number and that gets rendered as
a color and it had a function that would
export an SVG I said great so I made
this SVG but that's there at the data
and I said oh my goodness so if you I
don't know if you can see this but this
is not SVG this is taking a PNG data and
shoving it inside of an SVG data
structure and calling it an SVG this
needed to be passed so I can control
them I can't do anything with this so I
said wonder if I can make if I can redo
this and make my own real SVG with paths
and so on and you can see the whole
exploration of that link but i took i
started with sort of the base image and
i tried different filters different sort
of things for edge detection I that's
doubled on this thing called thysen
wolves or something method I applied a
little bit of extra sort of tweaking to
it and what eventually came up with was
a way to sort of take a particular
region so this region here is just the
yellow part in this brain map and then
break it into the pieces and then for
each peach I could draw on an SVG an
actual path and so and I did that with
Carol which you can communicate with
it's a system library but for example
you can communicate from Python with
like pie Carol and so what does that
look like this is what this is what an
SVG looks like when it actually has a
path in it this is what I had expected
to see and I was very happy to have made
and so then I could immediately make
custom visualizations with this map so
what you see up here is the SVG that I
produced and then the user can interact
with it up there selecting to turn on
and off different brain regions and then
it will render in a scatter plot here so
the idea is that this is one brain image
and this is another brain image you
might want to discover some correlation
between two regions that wasn't apparent
when sort of all of the data is there
and so this is d3 but the issue about
this view is that in order to get this
to render Nevada browser d three handles
of thousand points okay once you go over
that it really just not going to work
but I really wanted to get all like 150
thousand points in the browser so I
needed a different technique and so how
do I get the entire brain map into the
browser I found this thing called camel
it's not a thing it's out there canvas
and what I basically did is I had a
strategy where I took a thousand points
in a queue at once and I would just plot
them onto the screen as static bitmap
points and with this strategy I can do
the same thing I can sort of filter
based on regions here's the exact same
SVG you see down here except now this is
like a hundred and over 150,000 points
in the browser in like under four
seconds and so this this seemed like it
was good to me and so why am I sort of
stressing sort of visualization so much
I think it's really important because I
think Elise in research and it may be
true in other things to people tend to
not look at their data and it's not easy
enough to look at your data in a matter
of fact bad things happen when you don't
look at your data so i want to share you
a little story of something that
happened recently that kind of motivates
this so what happens so i was doing
something this is for my dissertation so
like doesn't matter what I was doing but
basically there's this bread and butter
operation in neuroimaging where you take
a t-statistic map and you chrome bird it
to a z-score map and every software
package has it a method do it so here
was my original data like looks pretty
good I then plugged it into the software
oh my god like what happened so I don't
know what happened but there was like
all this huge like huge amount of just
zeros were just randomly appeared and
then there's like this weird truncation
thing happening and I said well maybe
it's just the software's bad i plugged
it into a different software and oh my
god like the same thing happened and so
I was really curious about this so I
started like searching around the
internet like t2z truncations varsity's
like what is going on and i found this
paper by this guy named Paul huguette
and it turns out that the standard
procedure to do this conversion relies
on p values and so if you have a really
big distribution your p-values get
really really tiny like point oh you
know basically toward machine precision
values go to zero and so that's why we
see all those extra zeros so what this
guy did instead of using P he basically
substituted Q equals one minus P I
served this intermediate variable and it
solve this problem so I said oh well
this seems important so what I did is I
implemented a version for brain maps
called TZ any distribution looks correct
as it should be but this was a really
scary discovery for me because nobody
had noticed this the thing is if you
look at a statistical map sort of in its
standard view you can't tell if a value
is truncated you little look the spatial
map will look the same and it just
terrified me that people weren't looking
at their data in different ways and this
is just such strong evidence that you
need better tools to encourage
researchers just to look at simple plots
like this so yes we need betters we need
better tools etc etc so the next thing I
wanted to do said ok brain maps this
this is sort of worked on this problem
what about an analysis workflow because
obviously if you've seen like this
reproducibility crisis in science like
we're not very good at being able to
show an entire workflow and so this is
my p.i this is rest pulled rack at the
time he was finishing up this big
project called my connectome project and
broadly what he was doing over about two
years was collecting lots of different
imaging behavioral metrics and then
metabolomics and genomics and this was
going on since october two thousand
twelve 25 year 2014 and what you see
here are all these different kind of
things that he collected and then the
number of measurements over there and so
when I first kind of saw this data said
I was like well I can make something
cool and so I made sort of little
interfaces to show for example like the
connectivity data the genomics data this
will show the brain connectivity let you
explore based on the region it shows the
corresponding brain images over there
you can export it as an SVG cuz i
figured if you're researcher you want
like to put in a paper or something but
this didn't really feel like it was like
that useful towards solving this like
reproducibility problem and so an
interesting thing about this particular
project because it was so big russ was
talking to many different groups and he
had many different like analysis
pipelines that he need to basically run
million times and probably just out of
sort of logistics and lay a little bit
of laziness he basically made a module
to run everything and so he came to me
and he's like Vanessa I have all these
scripts together in a module like can we
turn this into a reproducible thing like
what does that look like and I said well
let's start with a virtual machine
because you know we're going to be
dealing with sort of software
dependencies and that kind of thing and
maybe this this this seems like the best
way to go so I found vagrant didn't had
never used it before but it seemed like
the right thing to do and so then i said
okay my connect on vm what would that
look like what are sort of my goals for
this well i would want it to be
deployable with one commander click you
know vagrant that is vagrant up done I
then would also want the data to be
downloaded from the cloud you can keep a
lot of things in a github repo but
largely like a lot of these huge brain
maps really need to be downloaded from
somewhere this is actually a bigger more
challenging problem that it seems
because that i found that different
resources had sort of different
reliabilities and that even just the
simple task of like downloading stuff
could you could you could have a lot of
sort of bottlenecks I also wanted the
user to be updated about the progress so
the entire analysis took like 12 hours
and so if the user just like ran the
virtual machine and then they nothing
saw nothing like that's that's just not
okay and then finally whilst to go along
with that air and out pellagra should be
available but then when everything was
done I wanted the results to be sort of
explorable and I wanted to be here to be
able to see everything had the
satisfaction of knowing that that was
going on and so to solve these goals I
built the my connectome viewer the
virtual machine this is deployed it
results that my connectome org and
basically what happens is you do vagrant
up everything installs and this opens up
in your browser these are the four
components of the analysis these
coincide with sections of the paper so
it sort of makes its intuitive for
someone who's read the paper and
basically as these files as files appear
as results are generated the links will
go from grey to green then when you
click on a link you'll be able to get
sort of an interactive report it could
be our markdown ipython notebook PDF or
just some kind of HTML page doesn't
matter and the other thing that happens
is that the users always kept updated
about the progress as the analyses
progress
and the way that I did that is by
running it many times getting estimates
for how long each thing took and then I
can basically give them an estimated
time remaining based on the file out the
output files that have not been produced
yet and then when everything's done this
enough this button is exposed which will
let them explore the results and so as I
mentioned here's an example of the log
there's a complete our error log and
output log the data Explorer will let
you select different variables for here
and for most of these what researchers
really want to see when it comes down to
it is sort of correlation and effect
size and then Q values and these are
sort of searchable and sortable so you
could find what you're looking for and
one detail that you can't see in the
static view is that so one thing I
really like to do is put little bits of
sort of beauty in these design and so
this this banner here when you mouse
over it will sort of change a little
matrix style and the other thing this
graphic shows is that the interface
refreshes itself every 15 seconds so
that it can be updated and actually the
banner itself is a tool I made it so
that you can go to this little whatever
my website and then type in whatever you
want and then create your own
interactive banner because it's very
useful right okay so at the time russ
was also coming out with this paper that
talked about a lot of sort of this list
work and cognitive neuroscience and they
came out with this really cool cover
which is sort of calling the matrix a
little bit but when i saw this there was
something like completely wrong about it
and the fact is it's not moving when you
see the matrix and all those in one's
like boom is moving up and down so i
thought i could give this a better try
so i made my own interactive version I
think you can kind of see that but the
cool thing is that hidden in the letters
coming down I put actual cognitive Atlas
terms when you mouse over the little
brains it will show you terms from the
cognitive atlas you can then click on
them and it will take you to the
cognitive Atlas to explore it and this
seemed like a better representation of
like the idea they were trying to get
out than the cover also at the time the
neuroimaging was neuroimaging to have it
was having a data-sharing special issue
and so one of my labmates made this cool
background where which is a brain map
made of little brain maps but I think
you had to pay like an online
service where he like uploaded images
and sort of annoying and hard and I said
huh I wonder if we can use brains as
pixels and so I came up with art brain
which is pretty simple method but it
works as follows basically I generated a
bunch of randomly sliced brains of
random colors with open source data from
neuro vault I then would generate a
color lookup table for the mean color of
each brain map then what i could do is
read in an image and for some sampling
rate i could basically match that pixel
to some some it's up to some brain map
in my lookup table but I added a little
bit of noise because if you always
selected the brain same brain map every
time the image would be terribly boring
and so what did that produce well
rendered it then it would open up in
your browser so then you could take any
sort of image and then render it
completely in tiny little brains
specifically we can zoom in all of the
pixels are these tiny little brains and
sell here some of my favorites Ramirez
girl the Pearl and then Jigglypuff and I
thought this would be really cool but it
looked pretty cool in your browser but I
wanted to really see it at scale and so
I found that Stanford has this diver I
called the high because it's not
complete it's a 3d wall it's called aunt
hive and so I made portraits of everyone
in my lab and I took them there and I
surprised them with themselves in huge
3d brains I think they liked it I think
they liked it so then I said huh I
wonder if I can flip this around what
about images on the brain so the brain
has the canvas and so a couple years ago
I had done this little stupid matlab
project where i had on basically reverse
ica so i would hide a message in data
and then if you did i see a would come
out in so like here's ok i don't know
how interesting that is so this so i
said okay i want to be able to like take
this is around christmas try and that's
why you Santa I want to be able to take
Santa and I basically converted him to
enter your values and I probably don't
need to go over this in detail but
basically you read in the channels of
your data one's an alpha channel doesn't
have to be there though you basically
combine them into an integer value and
then you normalize and then you have to
scale it to fit onto the brain map and
then you write it into I decided
do an axial layer axles us like you cut
someone's head with an axe so it's like
the biggest view you can get and it
looks like Anna so it opens in their
brain VAT and in their browser and it
looks like this so here's we have Santa
you can also do it for sort of goggles
guy and so the last thing I did sort of
playing around this idea of like
different fun things to do with brains
is what about a 3d brain and so at the
time my labmate Chris he wrote this blog
post he said this is my brain sharing
the risk and to me this was more of like
a challenge like what can I do with this
that would be interesting and surprising
and so first I took his brain and I did
some simple analyses to extract gray and
white matter and to make a 3d model and
you know standard brain imaging software
but then I figured out how to export
that model into like real 3d software so
blender is what I have sort of on a boon
to so i made this remodel and then I
found a 3d printing studio at Stanford
and so I printed Chris's brain and I
presented Chris with his tiny brain and
it was really really it was really
awesome he eventually figured out it was
his brain and so at this point I'm sort
of having fun with all these sort of
different visualizations and going into
like the third quarter and yes you can
imagine as a grad student you have to
read a lot of journal articles I was
always plagued by this question why are
they so boring so my first effort to
make it better as i made this thing
called pubmed lib which would let you
enter search turn it would then retrieve
an article from pubmed parse the
different parts of speech and then here
to ask the user to enter just a random
sampling of those words whatever you
please and then you submit and then it
would basically render the abstract in
what i thought would be much more
interesting essentially mad libs for you
know pubmed art abstract so this is this
is useless but it's kind of fun a larger
idea i had is and this is sort of a
general kind of observation there can be
a lot of really nice tools and sort of
like things that you can use if you're
like a web developer for example have
you guys heard of font awesome yeah so
font font awesome is basically like web
web fonts and so if you see if you see
like a search bar icon eighty to ninety
percent sure that's probably a font
awesome icon it just makes it very easy
to insert sort of these icons that you
they're so common you don't even see
them anymore in web browsers I was like
why is it the case that like researchers
don't have something like that and on
top of that maybe we can take something
that's kind of dry and like just a
standard representation of something
like a method section and maybe I can
come up with a different way to show the
exact same thing and so I came up with
font brain which you're not seeing all
the icons but it's a bunch of different
icons and then this is actually a
rendering of this exact same method and
its interactive too so for example when
you mouse over the things it will say
okay for registration this is the method
that we're using this is the kind of
brain map and it's in this this standard
template space if you click on any of
these links that goes right to the page
so you can actually read about the
details of the method and so what this
idea is and this is something I like
think about a lot is how can we take
these standard representations of
information of methods like things that
you see every single day and think about
them differently and maybe make a new
view that is more fun or just that
people will be more incentivized to
actually use and so along these same
lines a similar question is how can you
extract new knowledge from sort of these
standard resources that you sort of use
every day and so i'll give you I've done
a million projects like this this is
just one example like it I'll show my
one of my friends mod who does something
totally different she's a microbiologist
she was looking at these different data
structures to describe genes and i
noticed that i don't think you read this
but i noticed that there was a country
filled so this says countries some some
country in spain read leave you and I
said huh I wonder if we can map the gut
microbiome or at least the human gut
microbiome and this was many years ago
actually before sort of the microbiome
became like a thing and so what I did is
I found this database of these data
structures i parse them all for this
exact field I then found that Google has
an API where you can basically get a lot
of tude and longitude for a location and
so for about a hundred out of 250,000
queries and I I only did that many
because my p.i very commonly gets mad at
me when I'm using your computational
resources for things that are not I
don't know not what I should be using
them for so I only did 100k queries i
filtered it down to Homo sapiens and
then I mapped it out and
was really disappointing so I said okay
basically at the time all of the data
that was sort of coming at least out of
PubMed for least half the queries was
from Spain and then basically Chicago so
this is a particular analysis wasn't
super interesting but it's this exact
kind of thing basically taking something
that is intended for something else and
then figuring out a new way to use it to
potentially uncover new knowledge that's
really important because what if we had
had enough data here we could have gone
to the papers and then found some sort
of interesting correlation with like
geographic location and maybe something
that they found in the paper and so of
syrup a problem that's more close to
kind of the kind of things my lab does
so I'll tell let me tell you a quick
story so my lab we have this ontology
called the cognitive atlas and we spent
like eight months just defining like I
don't know different relationships and
entities and it was painful and it was
awful and I was like oh my god we need
like we need a data-driven way to do
this because I never want to do it again
so maybe we can learn those sorts of
things from publications and so I came
up with a solution it's called word fish
it's this little tool for standardizing
corpus and terminology extraction
because I realized that a lot of people
a lot of researchers generally will want
to like have some corpus e thing have
some other text e thing they want to
find in the corpus e thing and then
they'll basically want to like put those
things together and then maybe do some
kind of machine learning to find
relationships or something and I was
running into the problem where have you
guys heard of deep dives at Stanford I
was running to the problem with deep
dive that it's like an over sort of an
over end question I shouldn't save
negative things but it seemed like it
was too complicated for really what I
wanted to do this was a much simpler
problem so I decided to make word fish
and so the way that word fish generally
works is that so it's a Python thing
it's based on this idea of plugins and
so a plugin is basically a script that
has a data structure that will either
identify it as like a terminology or a
corpus and so anyone can like write a
plug-in for their particular terminology
there a particular corpus then it makes
it immediately available to anyone that
uses the application and so you install
it with Python you basically so for this
first thing I'll obtain a large corpus
so one of
plug-ins for examples reddit so about
two hundred and fifty thousand different
reddit posts I then would actually parse
the text and so parsing a corpus just
basically the standard stuff removing
stop words non-english characters etc
etc and then I'd want to generate and so
the goal here is to find an unsupervised
way to find relationships between terms
and so I found this method called word
tyvek that is engineered by Google I can
share a paper after if you're interested
in it but it will basically generate
word embeddings or vector
representations of words based on the
context and this is really cool because
then well let me show you well first let
me show you what sort of the application
use case looks like this is probably
what you would be a user would be
dealing with so it asks for some basic
sort of configuration stuff and then it
says oh look we have and so then it
interactively queries we can hub repro
to find all the plugins that are
available is this oh we have these
terminologies we have these corpus just
select the ones you want to use you
select them it downloads this
application to your folder or to your
computer then what you basically do is
you just extract this in your cluster
environment you then just basically have
to define like a work folder and then
you install it installation just
basically means then you can go to the
scripts folder in the scripts will be
automatically generated all of the jobs
that you need to do the extractions to
find the terms etc etc and what it does
is it produces a standard data standard
folder hierarchy that has sort of your
sentences and then your terms and so
this is an example of an analysis
pipeline so basically I don't think you
can actually read that yeah that looks
pretty careful so basically you define
directories and then you read in your
corpus you make the models you build
define relationships and then you just
save them in different formats but so
when I talk about the mod been talked
about bottles and stuff and you probably
want to know more details about this so
we're due back generally you can think
of it as it's either going to be a
continuous bag-of-words model or a skip
Graham and the basic idea is that you're
either going to be from a word context
let's have a word here these are the
words the left and the words to the
right I want to be able to be able to
predict the word or with skip Graham I'm
start with a word and I'm going to want
to predict the context and so what i
could do is for example all these terms
in the cognitive atlas ontology i would
want to do this model because I could
take a context so some some text corpus
whatever and then predict the related
terms and so just to show you an example
after building a model you can say okay
what is the most similar to anxiety and
that it will return to you back the most
similar other word vectors just based on
the similarity score and so what I did
so I derived a model using a bunch of
neuroimaging corpus and then for all of
the terms in this ontology that my lab
worked on i calculated pairwise
similarity you can't see any of these
labels here but there's really
interesting structure here but then I
ran into a really big problem and the
fact is that there's no way to validate
this because we don't even have actual
like term I mean this is a totally human
generated thing this is unfortunately
where it sort of stopped and I'd love to
talk about it if you have ideas for how
to validate something that's doesn't
really have anything like that but
there's actually another sort of
interesting use case for this kind of
thing and that is this idea of can I
classified disorders based on reddit
posts and so this is a really
interesting huh how who's like an avid
user of reddit hear anybody a little bit
yeah the interesting thing about reddit
is that I found that if you go to for
example the depression board you find
posts like this people that really have
depression and for example and that are
writing about like their daily life and
I realized that the signal for like a
phenotype of depression is like sitting
in front of all of us it's like right
there on reddit yet here we are for
example at Stanford and researchers are
like trying to like collect all these
different data things getting health
information but really if you want to
sort of uncover this phenotype you don't
really need to look farther than read it
and so the the goal of this model would
be to be able to have some posts like
this and then be able to predict that
yes this is a depression post and so
what I basically did I derived a word
embeddings model for a reddit this meant
doing it for the entire corpus and that
gave me a vocabulary under 9000
and then for each post I can then
basically map that post to that vector
space by taking a mean of the words that
are in the model and then you don't need
to use SVM i just happen to choose it
because why not but I you I built SVM's
predict disorders based on the tax so
for example and I dealt with multiple
labels just by building pairwise models
and so for example for anxiety or
atheist I'd subset the data to all the
posts for those two things I'd hold out
twenty percent for testing eighty
percent for training build an SVM save
accuracy metrics and I have a big table
of these on github explore if you're
interested but what I'll show you is the
absolute worst performing one here just
which is about sixty-eight percent
accuracy distinguishing between the
boards cringe and nice guys I'm not even
totally sure what that means and you
know the the testing set is kind of
small and it's not great but the thing
about this the interesting result is
that for most of the results they did
very well and so for example for
alzheimers and bipolar which have you
know at least more reasonably sized
boards there's only six false positives
60 false negatives this makes a lot of
sense to me because when you look at
these boards the way that the language
in the context is very different and so
the next stage of this work would be
okay what particular sort of words or
what what contexts of that is really is
being used in the model to distinguish
between these two things and you
probably would want to use SVM if you
want something interpretable but um I
haven't haven't explored anything beyond
that so yes you can learn about disorder
from reddit actually took this idea to
my pie and he just totally said no
because you can't he couldn't imagine
publishing a paper and talking about
using reddit okay and so the full
results are there if you want to take
you to X for them so this next question
came up actually because of another
interesting story the ideas can I
measure can I standardize the
measurement behavior so modern
behavioral collection in psychology
looks like this you have people come
into a lab you sit them down the
computer maybe you don't even send this
to sort of like Amazon Mechanical Turk
and they push buttons and they respond
so this is the Stroop paradigm which I'm
sure you guys are familiar with and
that's it but the problem is that
everyone implements their own thing and
it's all the way there's always bugs um
you can
reproduce things from a paper and so
there was like there's a this is my
fellow grad student in my lab so he had
this interesting question can I sort of
what are all the different ways we can
measure cognitive control how do I
answer this oh I have an idea I'm going
to make a lot of these experiments and
matter of fact I'm going to send them to
an Amazon Mechanical Turk because
there's like lots of big data there and
then he found this thing called sighed
turk which would be basically a little
flasks application that would help him
code his experiments and send them to
mechanical turk and so his strategy was
to basically start hard coating them
into this one basov folder and so I was
peeping over shoulder and I was like oh
I wonder if there is a better way we can
do this and specifically I wonder if
there's a way that we can sort of take
advantage of all the hard work that he's
doing so that other people can use it as
well and so I said can we think of these
experiments not as this hard coded
folder but instead these modular things
that we can sort of select and move and
change as we want and then so we'd
probably need some software search for
sort of controlling them and then you
can also plug them into like whatever
deployment you want and so this was
rationale that week I came up with the
experiment factory which is an open
source framework for development and
deployment of web-based experiments this
is totally this is pretty recent work
and generally I these these are the
three goals that I thought were really
important the first is just to provide
tools for end users the second is that I
wanted a modular infrastructure I wanted
to be possible to define this sort of
component experiment and plug it into
some other component that is like an
environment and then modern technology
design are just really important because
if something isn't beautiful no one's
going to want to use it and so this is
what what it looks like this is deployed
at exp factory org so the idea is that a
researcher can log in when they log in
they can interactively just add
experiments to their battery they can
manage what's called a hit on Amazon
Mechanical Turk different studies they
can also have subject management we have
a blacklist and I also just recently
added a credit condition and then
there's the different deployment options
so you can either serve it locally like
sending someone a link or having this in
the lab to link or you
to send it directly to em Turk this is
totally docker eyes so right now exp
factory org is still closed it's there's
about five labs at Stanford and a couple
collaborators using it we haven't opened
it up to everyone because my p.i is
worried about sort of the intellectual
things associated with that but you can
just take the docker image and just
deploy your own exp factor at Oregon
like one command anyway so the other
thing just to give you a sense of what
these experiments look like this is a
standard experiment the person reads
instructions and then they you know do
some tasks this is my favorite I always
like this game where you have to like
get the one to look like that one our
surveys I wanted them to be just really
modern and beautiful so I use Google's
material design light and we've recently
added a likert and then just to give you
a sense of like what does it take to
actually contribute a survey I wanted
this to be just super simple and easy
and so each survey is just a folder in a
github repo when you look in the folder
there's a small configuration file
that'll have like a couple basically
variables that the software needs to
know how to sort of deploy it and then
the survey itself is just a tab
separated file with like with the type
of question and then the question tax
and whether it's required and that sort
of thing so anyone even if you don't
know how to program you can contribute a
survey you probably need to know how to
use github but you know I can I'm
probably gonna make a tool that will you
don't even need github for it and so the
other thing that I recently added which
is it I'm really excited about his games
so it occurs to me that a lot of sort of
traditional experimental experimental
paradigms in psychology are kind of
boring and for example if you're doing
research with kids they're not going to
want to be doing like the Stroop task
and so this is an example of one of our
math games where the kids has to like
basically solve add up the numbers to be
able to cross the bridge and these are
cool because right now we have about
eight different games and they're doing
a pilot study where they take these
games on tablets to schools and have the
kids do them another cool thing about
games is that they're totally sprite
oriented so you get much more than sort
of like if the kid gets the right answer
you know always you get the reaction
times and sort of where they're touching
the screen and a lot of really cool
stuff and so right so they've got some
kind of visual constraints of allow them
to solve the problem so it's not
equivalent task
right so yeah so their third see where
you're in the right range yeah you
wouldn't necessarily have in your mind
if you're just thinking about the
numbers right so they're all there's
there's about eight different for
example just math games and they're all
sort of different different you're right
that it's not just testing them to like
think in their head to produce an answer
I three and you know six out of 29 with
that knowledge plus making them look
about the right length I can solve that
problem whereas it's very different
different to the algorithm you'll always
have to run yeah I don't think I don't
think this particular lab I don't think
their goal is to try to sort of derive
like what's going on in the kid's head i
think i think they ran into the problem
where they really needed a lot of data
about kids answering math problems to
associate with brain imaging data but
they couldn't get the kids to actually
do the games or to even hold their
attention for long enough prezi read it
is gamification of paradigms is
something that has sort of been talked
about a lot and the problem always comes
down to the more gamified it becomes the
farther you move away from what you're
actually trying to represent but yeah I
definitely I just totally agree with
what you're saying so that's that's sort
of the balance and the drawback so exp
factory org I also wanted it to be
totally programmatically accessible to
researchers we have a complete API which
requires authentication total
documentation so this is a cool part so
I always think it's very important to
have testing of all your code whenever
you have any kind of change so all of
our repos are on Circle C I but I ran
into a really big problem in this and
that is specifically that JavaScript
bugs are terrible and there wasn't a
really good way to test JavaScript at
runtime and so my solution was to come
up with the experiment factory robot and
the robot can run on your computer or in
a continuous integration environment and
whether it's a survey or an experiment
the robot goes this is him slowed down
so you could actually see something but
the robot goes through and answers all
the questions and if there's some kind
of error so we test all the experiments
anytime there's any change and if
there's an error then it will trigger a
bug and obviously the pr won't go
through and so the other so this is this
is currently work in progress something
that i'm kind of become
a little bit obsessed with is like can I
learn about research practices and
methods from acts not like the text
everyone in academia is parsing like
PubMed I want to parse the code and so
my original and so for example maybe if
I can take text I could try to figure
out what methods are being discussed
either from the text or from the
equations I could maybe develop features
of different code repos and then being
finding associations between the repos
in the text and papers I could then
basically length length of different
repos to the methods based on these
citations and the general idea would be
then a researcher could take a new paper
you could parse it figure out the
methods that are in it and then give
them advice about which kind of software
they might be interested in and then
this other sort of higher-level question
like can you identify components of good
software the piece of software has been
cited a million times that might say
that it's at least been used so it's
useful and so what about that software
makes it better than some others offer
that hasn't been psyched excited and so
I came up with sort of repo fish and my
first step was to develop some kind of
rec vector representation and methods so
I used the same word fish that I talked
about before I found this wikipedia has
everything i found a list of statistical
methods on wikipedia i then developed my
own vector representations and i
extracted images links in texts because
the cool thing about wikipedia is that
all of their images for the late text
late tag equations um there are do you
have the code embedded it essentially
with the image so you can basically
parse those and come up with like a
graph representation for example so i
used word to backhand it built a model
using all the text i then math I then
would map each method on to the space
and calculate similarity and so what
you're looking at here is all of those
methods in similarity and ironically
this kind of looks like a fish and the
cool thing is that so for example over
here I saw lots of different types of
distributions here you have sort of
metrics of central tendency and standard
deviation these are sort of like high
level kind of like data science ii ideas
and then at the top i think was
different kinds of models and so what I
basically wanted would
to do is to be able to take some tax
from somewhere and be able to understand
how it maps onto the space based on the
text and so my step 2 I said okay I'm
going to take pubmed central articles
because you have full text I'm going to
map them into this method space so again
parse the text for each paragraph in the
text basically create that vector
representation and then and then map it
and so this is what I was going to do
before my dissertation then my
dissertation happened and I didn't
really work on it so I realized this
past weekend I was like well maybe I
could do something really quickly just
to kind of get a sense of this so I said
maybe I can look at microsoft research
publications and so this was like
Saturday afternoon so what I did is I
scraped all of the abstracts from
microsoft research site there's about
just under 10,000 authors and just under
8,000 publications there is the issue
with disambiguation of names for example
if some people have like a middle
initial and I did the best that I could
but you know it was just like I'm
afternoon project so I I did my best I
then wanted to generate an equivalent
collaboration network based on who's
publishing together and then again for
each publication turn it into a vector
representation and then I'd want to make
a doctor eyes visualization so other
people can sort of play around and
explore with it and so here what you're
looking at are the collaborations and
the good news is that this looks like a
stinky hairball which means that people
from different groups are talking to
another and collaborating we're not
seeing these isolated clusters so I
thought that was very good I sort of
looked at the people in this group and
this looks for example here's like
functionally this looks sort of like a
visualization group here's an example of
the dissemination problem because
Jonathan this particular Jonathan
appears twice once the middle initial
once without over here identified
researchers that are sort of machine
learning and sort of data science
oriented and so then I really only had
time to answer like really basic
questions like who has the most
collaborations and so here's a ranked
list I was hoping there'd be a big room
of people so I could possibly embarrass
somebody but no no big deal and so for
example I looked at David heck erman so
I built this docker application so that
I could just kind of start to look at my
data and I would say this is cheating
for
that's too many people in that paper and
so what are the dominant methods so what
I did is basically take an average an
average across all of for an average
across all the scores for every single
method and this wasn't very surprising
because you know what you see is that
sort of forecasting and inference and
analytics methods are serve on top the
one weird one here oh there it is
spaghetti plot yeah spaghetti plots I
looked at these pages and I think the
reasons that they show up is because
they have a lot of examples of like
applications because the spaghetti plot
is really comes down to sort of like
some kind of scatter plot and so because
there's a lot of texts that talks about
applications that's very going to be
very similar to what you would find in
abstracts and so my next really the what
I was able to build in terms of
visualization is answering the question
like what methods does a particular
author publish and so for example here
you can search for an author Michael ubi
who only has one publication so this is
all of the tween Oh 2,800 different
methods and I was pretty happy that in
the top five you start to see something
about Markov models and so what what so
what about the other question what
publications will match the method if I
have a particular method in mind and so
for example if I look up n and Marco
bottle will then return all of the
publications that I found with their
with their similarity score and that is
all the times that I had to do on
Saturday afternoon because i don't know
i had pack and stuff and so there's a
lot of stuff of that's under development
here and i'm really excited to get into
I want to be I've already written
functions that will basically described
well I started writing functions that
would parse a Python script and then get
sort of the functions and the arguments
and I realize that they don't need to do
that I can just look at the import
statements and get most of what I need
so I do that and I derive features I'm
also developing features based on the
file extensions in repose and also the
text content and sort of read me and I'm
also this is really cool I want to
develop a graph representation of a lake
tech equation so then because one of the
things I noticed is that when people
talk about their method for example the
abstract they're going to be missing a
lot of sort of the details about the
math and the distributions but if I can
parse the equations directly
a then that would give me that sort of
level of information and so all this is
available at microfiche if you're
interested in exploring and there's a
doctor image too and so in order to
understand the space of Python functions
the other thing I quickly did was great
ball of pie pie and so this is showing
you all of these methods based on their
dependencies here's sort of like Django
and you know pyramid and then there's
functions up here for working with like
hdb etc etc it's really it's it's
unfortunate you can't really see much
here but I can send you interactive
versions of these if you're interested
okay so i think we're probably running
out of time so I want to start to kind
of summarize what what what are some of
the big ideas that I've sort of talked
about in terms of what I've learned
today the general idea is that solving I
found that it was really fulfilling to
solve problems that will actually build
tools to help people and there are
different levels of helping people
probably the stuff that i have done is
very niche it's very specific for
example the neuroimaging community if
not going to like solve world hunger or
anything but I realizes a lot more
fulfilling than for example trying to
like optimize an equation or you know
point 0 x 0 point 0 1 percent the other
thing is that interesting problems are
hiding in just everyday things all of
those little sort of pressure points in
our daily life are sort of interesting
problems that are worth looking at the
other thing is that complacency sort of
going into something with a very
specific set of expectation saying this
is what I'm supposed to do and just
doing it is probably and then just being
sort of content with that is just so
incredibly dangerous and not only
dangerous it I just feel like it's
boring I mean I think there's probably
personality types this will be better
for but I find that it's much more
fulfilling when you're just constantly
sort of changing and being challenged
and with that goes like I said
expectations and so sort of as I alluded
to a sort of goggles optional and you
know really a lot of serve this data
exploration having impact as a
researcher as sort of a person in
general goes far beyond you know just
publications are doing what you're
supposed to be doing and then finally
and this something I think about a lot
how can we rethink sort of standard
representations of information and also
methods as well and so I wanted kind of
come full circle and come back to the
story in this race what
tell you about this race is that I
didn't totally finish it I collapsed
about 10 meters before the end and I was
able to kind of stand up and like crawl
over the line and then I was just
totally passed out in a tent and I woke
up there and like my a couple hours
later but this is a really salient
detail because I really stuck with it
because I loved it and a couple years
later well I got really i got much
better I stuck with it because I loved
it and I became a very successful
competitive runner and we went on to win
races but the reason this story is sort
of meaningful for me is because of
something my parents told me many years
later and it was that something my coach
had said to them at the time is that
Vanessa's mind wants to do more than
she's her body is capable of and I feel
that's really definitive of how I am I
feel like I come to all these different
sort of points in my life and my level
of thinking is always just beyond
whatever environment i'm sort of
currently in or what I'm currently doing
and so that's really why I'm here today
in front of you I we can make sort of a
metaphor about the kinds of problems
that I've worked on up to this point
these these very small problems they're
very niche and they're very specific
sort of like running routes and you may
get some variability in the terrain like
maybe sometimes it's kind of like lumpy
and bumpy but generally like if you look
at like the world of problems what I've
worked on is like this tiny little point
and I realized that there are so many
well they're small and they're not so
meaningful maybe they're meaningful for
for example for neuroscientist but
they're not meaningful in a really big
sense I have like these other problems
that I'm starting these questions that
are starting to trickle into my mind
that I'm really curious about for
example can identify dangerous jobs and
maybe make them go away can it seems
like I'm a very allergic person it seems
like we don't really have this like
nutrition and allergy things sort of
figured out can I advise people where to
live based on like these very small
details something I think about a lot is
the fact that there are so many people
out there that might have sort of
anxiety or depression and they're just
kind of suffering and maybe there's a
better way that we can like identify
these people and then help them build
some kind of interactive environment and
then a really important thing is like
how
integrated sort of everything is
becoming with like obviously the
internet and so how can we better
integrate sort of human things like
emotions into the space can my house
know that it's me when I walk in and
it's not someone else based on sort of
collecting data there's this huge and
then there's sort of these
non-traditional sources like there's
this huge sports of sorts of massive
online online play bass of multiplayer
online role-playing games where they
would be huge sources of data for sort
of decision making and social things but
no one's really taking advantage of that
in mining them and so the reason that
I'm here today is because I am hungry to
answer these questions and I'm not
convinced that academia is really the
best place to answer them and I want to
find what i see in Microsoft Research is
an environment that is just very rich
that offers opportunities to really
learn and grow and take risks and I'm
really want to pursue that opportunity
and so that's all I have presented for
you today I can definitely take
questions thanks to my lab for just
being awesome and you guys actually
funded me many years ago with a little
fellowship so thank you to you as well
it's great don't have any questions um I
think Robin I talk to you yeah okay so
there's plenty of time for it it's
actually giving me a great list of
things that I'll show you the other day
that's inside my patch has to do of how
much more work so far I imagine a Norman
Daryl have questions when okay do any
other questions for videos oh yeah i
have a very specific question actually
okay mention that um that a lot of brain
scans are in svgs and i was wondering
are those like the file format that oh
so greatly available so brain imaging
scans aren't in SVG's for energy has a
standard format called a nifty one thing
that nerve nerve endeavor has done wells
we have a really good standard file
format the challenge is being able to
take that data and put it a format so
that you can put it into different tools
that would be more sort of consumable
both by researchers and by people who
aren't researchers and so in order to
get like a brain map into a web browser
um sort of you could take the approach
the first approaches that I was feeling
like literally run during the entire
brain map but what sort of makes sense
to me is you'd want to have some kind of
data structure that can both contain the
data and then you could work with also
in the web browser and so that's why i
was going for something like SVG cuz i
wanted to sort of kill two birds with
one stone what's that the Nashua
Telegraph it's okay yeah okay named
after okay awesome oh well thank you
again you're not related</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
