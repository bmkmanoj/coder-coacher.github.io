you
so next up we have fuzzy bird a buddy
for autistic kids that supports them in
good and bad times this is delft
university of technology from the
netherlands and i was to chew over to
their presentation thank you to wait
thank you so we're t tu Delft my name is
Max and I am Sophie and we would like to
present you the fuzzy word which is the
body for autistic children in good times
and in bad times this is a photo made
during the exhibition where we presented
the fuzzy Bert at Theo Delft or other
teammates are Joseph and ousted and in
the middle you can see Thomas who of
which he couldn't make it we are in our
first year of her master program called
design for interaction and Delft and we
learn to design for real people but
again for this project that sure not be
quite a challenge in America 1 in 68
children is diagnosed with autism which
is a wide spectrum of disorders with a
shared set of symptoms Thomas the
eight-year-old boy he's one of them he
is diagnosed with highly functional
autism he really likes repetitive
behavior structure and order and he
really likes to feel and squeeze and
touch different kind of textures and
materials but in daily life he sometimes
has a hard time with such social
interaction and Thomas's affair for
uncertainty during his project in a
context of inclusive design we tried to
design for the one percent but see how
all the new insights we gained could
also benefit for us all select for Emma
who is a very shy girl who doesn't dare
to talk to other people or Noah it was
just very nervous for
first day at school but let's pretend
i'm thomas and i feel very tense so I'll
go to my fuzzy Bert and I'll start
interacting with it i will start
squeezing and touching and when SQ is
the left Green Wing you will see the
fuzzy Bert tildes head to the left and
green lights will start to glow it's a
very direct and understandable reaction
for Thomas which is very nice because
otherwise it would confuse me and now it
reassures me when I start hugging the
bird the bird will start five rating and
this cuddling movement will comfort me
and by petting the head the bird will
make a happy sound it will make him very
lightly and friendly I will trust the
bird and I will even find myself
mirroring the bird and after interacting
with the bird Thomas his comforts again
comfortable again so now if you met the
first birth and fifth met Thomas I will
go a little bit more into detail about
the process and tell you about the
insights so our process is quite a
roller coaster it had some good times
but also some bad times so we started
off at a project with eggie eggie yeah
Aggie had some flowers in a way it
interacted with the user its movement
was quite unpredictable and that cost a
lot of stress amongst the user so that
led to the inside that we should not
only focus on what the product should do
but also what it shouldn't do so
developing our concept we decided to lay
diac back in his nest and to see what
will happen so we waited for some time
and suddenly fuzzy Bert was born
so also with this I can give you an
answer to the age-old question what came
first the chicken or the egg so with
this concept where you went to see helma
Hellmuth online sorry helm of a line
she's a Dutch award-winning designer who
is designing learning toys for kids that
are diagnosed with autism she gave us a
pretty straightforward advice you are
not designing for the kids you were used
to be you're designing for the one
percent and you shouldn't really know
your target group because autism has
such a broad spectrum some things work
at certain people but don't work at
other people so you have to simplify
your concept to see what works and what
doesn't so that led to a little trouble
when you're designing and you're doing
research it's sometimes hard to
synchronize the way of conceptual
thinking with the way of programming and
embodying your design it's always
important to test out your interactions
to see if they are working so sometimes
you have to simulate or mimic the
technical part in order to see if it's
working that led to our final or not to
a final but it led to a working
prototype which we tested at a primary
school in Delft it had some kids with
special needs including Sam with highly
functional autism so we would like to
share this impression with you that we
made and I really would like to point
out the change over time of the facial
expression of Thomas or sorry Sam and
see how he interacts with the fuzzy bird
so
is normally quite close and shy trying
not to have eye contact but he starts to
explore what he can do with fuzzy word
he starts hugging that comforts him and
he dares to speak up
we really think that user testing is one
of the most rewarding things in research
and design because you can really test
out your concept and see how it works so
I would also like to quote one of the
teachers who told us that when Bob was
going back to class after playing with
fuzzy bird he started interacting with
other kids telling about this experience
with the fuzzy bird so we do not do not
only think that the fuzzy Bert can have
an effect on the short term but also
maybe in the long term so here we are
now with the fuzzy bird here in redmond
but we also want to take a look into the
future to see what the fuzzy beard can
do so i would like to quote one of the
psychologist who stopped by at our expo
in Delft and she told her she told us
that the fuzzy Bert remembered reminded
her of a transitional object that's an
object used by therapists to gain the
child's trust and to make him open up
and tell about difficult difficult
events so with these insights of
inclusive design and designing for the
one-percent we can try to find insights
that can help us in designing for the
rest and to create a benefit just not
only for Thomas will also for Emma and
also for Noah so I would really want you
to come to our showcase and experience
the fuzzy Bert yourself thanks
thank you that's a great picture that
also happened between Monday and
Wednesday so who would like to start
okay well you guys you guys know you're
doing well with this I don't need to
tell you I mean I think I don't know i
need a fuzzy birds sometimes work gets
kind of stressful and so I you know I it
seems like a rather complicated issue
right so you really you know your user
testing and what you guys I don't know
how many how many people have you
actually tested we've tested with eight
different kids boys and girls varying
from the age of five to ten yeah very
interesting yeah I mean it's all kind of
in the results right for what you're
going for here and so a lot more testing
a lot more iterating you know would be
great i mean i think this concept you
know is really really strong i could
probably keep going right i mean there's
probably quite a bit of innovation quite
a bit of additional features that you
could keep adding a lot more that you
can you can do with it so that's very
exciting as it and what a great look
this is a platform look at this platform
what an awesome platform so lovely
lovely sure her uh great great job guys
I think this is probably you know the
most complete concept in out of all the
kind of work we're seeing its i love the
journey that you got getting here the
fact that your prototype is fully
functioning and you pulled off the
presentation and demonstration of it
really perfectly that's very commendable
and that you subject to this to say user
user evaluation and really learned
through prototyping that that's all like
just total magic for me in terms of just
you know getting out of the theory
building it and really learning from
from the hard knocks and the experiences
of seeing it in the hands of your target
audience so totally commendable love the
work great
yeah really very very thoughtful great
storytelling you know he did a beautiful
job of putting the story together and
telling it and talking about the bits
that were a bit didn't work it is like
eggy just wasn't there um and woven into
a story that was very neat and very nice
um I think the only thing I would have
liked to have seen just because she does
such a good job being a see something
else was um thinking about other forms
for this you know I know you went from
eggy 22 bird but I kept kind of feeling
a little kind of unsure about the form
and the bird and the audience you were
going for even you know once you get to
school would you take that to school
with you and so kind of thinking about
the world of stuffed animals and what
what was going to work for people and it
being a platform basically so I you know
that's just kind of next steps really
like what else could you do but a really
nice project thank you
we have time for questions from the
audience hi a really interesting project
i'm very curious if you were able to
identify which aspects of fuzzy bird the
children were responding to was it the
the form of the interaction was it the
physical shape and the presence of a
face or no face or do you did you have
way of testing that to find out I think
they were reacting on both we did not
test how they reacted if it was not a
recognizable animal bird so it out of
face so that might be very interesting
if that's actually necessary but yeah
the director a feedback that the bird
gave and I think that will definitely
the features of the softness and
somewhere cuteness i'm not sure if you
needed the face wird bitte the movement
and that reaction yeah and also the
interaction with the bird is sort of
human-like in a small way so you're
touching it you're trying different
stuff you cuddly that can help in yeah
things that have to do with autism ok
thank you so much else
