you
but next up we have a presentation that
takes it to the neighborhood level
grassroots a platform for neighbors to
connect and it's at Carnegie Mellon
University go ahead thank you so much
Microsoft for inviting us we're really
excited to be here today to tell you all
about our work I'm Alec shoot oh this is
shannon and perilous airy and leslie
bloomfield and we're from Carnegie
Mellon University I want to start today
by talking about neighborhoods the
backyards and front porches the
playgrounds and parks that surround
where we live in the past this the the
the neighborhood was the centerpiece of
most people's lives today though you
probably work far from where you live
and most likely your children attend to
school that's different than the people
next door as our a popper tunities our
life have expanded the tonight
connections to our neighborhood have
greatly decreased think for a moment
about the green space in your
neighborhood who is the person who's in
charge of maintaining the community
garden down the street or who makes sure
that the playground three streets over
is safe and clean for kids to play in or
just who is the neighbor who always
keeps everyone else up to date on
neighborhood news I'm guessing that the
answer you're giving yourselves right
now is very different that when you were
a kid growing up in order to explore how
neighborhoods have changed and how we
can introduce technology today to make
neighborhoods stronger we conducted a
variety of design research in the
friendship neighborhood of Pittsburgh we
conducted surveys and we interviewed
neighbors we tested various prototypes
of differing levels of fidelity we also
did a really cool 10-person co.design
workshop with actual next-door neighbors
which was a whole lot of fun we came
away with for unexpected insights and to
tell you about them I want to introduce
Jane a neighbor we talked to who founded
a community garden Jane is a great
example of what we call neighborhood
pioneers she took an empty lot behind
her house and turned it in to a thriving
community
great neighborhoods always have
neighbors like Jane the biggest
challenge Jane had when she was starting
our community garden was getting other
neighbors involved but when we talked to
James neighbors it wasn't that they
lacked enthusiasm our time to help Jane
instead they were held back by not
knowing where to begin if they didn't
know Jane personally they were at a loss
we found a way to overcome this
involvement barrier is through
increasing sharing among neighbors
neighbors are excited to tell other
neighbors whether they're home or not
and what kind of tools are in the tool
shed behind them as long as they know
that that data is going to be in a
trusted neighborhood network and finally
neighbors are really excited to use new
forms of technology to share this type
of data obviously sensors are the ideal
technology to do this sort of in turn a
brokerage sharing right now because the
sensors are great technology because
they are rooted in the physical space
where they're located but they turn data
into collectible and shareable
information right now we see three
different levels of sensors in the next
five to ten years one our personal
wearables to our smart objects and the
smart appliances our home and a third
are open city data which will include
city-owned sensors and smart
infrastructure we see a great
opportunity for a fourth level the
neighborhood level and this is the level
that will connect people to the
neighbors they live around in the
physical neighborhood that they live in
and it will really help a neighbor like
Jane start new community gardens and
also continue them more easily
introducing grassroots a sensor system
concept that we developed that we think
will help to bring community back to the
neighborhood grassroots first addresses
this task of creating a network of
sensors at the neighborhood level
pioneers like Jane can purchase the
grassroots kit which contains 12
different types of sensors that contract
different types of information about the
local environment Jane can use the plant
sensors weather sensors and Podesta
sensors to understand her garden and the
neighborhood around it in new ways when
she places these sensors throughout her
neighborhood they collect this data and
transmit it back to a base station in
her home it can then be shared among
neighbors in a closed network
furthermore these kits are modular so
others can build off the system the jane
has created the second part of the grass
root system is a platform that allows
neighbors to use all this data in
meaningful ways to help improve their
communities the process works like this
the first step is gathering data with
the neighborhood sensor system in place
jane can log on to her grass roots
account and view all of her sensors on
her neighborhood map she can see which
the plants in her garter need watering
is well his who has visited the garden
recently in addition she can choose to
sync her personal wearables and other
devices in her home with a network on
the my data page the second part of the
system is to use this data to create
recipes if we say that all this data
makes up our ingredients recipes are
then the set of instructions that the
system uses to process and take action
on it recipes can create graphs send
custom alerts or initiate actions to the
smart devices linked into the system for
example this can mean turning on an
automatic sprinkler Jane can use the
recipe maker in the system to use simple
logic to create a recipe that lets
nearby neighbors know when a plant in
her garden needs to be watered the third
and final step is to share and grow Jane
can see all of her recipes on her
dashboard however she isn't just limited
to her own recipes that she creates
herself in addition in the past just as
neighbors once shared cups of sugar or
exchanged recipes culinary recipes with
grassroots neighbors can use the
cookbook page to swap and share their
sensor recipes this not only facilitates
communication between neighbors but it
allows communities neighboring
communities to collaborate with one
another share ideas and draw inspiration
now let's see how we envision this
system rolling out and Jane
neighborhood neighborhoods everywhere
live when people connect with each other
to take care of and improve the
neighborhoods they live in today
technology often prevents neighbors from
connecting with each other introducing
grassroots a neighborhood solution that
solves this disconnects by giving
neighbors son circuits the gathered data
and the digital system for understanding
the data neighbors collect the
grassroots encik it makes it easy for
neighbors to play sensors in their
neighborhood the toolkit includes 12
types of sensors which can collect data
about the weather traffic and violent
and more the sensors are embedded in
small environmentally friendly stickers
which can be placed online posts or
other surfaces around your neighborhood
you can use your smartphone to connect
the new sensors to your groceries
network once the senses are activated
they start transmitting data streams
immediately when you log on to your
grass roots of Charis you can see all of
the sensors that your neighbors have
shared mapped onto your neighborhood
the grass root system takes in all the
sensor data and gives you the ability to
transform it into information you want
using custom recipes finding new recipes
is easy using your neighborhoods
cookbook or you can search for similar
neighborhoods and see how they have
successfully used recipes you can even
make your own recipes by dragging and
dropping sensors and actions and linking
them with this simple logic grassroots
isn't just limited to the sensor kits
data it can add sensor data from a
variety of sources most cities share
their civic data with residents all of
these data streams can be added to your
neighborhood map smart objects are all
around us and constantly recording
information about their activity you can
add these object data streams to your
neighborhood as well with all the
sensitive data at the power to transform
it imagine how your neighborhood will
use it you could collapse data to
advocate for better air quality modify
traffic routes based on outdoor activity
or get more people to help maintain the
neighborhood green space the
possibilities are endless the question
is how will you make your neighborhood
better today we've told you about Jane
but grass roots is used for much more
than just gardening we tested prototypes
on real users and this is what they said
Melissa who just moved to the
neighborhood with her children could use
grass roots to connect with other
parents in the area that way she's
alerted when a pickup hockey game starts
three blocks down and her son can join
the fun and meet kids his own age rick
is a member of the neighborhood
association and concerned with local
traffic patterns by putting up sensors
that are pedestrian and vehicle sensors
he and other neighbors can monitor
locations in the neighborhood where
drivers speed Scott is the founder of a
nonprofit that advocates for bike
infrastructure in Pittsburgh by asking
his members for bike sensors in their
neighborhood he can map bike traffic and
petition the city for better bike routes
grassroots is a powerful system that
lets neighbors connect and use
technology to share with people around
them how will you use grassroots
excellent thank you guys also want to
make sure that the audience knows that
you guys can also participate and ask
questions and there is some 11 rounds
another microphone so just wait raise up
your hand if any time you do but in the
meantime maybe this time bills like to
start us off he's been getting cut off
so um first I I really like the fact
that you're using the online the digital
world to reinforce physically about a
bound community as opposed to virtual
communities which the latter it's done
well it's not done so well in the former
and so I like that focus I select that
you you chose to you have these
concentric circles of scale of group but
you chose to focus nicely on one to get
into enough detail but it also you you
touched on to show you thought about how
you can seamlessly move on the
transitions across the boundaries to cut
if so bringing the city for example so
the question I have um is let's say look
five years down the road tell me one or
two things that you were you that you
think are the biggest impediments from
realizing this vision because it is an
envisionment piece and what are the
things a couple things that you think
give you confidence that it's achievable
what are the roadblocks and what are the
catalysts we you know we talked about
this yesterday when we are going through
the run through the big challenge
technology technologically we see is
providing power and there are a few ways
to address that that we think one is
that there's a lot of work being done in
sort of capturing the ambient power in a
neighborhood and as time progresses were
able to capture more and more of that at
the same time people are working very
hard on ultra low-power devices that can
potentially work for months and months
so I think the combination of that so
we're using less power and we can maybe
gain more power maybe we can keep these
sensors up
for half a year so i think the other
challenge is environmental realistically
how much coming stickers or how many
sensors do we really want in a
neighborhood and how to sort of deal
with too many sensors at the same time
what are the marks of a great
neighborhood today you know we have big
box stores and fancy things like that
what if the mark of a great neighborhood
are these sensors that are everywhere
what if that becomes something that
people value in their environment and
it's not considered trash so one of the
things I in the presentation I
particularly appreciated was almost a
throwaway at the beginning when you
listed the number of people you spoke to
and so forth I thought that was nice and
you didn't belabor the point good job um
from there my head went to a dark place
because you know I grew up in
neighborhoods where I could imagine
these sensors revealing things like the
fact that my brother came home drunk
after breaking into somebody's liquor
cabinet and peed in the the community
garden and the sensors reveal that right
so I'd like to hear a little bit about
what you heard from neighbors about
their privacy concerns their
relationship concerns as a result of a
ubiquitous sensor environment I think
privacy concerns are one things that
that did come up in our interviews and
what people told us is well they would
not be comfortable just telling the
whole world when they're not home the
idea of theft or home break-ins did come
up in our interviews but if they knew
that that information was only being
shared with the close neighbors around
them that they trusted there's something
about living around other people that
even if they're not necessarily friends
and they don't necessarily know one
another since they're right next door
there's certain things that they just
trust about one another so that was a
big factor in addressing these concerns
and also with other things like sinking
their personal devices or other things
in their home we provided an interface
for them to specifically set more
guarded privacy settings around that so
they could stick to what they're
comfortable with I will just say one
other thing we never talked and this is
we never talked to teenagers actually we
talk to little kids when we talk to
parents but that's an interesting case
of that rebellious period between you
know 14 and 18 when you don't want
anyone to know anything so I think
that's an interesting
the privacy yeah yeah um so I love this
the whole time I'm looking at this
thinking it's like Pinterest meets data
sensory that was my feeling of sharing
the way that I share in the way that I
share with my neighbors um one thing i
would i would like you to comment is on
as much as you're designing a system for
data collection i think you're also
designing a system for to increase the
perception of safety and this links to
the the the play bracelet we saw earlier
which is this sense of even if i was
compelled by your example if i know that
kids are at the park i'll let my kids go
out there and I'm thinking this is great
I can stay and just write more papers in
my office and just send my kids outside
and it gives me the sense that they're
safe because there's other kids out
there but it could be a drug dealer say
who just happened to come to the
neighborhood and is hanging around so
I'm really curious about this idea of
the perception of safety or the
perception of community versus community
or safety sure we were very cognizant of
the fact that these days parents don't
really let their kids just like leave
the house and go down to the park and so
we wanted to create an environment where
they would feel safe just saying like
Jimmy like you can go hang out in the
neighborhood because I know it's safe
and I know there are other parents
watching out for their kids also so I
think it is definitely a perception
thing but our hope is that as people
sort of exchange being like you watching
out for my kid just with the sensor
system I'll do it for you and it all
builds a community up it's one like real
quick comment one of the more
interesting things you said was this
notion of trusting people you don't know
and and and how they support that it's
an interesting notion that how do you
build who can that actually happen and
is it perception or can it be real it's
it's an interesting thing how technology
can play I don't expect an answer just
but it's a nice it's something comes out
of what you're saying that I think is a
really it's worth exploring especially
in light of the keynote this morning
