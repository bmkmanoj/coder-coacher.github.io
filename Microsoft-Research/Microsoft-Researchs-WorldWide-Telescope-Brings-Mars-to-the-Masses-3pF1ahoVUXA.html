kemp from nasa we started thinking how
we could bring together the features and
the functionality that we had in world
wide telescope to some of the planetary
data sets and we really wanted to focus
on a unique asset the high-rise imagery
that Mars had and so we started working
and collaborating to figure out how we
could bring to the public and get it in
their hands the high-rise imagery is
one-of-a-kind camera that's on board one
of the satellites that goes around Mars
and takes really high-resolution images
of the planet's surface we have complete
base maps of Mars as well as very
high-resolution data that are actually
higher resolution than most of the
satellite data that is publicly
available of Earth and so we can
actually see Mars in better detail in
some areas then we can see earth
this project leverages several teams
within NASA and then also of course
teams at Microsoft and really it's
bringing together some of the kind of
cutting-edge technologies in both
institutions to do something which has
not been possible before people can go
for a walk on Mars now and actually see
the craters see the cliffs and get
appreciation of the scale in a way that
they could never have done before Mars
is a big place by making this raw data
its full high-resolution data available
worldwide telescope we're just going to
open all of that up to classrooms across
America across the world and in connect
with the public in a way we've never
been able to before so if we can really
put projects like worldwide telescope in
datasets like the Mars high-rise data
set I think we could inspire the next
generation of Americans like Apollo
inspired this generation of Americans to
really be innovators be thought leaders
and be leaders in the world
