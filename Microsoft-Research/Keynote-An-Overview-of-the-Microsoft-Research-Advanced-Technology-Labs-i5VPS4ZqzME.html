hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
so good morning everyone it's my great
privilege and pleasure to introduce Rico
Marvin our final keynote speaker for the
Microsoft summit here in vina del mar so
Rico mova is a Microsoft distinguished
engineer but is also the chief scientist
for Microsoft Research he was born in
Brazil and grew up in Brazil but he
tells me that he's also a Carioca which
I think will mean something too many of
you so that is something as well before
moving to industry in 1994 he was a
professor of electrical engineering at
the University of Brasilia where he and
when he joined Microsoft he started the
signal processing group which developed
new technologies such as a new media
compression formats which are used in
windows in xbox and it offers and also
microphone array processing technologies
which are used in Windows and in the
tablet PCs and in the Xbox Kinect as
well as machine learning technologies
for music identification in windows
media and believe it or not also in junk
mail filtering in exchange so all of
these things are due to Rico he made key
contributions to popular video formats
which are used in YouTube and in Netflix
and in Adobe Flash and digital TV many
other applications are also due to Rico
and the groups that he started Rico
received a PhD in electrical engineering
and computer science from the
massachusetts institute of technology
which we know as MIT sometimes in 1986
and he has over a hundred and sixty
publications and 115 patterns if you
visit his
as you will find many of the patterns in
little blocks up there on the wall in in
those areas so because of these
achievements Rica was elected as a
fellow of the I Triple E and he received
the technical achievement toward from
the I Triple E signal processing society
and a couple of years ago he has
achieved one final award which was
really significant he was made a member
of the US National Academy of
Engineering so with that I would like to
say welcome Rico and thank you for
coming to address us Thank You Judith
thank you for the very kind introduction
introduction es un preserve a estar con
ustedes no cement a empresa y las con
todo safe ah here i have to i will now
switch to English because my port on
y'all is not that good so uh and this is
a I want to talk to you about the
advanced technology labs but I will
start a little bit about microsoft
research in context and then switch a
little bit to why we have those advanced
technology labs and because i'm a techy
as as you saw from judith into the
introduction I can't help but showing
you some tidbits of technology which I
particularly find interesting and things
that were developing in our advanced
technology labs and i hope you will and
i'll try to go fast because oh by the
way i don't know if you got the lunch
ticket because if you're here then you
can have lunch so thanks for being so uh
I'll try to finish faster because I know
I'm between you and lunch and of course
I'm not here to to make advertisements
about Microsoft products but there's
this little app for microsoft research
which i will be using to control the my
powerpoint presentation so you can go to
the Windows Store it's called office
remote and it has all kinds of nice
features so if I assuming all goes well
it depends on bluetooth and as you know
bluetooth is a little witty
it seems to be working fine okay let's
go let me tell you a little start by
telling you a little bit about microsoft
research because i think that will help
the context when i tell you more about
the advanced technology labs microsoft
research actually started back in
nineteen ninety one because of a memo
which was created written by nathan
myhrvold at that time he was our chief
technical officer and he proposed to the
company we should have a research lab at
that time Microsoft was much smaller the
revenues of Microsoft at that time were
barely above 1 billion dollars well 1
billion is a good number but it's much
less almost two orders of magnitude
compared compared to what it is today
and since 1991 the memo is from 1990
Bill Gates really like the idea said yes
we started microsoft research and Rick
wretched led the lab for a little over
20 years and last year peterlee now is
our new head of microsoft research and
peters is still driving the boat under
the same mission statement we have the
three core sentences that i'm pretty
sure many of you have heard before but
maybe not of you not all of you so i
will remind you what drives us
philosophy is very important and the
core philosophy is the MSR is that the
first thing we do is we advance the
field in the areas we choose to do
research sounds good and that basically
says push the state of the art that's
what we tell our researchers work on the
things that you think will drive the
state of the art one very important
comment is that the word microsoft is
not in the mission statement so it's not
about driving Microsoft products we will
compare contrast that to a few slides
later where we'll do things a little bit
differently the second mission statement
is of course well by the way we are at
Microsoft and we have some commitment to
the company so assuming we invented
great things by advancing the state of
the art let's take some of those great
things and actually bring to Microsoft
products so it
totally fair that at some point we
should be thinking about Microsoft the
third one sounds a little bit pompous
but it's actually true ensure the future
of Microsoft in the computing field
there are many things that sometimes you
don't see but just to give you an
example of something we did along the
lines of the third mission back about
eight years ago when being still was
called live search we were having
problems scaling up the indices of the
web search because as you know at that
time if you go back eight ten years ago
and you guys some of you are experts in
that area indexing the whole web was
really difficult so you had to maybe in
dec some part of it and putting the
machines together to compute all those
indices in the crawling and all of that
stuff was very difficult and more
important the indices were big enough
and the content is large enough that any
search you do in the web there is always
thousands of results now a quick poll
among all of you who actually goes after
page one when you search on bing or any
other sort of change right so you
usually don't go beyond page one even
there maybe 20 pages but you just click
on things on page 1 which means
relevance is actually super important we
need to find what are the most relevant
things and we used to have a system with
sophisticated rules about computing
relevance and then about that time about
eight years ago thanks to microsoft
research we switch to a neural network
based system to compute relevance so the
system just learned we have some ground
troops given by people who would click
and we use that to bootstrap the system
so we did it call a combination for
those of you in machine learning of
supervised and unsupervised learning and
he completely changed the ability of
life search in now being to provide
better results so the efficiency of a
very important property of Microsoft
changed significantly thanks to
microsoft research and now i will
mention a little bit more later things
like connect can you imagine a company
other than Microsoft that could have
invented a device like that
with all the pieces of different pieces
of technology that you need to put
together to get to a device like that
which open a new way for you to play
games and now as many of you know it's
not about games anymore because now all
of us we're seeing oh this whole idea
about depth sensing it has further
implications than just game so we change
the field actually so we do try to hit
that bullet so our researchers do have
all of those things in mind and we are
distributed around the world we have all
these labs in Asia India Cambridge in a
few labs in the United States some of
them with specific names because they
are specific groups in some areas if I
ask you I'm pretty sure you would know
the answer but why why are we
distributed all around the world if the
headquarters of the company is in
redmond in the pacific northwest of the
united states why do we go to all those
places there's two reasons right so i'll
jump ahead of you one smart people are
everywhere here so here Latin America
Asia Europe so we can find smart people
everywhere and not all these people
necessarily want to live in the United
States second diversity people from
different societies think differently
they use technology differently and that
has an impact on how technology is
developed so some of the things for
example that we can develop here in
Latin America because of the way I'm
from from Latin America so I understand
the differences if you travel many of
you have travel all over the world you
see those difference you see how people
use technology differently I'll give you
an example if you look at social
computing and communication through
social networks all of you are quite
familiar with Facebook and a few years
ago if you go into Brazil Brazil
everybody was in an another network
called orkut which is owned by Google
and everybody thought oh wow they got
the half of the users of our code was
actually in Brazil and we don't quite
understand why and then I said oh it's
going to be difficult for facebook to
to get a market in Brazil in less than
six years everybody switched because
people start using they pull together
today Brazil's the second market for
facebook and it's like whoa and it's not
that easy to predict that and to
understand that better you need
scientists researchers and engineers in
the area that can see how people use the
technology that's just an example
there's examples all over the place
right and we also have our advanced
technology labs which i'll talk to you
more about which is the topic of this
talk they actually report through me
which is interesting because my groups
none of them are in the united states
even though I my office it is in the
United States so we have a group called
atl Europe which is in Munich Germany we
have atl israel in atl cairo it's
actually fun to get folks from Israel
and Cairo to work together and you can
imagine what that means but we take
religious barriers and other things away
and the engineers and researchers just
work together which is fun and as you
can see there's no dot in Latin America
right so some of you may be sick hey you
have something missing oh not anymore
we're going to open this year an atl lab
in in Brazil in Rio de Janeiro so if all
goes well we and I'll tell you a little
bit more about the work will be doing
there so if we think in terms of return
on investment this is a question I've
asked you before in other these events
and I will ask you again just to wake
you up a little bit what is the ROI of
research if I ask you the following way
and look of all the projects at
Microsoft Research what percentage of
those projects do you think actually hit
the product let's say in the short to
medium time frame ninety percent eighty
percent fifty percent higher lower lower
twenty percent lower ten yeah five no
not one
huh it's actually a little bit better
than that but it's not we actually don't
measure it's not a number that we keep
tracking I remember and I was at some
point the manager of the Redman lab and
it's not i would look at many many
numbers and that number i didn't really
pay much attention to but there was the
other number which is if i flip the
question a little bit this is just an
example of many products from microsoft
what percentage of the microsoft
products do you think have technologies
that help that product that came from
Microsoft Research 95 whoa you're
optimistic oh you're from Microsoft okay
so any other guesses 80 60 80 all right
it's actually a pretty close to 100
every product some of the things you
don't see for example I'll tell you one
that you don't see in Windows since
Windows Vista we have this thing called
super fetch you're probably very
familiar with caches right so if I'm in
an operating system and open an
application the application opens up
buffers and memory files in this can all
of that and I can catch some of those
things so next time you bring the
application things are cash it loads
faster you're more productive with super
fetch we go a little beyond if everyday
9am you open your outlook email clients
next day at eight fifty or so we preload
outlook so when you load for the first
time it already loads faster so we
literally prefetched based on statistics
of usage sometimes we hit sometimes we
miss when we miss it just takes a little
longer to low so there's tons of
technologies if you look at azor for
example lots of things recently
Microsoft Research made a major
contribution where you can have the
reliability of duplicating data because
you need to duplicate data because hard
disks failed right you can't store data
just in one hard disk and if you think
the naive idea of duplicating by just
copying the same data in the same hard
disk in a second hard disk and then
your probability of error goes down
significantly because you have two
copies you can achieve the same
probability of error or the other way
around the same number of nines in terms
of reliability not by having to X of
number of discs by having only one point
35 right so that difference if you
imagine a company like Microsoft we
literally spend billions on data centers
that is a very big difference right so
what makes Microsoft Research which we
usually abbreviate to ms are so I hope
if you don't mind if I if I say MSR
because it's shorter microsoft research
so we have about over a thousand people
between researchers and engineers most
of them are researchers about more than
two-thirds because it is about research
it is a research lab so it's but if you
look at the size of Microsoft Microsoft
has more than 100,000 employees
especially now that Nokia joined us so
it's less than the one percent of
Microsoft but you know it's the largest
computer science research organization
in the world I'm pretty sure you do not
know any university where the computer
science department has a thousand people
ok so we're equivalent to several
computer science departments in fact
every year we hire the equivalent of a
computer science department which means
we spent a lot of effort trying to hire
the right people we cover the breadth of
computing anything related to computing
including lots of people in sociology
psychology because of course how you as
you saw in Jonathan's talk earlier today
how people interact with technology is
incredibly important global locations we
already talked about that and of course
the last sentence there is one that we
always use when we're interviewing young
researchers for positions at NSA come
work with us because you have the
opportunity to literally impact billions
of people or hundreds of millions so and
people do get excited about that we see
that researchers they love to publish
the result and they also love the idea
that their work has a potential to
influence
good percentage of the world so what is
the value of Microsoft Research to
Microsoft why do we have it why do we
get back I already gave you one metric
our products do benefit from it but do
we benefit enough is the investment
justified of course we think the answer
is yes we wouldn't be here talking about
it so some of the things for example the
Adil agility to driving respond to
technology shift that's actually quite
important not only technology evolves
but the derivative of the evolution
keeps going up things change faster an
example that you've all seen who would
guess that a some new communication tool
like what's up would go from a few users
to almost half a billion users in less
than two years it's almost unimaginable
but it does happen so things happen very
quickly if you put in a new technology
it can catch on very very quickly right
so and because in research we're not
tied to the day-to-day of delivering
high quality engineering products we can
step out a little bit and look at the
technology few and anticipate the
changes and try to help the company with
those right of course expand
problem-solving capabilities do you
think that engineering groups they come
to msn say oh I have this database
problem things are not fast enough the
memory is not optimized can you help me
with that it happens all the time and as
much as we can we really like in an SR
to say yes to those questions it with
you as an obligation to answer yes yes
we can help yes we will work with you to
improve your engineering as well even to
the point of I'll stop working on my
paper and I will work with you to
improve this technology it's part of the
culture of Microsoft but when some once
i'm done yeah i'm going to go back to
the paper because that's fun too so the
balance of the two is actually quite
good for the company right naturally we
generate a lot of intellectual property
about twenty percent of the patents file
our come from MSR as you saw naturally
promote the use of microsoft platform
the outreach team at Microsoft Research
they are they're driving this event this
event is an example where we we can
connect and show you the advantages of
Microsoft platforms we go a step further
i'm pretty sure many of you have used
many technologies that we distribute for
free to academia like the kinect sdk and
tools you saw touch develop you saw in
there many tools and software
engineering for example which is a
strong area naturally for microsoft
research because we are a technology
founded on software many of those tools
are available to you in academia and
sometimes they become available as part
of a product as part of the visual
studio but you can have your hands on
tools like pecs and z3 touch develop
many many tools before they are
available commercially and we really
like that the idea that if we can help
you grow then we also benefit from that
because we're gonna hire your students
to work in our company and the whole
feud goes together and everything goes
faster so we all benefit from that
enable other fields of science I saw
that here in the event many nice
applications and how can you use cloud
computing to to environmental science
and hydrology all kinds of scientific
research and of course at the end of the
day it is about the main goal of
Microsoft Research is long-term impact
now let me go with that as a background
let me talk about advanced technology
labs and those are new they've only been
around about seven years we started each
lab the newest one as I said hasn't even
started it will start later this year so
it is a younger organization and what is
that we're doing and why why do we have
those advanced technology labs it's
basically diversity of research models I
already talked to you about diversity of
people because we have people all over
the world that helps the development
Richard development of technologies the
other one is diversity of research
models so we still want continuing the
main charge
you remember the first mission statement
of NSA is advancing the state of the art
but since we invest a fair amount in
research as I told you you can do a
calculation whoa to run a thousand
researchers and engineers will cost you
this much money a year you can probably
guess we don't tell what the number is
but you can probably guess within an
order of magnitude right given all that
investment which is a very small part I
mean Microsoft invests about 10 billion
dollars in research and development
every year which is a very large amount
it's a very small percentage of that
that goes into an SR and within that a
small percentage can be a little more on
applied research because research
naturally you all understand that and I
just said in the previous slide is about
long-term impacts but what about short
and medium term impacts all of you have
ton of ideas our researchers and
engineers have ton of ideas can some of
those be leveraged more quickly I was
just mentioning that things move fast so
we have some great ideas for the
long-term can we do something in the
short term maybe with an opportunity for
quicker business impact that would be
good for the company so part of the ATL
is about that pick up some areas and
invest for faster impact that usually
means you have to develop prototypes for
example faster to be able to test them
quickly and see if you can ship and more
quickly which means that most likely and
then we do that you need more engineers
than researchers because you have a few
researchers to help with the ideas but
you really need an engineering team to
build the prototypes and try to work
with the product engineering teams to
see if we can ship something faster and
that's what we do in the advanced
technology labs right so I actually
established the vision the mission
statement for the atl and it's different
if you look at the first sentence it
says create tangible technology
innovations with high impact on
Microsoft's businesses right now I put
the Microsoft name on the vision number
one because it is about short-term
impact I put tangible technology in
vations if a researcher from one of my
atl labs come to me and say rico i
published this wonderful paper say wow
this is great this is icing on the cake
what did you do in terms of prototype
development so I will ask about the
prototype development first and second
about the papers papers are also nice
because ideally with the super high-tech
world we live on being founded on
research is is still a good thing and of
course in our lab we should connect
those labs to the MSR labs and tap on
the research already conduct conducted
on those labs and then adds the
engineering to to have shorter term
impact and also leverage the local
connections for example and I'll touch
on that later if you look at the lab in
Cairo it is in the Arab world the Arab
world is very large if you look at all
the core countries together is about 500
million people it's a large untapped
potential because it's a it's a region
that keeps growing and one interesting
thing there it's in that region two
aspects that are important one is that
the young generation just like here you
see as well in Latin America people are
both lingual they speak their language
and they also speak English and when
they use tools such as Bing and they
look for information they want a
multilingual interface because they want
information both local and global
because they are eager to connect the
two and make sense of the information in
that way which means our ability to
process other languages and processing
Arabic language is difficult indexing
content in Arabic languages is difficult
and the lab in Cairo is able to add the
necessary technology so that the
performance of technologies or services
like Bing would be high in that area so
the local connections for each one of
our labs are very important so we call
we won put way to see a pictorially this
idea about the atl's is that we bridge
the innovations
I'm exaggerating a little bit but think
about on the rights product development
and on the Left research sometimes there
is a gap and in fact I'm pretty sure
many of you know that some companies
have tried to do research and didn't
necessarily find the best way to connect
the two so you would have wonderful
research results that don't necessarily
help the business right I don't need to
tell your stories about that you know
stories about that right but so with the
atl's we try to put a bridge between the
two and we can say there's many terms we
use one is incubation we can prototype a
new idea and try it out before we
actually try it as a product that's why
we also refers to risk reduction we they
tell take the risk of trying something
even shipping something in bins so for
example my team in Cairo they can
actually modify big they have access to
the to the code they have access to the
system they can modify being the big day
runs in that region they can't modify
bring look globally without lots of
other processes but they can modify it
locally and then we can run experiments
and if we learn things that we think
will scale to other areas then we can
port those two to being globally right
and it's more of an intrapreneurship
which is really intrapreneurship we're
trying to come up with innovations
inside the company and move fast so the
idea of moving fast shorter term impact
is in the heart of the atls and of
course to achieve that collaboration is
key for example in my conversations with
my teams in details I always tell them
well if you do some interesting research
because that's needed to finish your
idea and finish a prototype that's super
but if you duplicate the research that
is already being done in the core
research labs you're missing an
opportunity right so again bringing
high-quality prototypes is the core of
what we do in the HL and in many cases
we also work with external partners
especially industry partners in many
industries
pan on high technology and they are
willing to take the risk with us on
advanced and just to give you an idea
some of the areas we work on the Munich
lab works on Internet of Things data
analytics systems assurance Cairo as I
mention a chiral language processing
they also help a lot on multimedia
information retrieval which there's ton
of work to be done I'm pretty sure all
of you when you do image searches on the
web nobody delivers that with the best
possible experience there's still lots
to be done in terms of improving the
ability to find images and video on the
way and the chiro team is pushing in
this direction atl Israel works on
interaction mining in computer vision
I'll show you some examples of the
computer vision work in Brazil will we
plan to work on document understanding
and new search media experiences maybe
in the next of these events I'll be able
to tell you in more detail what that
means because by then hopefully we'll
have some results in that area right so
now I would like to show you some
examples of the work we do in those labs
for example in the atl europe which is
our lab in munich is the largest of our
atl's we have about 30 a little over 30
people there and the main area of work
is intranet of things well that term is
a little broad it can mean many things
and why they're mostly working on is
developing a system such as the diagram
in there and the core vision is the
following imagine that you're a data
specialist and you're working on the
cloud and you want to gather data from a
bunch of sensors and you want to issue
queries on that data you want to learn
things from that data but you only want
to work on the clouds and the data is
provided by sensors to be a bit more
specific for example the work which
we're working with Nissan imagine that
your car company is actually monitoring
with thousands of sensors in every car
all the time so the car company sees
what's happening to every car all the
time and I can monitor that well does
that mean that
each car with 12 or 20 sensors that are
sending data is the data being sent up
to the cloud all the time no because
it's too much then sending all that raw
data would be too much ideally you only
want to send the data that matters to
the queries you want to run to the
analytics we want to run so we
implemented a system based on the SQL
Azure streaming sites technology to get
it streaming data so you wish you the
queries in the clouds and we push down
queries to clients through the
aggregation correlation and to the
little servers in each of the data
sources so that the queries actually can
run all the way down to the sensor for
example imagine I have a sensor
measuring temperature every second but
the query only needs temperatures every
minute I can do the averaging in the
sensor love before I upload the data so
simple things like that and more complex
calculations like that are distributed
so we automatically distribute the
computation from the cloud to the server
so that you can actually handle for
example recently a few months ago we are
using ourselves the technology and
office 365 all the server's of office
365 in particular exchange 365 it's the
one that is implemented now all servers
of exchange use that technology which
means when you're in a web browser
running outlook as an office 365 clients
if there is some performance degradation
we will know about that very quickly
because we measure not what you're doing
we don't look at emails or anything like
that but the performance our windows
loading faster our messages flowing fast
enough all these metrics are being
measured all the time so we can work
together with IT managers on
organizations and much more quickly fix
problems so this idea that Internet of
Things is growing i think is where most
of the traffic of the internet in fact
today do you know what most of the
traffic of the internet is more than
fifty percent is one file format of all
the internet of all the internet more
than fifty percent is one particular
file file for it
yes h.264 so it's it's a big deal I
think Internet of Things in less than
two years ten years is going to pass
that because everything is being
monitored by the internet and you will
want to monitor all kinds of things that
you don't even think about today but you
need smart systems like that and if you
want to know more about this we have
some tools they're available just let me
know this is just a diagram that shows
the typical data flow but many of you
are experts in data management so i
don't need to talk much more about that
let me talk a little about connect and a
little bit about this path between
research and apply technology and
connect is a good example in the two
versions how we needed all of it to be
able to deliver what we have today this
is actually something I built and as you
can see the dates in 1998 with erector
sets with a bunch of microphones and
people like what are you doing oh I just
want to play with lots of microphones at
once right I was just talking yesterday
I think was I don't remember with whom I
think was with Vidya we're saying
remember how the restaurant yesterday
was very noisy but in the middle of all
that noise you can listen to somebody
and focusing and listen to I that it's
difficult particularly yesterday evening
but you can but you can do a quick
experiment cover one year and try to do
the same you will not be able to do that
because the fact that you have two years
and the phase differences in the two
years it's fundamental for you to be
able to zoom into a particular thing
well we're not so we're not as good as
mother nature so we need for we need for
microphones so many years later we had
our first prototype or a four-element
michael ray and if you look at the first
connect from 2010 and you break it apart
and you see in fact the reason for the
connect to be about a foot in length
because that's the distance we need for
the microphones if it were not for the
microphones it could be smaller right
and since we have the space we actually
put some more stuff in there but the
main reason is for the microphone array
in just to give you an idea what do we
do with that because the problem would
connect
was really revolutionary because you
don't have a controller anymore but if
you playing the game in the phone rings
how do you stop the game because there's
no button to press you say Xbox is
stopped right it's an easy thing to do
it's actually very powerful I always say
that because you don't have a controller
because you do not have a button to
press you cannot press the wrong button
right and that open up all kinds of new
usages of Technology because you don't
need to press a button but see for
example this out
next
in the middle of the game there's all
these sounds but then I'm trying to talk
to a xbox do this do that but how can
Xbox listen to that even for you it was
a bit difficult to understand what
saying because there's all the sounds
being played say well I have I need to
remove those sounds and just leave your
voice there some of you may ask well but
you're playing the sounds so if you're
going to remove the sounds that you put
in in the first place it should be easy
because you generated the sounds you
just subtract them back right it's a
minor detail because you're playing the
sounds through a loudspeaker they go
through the acoustics of the room and
they come back to the microphone and I
know there's tons of smart folks in here
oh there's a simple differential
equation it's a linear process that maps
why do you play out for what gets back
in sure there is a differential equation
a minor detail the order of that is
4,000 are you good about solving
differential equations of order four
thousand and doing that 50 times a
second because it changes as you move
around so and that's what we have to do
and you do and you get this
Xbox which profile so as you can see
it's not that perfect but all that noise
went away and it's mostly the voice and
you could say you could hear he's saying
Xbox which profile right so I'm going to
skip this a little bit and as you can
see when we went to the new xbox which
we just released a few months ago about
half a year ago you can see there is the
new block with the new technology for
the cameras and there's the bar on the
bottom still with the four microphones
still in the same configuration we
didn't change the microphone technology
but we did change significantly how
depth camera goes the old xbox would
produce an ir pattern and breed back
with an IR camera and the distortions of
the pattern would tell you the depth
because we need to measure them with the
new xbox we actually do a time of light
sensor basically from the sensor sorry
for the drawing we send a laser and
there is an object we send a laser to
the object the object reflects the laser
we read it back the time it takes for
the laser to fly to the object in back
that's why we call time of fly is a
measure of distance right well if you do
the calculations if I want a resolution
of about a centimeter or centimeter and
a half I need to measure picoseconds so
wow that's a bit tricky not only that so
it's a tons of pixels per frame but the
problem is that multiple light paths
generate what we call multipath because
if I send a laser to you another laser
when I'm skinny may hit the table and
hit you and get back to me how do i
differentiate the reflection that was a
direct reflection from a direct path
versus a reflected path it takes a lot
of computer vision to solve that so the
lab in Israel we did two things we
actually found a new algorithm that they
reduce the dimensionality of the problem
and we put the engineering because we
had to work on five percent of the CPU
because the Xbox Guide story you can
only use five percent of the CPU because
the rest has to be for the game right
you can't use that much and and we did
it and if we not had done that we would
not be able to ship that technology so
it was really important tour
very hard on the engineering in
combination with the algorithms I can't
tell you about the algorithms yet
because they will be published soon and
then at that point I will be able to
tell you more but we did a very nice
combination of scientific push in the
engineering push and we came up and i
will show you why do you want to take
all that trouble so basically from basic
research research directed to the
product and then we get the impact of
being able to ship the new connect what
can you do with the new connect I think
a good example is by this video that I
would like to show to you I'll point out
the anatomical correctness his hips are
in the correct location he has a
multiple spine this shows the skeletal
not all her problems from the new poles
joints in his head and neck so he can
bend over he can bend forward he can
move his head shrug his shoulders so you
know we're connected the first version
was really about understanding gross
human motion we have true you can see on
hand hands Adele you can actually
distinguish the motion other day
advancement I'd like to point out is the
new joints we've added in the hands we
have joints that represent tip of hand
and the thumb so as Scott is opening and
closing his hands you can see it being
represented on screen the skeleton is a
great representation of the various
bones and how they're connected together
but we took it a step further and
started with orientation now this is
block man as a team calls him and when
block man represents is the actual
orientation of Scott's body as he's
moving in 3d space as he rotates his
hands in his arms and his legs you can
see that block man is you know very
accurately depicting what he's doing so
we're kind of getting beyond the joints
we have the actual rotations that his
joints are experiencing you can even
draw small nose circles in the air and
we can see his head rotating on block
man in line with what it is at Scott's
doing now I'm a pretty tall guy I'm six
foot four my skeleton only weighs eight
pounds if you really want to understand
what's going on with the human you need
to understand and describe what's going
on with the muscles the forces the
torques so that's our intro into muscle
man so muscle man is a real-time human
based physics model applied on top of
our next generation skeleton
high-resolution depth map but what the
colors represent is green equals no
force and then the highest intensity red
is the largest level of force as you see
as Scott kind of shifts his weight
between one leg and the next as he lifts
a foot you can see the red disc
representing the greater force you know
on the floor being exerted you can see
changes in his core and his legs if i
can get Scott to do a little bit of a
squat for me all right go ahead and hold
it like he's feeling it in his legs and
you can see it on the screen you know
normally make him do that for a long
time but I'll go easy on today so as you
can see there the level of resolution
for the skeleton models and now these
models such as muscle men are are
significantly better and you can see
well what can I get my hands on that can
I get a development toolkit for the new
kinect so I can actually use this
technology yes in a few months is coming
up so I already have my hands on one and
it's coming up I don't I'm not
authorized to give you a date but it's
coming pretty soon right so and probably
the connections team will have more
information about that as we in and I
know you're well connected to them as we
move forward okay so just to close I
want to show you something interesting
that we do in atl Cairo which is social
media analytics how can you do sentiment
detection in messages especially in
social computing how do you put together
social computing and information from
social networks together with search to
maybe have a new experience in search so
we've been doing a lot of work in atl
cairo on getting data tech sources from
email Twitter Foursquare facebook
Instagram all of those and we break that
apart select the sentiment of those
tweets which is very difficult I mean
tweets for example are very short
messages understanding if that's a
positive to eat or a negative 2 it may
not be easy but then discover relations
find the topics and use that information
in conjunction with the information we
crawl from the web for some experience
so for example a few months ago we lost
we launched
what we call a pilot or a flight some
portion of the traffic of being in
Brazil we're trying this technology so
for example if you if you are in Brazil
running being a new issue in some topic
we only enable it for a few topics for
example if you issue a search on a
telenovela as you know just like here in
Brazil telenovelas are a big deal right
and people want to know what the
conversation is about the tantalan vela
so we kick in this system and we will
bring up some of the what we think are
most relevant tweets about what's going
on in the novella so it's an experiment
of a different experience so do you want
to see the search results and at the
same time what people are talking about
that probably yes right and you can see
that sentiment analysis is very
difficult for example labeling of data
different words that mean different
things in English and Portuguese because
people may be typing in two languages
for example it's less formal for example
i love messy for his goal where's this
word where's the word in dictionary for
some of you in Brazil there is a new
word that we invented in facebook in
Brazil which is an arbitrary number of
case you can put a bunch of kids
together and it just means your life in
kaakha kaakha kaakha kaakha it's been
you can put as many as you want and all
of those are variations of the same word
it just means you're laughing so instead
of LOL you type a bunch of case so
that's why we need to understand the
local way people interact with those and
then oh okay they're laughing so this is
classified in a different way so data
sampling because you have lots and lots
of tweets each one giving you only a
tidbit of information so even the
problem what what is it important to eat
waters are not an important we there's
tons of noise and the tidbits of cool
information finding those tibbetts is
difficult we can have multiple targets
because the sentence may be talking
about several things at the same time
then you don't know what the sentence is
really trying to say negation so I
didn't like
Julie in this move you gotta be careful
that's a negative thing sarcasm look at
this one what a great car it stopped
working in two days yay of course you're
being sarcastic but you detecting that
is not that trivial so that's why the
natural language processing expertise we
have in Cairo really has helped in there
so again since i talked about angelina
jolie something we're trying to
experiment and we haven't really
released this yet is the idea of
bringing gossip and news if your search
is about entertainment right and you can
imagine business implications of doing
that not just different kinds of
advertisements but connections with the
companies that supply that kind of
information so there's all kinds of
possible business which we are still
exploring well I promise you I would
recover back some time because you must
be hungry so I will stop here and I hope
I gave you a good idea about details
thank you
don't know if we have time for questions
all right so thank you very much Rico
hey basic introduction to all the things
we do in our labs questions
thank you I was wondering what is the
relationship that you want to create
between students in universities and
these new labs similar to what you have
in MSR or is different that's a good
question you're asking about the
relationships with the students we try
to have roughly the same for example in
the chiro lab the problem with diversity
is a little more difficult and in other
areas of the world we see fewer girls
wanting to study computer science so we
put a little more effort in programs
such as DG girls and others to attract
those students to to get the girls more
excited about technology and we try to
have the same kinds of internships for
college internships PhD student
internships but when we bring them in we
explain look this led is more about
applied research so if you're interested
in in more fundamental research in more
core research you may want to consider
one of the other labs but if you really
want to get your hands dirty and do
something more applied and work maybe in
some of the code as well many of the
researchers actually like me they like
to write code and and we actually have
now an environment that might be better
suited to those but other than that it's
roughly the same yeah you must be hungry
how did one day Thank it well I don't
know is to a specific that it's about
the application the researcher at the
end on sentiment analysis I'm one of the
issues in sentiment analysis that most
of the methods are based on dictionaries
that you take one language lease a
Brazilian you know that certain wars are
same thing polarity they are more
positive or negative and and then you
used as a base length to start like
classifying the reviews or any other
content so in are you doing something in
in in that researcher in any other in
order to build this sentiment analysis
but not based on dictionaries maybe
model-based I don't know in order to
deal with that problem that's a very
good question because you could say that
the dictionaries that we usually refer
to when analyzing language when we're
looking at tweets or facebook comments
and things like that things don't apply
that directly so we can't rely too much
on dictionary so because of that you're
totally right and we do two things one
is adapt to learn new dictionaries for
example in Brazil we have to learn
kakakakaka which is a word with an
arbitrary number of case right in the
Arab languages it's even more
complicated and then that they have
there a few different kinds of dialects
that God created within the social
networks and you need to adjust to that
and the second one you use more machine
learning tools so you actually try to
get as many signals as you can for when
something is positive or negative and
rely a little less than the dictionaries
and rely more on the data correlations
you can get from the machine learning
tools so in fact that's one of the
reasons why the Cairo lab is a great
place to do that because the effect of
this language modification within the
internet and within those tools is
really strong in the Arab region so
we're learning a bunch of things that
maybe we can apply to other regions as
well alright thanks great well I think
we'll stop there and thank Rico once
again for you thank you folks
and so now we're going to hand over to
our chairs you're going to give us their
closing remarks thank you Judy thank you
Oh Rico again Thank You Rico we're going
to keep it short we do know that lunch
is coming and people have to take some
flights I just wanted to start by saying
that has been a great horner to be an
integral part of this ninth Latin
American faculty summit in this
beautiful country Chile and we just
spent three days all together thinking
about how to advance science and
technology through computing research
and now I would like to thank as the
program chair for this event I would
like to start thinking our all our
keynotes and session speakers as well as
our demo errs who've been doing a
fantastic job and of course you do dians
like all of your right without whom we
wouldn't have this event and I would
also like to thank personally our demo
chair mycoskie who's been doing a
fantastic job with the d'amours and also
in trying to align the demos with the
rest of the program and last but not
least I really really enjoyed the first
time I work on the Latin American
sammich I really want to thank Jaime my
partner during this event thank you
thank you
and that's very much reciprocal being
such a fantastic experience who were
with with Evelyn here in Latin America
thank you really now I would also like
to think that the event doesn't conclude
today I know every one of us has to
return home but what I mean is that I
would like to the event to continue
through several meetings projects
collaborations that potentially will
generate through all of the networking
that you have done here and also based
on all of the great presentations very
inspiring presentations that you have
attended a disability all of which can
make us really very proud to all of us
to say what are successful and rewarding
event so please continue it event
through all of these meetings that you
collaborations that you will be having
and hopefully we also would like to have
collaborations with you as well
something very important is that you
will be receiving a survey first an
email will contain a URL for the survey
that really would be very much
appreciated if you can just fill it out
very simple it will not take you more
than a few minutes to to do it but
that's very very important now I think
everything and I also would like to
thank very very much to Tony hey really
sore main sponsor because without able
to to a whole this event here so i would
like pleased to join me with a round of
applause for Tony
and electronic basically join us here as
well thanks very much Jaime and Evelyn
so I do want to say just a few words of
thanks to a number of people who made
this event possible first of all to the
minister and the ministry in misterio de
economia who came and sponsored the
event and that was really made this
event possible the other key partner was
Microsoft chili and I would like to just
mention the GM are Oliver flow go the
innovation director Wilson Pais and
Sergio Lorraine who is marketing and
operations director and I'll also like
to thank very much the marketing and
operations team macarena and josefina
and to Mac Elena for helping me start
the dancing last night so can we give
them all a round of applause as a few
other thanks i would like to do one is
the the event and the local agency at
Miguel Maori and the team so give them a
round of applause they've done a great
job my team has been really working very
hard as you have seen Mike and the demo
fest did a great job as he got up yet as
you've got a hangover very he he was
seen coming in about three o'clock this
morning I'm not sure how he's doing the
MSR events support team you have Melissa
and Sarah outside and lots of other
people in the IT team and the
audiovisual team they really worked hard
to make this event possible so can we
give them a round of applause to
and I'm almost done I'd like to thank
all the speakers and especially the
keynote speakers I thought they all gave
a great job instead of being able to
wander around the town I unfortunately
found it interesting to attend all the
lectures so I didn't get any time to see
Vinny Del Mar because it was too
interesting but they did a great job I
thought the audience you were really
make this possible and it really i
thought the attendance the punctuality
was a little lack some occasion but i
guess thats maniana right but it but it
was it was that you were a great
audience and I'm very grateful but but
my last thanks really must go to Evelyn
and to Jaime they really did a great job
in putting together a great program
coordinating all the events making lots
of visits making sure everything worked
well so as a final round of applause can
I ask you to to thank yourselves and
Jaime and evil in so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
