hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
we would move on to talking about the
lab of things which we believe is a
platform we have been working on it for
a few years now we started off with a
smaller component which was home OS and
now it has become bigger than that this
is the lab of things and we will be the
lab of things team here presenting so
it's just not me it would be AJ who's on
the on the top row right on the left and
it would be rather than myself he'll be
talking about it so AJ does HCI research
she deploys home studies goes out there
does these field studies if people tries
to understand how people live jae-young
does privacy and she is interested in
how people deploy technology in homes
and what are the privacy concerns rattle
of course is our systems researcher the
architecture of home OS as well as the
lab of things is his brainchild a Frank
does UI design and a lot of UI design
that you will see and will actually show
you the lab of things shortly is
something at that means land armor is a
distributed system researcher who's been
looking at the issues of storage in the
cloud and how distributed storage can
work in this system and then it's me I
am a research program manager with the
working with this project and my primary
task is to create a bridge between our
academic friends and the max of research
so if you are interested in any of these
topics and the lab of things you can
talk to any of us as well as as then
James says is our researcher who works
in custom devices the.net microsoft.net
gadget here is one of his projects so he
works in that space then we have an
engineering team Danny who she F Kelly
and Dre they have they are the people
who who have actually made this possible
we have some interns who have been here
for this last few months
came in summer Erin she works on
occupancy sensors we come in Sarah is
creating some smart furniture and talk
to her and she's here right now chenab
is the storage person he's been working
on the storage system and Cheng is
working on the programmability of such
systems how can they be programmed in a
more easier fashion so this is the team
and it was important to talk about some
of the different research angles that
each person within this team brings to
the table how we will do it do the hull
introduce the lab of things is I'll talk
about what it is the lab of things right
at a very high level we'll have a quick
demo AJ would come up here and she
quickly go through set up and how the
thing looks how to add a device take out
a device she'll do that rattle would
give a quick overview of design and then
I'll wrap up and we'll take a few
questions before we move on to something
very short and special which will keep
to the towards the end so here it is now
each one of us who work in different
domains and want to do field studies run
into the problems that can mean just
mention right problems of scale the
problems of deploying these field
studies and these field studies are not
just any one discipline they go across
disciplines they grow from healthcare to
energy management to connected homes
automated homes all of these different
domains require field studies to
validate research questions and when you
start looking at some of the devices yes
they are quite a few devices out there
but then these devices come with all
kinds of different nuances and putting
them all together is a challenge so I
will actually be looking at and talking
about these three challenges which we
believe are the key challenges in
addition to other challenges the key
challenge is that the lab of things
would be addressing so interconnection
of devices would be one how do you put
devices together the scale and diversity
we've been talking to a lot of academic
friends and we realized that unless we
can scale
field studies beyond two homes these
field studies do not really make sense
so so that's something I will talk about
the challenges and talk about how lab of
thing things addresses it and then the
engineering effort you did here Camille
talk about the engineering part of
things you know putting it all together
both in terms of hardware but also in
terms of software so let's look at the
first challenge which is how do you
interconnect devices in homes so over
here this is a these are a few sensors
we have been working with on the left
are off the shelf sensors you can
actually buy in a hardware store or
Amazon pretty easy to use pretty easy to
start deploying but also they come in
all kinds of different protocols
standards you really have to make them
work together it's not as trivial to
just bring them in and connect them and
then we also have custom devices this
one here is a moisture detector built
using dotnet gadget here and you could
conceivably build a number of different
kinds of sensors here and these again
have their own protocols and have their
own standards and once you start looking
at these sensors and once you want to
string them up so that they work in a
cohesive whole that is where complexity
comes in that is where things become
much more complex so that is one
challenge again we will talk about how
we address that in a lab of things
introduction but that's a challenge we
are going to address then is the scale
many a times and i'm sure those of you
who run field studies would vouch for
that you would want to do a field study
let's say of 10 15 20 homes but then
because of the challenge of maintenance
monitoring collection of data you would
bring it down to 235 max 10 homes and
that is a manageable number many of us
have faced that and and let me just go
into a little bit more details about
what does maintenance means so you
deploy software in the home and this
software could be you know the core
infrastructure meaning the place where
all the data is coming in or it could be
drivers it could be your experiment and
then you discover a bug and now you
have to go to those 25 homes to just
update that one driver so that's a
maintenance issue which all of us would
do software realize would happen one day
monitoring you want to know what is
happening in each home in terms of how
the sensor is working is it even alive
is it emitting data that it should be
emitting is that infrastructure of
network that you're set in place is it
working or not working and monitoring is
we believe an important part if you
really want to scale up beyond just
three homes of course data collection
you want it to be collected in as simple
a way as possible you do not want to
have a graduate student run down to each
home and put in a USB stick and bring
data to every day so that's not a model
yeah and that's a challenge that we have
addressed in this system and then of
course as you would all realize those of
us who who do software and who have been
doing these field studies there is a
major engineering effort required to put
this all together typically you would
get a few graduate students or undergrad
students who would come together who
would say okay we need to build some
infrastructure they would build that
infrastructure they would put in some
drivers write those custom drivers for
your devices would go out and deploy
them and now after six months these
graduate students have moved on you have
lost most of the engineering best
practices the engineering mindshare the
expertise that you had developed and now
you have to build that up again so
essentially you would be reinventing the
wheel all the time so that's one
challenge software most of the drivers
for most of the devices out there you
could actually have somebody else
develop it share it somehow and then you
could use it there is a way to share
this software share some of the apps
share some of the code that could be
used then of course finally as can be in
pointed out there is this advantage of
knowing who is deploying similar studies
across the globe if I could somehow work
with that person not just in terms of
sharing of expertise in software but
also in terms of sharing of participants
sharing of deployments that helps a lot
when you want to scale up so this is
this is a challenge again that the lab
of thing addresses so finally the
question is what is the lab of things
well in the very high level at a very
high level here is what it does it
allows you to deploy field studies in an
easy way by interconnecting devices and
implementing applications in in homes
using the core home Wes software it
allows you to scale up by giving you
automated monitoring data collection and
updates you do not have to visit those
homes you sit on a portal and you can
push out updates to selected homes or
all homes at you on it allows you to
share code data maybe even participants
if things you know if you find a
collaborator who wants to do that so it
essentially lowers the barrier for you
to deploy field studies using connected
devices in the homes so that's a lab of
things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
