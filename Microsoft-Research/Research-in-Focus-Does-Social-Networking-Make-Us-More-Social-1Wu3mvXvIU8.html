has been studying the impact of
technology and particularly that of
social networking and he's arrived to
some very different conclusions pleased
to be joined in the hood right here by
professor of communications Keith
Hampton of Rutgers University thanks for
being here appreciate this this will be
fun all right so you're going to be
giving a keynote address tomorrow but
we're delighted to get a chance to talk
with you right now help put research in
focus don't forget by the way to our
online audience you can join this
conversation if you're inspired
something you've been wondering about in
this realm you can send your questions
into me to Keith I'll relay them here
just use that tool right there in the
viewer there okay so Keith unlike most
speakers and attendees here at the
microsoft faculty summit you're a
sociologist not a computer scientist but
that's not as anomalous as it might
first seem since first everyone on
Facebook knows computer technologies an
enormous impact on our social behaviors
that everywhere we look around
somebody's on their phone they're doing
it right so you're looking into just how
social media affects us both as
individuals as a society and before we
even get into your current research
about that I think our viewers would
probably like to know a bit more about
your background exactly how you got
interested in this line of research sure
I mean I got into this in the late 1990s
with a study of Wired suburbs actually
built north of Toronto and it was a
similar kind of moral panic of the day
about how broadband technology would
affect relationships there was a lot of
concern that if you provide people with
a computer in their house and everybody
had one and he gave them always-on
internet access that they would choose
to abandon their neighbors and other
close relationships so I spent two years
moving into one such community living in
the neighborhood and studying how those
technologies were affecting local
relationships in those settings Wow okay
so it perhaps is just viewing the past
the rose-colored glasses but I think
most people believe that social media
has sort of been detrimental since it
replaced you know what a lot of people
think is so nobody talks anymore nobody
does face-to-face person-to-person
interactions it's all kind of
self-absorbed and tweets look what I'm
eating look what I'm doing look where
I'm vacationing
but that's of course just opinion how do
you actually study how technology in
particular social media has impacted our
social behaviors right so I mean I think
rose-colored glasses exactly the way to
frame it my talk tomorrow is about
whether the grass is in fact any greener
than it was in the past and I think that
every technological change is
accompanied by a concern about whether
those technologies are going to destroy
society destroy relationships make us
more alienated and this is really just
the latest one you know the ideal way to
study these is to be able to study them
over time in terms of some sort of
historical comparative way of measuring
change and lately we had one opportunity
to do that in studying how new mobile
phones technologies might be affecting
people in public spaces for example so
we got our hands on a series of super 8
films a really big archive people just
walking around in public spaces that was
taken about 30 years ago and those were
films that were taken to New York City
and Philadelphia and in Boston and we
were able to go back to the exact same
settings that those films were taken 30
years ago and take pictures today video
yeah and then we were able to compare
the content to the film 30 years ago to
the content of the film today see people
were more likely to be walking alone to
see if there was a role for mobile
phones in these spaces to see if there
was any kind of change in the
composition of people's interactions in
those spaces and we observed about
150,000 people and our coding we did by
hand I'm not a computer scientist and
what we found was that over 30 years
people are in fact less likely to be
walking alone in public spaces man on
people more likely spent time in groups
those groups tend to be more diverse
people for the most part weren't using
their mobile phones of public spaces may
belong two to ten percent in our most
extreme cases and in places where there
were more groups that's where people
were less likely to be using their
mobile phones it was really an activity
that people were doing when they would
otherwise be isolated in a public space
okay so let's talk about what about
private as opposed to the public spaces
you know has social media usage had a
negative impact on our closest
relationship with friends family at home
right well again we had an opportunity
to do a bit of a historical comparative
study in this
ants in the 1980s and again in 2004 the
United States general social survey did
a series of questions to focus on
people's closest relationships and they
were able to model whether or not people
had fewer close ties today than they did
say 20 years ago the big and kind of
surprising finding of that was they
found that the number of close ties that
people have had declined over time and
the diversity of those relationships had
declined as well the time period again
kind of matched to the rise of the
Internet the rise of home computing but
they didn't really have very good data
on whether or not individual uses of
those technology and how people were
using the technology we're responsible
for any of that increase in our sort
decrease in the size of people's close
ties so I partnered with the pew
research center's internet and american
life project in 2009 and 2011 we did two
really big large national random surveys
of americans right our we asked them
that same question that they asked in
the general social survey and what we
found was that in fact the number of
close ties people have doesn't seem to
be negatively affected by the use of
technologies in fact we've got no
negative relationships between people's
use of mobile phones social networking
sites internet use at all and having a
smaller core network on average Wow well
we did find is that people who use
social media in particular but also just
the internet overall tenth have more
close relationships and those
relationships tend to be more diverse
they have more friends aren't just
family mm-hmm absolutely yeah I mean
these networks we've all created yes
some people see it as an obligation some
people as you say kind of create these
networks of people that they maybe don't
see face-to-face but that's not
necessarily a bad thing right well
that's true although we do find amongst
our closest ties that new technologies
such as Facebook and other kind of
social networking turn technologies
aren't really substituting for
face-to-face interaction if anything
they're adding on to it and we're
finding that the more people interact
with different types of digital
technologies the more they tend to see
each other in person as well and that's
especially true of our closest
relationships okay so what if we turn
our attention away from from just
individuals and now talk about society
more broadly let's talk about the impact
of social media on us as citizens voters
for instance out of social media
our awareness of different points of
views obviously anyone who uses Twitter
he knows that it's kind of becoming
information in a new source in addition
to just a way to have some fun and share
fun stuff yeah well again through
studies with Pew Internet in area life
we were able to find that the average
person who uses these new technologies
just internet use in general and then
the more they use social media the more
diverse their networks tend to be so
they do tend to know people have a
greater number of different perspectives
the people of different social classes
and kind of span the whole social
hierarchy yeah yeah well I think that's
what at least I would assume that that a
lot of folks are going to go kind of
hide in their their pockets of social
media in the internet that they feel
comfortable in does this make us more
aware of outside perspectives does it
silo us in those little chat rooms where
we converse with only the people that
are like-minded well you know that's a
more complicated picture so we know from
you know other studies before the
internet came along that there's
something called the spiral of silence
and that the more aware you are of
different points of view it actually
tends to reduce your ability to have a
democratic deliberation to some sense so
if you're aware that there's a lot of
disagreement in a social setting that
you're in I just because of that
heightened awareness you may actually
feel less willing to speak out about
some probably yeah less likely to voice
opinions on political issues for example
right so I mean it's actually an odd
little bit of a paradox you know we are
much more aware of that diversity around
us but that whereas the diversity may
also have this kind of negative effect
on us and that it makes us slightly less
willing to speak out when there's that
kind of uncertainty Wow okay well then
let's talk about the trickle down there
at the effect of social media on our
democracy is affecting things like voter
participation involvement and
campaigning and so on i mean does it get
that far it's a great question you know
and there's a lot of difference between
you know democratic deliberation which
is what we're talking about in terms of
people's willingness to speak out and
democratic participation and in fact
they may be very different things in it
there's some evidence to suggest that
you can't necessarily have a lot of both
that places where there's a lot of
deliberation you start to appreciate the
other side more it actually may reduce
participation the Sun level but what
we're finding is again Internet users in
general and particularly you
social media from another study we did
with the Pew Research Center we found
that they are in fact more likely to
attend political meetings they're more
likely to try and persuade other people
to vote and they're more likely to say
that they're going to vote themselves
right okay well so let's take it down
now to the local level I understand
you've also investigated the impact of
social networks on neighborhoods what
have you learned about its effect on
community involvement in the
neighborhoods in specific right so after
the net bill study which as this project
where I spent two years doing this
ethnography I've done a series of other
studies where we observed how
neighborhoods change over time as a
result of digital technologies and one
of the things we found is that you know
the simple introduction of something
like a neighborhood discussion forum at
the local level has a lot of impact on
local relationships in fact we found
that the average person who uses such a
neighborhood discussion forum makes
about three new neighborhood social ties
in a year as a result which is fairly
significant over time that adds up to a
lot of relationships and of course you
know you don't have to be best friends
with your neighbors by any means it's
just really about awareness and that
awareness of people who are living in
your local community turns out to be the
most important thing when it comes to
things like organizing for collective
action dealing with local problems
whether it's crime or problems with a
meal carry or something small and even
being able to help a neighbor who say
having some sort of local kind of
problem with health or something that
you can intervene with sure I can see
that okay well let's talk about your
your work more specifically your work is
actually indicating that social media
usages increases stress levels which I
guess isn't that surprising but but I
guess the question as to why is that
people are so aggravated trying to keep
up with the technology the obligation to
tweet right so this will be one of the
things I'm talking about tomorrow though
I'm making forward to and its really
interesting it's really not the
technology that's raising people's
stress so what we found was that the
technology used itself how frequently
people are using something like social
media or their mobile phone or email
doesn't in itself tend to predict higher
stress in fact amongst women in
particular we found that the use of many
of these technologies was slower stated
with a slightly lower level of
psychological stress but what we did
find is that when we measure social
stress which is the stress that you get
from being aware of kind of the problems
tribulations and other people in your
lives so when someone close to you if
they know someone who dies or they know
someone who's experiencing bad health or
is lost their job awareness of those
kinds of problems creates a social
stress that seems to be related social
media use so those little bits of
information that we kind of wonder how
valuable they are as they come through
those different feeds they really do add
up to this kind of big golf right and
yeah you know just one little bit of
information tries I'd be really
significant if it's about a negative
thing that's happening in other peoples
live so it turns out that women in
particular but it's also true for men
but especially for women they are much
more aware of these kind of negative
life events that are happening around
them as a result of the exposure to
these little bits of information through
social media wow that's fascinating
alright you've inspired some of our
online audience as well right questions
coming in this one for you for Keith
please impart me and I can relate to
this one right out of the gates please
in part one or two pearls of wisdom for
a parent with kids active on social
media especially with regards to safety
being able to know what might
potentially hurt others or even
themselves we all worry about you know
kids when concise should I let them on
the computer when should I give them a
phone that has access to internet social
media has created a whole other world I
have a seven year old and a four year
old girl at home who knows what things
will be like by the time they're on the
phone on the internet on social media
what do you say because i'm sure people
find out what you do they go oh so chip
should i let my kid on facebook should I
Adam on Twitter and again we all know
someone who is either lost a job or not
gotten a job because maybe something
silly they posted on social media you
know it's an incredibly difficult
question to answer I mean there are no
really perfect answers for this you know
it's not really a prescriptive thing I
mean the best thing that you can do I I
have a seven-year-old I ten-year-old
myself they're certainly not on most
social media but they're starting to
text their friends and things like that
now and I think that you know just
having that sense of trust with your
kids early on is really the most
important thing when it comes to using
social media later surveillance doesn't
seem to work cutting them off I don't
think it's necessarily good idea because
these technologies are really an
important part of use culture today and
they provide you know these kids with
new ways of interacting with very
diverse peers and gain the social
support of their peers
that may not have been available to us
say in the past so I don't think that
you know full-on surveillance is the
answer I don't think that cutting them
off is the answer but I do think you
know monitoring their use measuring
their use is important and assuring that
you know it doesn't you know crop up at
inappropriate times and helping them
learn the norms of acceptable use you
know so my house or no devices allowed
to the kitchen table when we're had to
dinner and things along those lines and
we know we measure how much screens they
have in general and I think that that's
an appropriate thing that we would do
when we're not just talking about social
media but about all media's it's
fascinating stuff we could talk all
evening I guess we'll just have to take
it to Twitter I think that I can fourth
question well thank you so much for your
time really my pleasure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
