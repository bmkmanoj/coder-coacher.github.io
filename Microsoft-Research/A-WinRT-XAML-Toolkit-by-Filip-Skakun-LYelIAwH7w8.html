you
thanks everybody for joining us and I
want to go ahead and formally introduced
Phillip scuk une wright-phillips crackle
yeah Scott Kuhn Phillips cocoon and he's
gonna go ahead and give kind of the
details on and where he works kind of
already has for those of you that got
here on time and and he's going to be
talking about a toolkit that he made
using zamel I think that you'll learn if
you're a saml person I think you'll
learn a lot through his implementation
of zamel in order to make this toolkit
instead of just writing a plevin code
app level logic you take a step back at
one abstraction away and you write
yourself control tool kits and control
packs and stuff like that then you're
actually going a long ways toward being
able to reuse that elsewhere so it's
always a good idea so anyway I'm excited
to hear from Philip so hi my name is
Phillips cocoon and I'm a developer on
the fresh paint team and Microsoft it's
part of Microsoft startup business group
which is part of microsoft research I've
been the freshman team for the three
months now previously I worked for
another company called vector form and I
work back and forth at Microsoft and
vector form a couple times already so i
started at microsoft seven years ago on
the sequel server team then going back
and forth i worked on windows sdk xbox
live and microsoft retail microsoft
surface the original one actually my
adventure with zamel started building
applications with WPF and for Microsoft
Surface the original big a stable and
then I also worked at Microsoft CRM
building Windows Phone application and
then I've done some more contracting
building applications for companies like
CNN ESPN nokia Microsoft Disney Sesame
Street accuweather a couple others
probably and now i'm at the the fresh
paint team and i still use zamel and
usually do that together with directx to
some degrees so that's what I do at work
but in my free time since I've been
developing on Windows 8 for like two
years now about a year and a half ago I
decided that a lot of the things that
that you want to do on windows 8
requires controls and behaviors that are
not available out of the box and in the
windows 8 ap is so since I started
building my own tool kit I at some point
I decided to start sharing it on
codeplex so I've been building controls
and extensions and tools in the WinRT I
will talk it for one year and a half now
and they're there on codeplex where you
can download them a source code and also
available and nougat so if you need some
some of these tools that i will show
today you can just go to your package
manager in visual studio and in a few
seconds you can you can have my library
as part of your solution so when
artisanal toolkit is the name of the
library so it's a library over using
reusable solutions to recurring problems
and and that's actually proven to be
really read true because most of these
things that are in that library I've
used and like these two or three
different projects that I worked on and
the library has controls so there are
there's a list of controls that I custom
implemented just out of some quirky
ideas or just to test some test some
theories some of them are
implementations of controls that are not
available in Windows 8 but we're
available in either WPF or solar light
some of them are actually ported
controls from the civilized toolkit that
you have done and Silverlight three or
four or five that are not windows 8 and
I decided to put some of them and then
there are some additional helper classes
that help with building windows 8
applications and there are some zamel
debugging tools so so since we have two
versions of Windows 8 now windows 8 and
windows 8.1 I actually have two versions
of that toolkit that share almost all of
the code but have some slight
differences and i'll probably be adding
some more features to the windows 8.1
version since there are some some nice
new features in Windows 8.1 including I
think my favorite control well favorite
class being at a render target bitmap
which is an image source or a bitmap
that you can you can use to render your
visual tree to a bitmap that you can
then duplicate on the screen and get
some really nice effect so this is the
windows windows 8 version of the
application that the application is
actually a list of samples or tests that
that show how you can use the controls
and the helpers from the toolkit so I
won't go and show all of them but I
would like to show some of them and talk
about them a little bit so maybe I'll go
alphabetically and the first one is
alternative frame so there's a frame
frame class in Windows 8 that that you
can use to navigate back and forth
between pages in your UI and at some
point I decided that I want to do
control the dust transitions between
pages that aren't just you know fade out
fade in but allow you to see both pages
or
crossfade between pages and this control
actually allows you to do that so it's
it has almost the same API surface as
the frame but it has all these nice or
random transitions that you can do
slides and wipes and flips of of pages
you navigate from one to another another
feature that it has is actually you can
preload the next page that will that you
want to open so for example if you have
a page that you're planning to open next
or the user will probably open next
because right now you're in a hub page
and next the user will most likely go to
the you know page that has lots of
images and you roughly expect that this
is going to be the page so it actually
preloads the page that you you say is
likely to be loaded next so when I click
here it has the page with lots of images
that have been loaded when we were when
i was talking to you so that's that's
alternative frame you can you can grab
the up control from the toolkit and you
can use alternative frame and define
your own transitions and if you need any
help you can always talk to me another
one as a sample is a calendar control
this is direct port from some light tool
kit so there's no calendar control in
Windows 8 and I think windows 8.1 also
doesn't have it out of the box there's
also only like a date date picker and
time picker control so if you need to
display a counter you have this control
here I modify the template a little bit
to be more touch friendly so you can use
it in an application another one is a
camera capture control so in Windows 8
you have this nice launcher called
camera capture you I and you can use
that to well yeah to show a preview of
from the camera and start recording or
taking pictures and record videos or
pictures but the problem is that it's
full screen and this is
this goes nicely with the Microsoft
design language where you want to have
no focus on the tasks that you're doing
so if you're recording a video you want
to do it on full screen but there are
some scenarios where you actually want
to do that inside of your application so
the camera capture control is actually a
control that helps you with that so I
can hide and show the preview inside of
the application I could take a picture
there's actually a countdown control
that that was used here to take a
picture so you can see it counting down
here to from three to zero and then
taking a picture you can record and then
it plays back that's recording so i can
do something here and it shows that
recording that it did so that helps you
if you want to work with video or
pictures the next one is a kind of
example of what you can do with with
zamel so it's a cascading image control
which just has this interesting
transition when it shows up it's one of
the eye i call them quirky controls that
don't serve a big purpose but they're
kind of flashy a similar one is let me
find that cascading textbook so next one
so this one actually has this text that
shows up and rotates while it's falling
I can change some properties here so it
rotates more so it falls in rotates and
you can type in any text here so I can
say hello applix fast and the next time
it loads will actually be hello epics
fast
so another one that's probably the most
popular control from the toolkit is the
port of the chart control from
silverlight toolkit and it has various
ways of presenting your data and it's
one of the very few charting controls
for for windows 8 right now and there
are lots of samples here for put types
of charts you can implement with it
they're all slightly modifying to look
better on Windows 8 there's a this
entire toolkit is my open source project
that I do work on my free time and I
don't always have the time to finish
everything but one of the things I
started working on was a color picker so
there's actually this page here that's
called color picker primitives in it
it's not showing up so nicely because I
haven't finished working in it but it
has it shows a lot of the code that
isn't a toolkit for working with with
colors so there are helpers that help
you convert colors between RGB hsl and
HSV color spaces and these tools are
actually used to render these this
coloring and color triangle and these
bars so all of these use some help /
libraries that help you help our API
submit make it really easy to render
these color picker selector so depending
on your requirements if you if you if
you're building the next paint
application that's maybe a competitor to
fresh paint you could use these
components to to select colors one of
the controls that I really like is the
custom grid splitter which there's a
great splitter control in WPF that's not
there in Windows 8 because well grid
splitters don't go so well
with Windows design language or
Microsoft design language but there are
many cases when they're actually pretty
useful especially when you're building
tools on or do you want to have a DUI
that's slightly more flexible so that
grid splitter is roughly the same as the
one in WPF in terms of API is it's just
a default template is more geared
towards dash so i can actually easily
find that control with touch and move it
with touch one control that someone
actually contributed to the toolkit
recently is called a gauge control it
allows you to show values like a gauge
on hydraulics or inside of a car which
is my way nice way to represent some
sort sometimes of data it was actually
designed by Arturo Toledo which was one
of who was one of the designers at
Microsoft I think he worked on the
Windows Phone team there's an image
button control which which is something
that you should probably take a look at
if you're building an application that's
rich in pictures and you want to have
highly customized buttons that that have
different states represented by images
sew a button typically typically has
like three or four states which is like
normal pressed and hover states so that
control allows you to easily specify
multiple pictures that are going to be
used to represent that image without
reedom planting it and also if you don't
have all of these images it will
actually give you options to
automatically generate some of the
images so I think one of these images so
this control actually has just one image
specified for the
neutral state but if you hover it
actually generates another picture
that's kind of semi-transparent it's
more white whitish and then when it's in
press state it's even more white at none
other one is a actually it generates
disabled State there are some image
processing algorithms in in the toolkit
that automatically make the picture
grayscale so it automatically generates
a disabled State button for you there's
also a toggle button version of that so
it has it has all these states and you
can define them either with images or
some parameters that make these images
you know grayscale or some sort of
lighter shade another one that's
supported from school I took it is
layout transform control so if you use
WPF before there's a render transform
and layout transform property on a sam'l
element and you can use render transform
to kind of ended independently rotate or
scale or transform otherwise I control
but there's also a layout transform
property that automatically makes space
for the resized control that you have so
that layout transform wasn't implemented
in solar light or in Windows 8 but some
light took it had this implementation of
a layout transform control which in
which you can specify a transformation
and it will automatically scale that
control and resize it so it actually
fits so Hugh for example have a text
block that you want to show rotated 90
degrees it makes it really easily doable
for you you just put that button inside
of this control specify the transform
and that that text block will shouldn't
get clipped in any way and a space will
be available made available to it using
the layouts and algorithms of the
platform
there's a ring slice and pie slice
control which you can use to show data
or maybe use implement a slider control
that looks like a ring or pie slice a
numeric F down control which is slightly
different from numeric I've done
controls of windows forms or WPF end up
it actually is geared not towards
decimal values and the currency but more
towards floating point value entering
and and it works in a similar way to the
sliders and blend in that you can well
you can do plasma and minus two to
decrease and increase values but you can
also start dragging on top of it and and
just by dragging in any direction you
can reduce and increase the value that's
centered and you can also click and
enter the pub you manually with keyboard
I'll get it up again later there's a
treeview control which is so supported
from from the supply toolkit and it has
a touch template and the mouse template
depending on what you want to use it for
so that's another one uniform grid is
actually a contribution and I've been
playing with it a little bit here
there's some sort of an animation that
transforms all of these elements and
puts them in a circle and you rotate and
they're sorted this is based on the hsl
color values so it shows quite a few
features of the framework if you look at
the source code which is available on
codeplex there is a watermark password
box and watermark text box and Windows
8.1 actually adds these new properties
that allow you to specify a placeholder
text on a text control and in windows
8.0 there wasn't that feature so I
implemented this control which which
works like a password box but you can
define a watermark text and also what
you can't do in Windows 8.1 is you
actually define any any any content as a
watermark so we can put an image or
shape and this is one sample that shows
it that you can you can put this arrow
shape here inside of it as a placeholder
text so if you want to prompt the user
to do something and specify that someone
might enter something there watermark
text box work similar way a web browser
is something that you can do if you if
you really want to have a web browser
inside of your application so there are
ways to actually launch internet
explorer or default browser outside of
the application but there are mighty
might be cases where you might actually
host it inside of the application so
it's it's not a very super robust
because I've never actually used it in a
shipping application but you can type
stuff n stuff in and actually by default
navigates to the WinRT saml toolkit
patient codeplex I can navigate to bring
up scholars our colors are not set
correctly but it shows the web browser
and it has the all the UI that you need
to enter the address there might be
cases where where you want one too you'd
want to use that for example if you want
to use some custom bookmarking of your
pages so for example if you want to do
some integration with Instapaper or save
your bookmarks somewhere and to SkyDrive
and use some custom logic then you can
host the web browser control in your
application so these are the controls
but controls aren't the only thing of in
the toolkit there's also lots of
extensions there's a implementation of
the behaviors API which which the blend
team I think shipped before for WPF and
Silverlight I won't go through all of
these right now but for example
highlight behavior is something that
might be pretty useful if you do search
over text in your application you can
type in some text and you there's a
simple property applies to to that text
block below that actually highlights the
text so I can type in an egg text here
and at highline stop text inside of the
text block what else there's a text book
a text box validation so if you need to
enter some values there are some simple
API is that allow you to validate the
values that need to be entered for
example this field is set to be
non-empty and if if it's empty it shows
in a different color this one needs to
be non-empty and numeric so you can
specify different error messages that
show up when these when these parameters
are not met there's another one for
strong password which is kind of
arbitrary but it requires these eight
characters and lowercase and uppercase
and the number and the special character
to be entered so lots of interesting
features that you can use a few if you
have an application work and you have to
enter data and it's sort of i think
enterprise application might make use of
these there are some simple api is that
that you can use to fade in or fade out
controls with a simple single single
method image extensions allowed you
allow you to specify that an image
control should fade in or somehow other
transition once the image loads so if
you have images that go from from the
web you specify that single property on
your image and that image fades in or
slides in or does something interesting
when when it shows so you can have some
placeholder image showing up before your
actual images loaded a lot of these
extensions are actually a little bit
difficult to to demo without looking at
the code which I want
show also in a moment but so I will
quickly jump through them but animated
scroll is another feature that is not
available in a scrollviewer and Windows
8.1 windows 8.1 actually adds that
feature so it almost makes my toolkit
unuseful for Windows 8.1 with a small
caveat that you can actually you can
actually awake that scrolling to
complete so you basically call a weight
scroll to certain position and that
await method returns when that scrolling
is complete and there are lots of
scenarios where you might want to do
that for example if you have lots of
text entered in a text text box and at
some point you want to animate to the
end of that text and only after you
animated at the end of that text you
want something some other animation to
play then you can use that extension
there are lots of helpers that help with
images here there's actually an image
imaging helpers section which which
shows another part of the toolkit which
allows you to render your UI to a bitmap
and windows 8.0 it uses a sharp DX and
direct x2 and direct direct2d to render
your UI to a control it actually
imitates what windows does when when
rendering stuff on screen it just does
it into a texture and save save seeds
into a writable bitmap it's not perfect
there are some not lots of things are
not implemented so it's good for a very
basic stuff but you can use that right
now for your windows 8.1 for example if
you want to want to render a custom tile
with some text on top of it and with
seven shapes you can use it to render
that tile right now it's kind of hard
because you you have the option to
either either use writable bitmap where
you control each pixel
pratley or you have to use sharp sharp
DX or direct tax yourself and use the
you know learndirect x if you don't know
it with this control you can just create
that DUI and using zamel and render the
UI to to a writable bitmap and there's
another helper that that makes it really
easy to write that writable bitmap to an
image and then you can you know render a
lifestyle that it has text and rich
content so I I believe the most useful
feature of this entire toolkit and
something that I'm focusing on right now
is the visual tree debugger which I
might have shown you before but there's
this concept of a visual three debugger
that I think first showed up with WPF
and there's still a very popular tool
for that called snoop which you can use
to debug any WPF application and see
what what UI elements are were and
navigate the entire visual tree search
for things filter what things are shown
and use PowerShell to to run some
scripts over a UI of an application even
if it's not your application actually
there's another tool that was created
that's a commercial tool for silverlight
and what's called civilized so light spy
which does a similar thing and there's a
new version called zamel spy right now
which works with WPF and Silverlight and
Windows Phone and Windows 8 but that's
the commercial product in it costs I
think at least a hundred dollars to use
it so this is an open-source version
that you can use for free and there's a
limitation that you might call a
limitation but it also might be a
feature that it's actually in
to show and render as part of your own
UI so there's a pop up here that shows
up inside of the application and you can
use these grid splitters that I used
elsewhere and the tree view control that
I specifically ported from a civil like
two keys to actually implement that
control here and I basically hover with
my mouse on top of some UI element like
this button here press ctrl shift and
that control gets selected in that tree
and I can see where it is actually
defined in the application so it
actually lists all the properties
categorized and grouped in different
categories there are filters here so by
default it doesn't show properties for a
control that that weren't specified
manually so if something is unchanged it
doesn't show it so I can see that the
foreground is specified for that button
and I can actually go and make that
button red actually good that's the not
the right one but I can say that this
one should be read not the 10 yep so
that right now the the control got
yellow because i typed in the RGB values
that define that the control should be
yellow you can also open an image and
make that background be be an image so
if I want to test some some theory for
the design it actually loads that image
as the as the foreground brush for the
button so I have various filters here 11
is I can show the properties ungrouped I
can make it show show all the properties
including the read-only property so I
can see what the actual height of open
element is so sometimes it's
it's hard to see what the actual size of
a control will be inside of the
application and it's a little bit
difficult to debug it and you can you
can use the designer view for for your
control but you you might not always see
what what the size will be inside of the
application so you can check actual
height and actual width of the control
and using that tool kit you can you can
search so you can enter margin and
margin shows up and I can I can move
that control and actually right now you
can see that if I move it further it
disappears so sometimes problems when
working with Sam OH are that some
control has a clip property specified or
something has a paucity specified 20 or
visibility set to 0 and you're not
always sure what the reason is that your
control doesn't show up so we can you
can use that visual tree to find the
control you know that it's in debug
preview test page and you know that's no
third grid in a row and it's it has a
specific name and you find that and you
wonder why it's why it's not showing up
and then you look at it then you can see
that maybe the the opacity is set to
zero so so type opacity and no it's not
zero it's one you can you can look at
the the other controls up the stack and
see that all of them actually have
opacity set to one but you select it and
you can see that that highlight
rectangle here it's kind of shifted so
we might see oh maybe it's it's miss
position so type in margin and you can
modify that margin and see that it
actually got clipped by a clip property
on some of the elements where it was
hosted in so there's also a filter
that's kind of built in right now which
if I only disable that time 10 filter
there is a filter that shows properties
that are likely to alter your layout so
it has a list of properties that most
likely cause an element not showing up
so there are bubbling render transform
maximum height and width property so I
can specify a maximum height somewhere
25 and that control will never show up
because maximum height actually
overrides and a value specified by width
height or and other layout properties I
can reset that and go back to the
original value so I can go elsewhere in
the application and press ctrl shift
elsewhere and it refreshes automatically
and you can you can see the other
parameters that I cannot control the
positioning of the control and yeah this
this list right now shows the all the
properties that might affect layout so I
can collapse it there's also another
feature in debugging here that you can
you can show a debug.trace inside of the
application which is sometimes useful
like for me when I only have one laptop
with one screen I don't have a secondary
screen to look at logging and I want to
debug some interactivity code so i move
my mouse on top of the control and i
want to see what the properties are of
the pointer events i can i can trace
them and show them inside of the
application so so i can have a quick
look at what's happening and i've
actually supports na and a text and you
can easily hook up to that and use it as
easily as you use you know debug right
line today for printf debugging you can
fade that out and you can make it
actually so that you can let's not hit
that visible so you can interact with
your UI through that through that trace
information screen so there's also a
version of that toolkit that i have for
windows
point one and to test things out a
little bit I change the default theme
there to a light theme so all the
controls are here and and they render
and light theme us as well as they do
and inducting most of them so that's a
complaint that I've seen from a lot of
people who are using the tool kit that
some controls were in support supporting
different themes and right now that's
built in miscellaneous there's a web
file helper class that allows you to
very easily with 11 line command
download the file from a URI so you
specify a URI like the current bing
image of the day and with one call it
saves it to a file on your local drive
and automatically figures out what the
name of the original file was on the
server getting it from from HTTP headers
and a lot does a lot of stuff for you so
you can use that and maybe let me show
you some demos of what you can do with
with the toolkit and how you can use
that so
I have visual studio 2012 here so i'll
do a windows 8 project i'll start with a
maybe with a great application and i'll
show you first how to do debugging
default grid application template has
some UI in it already so it should be
pretty good too to debug and modify so i
go to manage no get packages and the
project i look new get official package
source and i look for when artisanal
tool kit so there's a few packages here
I broke things down a little bit because
the toolkit started growing a little bit
large and became a little bit hard to
download and the debugging tools is
something that I use every day now it's
been almost 1,000 downloads so far and
eleven thousand downloads for the one
artisanal toolkit so people in the
community seem to be using it a little
bit let me install the debugging
components okay done so i think the
default page when the application starts
is the grouped grouped items page so the
best way to put put that hook and it's
actually wait for the low that you end
and i'll just type in DC and hit alt
enter if i use resharper if you don't
have reach our / you can do all shift of
time and it automatically adds the
reference for you so using when
artisanal to get debugging and then just
do show visual tree this and this is the
only thing sorry
debug console so there's actually a
class fully called debug console and DC
is another class that's just a proxy to
that so it's easier to type I I was
using a sam'l spy with what my toolkit a
little bit and found that it takes a
little bit much work to actually hook it
up so I wanted to make it as painful
painless as possible to use my toolkit
and debugger to to debug the application
so yeah the debugger is here I can debug
this I can debug that I can move move
things around if my designer comes up
and tells me that this is you know five
pixels too much or too little and then
we can quickly change it inside of the
application and we don't have to rely on
blend and specifying you know using mvvm
and the sample data or anything we just
run the tool kit run the debugging tools
and you can modify things at runtime
things disappear you can see how you
know how much you need to move something
so that you know you'll get two rows of
data instead of one row of data and you
can do that at the at runtime
exactly what I want how do you convert
up yes so right now you have to take
notes but yes one of the things that I'm
planning and I might do it and actually
in the next few weeks is to actually
record which controls were modified and
give you a list of things that were
modified I think more would take more
work but it certainly might be possible
to you know generate a style that
overrides your style you have currently
or I have ideas for know creating
animations automatically using that
jewelry debugger and you know dragging
things around on the screen with just
you know you're touchy press ctrl +
something and you will move something on
the screen and and say that as an
animation for example so there are lots
of interesting things that you can do
once you have an open source project and
you control the source so let me
actually do maybe windows 8.1
application and I'll show you some of
the things that I do with the toolkit
okay so I have a basic application let's
see
so one of the libraries in part inside
of my toolkit is called away WI and what
it does is there are various things in a
UI development that are not like things
that you you load something from your
hard drive or load something from the
network or from from the database but
still might take awhile to to perform so
for example you might run another nation
and you might want to run something that
that's run only after the animation is
completed so the the away table UI
library in my tool kit actually allows
you to await various events in you I so
i'll try to show you quickly how to do
that i'm going to get the official
package source when artisanal to get
okay so i installed it toolkit and so I
have an empty page and maybe i'll make
it into a canvas and actually let me
quickly switch to blend because if i'm
going to create an animation then it's
best to use blend for animations i can
type a type that in and zamel or or in
code behind but it should be a lot
easier with blend so quickly switch ok
that's my page and blend I look for an
ellipse put out the lips over here I
create a new story board storyboard one
I move the the ellipse and I want it at
1 seconds to move here and then I want
to create a new story board that moves
the the ellipse here for example and
i'll put some button here and i think
yeah let me see that animation works so
the ellipse works animates your lips
most here ok so i have two storyboards i
save that i can go back to your studio i
have the storyboards and now what I want
to do is when the applicant the page
loads I want to start something
yep I forgot I don't have resharper in
Windows 8.1 eight so i'll make it a sink
so I had that story board I thought I
have it storyboard one well maybe maybe
it just doesn't know that it's there and
usually a storyboard you run with begin
but this one you can run with begin i
think i just have to reference the
noticeable toolkit wait wi and now i can
away the storyboard and then i can await
a message dialog
and I can wait another story board and
let's see if that works
think that hello needs to go there
I think is it show a sink yep so the
standard is that anything that s
available should be called a sink so the
page loads you get that dialogue you we
are awaiting that dialogue when I press
close runs the other animation so that's
that's one thing you can do with the
message dialog but you can also do it
differently you can I wait I wait the
button click so
wait for click async that's what the
name name is so the method so now I
don't have any events that I'm actually
specifying but I can build some sort of
some sort of wizard that goes further
after I I click something and I do all
of that using you know structured Cody I
don't have to specify in the events and
if there's some sequence that fairly
rigid and there's there's not going to
be anything that breaks it I can do
things in my four lines of code that
usually would take me five event
subscriptions and handlers and stuff
right now it's just four lines of code
so let's take a look at how you can get
to that other than then you get so
there's this page on codeplex called
when artisanal toolkit code flexkom and
if if you go to source code there's the
other source code I i use get with that
so you can you can clone up with get or
you can download it you have download
you'll get the zip package with all the
source code in the current version and
that's something that you might want to
do if you want to look how to actually
use all of these controls that I showed
I have so you can save the zip file
right now I have solution open here this
is the eighth point Oh solution i have
three solutions one for 4.1 4.1 and one
for everything depending on what you
want to do I walk you through the
through the structure of the project so
there's a there are projects for various
groups of features the toolkit has most
of the code right now the composition is
how's the composition engine which is
used to render the visual 322 akin to a
bitmap which users sharp DX so it's
actually extracted separately because
rap DX is a little bit heavy to load so
if you don't want to load six various
libraries say you don't have to do you
don't have to use it the Soraa light
toolkits calendar and right tool kits
charts are pretty hefty control so they
have their own libraries here there's a
gauge control which has a separate
library the debugging debugging stuff
actually this is the only part that when
you get it from nougat it's compiled as
a debug binary so you won't ship that
into the store because the store doesn't
accept anything compiled with debug all
of the other libraries new get compiled
as release the reason debugging is
compiled as debug is you probably don't
want that code shipped in your
application you only have that one line
of code if you want to debug it and then
you want to remove it and also there are
actually attributes specified in various
methods in there that make it only run
and debug builds so you don't actually
have to disable it if you include the
source code of the debugging library
with your project and you want to
quickly build the release build you
don't have to remove all the tracing
hooks from your code the sample is
actually what I was showing which had
all the sample code for various controls
and extensions so it's using mvvm and it
has a few view models where it was
necessary but I tried to make it as
simple as possible so so you have simple
hook ups to all of these controls and go
to get gauge test page and look how it's
done and there's a grid and various
gauges with various parameters specified
so you can you can actually see if you
need to define your custom template to
get that look of the gauge control or
you just can specify a few properties
and in case of a gauge control there's a
needle rush color and trail brush color
and so on that you can change and the
chart is the biggest control in there so
far and it actually as there's a flip
view with different sample of the chart
for for each page and some of these some
of these have been restyled the return
platter than there there are different
data series definitions so a column
series in the column chart and var
series and burn chart so we can you can
see how it's all done by looking on the
source code and in the sample there's
also another application here that I can
show you that sometimes useful although
maybe it will be a little bit less
useful with Windows 8.1 and visual
studio 2013 but it basically visualizes
what of the standard brushes and and a
bar button styles for example and you
can copy and paste these these names
from this application just go through
all the all the available styles for
application bar buttons and text block
styles you can see which ones are bigger
and which might might fit your
requirements so you don't have to define
your own styles that are already
shipping out of the box so if you have
any any skills in samo I would actually
also ask if you if you want to
contribute if you have some controls
that are interesting that the my chair
want to share with the community I think
working with open source is really
rewarding I I really learned a ton about
development and made myself really easy
to hire right now by knowing a lot of
stuff about Sam oh let's see
like there's just three tons of work for
some all developers right now and lots
of teams that Microsoft are hiring so
when I came back to Microsoft three
months ago there were five five teams
that were looking for example developers
that reached out to me and I could pick
and choose in a fresh paint was the the
most interesting one and basically
working with with this in your free time
gives you an opportunity to learn and
work with anything that you like to do
and not necessarily something that you
do for work but also a lot of the things
that I've done here were driven by by
things that I wanted to do at work so
for example I worked on a Disney
Princess application for Disney and I
found that I needed a lot of things that
we're missing and and the platform and I
didn't have time to build reusable
controls at work but I had a long
commute and on the bus home I usually
spend some time to make things reusable
and I created controls that I later used
in the application and also know the
debugging controls I use that work all
the time and it's that's really a good
experience doing something that you like
in here in your free time that you can
then use that work and beauty world for
it yeah so i think that's that's it for
me
do you have any questions yeah she go
ahead and take that from your time you
got any time yeah if you want me to demo
something else how you use some of these
features i can do that for you others I
was opening how does work with open
source giant food LCA uh how do you
reach that so as long as it's I I
believe that as long as it doesn't
compete with and I think that you do at
work or it doesn't taint you it
shouldn't be a big problem so most of
the code that that's in my tool kit was
written by myself or was using a code
from Microsoft so it's not a big problem
for me I think you can just ask your LCA
about about that but usually it's it's
not a very big problem and lots of
people at Microsoft do open source
development in every time and some of
them will libraries that millions of
people use outside of Microsoft
so do that
so one thing is just that you play with
with things that you want to do and not
necessarily think that you have to do at
work so maybe at work you do HTML and
you want to learn zamel and you can do
that your free time you can build your
own application and that's certainly
something that you can ship to the store
and not make it open source but using
building something that other people
might want to do and something that you
might want to reuse in the future like a
library or a toolkit like mine you learn
a lot of things about architecture
architecting software you learn to work
with people with a community you you
expose your your code to you know
criticism and you get bug reports and
you can you can be you know the master
of your own project and which is not
something that you always get at
Microsoft so I think a lot of a lot of
that feedback from the community is
something that helps you learn well
basically the things that you can
experiment and you have you have freedom
to do whatever you want as something
that's really beneficial and I think
it's rewarding just that you know I I
hear a lot a lot of from from people who
use that tool kit that they well they
thank me because now I you know made
available these are some features here
and there and this is the only charting
toolkit for windows 8 and now they could
create that application and I've seen
some applications like I think who'll or
twitter official applications for
windows using my toolkit and I think
tons of other applications that but you
know use various parts of it and i think
that's that's really motivating
I think before I started working with
open source i was playing a lot of games
in my free time and now i don't have
time to play games anymore because I
have such a fun time you know writing
code and actually that makes me I think
also a better developer at work because
I have more experience I double my my
time you know programming and it at work
that we might be doing things that are
not necessarily as fun as you would like
to but if you with you do open source
you can come up with some interesting
theories and maybe you come up with some
ideas that you know maybe you can use at
work maybe that they will help you at
work or maybe you can share it with
other people and they might make make
you famous or they might give you just
the joy of working with other people you
know there's tons of benefits of you if
you become very familiar with the some
topic
you had the question no unfortunately
all of these libraries are net and
they're not winner d components and
originally I was just not very familiar
what's the difference between a winner
teak component library and the class
library but I mostly so limitations and
in winrt components so you can you can
create a library for windows 8
applications with C sharp in two
different ways one is a cross library
and that can only be used in dot net
applications and you can create an winrt
component which looks roughly the same
and there's actually you know you can
just go to project properties and
there's I maybe I'll stop it there's
this output type parameter you can
easily change your project between
Windows Store app class library and
those runtime component but the problem
with winrt components is that they
impose lots of limitations on here so
you can't have I think you can't expose
your controls or your classes making
them inheritable you have to have
everything sealed I think you can't
share I don't remember all of the
limitations but maybe like interfaces
aren't available or you can expose
things as structs or you can't you can't
expose anything that that isn't sealed
so my talk it wouldn't be extensible
that way and yeah so so for example one
of the features i have is a behavior
class so you can you can easily add your
own behaviors to controls but a behavior
you have to derive from my base behavior
class and you wouldn't be able to do
that if you had a winner d component
rate
so actually maybe i wouldn't i'd like to
show one more thing technical reason why
they why they do they have exactly four
performances um okay i think it's just a
part of the WinRT lower level framework
so winrt in its base i think is based on
come i'm not sure if calm allows for
inheritance it may be basically is based
on interfaces and I think that has to be
rejected yeah it has to be productive to
other languages that work differently so
I think maybe in the future when arty
types will and with rt components will
allow for anything that you know dot net
applications allow for right now but you
know if you if you expose a link link
query results for example outside of
your application that would have to be
projected to all the other languages and
maybe they don't understand that
programming language structure paradigm
so yeah so winrt components if I created
it as a winner d component you could use
that in C++ and in theory you you could
use that in and JavaScript as well but
since all of my code is heavily relating
that to humble well there's there's no
point in doing that with JavaScript and
I actually haven't seen many people
doing sambal development with C++ either
so there wouldn't be so much return from
that although a lot of that code should
probably if you extract it into a one RT
component library it should be possible
to make it without a component fairly
easily just that the requires more work
and I'm just one one guy
someone else to the question
yeah so yeah C++ is possible to use and
I think for for example you can you can
certainly use that and there are cases
where it helps but I think if you if
you're a c-sharp developer and
developing applications in c-sharp is
probably a little bit easier and faster
and you know cody is easier to maintain
I would actually not recommend using
using C++ for example development and I
do recommend using C++ though if you
have anything that does heavy processing
or like if you need to use direct tax
it's a good idea although even with
direct tax today you can use sharp DX
which makes makes it a lot easier to
work with with your attacks if you don't
know C++ well I've used the saml with
with directx using both C++ and sharp DX
and there are benefits to both methods
so with plus blast you you have problems
with with using another language and C++
is definitely more difficult to program
and maintain that than done c sharp but
you can create the WinRT component with
C++ and that might be reusable whether
it's a C++ or C sharp application and
also for c++ you have all the samples in
the you know directx sdk and you can use
like c++ anp if you want to do something
really quick with GPU and it gives you
lots of power but I think if you build a
Windows Store application I wouldn't
really recommend that unless you're you
don't know C sharp and you're very
skilled with C++ which which is still
probably I'm sure lots of people doing
C++ but
I think a lot of people at Microsoft are
C sharp developers and it's just easier
with sharp DX there's less documentation
but you can just compile for any cpu and
that's actually one problem that I've
seen with using C sharp and C++ together
that usually here you have to create a
separate separate package for each
platform so for your arm and x86 and x64
you have to create separate versions so
it's also difficult to you know create a
reusable library that you would want to
use with different different c-sharp
projects because you you need different
versions of that library and I'm
actually not sure how to how to build a
c-sharp application with you know I
compile the c++ library if you have
separate versions of that library for a
different different platforms that you
probably need to use them like an
extension SDK or something like that so
I just remember one thing that I haven't
shown you so maybe I can quickly go
there there's controls extensions groups
of samples and in there that show you
how to how to use some of these
extensions in the toolkit and I only
showed you what what they look like once
you run them but I thought maybe it's it
would be nice to show you how to
actually use them so for example let's
go to highlight behavior so here you
know you can implement it in different
ways I i have this search string box
where i entered some text and
you know I could update and regenerate
that the text block underneath with with
the highlighted stuff but if you go to
what is it called highlight behavior I
think it's actually here you go here you
can find that that there's one text box
that has been in the search search text
there's another one that has the search
string and the only thing that you have
to do to highlight that text is just
define these few lines of code to to use
that behavior that i have for
highlighting it that's that's using a
behavior that's similar in its
implementation to blend behaviors so
blend the 2013 version with the land sdk
is supposed to have this new
implementation of behaviors so they are
really light easy to apply in blend and
that was the goal of this library but
there's also another another set of
behaviors that defined us basic attached
behavior pattern so so in some of some
cases of these extensions i define them
just as attached properties so for
example there's this framework element
extension system cursor property that
that's you know just one property here
that you define and you set it to some
in on value like our cross and if you go
to think it's this one you know i
specify a different cursor for each of
these controls by just specifying these
one line of code 11 attribute and
underneath there's actually a class that
attaches to attaches do that without
control and handles
pointer events pointer entering that
control and leaving the control and
setting the system cursor right now
there's no built-in API in Windows 8 44
changing the cursor automatically for
for a specific control you can you can
only change the cursor for for your
application or for the OS so this gives
you a way to specify that I want to hand
the cursor for for my PDF viewer when
when users can pan with their mouths on
the screen so when Artie has a lot of
these controls that are created
primarily for use with with touch but a
lot of the things that you might want to
do to support keyboard and mouse which
Microsoft used to require from all
applications in the store are actually
not so easy to implement and a lot of
these extensions help with that so
actually a let's let should show one one
more thing so show text box validation
you can find that oh well maybe I don't
have a sample for it but there are some
extensions here that make the text
automatically a text box automatically
select the text when you enter the
control or for example when you your
text box only supports three character
because it's area code code for your
telephone there's an extension that that
says that after the control has been
filled with this number of characters it
will automatically skip to the next
field so it has lots of that support for
keyboard input and the treeview control
and the great splitter are all created
to support all these mouse input
scenarios which which are not so easy
with the out-of-the-box api's
you want to
got more things there's an extension
that helps make a list view item
disabled just one item in the in the
list through binding there's another one
that allows you to specify that you want
some specific item to be brought into
view in this view with with a bindable
property so so if you use mvvm you can
say that oh I want this item to show on
the screen right now so you basically
say say that said that item in this new
item extensions to bring into view and
now i select the item here and just with
one attribute somewhere in cold it gets
brought into view here there's a another
set that allows to bind the list of
selected items so if you use nvm and you
want to control the list of items
selected in the list there's a helper
for that you have bindable selection and
my source list has a has a selected
items or bindable selections property
and i have another list that binds to
that collection here so you can I invite
you to explore things that are there a
lot of these features were also driven
by by me scouring the stack overflow
website for interesting questions in one
RT so sometimes I saw a question like
how do I do that a nice I think well
it's it is difficult in one RT and well
maybe I can create some some reusable
you know method or extension that you
might use and then you know I create
that I put that in the toolkit and many
people on Stack Overflow go back to that
question and you know I want to
highlight some text in my text block
when I when I do a search in the
application they they find the link to
my library and that's that's where they
get so if you looked looked for some
solutions to problems online it's likely
that you found links leading to my
toolkit and if not there then there's
another tool kit from Tim heuer from the
windows team who has other controls that
that you might have seen missing in
Windows 8 point although a lot of his
controls are now implemented in Windows
8.1 so it will be less usable he is
probably the most popular control
toolkit for Windows 8
