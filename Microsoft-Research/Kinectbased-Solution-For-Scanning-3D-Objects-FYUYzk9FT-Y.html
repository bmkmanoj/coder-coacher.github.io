transfer control is the cutting edge
technology in gaming the kinect motion
sensor helps developers to unlock even
greater potential in their applications
which connect with like to provide and
unique experience that allow you to
control and play your favorite games in
a new way now let's find out how it
subtly we are able to do this first of
all we need to understand how connect
census ever well depth information
shapes
materials and motion
the touch sensor is a breakthrough
fishers of the Kinect and was also the
central focus of our research each
connect contains a RGB camera a depth
sensor and in microphone array the depth
sensor is combined with an infrared
structure and laser projector and a
monochrome camera the projector casts a
non mindful pattern their pixels on to a
single then the camera uses the
defamation of their pattern to calculate
a depth information of the sea before we
acquire any useful information from a
single the raw data from the kinect must
be heavily processed if you're close at
each scan data from the connect directly
you can see it's a very rough we have to
transform this data into something more
useful
parcel service reconstruction helps we
use a Poisson equation to determine the
indicator function price grid in the
field of that the match surface can be
easily extracted for other indicator
function now the quality of information
is improved but it's still not good
enough
the xbox 360 released in 2005 now seems
to have limited hardware it would take
about 20 seconds using traditional
methods to do the reconstruction it
doesn't sound like very long time but
for real time game even a few seconds we
will seriously impact the user
experience the xbox 360 has a very
strong CPU but it's tpo is even more
powerful so we developed a hybrid
framework to utilize both our CPU and
GPU studio calculations besides our
computation memory is another kind of
limitation the xbox games the textures
models music and assistant all of them
takes memory so finally we only have a
small amount of space available we can
furthermore adjust the parameter of this
acquisition to reduce eighty percent of
the triangles with little actual change
in their shapes finally connect can
digitize an object in less than two
seconds our current book is the only
first step we're still working on
connect object it with hydrogen in the
future you will become faster more
accurate and more realistic without so
this effort to enrich the user
experiences of the connect object
digitization
