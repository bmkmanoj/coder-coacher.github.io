you
so
it's my pleasure and honor to welcome
professor les Atlas to ms are less is a
distinguished professor at u-dub he's
been involved in different things mainly
he is working in single processing of
acoustics the sound has his speciality I
believe in sensing that and working on
it so professor Atlas peace thank you so
I want to mention that this talk that
I'm giving is a slightly updated version
of a talk I gave a few weeks ago in in
Cambridge and it wasn't it was given to
the group of hearing researchers to
Brian Moore in his group and other
people Roy Patterson's group at
Cambridge UK and a reason for that is
kind of right here and bloedel hearing
research scholar is something that I was
awarded about a year ago which is gave
me some release time and some motivation
to work on how the ear works because
people have run into a limit in what
they feel the science and mathematics
can tell them about the year and they
want to help wanted some help with that
limit so I also want to thank someone
who's been very inspirational in this
work bitch to at all who many of you
have heard of and our sponsors so let me
go ahead and get into my first point and
it's really real just what I just said
that conventional math tools and science
for audio signal representations that we
work with now that we're taught are
insufficient they limit our creativity
we're taught a certain set of things
their standard part of electrical
engineering computer science physics
mathematics and those are limiting and
the better tools and science would give
us the ability to and for example come
up with enhanced listening be it for
normal hearing impaired listeners or
machines multiple simultaneous sources
noise and reverb these are standard
problems that people face and reporting
systems from a laboratory to the real
world and let me talk about existence
proof that there are better solutions
the first one is we know our ears work
well and we can look at top-down
approaches people like she option more
leading or others who work in dynamics
that's essential having models of how
sounds evolved over time is absolutely
essential part and I'm not saying that's
unimportant but I'm going to stress
something else that's important which is
more the bottom-up feature based
approach and just from the standpoint of
what really can be done if you expand
your imagination you let go of some of
your previous notions and previous
mathematics law for the fact that there
might be a different world out there
than what we've learned and I've got a
picture here from a recent publication
that actually made use of some of our
previous concepts which is us notion of
a modulation spectrum and modulation
filtering this is a model of what the
ear might be doing according to
McDermott at all neuron and they cited a
paper transaction signal processing
something I've talked about before
called modulation filtering and their
argument which is an argument that we've
gone a bit beyond and I will be doing
that the rest of my talk is that well
first of all the way that the ear works
it's got a bunch of sub bands and each
sub-band is producing something like a
bandpass filter there's an envelope and
compressed non-linearity envelopes come
out of every sub band and whenever you
talk about an envelope or modulation
there's another word for modulation
which is called product modulation
multiplying product all mean the same
thing which means if you really want to
find a modulation envelope you have to
demultiplex carrier or do something else
get rid of that original carrier and I'm
going to talk about that old
communications model why it's old and
why it's a bit dated and how we can move
on from that point it's a conventional
model that people are using this is a
2011 paper they got some pretty new
weeds up nice results using something
called modulation filtering which I've
argued for previously but what's really
missing is what this
experimental work or is it modern work
both is both both so in this neuron
paper is both and and I you'll find if
you look in the literature you'll
certainly see sets of both but what's
missing is part of the scientific
community and also the engineering
community is people talk about a
modulation envelope and that's a
well-accepted concept because the way
that the ear works and the way that
vocoders work and the way that you can
get intelligible speech is about these
envelopes these slow-moving envelopes
one for every sub band you might have
eight or sixteen or even floor it's all
bands can excite them with noise you can
get intelligible speech but when you
have to talk or you have noise or you
have a reverberation going on that falls
apart so the problems that we started
with which is multiple sources noise
reverb are things that don't hold up
well to having the envelopes only so the
notion of what's called a temporal fine
structures what the communities after
problem is they don't have an
agreed-upon definition there is kind of
an operational definition I'm going to
tell you why that definition is wrong
and I'm going to give you a substitute
way of looking at it now let me just
give you another existence proof
something that's actually related to
this problem when you go into a new room
and you listen to a group of people
talking you can single out a particular
talker and a highly reverberant
environment like that understand their
speech even at a negative signal to
noise ratio and there's another case of
something like that that's radio
frequency walking around be it Wi-Fi
that's running at 450 or 600 megabits
per second or 4g internet or 3g internet
if you take a look at something which is
a city kind of layout that's actually a
Wi-Fi record that's not 4g internet
little devices that look like this thing
is small on the left you can get a
layout like this between buildings that
tells you about how well you'll do and
the key thing about that is when you use
Wi-Fi or use 4g internet
there's no training sequence it's a
blind equalization that's done and
there's tricks being done an orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing that are
remarkably similar as I will argue to
what our might be doing that's the
analogy i'm going to make toward the end
of my talk so let's start heading toward
that and first of all to get to that
point that final point of OFDM or
frequency division multiplexing let's
start with some history the idea of
breaking things into frequency or sub
bands the first person to do it really
was Alexander Graham Bell who tried to
send multiple moris code signals down a
single line simultaneous the multi-user
problem for Morse code he failed in
doing that but by mistake he was able to
send voice over that same line that's
called the telephone now that wasn't
bought 90 1875 that he did that 1877
Helmholtz ended up writing a book and a
key part of that book is quoted right
here the notion of tones they used to
crunk on zero crossings if they could
they used to try to make a silly grammar
time-domain pictures but they didn't
have a notion of frequency didn't link
what Fourier did with what happens with
sound it was helm hold who made that
link once we did that suddenly the area
took off 1906 the notion of product
models that are still being used that's
am radios initiated bath in 1933
vocoding models AM and FM together FM
radio came there and the problem is
we're kind of stuck at that 1933 point
in terms of modeling we're using for
understanding how the ear works and
understanding things like even Mel
frequency capture and what they're doing
now frequency capture go well beyond
what AM FM models do but errant in them
inherent their formulation is right
there let's take a look at something
that's more modern or after yeah man i'm
really stressing the FBM part doesn't
have to be orthogonal notion of
frequency division multiplexing of 1966
is the first papers i list 1942 because
the first person to talk about frequency
division multiplexing or spread spectrum
and general head he
mar the actress 1942 that's used in all
modern Wi-Fi 4G and high-speed data
communications now it's just like this
problem we're talking about a multiple
talkers it's called multiple axis use
this reverberation it doesn't just
blindly equalize it uses reverb to its
advantage anyways i'm going to show you
without the reverb there's multiple
paths between buildings it would work
worse but worse best if thousands of
frequency channels are available for one
data stream the bar frequency channels
the better except for battery life it's
kind of like the air we have thousands
of frequency channels highly overlapping
in the year they're not orthogonal but
it offers some novel and surprisingly
simple concepts for auditory encoding
whether we're trying to understand what
the ear does from a scientific
standpoint or come up with new
algorithms that are in sensitive to
noise can single out sources now what's
different about it it's talking about
some communication scheme but what's the
single kernel of difference between what
auditory models use and assume the stuff
I've even talked about before and what's
done in OFDM well its effect it's
multiple access primarily additive i'm
going to show you why i mean by this
soon and not a product model when people
talk about modulation coming out of
every sub band and then the fine
structure that might be coming at the
pitch rate or at a higher frequency rate
they're presuming a product model that
product model causes problems which i
will show if you use an additive model
instead things get better let's take a
look at the auditory system just a
simple model of it I'm going to keep a
simple model from known material not
making any strange speculation here
saying that we have an input signal
that's broken into a bunch of sub band
it could be thousands of our it's fits
our auditory system if it's some device
you know modern audio compression it
might not be thousands you're limited by
computes but in any case you have a
bunch of sub bands and have certain
properties now what's special about our
auto our auditory system is the hair
cell rectification right here
so the hair cell rectification I'm
showing an instantaneous non-linearity
that compresses the signal in a way
where if the signal is negative going
either provide 0 or it lowers the
resting rate so it has a slight amount
of negative value at which I'd show by
having this white line below the origin
on the right side we pretty much
duplicate the output half wave rectifier
not a perfect model but pretty much what
the transduction between acoustic
pressure and neural stimuli does
followed by now I'm going to pour shadow
what's coming a crummy low-pass filter
if you take a look at every hair cell on
the ear there's several neural fibers
coming off it and it we're between one
and eight for the hair cells that go up
to the brain and what comes off then has
a low pass filter but it's a leaky
integrator low pass filter some of those
fibers carry information higher rates
than others never really been looked at
so let me give you some alternative
views here's the conventional view of
what happens in every sub band an
auditory system here is the conventional
view from the standpoint of auditory
research in psycho acoustics take a
Hilbert transform to form a complex
signal called an analytic signal put
things in polar form okay that's where
the problem is you put things in polar
form as you'll see there's that product
that products not going to be our friend
as i'm going to show you because you
start with something which will be a
beautiful looking envelope if you looked
at the original signal two sided real
signal formed it's one side of analytic
complex signal and then looked at this
magnitude which is again real and non-
it's a beautiful-looking temporal
envelope of the signal tracks it really
nice don't need a low-pass when you do
this but then what people do is so they
get some envelope that looks reasonable
non-negative real and then they take
what's left over because that's what you
need to decom to put the whole signal
back together yeah that most of all that
I was processing people have done they
don't ever they don't
take the face way they just take the
little bit of energy as a function of
time well the energy as a function of
time would be very similar to this you
put a square there for example and
low-pass filtered if you wish if you
don't use the the analytic signal but
the problem then is all you have our
envelopes okay so the standard thing is
if you only have envelope you don't have
what we call the fine structure which is
this branch down here you're not able to
track multiple talkers not able to track
a single talk or a noise these other
things that I'm arguing for us is this
into the face there this is the standard
way people go after what they call
temporal fine structure that's a way I'm
going to argue against for reasons
because what's the model that have seen
simply take you know inter SPECT I'll
take one the introspect actor of a lot
of spiking plan oh what the spiking
comes from somewhere yes okay there's no
I think I've seen you know all the
correlation models that they recall the
spiky time where I stand up if you're
not typically to be broke isn't by this
amulet or the white face makes me I'll
talk about you well I'm not going to
argue against that okay there's issues
but in terms of psycho acoustic
experiments these days and some
physiology that's being done with
mammals what shihab does with ian other
people at cambridge do they do use
hilbert face that is the most common
thing that's done the neurophysiologists
and psycho acquisitions tend to use the
overt phase which is that lower signal
you might be a little uncomfortable with
it i'm sorry i am too okay so that's one
example okay but here let me make a more
general point that if you decompose a
signal into a slowly very energetic
light component x a finer time structure
component that's still going to be
problematic any of those especially if
this is you know modular or magnitude
equal to one okay so let's take a look
at the alternative that's the problem
it's a multiplicative view so what we're
going to propose instead is something
that's closer to what's done in
frequency division multiplexing we're
going to start with rectification the
ear does then
out there's certain properties about
rectification that are be going to be
coming soon that you're going to see
really interesting properties that no
one really takes advantage of that's
half wave rectification then what's
known as this this notion of integration
after that which is a low-pass filter
now the new part that top branch is a
modulation envelope now the new part is
instead of it being a product it's
additive what we're going to put is what
we call a fast envelope if you're
talking about phase locking your phase
locking to this fast envelope or carrier
it might be at the pitch rate if it's
lower sub-band and speech it might be at
the input signal rate so it's addition
on the envelope with riding on top of it
a much higher frequency that's a very
different model it's different algebra
than we have here let's talk a little
bit more about this new additive model
so we're talking about the top being
something which is identical to the
standard halfway rectified however you'd
like to do it whether you use a hilbert
envelope or use a rectification followed
by a low-pass filter and a real signal
if you look at for example stuart
Rosen's definitions you tend to have
frequencies up to about 50 Hertz in
below for that envelope maybe below 16
or 18 hurts in some people's definition
but this new part which is additive that
bottom fast down the loop starts with a
low corner about 50 Hertz below the
pitch rate below the lowest pitch and
goes on up to whatever phase locking
rate you can have if you look in the
latest edition of Brian's book you're up
to 4 to 5 kilohertz for your phase
locking rate so I'm calling it a
bandpass filter just to show it doesn't
go on forever let's look at some of
these models the conventional model i'm
using hobart phase because that's the
most common people i was talking to in
cambridge but you can substitute your
other favorite product model for the
high frequency stuff that your phase
locking to first problem with it complex
exponential phase this is a theoretical
issue does not have an inverse function
in the standard sense if you pair it
with its original modulation you
okay but if you make any change your
stock mathematically or algebraically
the underlying complex polar forms
magnitude must always be non-negative
we're going to see the problems that
develop because whenever the real part
attempts to dip below zero you've got a
sub band of speech coming through band
pass filter in the ear in whatever
device you're building it wants to cross
zero it's not non-negative whenever it
crosses zero this particular Hilbert
phase or whatever definition you use for
a polar form product model it's going to
have a problem it's going to properly
change his face by plus or minus PI it's
not connected to any known physiology
let's contrast this to what I'm
proposing instead which is an additive
model fast envelope now there's a deep
theory behind it I didn't pull this out
of a hat the reason is connected to
frequency division multiplexing and
high-speed data communication is
something called complementary
statistics if you take a look at in a
more recently the work of Peter Schreyer
and Louis scharf and before that piston
bono in France transaction signal
processing 1994 you can see new
information and signals it hasn't been
used in most audio processing very
rarely used in audio processing only
papers I've seen her too I cast 2012
maybe one in 2011 that I'm co-author on
really haven't seen anyone else use it
in audio it's very rarely used for
natural signals in fact notional
complementary envelope is usually used
for complex communication signals will
you have a cluster in the complex plane
of eight or 64 different points in your
signal constellation and because you
have this cluster in your complex plane
it's not circular if you look in a
complex plane of the real versus the
imaginary part you wish you use
quadrature that's fine there's a pattern
which is not exactly circular that
patterns not circular it's got
complementary statistics that are
meaningful it's got new information when
speech has periodic correlation any
signal with periodic correlation could
be speech it could be sonar from
taller it has significant complimentary
statistics argument that this kind of
resistor connected to Obito physiology
oh I'm getting there okay I love it I'm
getting there okay I'm about to get
there a couple slides these nail make
use of a simplified low pass and what
I'm arguing for the additive fast
envelope I'm trying to get at that okay
when you look at these kind of papers
are talking about expected values things
that are in the limit expectations where
you have either infinite limits if you
assume it's ergodic or other ways of
finding an expected value of its not or
gotik you also have to assume that
signals are harmonized about other
things that you need because they're not
necessarily stationary but yet you need
to be able to find some statistics on
them complicated mathematics hard to get
through with this complementary
statistics what we do instead these days
it's not going to be my talk I don't
have time for it today it's a generative
model and what a generative model can do
it's much like having a DFT instead of a
power spectral density if you have a
power spectral density that's a pencil
and paper thing you need to know the
underlying true autocorrelation function
you take its Fourier transform pencil
and paper but if you have data you can't
do that you do a DFT you do an FFT you
might win do it you might use linear
prediction with other characteristic
those are all spectral estimators when
estimator of complimentary part is this
fast envelope it is an estimator of it
it's not expected value it's not a
pencil and paper thing but it works with
the data let's show you why this is the
slide where I can show you why that's
true there's the only math going to be
giving you today it's actually very
interesting and the reason is if you
take a look at this generative model of
what the complementary part is this new
information that has to do with the non
circularity if you took the analytic
signal the stuff that's really important
communication signal the reason you get
600 megabits per second if you look at
that you get a double frequency term or
that
complimentary part is and the zero
frequency term is where the envelope is
the standard envelope is beat by itself
down to baseband double the frequency
that you started with your carriers have
two kilohertz at four kilohertz as a
complementary part that's what you'd
normally get in statistics in
complementary statistics now when you
work with a half wave rectifier gets a
little more believable and plausible for
the auditory system this is why let's
assume a sinusoids coming in what
happens to the Fourier series where a
sinusoid gets really interesting we have
a sinusoidal what comes out this is a
sinusoidal input is a sinusoid at the
fundamental frequency and with a minus
PI phase shift in minus quadrature
double frequency term so here's the
story if you're talking about
complementary statistics as new
information it's usually a double
frequency term we know 1.5 kilohertz two
kilohertz is important for speech the
double frequency term would be three or
four kilohertz hard to argue for phase
locking up at those frequencies really
hard to argue to Brian Moore in his
group for phase locking those
frequencies very rare but if you're
right at that 1.5 or two kilohertz it's
not so hard anymore so stuff that leaks
through at the fundamental is right at
the frequencies you can get phase
locking which is that complementary
information and by the way your first
harmonic for a sinusoidal that's just
the nature of the Fourier series that's
just for a sinusoidal input I can't
generalize this for a broadband case
because it's nonlinear but for a
narrowband case it would be like this
the higher order terms for the sine term
are very small you know go away
basically the higher order terms for the
cosine terms are also quite small but
they don't totally go away so there's
key principles going on here that's
linking a fundamental to its harmonic if
we're talking about a sub band that
centered at three kilohertz for speech
at six kilohertz that first harmonic
there's not going to be much phase
locking there so really not getting much
but if you're talking about something at
eight hundred Hertz 1600 hurts you will
get phase locking and maybe this guy in
this page if it is important so let's
keep that in mind
from this matter that I couldn't tell
that there is a 270-degree fishing oh
all i did is i just did the algebra i I
don't have the derivation on this slide
okay I can show you the derivation
separately okay but the derivation is if
you start with this as a signal model
and then determine a sub K a 0 and B sub
K using standard definition of Fourier
series you get these functions that I
plotted so that all that is its closed
form solution for a sub k &amp;amp; B sub K even
though it's a series internet serious
yes the death if you use a standard
definition of Fourier series there's a
definition of what a sub K is equal to
another definition to what B sub case
you solve for them and then you apply to
me get these pictures for this
particular s of T that's all that is
okay so this is the effect of half wave
rectification which is interesting a lot
more interesting than or whatever
thoughts so let's now do some demos that
relate to these concepts what I'm going
to do now is I'm going to play too
sounds that differ this is a really
crude model of one versus two talkers
and the way I'm going to do this crude
model is not really one versus two
sources it's something which is
consonant versus distant and the one
which is consonant is when they're
harmonic it sounds like one source no
question about it when they're dissonant
or in harmonic which is the 4 12 and 7
40 those two they don't necessarily
sound like one source they sound Colonel
like a crummy cord and what we're going
to do is we're going to we're going to
play them where we play this first one
then the second one will keep looping
through and you here just to hear the
difference between them you can listen
to them now and then i'm going to show
you the fast and the slow envelope for
these that's what I'm getting to I make
the argument the fast envelope tells you
the difference between consonance and
dissonance between one source and
multiple sources but let's just start
with the test signal so you understand
how it here's how it sounds
oh that one again
Oh
oh okay one sounds like a single source
the second one sounds maybe like a train
whistle that has two reads in it
whatever it is not a perfect chord but
certainly more dissonant than the first
one now let's take a look at these two
if I go with the just the first case
which was this one not play there it is
just that thing where they're harmonic
and sounds like one source what I'm
going to do for the sake of my
discussion is to talk about half wave
rectification start with the usual
follow a low-pass filter simplest model
auditorily acceptable to most people
what our auditory system does to find an
envelope I'll call it the slow envelope
to distinguish it from the new concept
the additive thing not a product the
fast envelope okay here's a way to look
at it you can think of the signal that's
coming through the half wave rectifier
and the low-pass filtered version is
just following the peaks of it okay
because a low-pass filter what's left
over bandpass filter part it's high
enough corner of the bandpass filter
part these two sum together give you
what came out of the half wave rectifier
give you everything except the negative
going part of the original signal so
what you're doing so for this particular
one I think that what we used here was
was it the corner 454 this one
450 over to ok so it's halfway into the
band that's a low corner the look in the
upper corner was three st / 2 so 3 times
for fitting in particular okay so you
will get that scene frequenter right and
likewise for this one we chose a a
corner that was made sure that it was
flat and you'll see the results shortly
but I'm going to be comparing the
results to this case which is the
inharmonic case takes a lot of load
sounds like two things maybe train
whistle at least we're going to do the
same thing for say comparison this is
the more dissonant case like two sources
maybe the slow in the fast Tomblin and
we're going to look at them and compare
them let's compare the harmonic fast
envelopes first the 300 is 600 clearly
harmonic here's a fast envelope coming
out of the 600 of the six hundred Hertz
input look at it speaks line them up
there's a 300 Hertz input fast envelope
perfectly lined up and the valleys also
line up with the peaks of the other one
there's the fast envelope structure
aligns in time so if I had to sub bands
one corresponding to 300 Hertz another
corresponding about six hundred Hertz
look at that fast envelope that comes
out call the low-pass filter after the
half wave rectifier a leaky integrator
look at what leaks out line them up with
their phase locking the phase locking
lines up nicely be correlated the two
sure aren't those labels foot is
the one in the top 200 the one in the
bottom you're right I'm sorry about that
okay I could call this scale we get away
with it sorry about that yes pay off
that's a mistake thank you for pointing
that out real good good I those
envelopes that I have in the same way
the original harmonics then we used to
create this out tonight up so what would
happen if they would be the original
harmonious would be shifted relative to
each other so you mean that the original
harmonics are all shifted together yeah
so it could could you go back to the
last or gospel ok because i will be
showing you the inharmonic case soon
okay okay so yeah hang on these on the
top right you see that so the top right
is the sum of the yeah left signals yeah
you see that they have been aligned such
that peaks of the 330 will line up with
a pitch of the 7s 600 yes in the same
and and of course as a result the
envelopes line up in the same way what
would happen if you would shift the 630
wave pipes a 50 Hertz whatever both by
50 Hertz you're sorry if you check it in
time bye what a beautiful soul oh if
there's a relative phase delay be three
number four that's all so pretty much I
believe this is what makes them to
belong to the same lead to perceive them
belonging to the same signal they are in
phase i guess is that if your footer
let's say 37 degrees fish inch off a
ship between triple system actually made
no decision by deliberately explanation
is that has that particular phase
relationship has to do the fact that
their body output
the half wave rectifier right because
with a half wave rectifier the second
harmonic the second P has to be aligned
with the other one to produce the
attenuation of this of the low peak
because of the rectification so that's a
factor that's a factor but if we went
ahead and did a relative phase two and
if you think of what the air you're does
with the traveling wave they're not in
phase by the time they get to the
yourself i expect it so she moves
everything around it won't change much
of our eyes are the same perception so
and the energy toward model will predict
that yeah and so the water will be
dancing yeah and so so when I when I
brought this example up to the cyclic
oooo sticks and physiology people in
Cambridge it started discussion that
went on for a week and this is to me a
success okay that's what I wanted to do
I want people to look at things
differently because all the random this
when you go to the face in allspice you
know just swap out all these differences
you're looking for correlation somewhere
else down the line so if you if you do a
relative phase shift one of them that's
never exact but you get random firing at
the peaks okay and if there's some
correlation somewhere down the line in
this huge structure in the auditory
midbrain it calls these likely from the
same source and all I want to do is
contrast so we could put phase shift and
we'd get something where they don't line
up perfectly in the plot that i showed
you let's go back to the plot we get
something well we don't get exactly this
alignment okay there'd be a relative
phase shift at the bottom one versus the
top one but over time they be
correlation between the two and how that
correlation is measured is somewhere
else up in the auditory midbrain yeah
the cochlear and then over time be at 10
milliseconds or 40 milliseconds so
statistics will accumulate say we've got
one source because they're firing in
synchrony in some way even though
there's a relative delay yes in the
magnitude of the Douglas would also be
affected by the relative days
signals nope here's the magnitude of
them right there they're both the the
silk as the signals as you change the
time alignment of the signals the
magnitude of this spectrum stays the
same the magnitude of each sub-band
output stays the same okay the signal
itself of course if you look at the
magna to the signal itself before it
goes into the individual sub bands of
course that's changing okay the signal
itself is changing its peaks and it's
shaped but if you look at the sub bands
in the auditory system what's coming out
of each one call it a slow envelope this
defined by half wave rectifier in a
crummy low-pass filter but only keeps
low frequencies it's flat as a board
with your phase shifter without it okay
and the reason I'm doing this particular
case is because when we go to the
harmonic case at the dissonant case next
their possible going to be flat as a
board so when you look at the standard
auditory model of a bunch of sub bands
followed by a rectifier followed by a
low-pass filter consonant and dissonant
shouldn't sound different it might sound
different pitch but the consonants vs.
dissonant should not be noticeable it's
something else what is that something
else okay people would argue for the
Hilbert phase I argue against it the
moment how to tell you why this is the
alternative which is the additive
alternative now this is only the
harmonic case let's go to the in
harmonic case see what happens now
they're not lined up no matter what you
do with the numbers that we chose these
are never going to line up you could
relat you could shift the face the top
relative to the bottom they're never
going to line up and accumulate their
statistics in terms of their for example
phase locking in such a way that over a
period of 20 or 500 milliseconds you
collect things where they're
synchronized they're always a
synchronized and that's why they sound
dissonant you look at the peaks to in
the valleys and we also have the recos
here at visa prefers to get so sorry
about that so they're not aligned ever
but look at their slow envelope no
information is slow envelope err sub and
they're both flat so consonants versus
dissonance did not make it through the
low-pass half wave rectifier it's the
high pass
or the band-pass part or the fast
envelope as I call it ok so that's my
new concept these are additive concepts
that's one another important thing let's
compare this to the conventional view
that's used by psycho acousticians and
neurophysiologists the Hilbert phase is
very popular now and I'm going to give
you a different example let two tones be
some them together let's just play this
case takes a little while to load now
these this would be considered the case
of two tones falling into the same
auditory sub band because they're
falling into the same auditory sub-brand
they're beating with each other and you
certainly hear that beating whatever
that envelope rate is that you're
staring at and that's a pretty well
understood phenomenon going all the way
back to Helmholtz that you have an
envelope we tune a guitar or something
like that you're listening to the
beating and waiting for it to go away
we've got frequencies that are close to
each other now the first kind of hint
that there's an issue here as which of
the two envelopes is correct the top one
or the bottom one I don't know they're
both correct now let's take a look at
that in the frequency domain very close
we presume they're in the same sub band
which they would be for our auditory
system let's look at the conventional
Hilbert phase temporal fine structure
the ways to find is that bottom quantity
it's a cosine of that phase that comes
after the analytic signal he put it in
polar form complex number for polar form
its phase function which is a cosine is
between minus 1 and 1 that's what a
cosine is going to give you whatever
phase you put in there let's take a look
at that signal that's that same beating
signal we just looked at let's look at
some of its characteristics let's zoom
in on this portion after we zoom in on
time I didn't want to use I told I told
us Scott not to use matlab's
interpolation between points because
there is no interpolation to be done
between points it isn't a vertical line
there that's a discontinuity so there's
something wrong mathematically with this
this definition gives you discontinuous
signal this is what people are using
when i get to speech you're going to see
that this is not an artificial case this
happens in speech also so there's a
severe discontinuity plus minus pi
whenever that thing wanted to cross zero
so let's take a look at the same issue I
argue there's a problem with Hilbert
phase and other ways of representing
this fine structure and the problem is
fundamentally that whenever your
envelope wants across zero you're going
to have a discontinuity in any of the
standard definitions what happens with
our new fast envelope with this case we
still have a discontinuity do we have a
mess let's take a look half wave
rectifier slow envelope is just that
envelope there's a fast envelope and
blue okay the fast envelope is not
magnitude one doesn't go for between
minus one and one it has modulation left
on it that's troubling for some people
that was troubling for me at first
because I'm used to this product model
and the product model is where the fine
structure has a magnitude is going
between plus minus 1 because you've
taken all the modulation out of it how
can you say that the envelopes are
modulator if there's still modulation
left in what you call the fine structure
I was stuck thinking that way for the
last 10 years I'd argued communities
been stuck thinking that way since the
1920s ok there's no way to force this to
go between plus minus one without
forcing and discontinuity in it and that
discontinuity as we're going to see a
would exist in speech if you analyze it
this way and it also causes troubles so
here model I never liked this model to
begin with
efectos de beber with you so why do you
so this is not be a logical at all and
most of fidelity or not I've seen and
the coupon yeah I choose the goose by
key information well this is this is my
predecessor to the spiking okay this is
what comes before this despite this is
what the spikings based on I'm not
arguing that this is I'm not arguing
this in place of spiking at all I'm
saying the spikings got to come from
something what does it come from just
feel you okay good see going there they
put you know random this there and then
give you a shelter it doesn't really
very you look you don't need to explain
you know the song localization its
coastal detector or half of spices aisle
I won't argue that but the
psychoacoustic experiments that are
being done these days that are looking
at you are using this yes you know 2012
papers are using this okay so again but
let's zoom in on this portion what I'm
trying to do is give you a good
alternative so what you'll have is
people who look at it other ways but
they look still look at it in ways where
that that fine structure before they
find the spiking has to go between minus
one and one so it still has to have
problems and I'm arguing you got to get
away from that so here's what happens
with the fast envelope when i zoom in on
that portion where the envelope cross 0
fast envelope just goes to 0 smoothly
there's no discontinuity there's no
trouble what I want to get to is the
case of speech because we're going to do
the same kind of thing for speech in a
moment so I'm comparing the Hilbert
phase version or any version which is a
product form and it's fine structure
before you determine the spiking with
something which will call a fast
envelope which is just the stuff that
leaks through the leaky integrator
that's going on after the half wave
rectifier and just compare them
spectrally we look at them spectrally
between the two the red is the Hilbert
case spectrally the blue is the case of
the fast envelope a fast envelope is
giving you your two tones exactly hobart
phase is giving you all these harmonics
which are distortion products due to
that discontinuity now
we can compare these two by listening to
them but I think I want to get to the
speech looking at the time let's take a
look at a 1.5 kilohertz sub-band of
speech we're talking about artificial
signals does this really matter for
speech and my argument is that yes it
does let me just play the speech sample
a bicycle has two wheels let me move
ahead let's pass that speech sample
through a single sub-band of speech
based on well the models that they used
in cambridge and we can just play it
after goes through that sub band 1 point
5 kilohertz it sounds squeaky but you
can hear some of the speech coming
through just that sub band now let's
take a look at our various
representations Hilbert phase there's
the original signal in purple coming
through there not the original signal
but after the sub band is in purple
right there it's Hilbert envelope is the
black dash line beautiful-looking
temporal envelope these are time signals
there's a Hilbert phase for speech what
did it do pretty ugly this is any
definition that's assuming a product
form where that fine structure has to go
between minus 1 and 1 if you're spiking
followers a time but any model that does
that is going to have these problems
let's zoom in on some portions
discontinuity right there let's zoom in
when it gets small and the magnitude
gets small of the signal that's some
problems what this does right in this
portion not a function of the signal is
a function of the word size of your
computer really what it's doing here
because they're down at a very small
signal level we're looking for a
transcendental function inverse tangent
so I hope work temporal fine structure
which pretty much everyone's using in
psychoacoustics a lot of physiologists
are using as a predecessor for the
spiking model has artifacts it's because
it's a constant amplitude even at times
when the artifacts are pronounced and
that's fundamentally because of the
product model it's also not terribly
physiologic
you call using this so the fast envelope
fine structures are alternative that
doesn't have these mathematical problems
and also is more physiological let's do
the same experiment there's a Hilbert
phase temporal fine structure that would
come out if we use a half wave rectifier
instead let's look at the fast envelope
fast envelope is I'll zoom in on the
difference the Hilbert is the red
conventionals read product models read
our fast envelope is is the blue one
right there has no discount capture the
carrier that's exactly what it is
capturing both the bitch in the carrier
depends where you put that low past
corner in communication co Fazio
interior is a coastal because in the
cosine side but here carrier chances the
function we have to have it that way
otherwise we're going to get artifacts
now those artifacts you get in man-made
communication signals are the message
that's being sent okay here we're not we
don't have such a clean message that's
being just that was designed that was
man-made so that's why it's a problem to
use those communication ideas for
natural signals there's nothing that's
that's doing for example freak
phase-shift gang coming from our
auditory system that we have control
over okay so if we put our make a
receiver look for that it's going to see
artifacts which were zero problems argue
that the slope end of them is another
distant
that gets Sun the slope I mean maybe
computers yeah you get coastal and we
love fast without carrying yeah then you
get a message they kept multiplying but
now for this natural signal yes so what
is the analogy here do you try to make a
knowledge that you are the faster
envelope it's like you know distorted
version of the carrier and the slow and
we love gifty here's here's here's the
closest i can answer that the
experiments are in progress right now
okay and are working with guinea pigs
they're looking at this myelin comparing
to dover trays and cambridge right now
the model that we're using is one we're
comparing the red for where the spikes
are the probability of spike is highest
at the peaks of the red that's the old
model okay the new model says the
probabilities where the peaks and the
blue are what if the peak is very small
it's a lower probability that's all so
what we're saying is we're still phase
locking but when the signal level is
smaller crossing 0 the probability of
phase locking at that face drops down
that's all so you can simulate using
this wise approach and then impact the
spiking result yes essentially to see
how much constance away yes okay
kinetics muggy as we probably all that
no no by december well the results will
be ready by the end of it probably paper
ready by dissented ram experimental
verify that excuse me who are doing
experiment measurement to see whether
using this model as a probability you
can generate the spikes that are
consistent
statistic with real Mike Stone and his
colleagues at in Cambridge okay and
physiology people from the
neurophysiology Department Ian guess
last name is first names Ian who us
there with it they're working with
guinea pigs and looking at single in the
inferior colliculus and and lower level
cochlear nucleus oakley in the ear
you've probably listen you forget what a
higher level you can't really get to the
fibers coming off the hair cells my
argument would be in the fibers the
eight or so fibers coming off each
aircel each outer hair cell you might
see something that spikes at the peaks
of the blue so here's a way to look at
it spike probably the least I hear it's
pretty high here but it's higher here
than it is here that's an example okay
so it's just it's a model that doesn't
mathematically break if you followed the
red and spike at every peak of the red
what's going to happen here big spike
here what happens there it's meaningless
okay so when you look at the results
that people try to predict what the
physiology is doing when they use a
Hilbert phase or other measures that are
going between plus 1 and minus 1 with a
product model they don't work so well
okay that's really not a big change now
there's a little more on this we could
listen to these and if you listen to the
Hilbert phase it sounds horrible all
clicking in stuff you listen the fast
envelope it's much closer to
intelligible doesn't have the distortion
that should be obvious but one last a
few last points I want to make we have
all these sub bands in the ear and I
want to get back to what you know an
application of this could be and on the
right hand side is a really interesting
one we don't necessarily with OFDM or
orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexing we don't do we do blind
equalization in fact if you walk around
holding a Wi-Fi or cell phone or
something like that the reverb helps you
why does it help you well we look at a
couple different frequencies and if
we're at frequency one some sub band and
the direct and frisÃ©e first strongest
reflected path and out of phase ignore
that sub man this week or wait a lot
less whereas if you are some other
frequency and
the distances of these are just right
the timing of them just right you get
constructive interference not
destructive like you do for frequency
one so if you look at a whole bunch of
frequencies divided up into a bunch of
orthogonal frequencies which is what
they do an OFDM you're going to get
something that does much better as you
walk around is automatically scanning
over the frequencies now there's other
things like its orthogonal which the
area isn't there's a carrier channel
coming through which your doesn't
necessarily directly have I'm just
arguing for this kind of analogy and
also carry recovery issues a little more
complicated than that so we can compare
what we have this is kind of from
outcomes purpose what's the difference
between what we're arguing for now which
is this fast envelope versus say Malcolm
Cellini's correlogram ana correlogram
you're looking for this kind of
information by doing correlations what's
coming out of every sub band where this
axis this is the frequency uh Subban
this axis over here is autocorrelation
lag and let's just contrast those two in
a correlogram you've got a perfect
symmetry about the center points of
autocorrelation perfect symmetry right
here in here slight amount of time
variation in this case over here we
don't have the exact perfect symmetry
but there's a much bigger difference
this picture is all non-negative real ok
I'm you this is correlogram is all
non-negative real this picture on the
left can go negative ok and what's
happening here with a picture on the
left is everything that's blue is a zero
crossing and that's dead zero crossing
that asymmetry is query different
representation thing on the right is a
square is a quadratic version of the
signal thing on the left there is a
rectifier in there but there is a
potential for it to be closer to holding
superposition this is for one second of
the vowel yes yeah is that is they
suffer it's not listen you have to
change
single tough speaker one segment of a
vowel about six seven pitch periods hi
Steven about the color of brown I would
the excess is the time delay this is
samples here and this is time in
milliseconds yeah so they're not the
same Daedalus they're both time but
different different units of time I see
peanuts can you pop that fuss and look
Greg something also in the same way that
you do comedy oh it kind of is here the
only difference is that this is sample
in depth and this is actually Scott
converting this to actual time in
milliseconds so they really are
equivalent to the duration of the left
one on the right when they're pretty
close not exact but they really have the
same time axis that just the units are
different in this block there's a
straightforward epic and one who still
goes for the general frequencies oh yeah
there is a straightforward mapping
there's a straightforward mapping of
this access to that ass these axes are
identical but the ax is coming out of
the screen okay the the dependent
variable is wildly different that's the
big difference how do you experimental
e-verify which is more realistic well I
really don't know what to do with these
but the physiological experiments that
are going on in cambridge right now are
trying to confirm whether that fast
envelope does a better job of predicting
phase locking for signals that are for
example beating and he's also using
chirp sounds from guinea pigs their
natural vocalizations a set of signals
that have characteristics of the things
I've demonstrated for you
I can make a few more summaries here the
main point I'm making is that the
envelope and its fine structure which I
call TFS for tempo fine structure
additive and not multiplicative you
don't have the problems if they're
additive you're not forcing the temporal
fine structure to have these
discontinuities or strange behavior
additive ax t is an easier decomposition
to work with if you align fast envelopes
it's a good way to do segregation we can
allow for example an observation that
happens the auditory system is that
neighboring sub bands and speech that
overlap heavily have sharper a law for
sharper tuning curves for loud sounds
how does that happen well allowing the
fast envelopes to be additive can
reinforce the tuning curves or the or
the narrowness of a sub band which is
actually quite narrow in the auditory
system and all of this is is something
called frequency diversity it's
potentially a new view of pitch modeling
I was talking to Bob carlyon about this
when I was in Cambridge there's need for
something more general than
autocorrelation features and this is
when Bob and I talked and when I was
talking about the correlogram there's a
couple things the correlogram doesn't
predict that happen one that is that the
karela Graham is not sensitive to
forward versus bad word order you could
take a signal in Reverse its order
correlogram doesn't change okay assuming
the signals for example a steady vowel
if you reverse it the correlogram is
identical whereas what we're showing
with the fast envelope of changes and
even a transient signal if we reverses
order correlogram or where certain
interval will not change
Roy Patterson's auditory image this is
another person who is at Cambridge that
I worked with he talks about a
stabilized image and what we're talking
about the fast envelope is a
computationally or mathematically
defined way of doing what he calls an
auditory image better potential for
analysis than Hilbert or other product
models the fact it's an additive model
means that he can decompose it so that's
it done with two minutes left like say
something about how they spend with a
penthouse field is completely according
to the theory okay uh you know I don't
want to fix on any two frequency
endpoints but let's just say the lowest
frequency of the band pass filter is
just lower than the lowest pitch you'd
ever get is you want to capture the
pitch period in speech that is you want
to capture your periodicity of your
pitch so let's make it 50 Hertz or 70
Hertz or something like that let's let
its highest frequency capture the
fastest phase locking whatever mammalian
species you're working with cats phase
lock at a higher frequency than humans
do so whatever your phase locking of
humans gets argued between 1.5 kilohertz
up to 8 kilohertz somewhere in that
range for the high end so it's basically
everything outside of that low frequency
envelope we can beat large yes okay now
there's going to be a certain sub
bandwidth you start with which is of
course going to limit it in terms of the
control of these complementary it's all
all the complementary information is in
the fast envelope let me be a little
more clear about what the theory of of
the of complementary statistics okay
everything that's down in the slow
envelope is the circular or non
complementary part there's nothing which
is complementary in the slow envelope
it's all left out but when you go to the
fast envelope you have both you have a
mixture of both that's what the theory
says and that's what you get and
practice that's a fancy way of saying
that when you look at that fast envelope
it still has modulation on top
it but it's got other information buried
in there that you wouldn't have had and
that slow envelope the convective
original version that know which
information do you krista as the message
and put you in vehicles that scary and
did we stop together on the crystal to
be separated not you know I i would i
would have to say that you know in terms
of how the ear works for example or how
how a speech recognizer should work you
should use both okay both the best you
can why throw out any of it okay but you
can but here's but if you have pristine
conditions that is one talker high snr
you can use only the envelope and use
noise as a carrier that's Bob Shannon's
experiment that was in science aight
sub-bands you get intelligible speech
you throw some noise in there you have a
lower snr it falls apart you throw two
talkers in it falls apart what does that
suggest to suggest that this fast
envelope is needed for noise for
multiple talkers or for reverb the
things that would make the noise excited
