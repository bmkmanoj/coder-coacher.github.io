you
but
Santiago is visiting us for today from
UCL please part of second also got
charged on asus is now we have a big
security group working a lot on privacy
and equipped applications and they're
trying to actually be quite fly and
implemented them take real-world
concerns into and into consideration so
in Milano here I think in his CD the
most interesting aspect i found is that
he was mostly talking biz advisor
running at the beach but there must be a
big difference coming to cambridge and
beautiful bad idea so it's the today's
talk will be on collaborative data
sharing and yeah so thank you much yes
yeah it was in much better shape when I
was in grad school so my advisor will
only talk to me if I went to run with
him saturday morning 7am on the beach
okay so yes I'm at UCL a-- missing a
redshirt there and so my research really
revolves around privacy enhancing
computations and I've been focusing more
and more applications as Marcos said
been doing a lot of work on genomics
privacy and recently started working on
this concept of collaborative security
so there's kind of two components in
this top one is the generic idea of
control data sharing and I'm going to
try and explain it as as we go along and
the second one is the specific use case
very specific use case stats we are
going to present today that's the
predicted blood placing point so I said
as I said our work is okay so our work
is motivated by recent increase in
interest in concept of collaborative
security which of course it's a very low
that term can mean a little bit of
everything but I mean the the basic idea
is that organizations different entities
could collaborate in order to defend
themselves against the right and
a way to do it it would be to share
information about how they are attacked
right and the idea is that if you know
we could gain a better understanding of
the attacks out there the
vulnerabilities and so on so we could
try to better allocate defense resources
trying to you know detect block respond
to two compromises faster and more on
and you know this is has become a little
bit of a buzz word in the past maybe a
couple of years and with advocates that
actually are quite famous includes
including the US President Barack Obama
written in January 2013 at the set state
of the union address which is one of the
most important speeches you know it for
four US president said that he wanted to
push policy and initiatives like
facilitating information sharing like
threat information sharing between the
US private sectors and the public
sectors so to better protect and defend
against southern US history went one
step forward almost three years after so
december 2014 by actually announcing
what to call a presidential executive
order essentially trying to push
congress to actually pass legislation
making this happen of course you know
these days good luck getting anything
approved by the US Congress but then
seen on a different a different problem
there is also you know a number of
initiatives that have recently started
again from the US government like the
Department of Homeland Security recently
maybe a couple years ago or now almost
pushed is predicting ish ative so really
a repository where data will be
protected and shared so creating an
infrastructure for data sharing there is
a facebook that actually launched a
threat exchange which news websites like
the register quickly a call
the social networks of CIA sauce which
are very simple tools and there is also
others like warm butter to Chris that
allow CIA Souls and security
professionals to share information about
rates there's also for profit
organizations like the red sky sky
alliance which actually you know kind of
facilitates all the legal aspects for
organizations to come together sign
non-disclosure agreements and make you
shake terms of theta shape so
unfortunately these initiatives are
faced with a number of problems you know
the first one that comes comes into mind
from you know privacy researcher on a
view is is actually privacy and
confidentiality said even if even if
this information only relates about
threats and the task it can actually
expose sensitive or confidential
information for instance you know by
looking and how a service provider is in
fact you could maybe understand who
their customers are or what kind of
systems are running maybe learn some
information about you know the customers
vulnerabilities and and so on there's
also kind of liability issues since that
I can maybe find out that my university
took them two years to fix the heart
blade but and it could be actually old
accountable for that when you talk to
see aerosols you notice also the other
kind of concerns like trust the fact
that you know these organizations don't
really trust each other and so what
happens is they they have to resort to
its kind of red sky online ants
initiative where such an you establish a
circle of trust where you promised each
other not to share information on side
the circle trust where you have all sort
of legal protection and these obviously
hinders economy of scale and speediness
because by the time you you put this
mechanism in place the data is obsolete
there's also competitive concerns i so
how you know the organizations that are
maybe the same sector you know maybe
they don't really want to
which one anyway so hard our giant idea
in sixth or how we can enable
collaborating track medication following
a control data sharing approach again
it's sort of a loaded term and but I
hope that it will become clear in a few
slides so we're essentially we want to
follow a data minimization approach
where you know we seek middle ground
between sharing everything's
organizations they come together they
hug each other and share all the data
that they have or share nothing which
are essentially the two approaches that
we have available right now all right so
and more more precisely we like to
design tools that help or these
organizations make informed decisions so
whether or not to share whether or not
to collaborate and you know in case they
decide to do so what exactly to share
and how much and so the idea will be
ready to guide this decision based on
some estimate that this will actually be
useful and we could actually try and
model for the usefulness and the risks
of you know is causing data all these
liability competitive concerns and so so
this is sort of like a generic generic
intuition but we'll actually explore
this intuition as I said in a very
specific use case which is collaborative
predictive like placing so prolific
blacklisting is really just simple
essentially machine learning algorithm
that will allow you to forecast attack
sources based on a model that you
trained using the past right so
collaboration in the setting means that
you know you you perform these forecasts
who perform this prediction based not
only on your on your past not only only
on your logs but also on that on those
that you get from other
ganization right so anything is actually
something that it happens already today
there are some volunteer run initiatives
like this shield where small
organizations and universities
contribute lot about attacks they're
usually logs derived by from from
intrusion detection systems they implode
it to to a repository called the shield
for instance and the initial server will
compute this prediction for you so by
based on all these aggregate marks okay
so how we we want to go about it is as I
mentioned we want to you know follow a
data minimization approach where we
shouldn't share information if she's not
going to be useful so what we need to do
is the first step is provide
organizations with tools to estimate the
benefit of shape and the second second
step would be okay based on this
estimate now let's establish partnership
let's say we have a probable cause we
have some some indication that is going
to be useful for us to share so we
should okay and it's kind of our last
step okay naturally we we need to do
this well it's a sailing with privacy
otherwise there will be no point all
right so we need to provide tools to
estimates the benefit of shark sharing
without actually disclosing then the
entire play the same otherwise that
would be really no point in doing that
in the first place and this is going to
be one of the key challenges that we're
going to to address and if the other one
is also like you know once we we have a
sense that he's going to be useful for
us to partner and we do establish a
partnership what we actually going to
share okay so we need to provide tools
that allow us to share only what's
intended to and
what's useful so now let's let's zoom in
and try to understand a little bit
better or you're trying to do it so the
first step in said is estimating the
benefits so are the question from a
research point of view is how do we do
that how do we estimate what what are
good indicators what kind of matrix we
can run to understand whether or not
sharing would be beneficial okay so you
know just common things that you could
think of okay maybe if we have a lot of
attackers in common probably you know
that would be useful if we collaborate
or we are typed in similar ways or our
attacks are correlated with each other
maybe this is a good indication that
sharing information would be useful for
us so we are going to experiment with
with with all these approaches and see
what happens so the second step is how
do i get to questions as in yeah so my
question is like this general framework
of deciding when to share information
it's also useful in business ethics
potentially more like Google and
Facebook may decide that they sometimes
want to share some of the information
and when to figure that out and do look
at that as well not really at this point
but so we are working on other
applications as well and actually I
think there is a whole area to be
explored here that kind of take into
account also game theoretical approaches
like making a decision based on you know
cost utility so here we focus more on
understanding how to to estimate the
utility of sharing but not really how to
model these decisions so that's
so I have more basic question when you
say that suppose two parties that have a
large number of attackers in your
comments then what would without to
benefit of sharing the data from both
sides say because there how much
additional information is each of your
party gaining so this is the knowledge
of the machine learning algorithm very
is going to do the protection so you
know maybe you have seen an attack only
a couple of times and the machine
learning algorithm I'm oversimplifying
the algorithm will not think that these
attacker is going to attack your game
okay see you yes yes exactly you
probably come clear when i show how we
do the prediction yeah so the second
step is you know once they say i have
and possible partners that i can
collaborate with how do I choose which
one actually to establish a partnership
with like again based on on these
benefits but what kind of strategies are
better to a best to go about it so we
don't really consider it is in this work
but you know you could think of let's
say if I have any possible partners I
will try and partner with the top k
where top is defined as you know against
the output of the benefit estimation or
you could try it to say okay if the
benefit estimated benefit is above a
certain threshold then I establish some
partnership or maybe I can follow a hot
pic approach so we don't consider dating
in this work also because you know the
vanity destination is not very
symmetrical right so you know I might
have a really good increase in
prediction accuracy by sharing with
Marcos but Marco or not so this is
another an open problem that again as I
said it's going to be evaluated in some
sort of game theoretic approach so the
third step which we do consider is once
we partnered off so we have to say two
or more organizations
share information with each other what
should they share should they shared
everything for just what they have in
common or you know again should they
share information only about attacks
also some metadata so if I've seen an
attack should I just tell you the IP
address of this of this attacker or also
you know time port number protocol and
other things and again we'll experiment
with witnesses so how cool in a nutshell
is to test the improvement in a predict
in the prediction accuracy thanks to
this control data share so you know as I
said wolf will try and and see how much
control data sharing makes us improve
compared to not share everything and
also compared to share to share
everything so before we switch here and
we actually present the results of our
experiment let me introduce some some
basic condition so we'll consider a
network of n entities and each entity I
holds the data set SI of suspicious
events so these are events in the form
of russ IP address time and port number
as observed by a firewall on an
intrusion detection system and we do
this because that's the data that we get
so we will experiment as i said with
these different different applications
right so in order to estimate benefits
will experiment with metrics like the
size of the intersection so how many
thoughts this entity I and Anthony J hat
or the similarity of this data set like
Pearson cosine similarity and so on so
now based on the output of this
estimation the net ities will decide
whether or not to partner up as I
mentioned so I don't know why this
became became a bug but this
it was just a stop sign okay so you can
decide whether or not to share whether
or not to partner up and then you can
actually share so you merge your data
set you could you know I don't merge
everything so you get the union of the
two data sets or you just share what you
have in common so just intersectional
now as I mentioned we actually want to
do this in a privacy-preserving way so
you know the fact I I should be able to
estimate these benefits without
revealing the data sets itself otherwise
what's the point and you know likely a
number of people who have done a lot of
work in secure competition so there is a
there are many ways to to actually run
all these all these functions here in a
privacy-preserving way which means
without revealing the data itself but
just reading the output of the function
right so there are interesting a lot of
progressing in this area both using
general two-party computation like garba
circuits or via specialized protocols so
I may be the focus of our word but you
know just we need to know that these
things exist and are efficient I'm going
to give you some back-of-the-envelope
estimation of how long will it take to
run these protocols at the end at the
end of the top so oh we can do that and
we can also support this kind of privacy
preserving data sharing so if I only
want to share the intersection of these
datasets I can do that there is a
protocol for that i can use garble
circles if I also want to share like
kind of the manor the manor data they
associated data so not only their pieces
are in common but also at what times
they they appear in my logs will pour SE
attack I can do that again in the
privacy preserving way ok so i want to
share everything then ok there is no
privacy but i just add this line in
stable because we are going to
experiment that what's the difference in
terms of the prediction accuracy between
sharing everything and just sharing
piece into
ok so now let's say what we've done
really so far it's just introduction so
we're going to use a real data set which
we obtained by DeShields I mentioned
this service before it's a it's a
bowline monetary-based run a framework
we're sorry sir / 4 different
organizations mostly small businesses
and universities or just regular people
contribute data in this port ok so the
detailed data set is actually publicly
available you just have to sign up and
then you can actually crawl it they will
give you entries in this form so you get
an anonymized information for the target
so essentially is the the organization
and contributed that entry and I think
this is an H Mac of the IP address of of
the big games on the contributor ok so
this is a this is a channel name which
is actually constant so you can link
different contributions by the same time
is it just use some secret salt I'm
sorry as it use a secret salt oh I don't
know ok then you get the IP address soft
talker so the source the source of data
the target port the protocol is we
actually don't look at the protocol but
you can get it and date and time so we
close this data for about two months so
and we and we obtain about two billion
tax so to be known entries in kind of in
this table we have 16 million unique
attackers and a hundred thousand unique
targets and on average we we observe
about 200 attacks per day per turn yes
posters from a legitimate okay I'm sorry
how do you know the Fosters from a
little no we don't know we can't really
can't really guarantee but there's been
some prior work using this data looking
at this data measuring this data and you
know if you filter out and we do filter
a little bit of noise this is you know
you can fairly assume that that's
legitimate sort of legitimate son so it
could be abused for denial of service
attacks and you try to convince each
year yeah yeah you might stop the sir
yeah you good yeah but um I mean that's
how we need that the goal of our over
work so we don't really want to design a
canoe anomaly detection are pretty
prediction we just want to measure the
difference between you know just kind of
control they are sharing versus sharing
everything and person sharing nothing
yeah so it's a little bit hard for us to
get data from like service providers you
need to get it from multiple sources so
it's kind of interesting I mean without
mentioning any particular company but
you know some company actually had
agreed to give us data but you know we
had we need to get data for multiple
companies in order for this to work and
why they hurt it the work that we were
going to merge data with other companies
as I know hi okay anyway so okay this is
like a large chunk of data that we get
and just to give you a visual
visualization of off like some basic
statistics so we as I said two months or
60 days as you can see the number of
attacks them that are connected by the
shield's kind of fluctuates a lot so we
have some days where there's not too
many and some other days where it is
probably in denial of service attack
going on and we have a spike here okay
so we have to somewhat clean this data
first in order to to use it so we among
other things we do other things
following private work mostly the
kind of cleaning the process that we do
is to remove targets that report data on
you for one day so we get everything
older we discard all these entries for
which you have a target reporting on in
one day and we go actually from another
time targets to almost 200,000 times
then what we're going to do who is gonna
going to select uniformly at random
115,000 times so thousand different
using google select a hundred different
was likely victims using the thousand
randomizer asians and from these 100 big
things we are going to experiment with
our dear sharing approach and measure
measure the protection so we remember i
said there is a network of n NT days so
now M equals 100 in the set and we are
going to experiment in a pairwise
setting on all of these tools right so
what I mean is we're going to drive the
sharing approach using different
benefits estimations so size of the
intersection Chuck personality cosines
me right and so on and then we are so as
I said we don't really experiment with
different partners election strategies
we always select the top 50 pairs out of
the 4950 possible players based on the
benefit destination so we use the output
of those of that function directly as
the way to establish a partnership okay
so we'll always select the top 50 so
okay and then we also experiment with
different merging strategies like
training the union or the intersect any
questions so how do you feel mr.
symmetry in definite benefit way Don's
yeah so I'm so happy we assume that even
if it's not beneficial for me I will
share with you
it's an efficient for you yes we do that
okay so and as I mentioned you know we
actually we see that this data is in
line with other like leasing and anomaly
detection work that has been done before
also another data sets I'll just issue
so you can see that you can observe
essentially to two phenomena so on here
on the x-axis we put the targets and the
y-axis we would sources so these are the
big teams these are the attackers as you
can see there are like some really clear
or example mines which means that are
like attackers that attack everybody
nice photos are usually like target
scanners they try and attack for
everybody and you also see some vertical
lines which means that there are some
targets that are essentially attacked by
a lot of other topics which probably
means there is a botnet or denial of
service going on to on the study and
these actually we are serving constantly
for different wigs but you as you can
see they're kind of different so they're
they're different species okay so there
if you we actually got me excited we did
a bunch of measurements so if you you
can read in the paper more information
about that also kind of to have some
some idea what was going on that helps
us actually understand how the different
strategies change because of the theme
ok so now one more thing that I have to
to explain to you how we do the
prediction there are many possible ways
where you can actually predict future
attacks based on the past by the state
of the art seem to be design of our
research essentially a simple time
series approach and exponentially
weighted moving average where you look
at the past so we look at the past five
days and we're going to
to try and predict the 16 okay and so
the time series is quite simple the way
you do it again it's a spiritually
weighted moving average so I know don't
want to go too much the details of this
but quite simple there is a couple of
things that I want to point out the
first one is that in this time series
prediction you have a smoothing
coefficient like a weight factor
Alphonse the number from 0 to 1 which
actually affect the output of the other
position so we're going to experiment
with these legs you know empirically but
you know what how how do we set is this
data and so these parameter as I said it
depends on on our data but if you
essentially if you put it close to zero
at 0.1 means that you gave a lot of
memory to your algorithm if you put its
0.9 inside your discarding
everything that is not very recent okay
so now this is the the vector of attacks
that you're going to use to perform the
prediction and these are sharing effects
this so if you do your bit the
prediction only based on your own lock
then the specter only has this you're on
your own lost if you do the sharing then
you augment this vector also with
partners mobs and that's what we're
going to experiment so as I said we have
to set this value of alpha I don't want
to spend too much time but this is in
line with prior work you can see on the
y-axis here the average some of true
positives so the average some across all
victims of correct predictions as you
can see it kind of reaches a stage stage
of you know about 0.5 so I think a good
signing for for offside 0.5 so you know
you look at the past but you give it you
know you look the far past as will have
a little bit less weight than the farm
the recent positive ok so now first
first set of yourself we're going to
look at how the prediction is affected
by the different benefit estimation
strategies ok so as I said we always
going to consider the top 50 pairs and
so here we take a cut of a conservative
approach and we say okay we top 50 pairs
I'm going to share only the intersection
with the associated data so i'm not sure
everything just information about common
attacks it doesn't change much actually
this graph when you put the union so
this graph tells us was the average some
of true positives so there are some of
correct predictions so the blue line is
the baseline which is you know no no
sharing you do it by yourself and then
we look at different strategies so you
can see the top line is a green line is
the intersection size so it turns out
that you you improve the accuracy of
your decision if you share based on how
many attacks you have income and this is
kind of very conservative approach you
know it's only sure what you have in
common on the top 50 pairs one percent
of all possible pairs but you know this
kind of shows us something especially
when you compare with the different
strategies personally I would have said
seem adoringly who wore it better or
correlation but it turns out that's how
do we know if short to most people not
oh ok yeah because the D shield did I
said we use it also as a kind of ground
truth day so if it's reported on the
sixth day as an attacker then we say
okay we we did the prediction correct so
the same we look we look at the five
days and then we try to predict the next
day we do this for a week so we have
kind of a movie moving if you look at
false positives yes so there's a couple
slack so
just to zoom in on improvement so here
we define improvement as the number of
correct prediction minus the number of
minus the number of okay sir the number
of correct predictions using sharing
minus the number of correct prediction
without sharing over the number of
correct or correct prediction without
shape so as you can see on average we we
always improve assuring and sometimes we
improve like seven eight times sometimes
we don't prove right and so the other
interesting thing to notice is that you
nobody by driving the collaboration we
are these different benefit estimation
metrics you end up selecting different
partners like so because we always
select these top 50 pairs you know what
happens is then you know you can have
very different entities in these pairs
or less different pair so we kind of
have this concept of polishing sighs I
wanna spend too much time but this kind
of helps us explain in the paper also
why we think the different metrics
behave differently mostly is that in the
way we do the prediction here by adding
more more views about the specific
attacks will actually help us predict
better because we cannot reinforce the
knowledge about something that was in
our top okay okay so anything fact we
actually try to to to look at the
correlation between the number of events
which are on the x-axis in log scale so
the events known known by by targets
known by victims and their ability to
predict to predict attacks right so okay
or curve shows a linear regression but
essentially we can we can say that there
is a high correlation between knowing
more and being more successful at
attacks so I mean that kind of explains
a little bit which is kind of
encouraging and from our point of view
they say okay look we're doing something
very simple we are not optimizing much
how to actually do the prediction how to
form partnerships but in reality we can
we can say that the more you know about
the thoughts then better you predict so
on the other hand you can expect yeah
but what about false positives I maybe
the more you know the more mistakes you
make so what we do is to look at the
false positive rates and compare it to
the true positive rate so who's first
positive rate is the number of false
positives over the number of false
positives plus the number of true
negatives and the true positive rate is
the number of true positives over the
number of true positives plus force name
so in theory you like everything to be
on the upper left corner so you want
smoke false positive rates very high
true positive rate right okay so this
graph is maybe it's not the best class
I've ever thrown but as you can say the
baseline we have it about here okay and
the sharing approach actually we have it
on the left of this baseline which means
that our false positive rates actually
go stop at one of the true positive goes
goes high okay so of a little bit but
that's encouraging right which means
that actually sharing helps up helps me
make less mistakes fewer mistakes all
right because actually now I can I have
better knowledge again this is a first
result can be way of demise and it's
encouraging yes
so it's okay but your true positive rate
is point zero nine it's still say lesser
than your post positively just like
point to yes so how useful is yeah
that's a okay so then this is a common
to essentially all this predictive like
pissing okay so when you when you try to
sue to predate and you put something in
a black lace you don't actually block
all traffic right so you you essentially
I would say the better term for this
will be greatly seen since if you have
an IP address then maybe as a firewall
you only allow outgoing connections not
incoming connections so even if you have
like sort of a high false positive
positive praise doesn't mean that you
know your provider will stop working you
know means that you are going to
scrutinize a little bit more I being
like connections from those IP addresses
so prediction will will have a high
false positive rate that's for sure so
how exactly do you determine a false
positive so is it so just to predict
imma take for the 16 it doesn't occur or
yeah so first budget for us is if we
make a prediction that is going to
appear again in the dishes log for that
painting and if he doesn't appear that
that such as possible you also fix it
only on the sixth day during for the
true positive or yeah okay okay so the
other the other plots that I want to
show here is this box box box of number
of events known by my collaborators so a
number of of the event said you know its
partner see and so you can see again we
just compare a different structure that
the different strategies and
intersection sighs you know gives us a
better like you kind of know a little
bit more about attacks so you kind of
expand expand your view so these are
helps us I mean actually help us clarify
why Tucker similarity doesn't work very
well because he actually done enhance
your knowledge that much okay so the
other there are the last thing left to
experiment is does the merging strategy
so what you actually so here we
again experiment with the different
benefit destination we get the top 50
pairs and then we'll look at the average
improvement sharing everything so the
union or sharing only only the
intersection right so we're intersection
sighs we lose but a little bit not much
for the other but the other side's you
actually gain so means that you know
sharing everything kind of confuses the
algorithm even more so we were feted off
actually sharing only the subset on
sharing only the intersection again this
is sort of encouraging for us because in
the instruction we don't need to share
everything we just need to share what's
useful okay what we have in common seems
to enhance our our prediction ok so i
promised i would give like some
back-of-the-envelope calculation how
long would it would this take if we use
this privacy enhancing technologies so
mostly we looked at ways to compute the
intersection and the size of the
intersection what we really need and so
when our protocols are very very fast so
we can do in one second we can do
private set intersection with 1,000
items so one 1000 1000 mah x 0 ng
commodity hardware ok so you know even
if you again in or saying you have a
hundred entities so you might in this
pairwise setting when we open reading at
the moment you need to interact with 99
other organizations so you know even if
you do you can
you know you can complete the whole
interaction in you know 100 seconds
let's send to less than two minutes so
you know considering that you you will
run these protocols every once a day
it's not that bad so it's a reasonable
performance we can actually operate in
real time even more than what something
okay so it's a conclusion you know the
kind of lesson said that we can take
from it's very preliminary exploration
of this problem is that knowing more
means predicting more so sharing is a
good thing but we don't have to really
share everything actually in some cases
sharing only common attackers it's
almost as good as sharing everything and
I you know I can only share with
organizations that have this common
attackers with me and I can find out
whether organizations have common at
Doctors Without Really disclosing my
data using this protocol site is that
intersection carpal circles and as I
said controlling control data sharing
also reduces a little bit but it does
reduce the for spotty positive rates and
so you know other kind of potential use
cases of this way we are considering now
is I can ever say so if you know these
strategies could help different
organization collaborate and perform
research you know 4dr interactions
treatment plans discovering new diseases
and other things courses online finance
marketing so you can track transactions
across different institutions you can
you know gather more information
collaborative marketing so on we're
working with in transport as well like
how we manage to share information about
different transportation means also you
know in the government and
and other things but those are just just
ideas to the way we are exploding okay
so this concludes my talk if you have
any questions be really happy too so how
do you determine what data you really
need to share oh you just said that I've
collection shared everything what ok
let's but how do you determine right so
I mean it depends on my current answer
is that it depends on the application
right so in the in this like predicting
blacklisting turns out that we
discovered that what we really need to
share is common information about common
attacks that's that's kind of like the
takeaway of this of this work so i need
to find organizations that are attacked
by the same attackers and i should share
information about these attacks this
helps us a lot almost as much as you
know sharing everything with everybody
so but the situation needs to be
provided from the result of this post
end yeah so yeah exactly so I first we
count how many attacks we have in common
if thats that's a lot I mean I'm
oversimplifying then we shared that like
not just the count but actually what are
these attacks that we have it go so you
see you look let me guess you your based
on was gonna only using late local data
yeah also look at the other extreme
value yeah we'll just is everyone so
where's this video so we are kind of in
the middle between the two things yeah
so in the paper we have bought a bunch
of other crumbs yeah but I mean it's
also good I mean there's also like
another line of work is in optimizing
the prediction itself right now we're
just using what what this shield has
been used
so they actually do days plus some
cluster I have to get data from from
different entities they clustered them
together using KNN based approach and
then they do this prediction time series
prediction on on the cluster that's what
it my name is setting where you actually
don't need the cluster maybe this
algorithm is not the best actually right
so we could do even better the
prediction we're in a way you also do a
cluster no you take 50 yeah yeah we lose
some kind of money off my cousin yeah
sure but so yeah as I said before we're
actually looking at other approaches
like it's we using random forests it's a
little bit more expensive competition
you to run but we have some some good
preliminary results okay we need to
change a little bit the strategy you
know random 4 is actually a
classification prom right so we need to
to turn around the prediction and make
it like classification so you know you
have an IP address and you try to
classify is this going to attack me or
not so it's a little bit different in
the Washington my colleagues are much
more expert than me hope this is benefit
like a no decision whether you should
share me
so for the way the prediction is done we
need what we really need in terms of
metadata is the time when like your
partner has seen this attack because you
know if he had seen it like a little bit
further in the past the way that
especially when an average will actually
make it count less than if you had seen
it more recently for the second source
which in the comp in the number of
intersection will not affect the
decision I'm sorry I need anything I
mean so the decision that will make from
this benefit measures is whether to
share the love yeah it's not the
official Metallica ya know which just
experiment yeah wait what you should so
hopefully this mechanistic approach in
general so as an attacker I can reset my
router negative new IP address and this
is what you used to register I'm thanks
again so there's an attacker I can
restore my Road and I wouldn't get a new
IP address so I yeah so that's a you
store or whatever so yeah so that will
work for you know targeted attacks
alright but on you know on large-scale
attackers for large-scale attacks that
it's not really the case so it would
cost you two to get a new IP address
right and that's you know what old
researching like anomaly detection
intrusion detection always count on so
these algorithms are public right so you
can try attacker school in theory the v8
so that you know your prediction doesn't
catch him anymore or as he said it can
change the IP address but it will cost
them money so they you know some will do
but the majority of them won't because
they don't have I mean I didn't have the
resources or them will cost too much
then the attack itself will not make
sense anymore but yeah that's a that's a
common for all
and you so for example it might be
useful if you had more information on
the IP addresses so that you could
likely soul IP subnet sup lights or
something but yeah you cannot do with
this data because of the hashing all
right so no the hashing is done on the
big game side not on the other side
right so the checker p is really visible
yeah it is so actually we thought about
it and we decided not to do it because
from prior work it seems that you don't
really have to it seems like you know
just for instance besiktas subnet
doesn't help you that much so actually I
mean it does but then it also increases
false positives around right so usually
when you have seen from the papers from
which on which we build on we just
follow their approach down to consider
something any more questions so se
manana will be around I don't know how
but when is your time I don't know I
haven't 3 insider so i can say every
evening if you want to talk it's on the
fourth floor thank you thanks for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
