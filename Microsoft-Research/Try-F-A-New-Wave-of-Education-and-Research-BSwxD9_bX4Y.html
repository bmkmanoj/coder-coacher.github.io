F sharp in the browser it lowers the
barrier to entry to a shop for an
outstanding in browser coding experience
how we do that by making it available
over a wide range of platforms which do
not require to download the visual
studio this new version of try sharp is
really an evolution to keep in step with
the latest version of F shop 3.0 what we
wanted to do here is to bring these new
experiences we did that through
tutorials across multiple domains and we
also brought many of the relevant type
providers that attract 3.0 brings and we
brought those into the browser-based
experience those tutorials are
highlighting features that are solving
two things one is the real word analytic
called programming problems things
financial world and the other one thing
the information which space where we are
today things data science right so you
can learn all these great features and
now actually you can actually create
some of your code and take this code
that you created to share it with others
software lies at the heart of our
connected economy it's an essential
component
virtually every business system every
business transaction now depends upon
the software systems and our ability to
affect business depends on our ability
to build complex software
infrastructures in UCL were actually
interested in making the bridge between
the foundations of computer science and
its practice and actually functional
programming is an excellent vehicle for
doing precisely that the game has
changed now and development in
functional programming of which f-sharp
is an exemplar how actually meant that
functional program has become a
practical vehicle for tackling complex
problems the tutorials in try off sharp
allow organizations such as University
College London to teach their students
and gives them examples of real-world
problems in the financial world F sharp
is used extensively and the tutorials
provided in the tryout website means
students can get their hands on
real-world examples and see how they're
applied at UCL we have developed
programs in cooperation with the
financial industry you think try F sharp
the students are able to learn and
progress quickly all in a web-based
user-friendly vertical development
environment
the research I pursue is really looking
at how to bring together more
information on the web nowadays more and
more what's coming to the web is in the
form of data rather than documents
f-sharp is a functional language by
design and one of the things that's nice
about try f-sharp is it gives us access
to that very strong and very elegant
programming metaphor in a way that's
accessible all the way from
undergraduate level for learning to
graduate level for using in our research
try of Sharpe really lets us pull
together some things that are really
important to us especially as people
working with big data on the web one of
course is that because I can run it in
my browser I'm not looking at many
different kinds of programming
environments and having to teach many
two things I'm using it within a context
that people are used to to when I'm
going for all these different kinds of
data I want to pull them together to
something that's comfortable on my
desktop that talks to all my
applications and all my desktop tools
and try F sharp gives me some of that
ability and finally try sharp makes me
part of the community I'm able to share
libraries I'm able to publish things
that other people can use as my students
build tools that make the Semantic Web
accessible through through the try of
Sharpe system other people will be able
to use those without needing to know all
the details of my research so the
community can really grow new and
exciting things at the kind of speed we
need to keep up with development on the
world wide web so what's the next
frontier for I shop it's really to help
bridge the gap between developers and
data scientists and information rich
spaces so now that we've launched the
traction platform it's open its press
platform goes across domains we are
really looking to the community to
further extend
so to summarize we'd like developers and
data scientists to use stripe shop to
seamlessly this
access analyze and visualize big and
broad data
