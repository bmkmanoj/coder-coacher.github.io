my name is Victor grof and these are the
students in my land in my lab that are
co-authoring this this paper I'll talk
about the research effort they are going
on in my lab on high resolution and
real-time spectrum polarization imaging
sensing so it's a very multidisciplinary
effort going from nano fabrications
optics with a lot of custom imager
sensor design to the algorithms and so
forth so just before we get into the
detail of some of the sensors that I'll
talk about it let's just take a look at
it the review the polarization of light
most of the talks that we've heard this
last couple of days you treat light is a
is a ray we have to look at it think of
light as a as a wave as a
electromagnetic wave and just kind of a
review a electromagnetic wave is
basically propagating or a transverse
electromagnetic wave is composed of two
orthogonal waves x and y they are
propagating in space and time towards so
whatever that fray you were thinking
about your ray tracing program now think
of it that there is actually a wave
super important that particular ray when
we're talking about ways there are three
fundamental properties that is the
intensity the wavelength and
polarization the first two are basically
encoded as brightness and color by our
visual system and by the imaging sensors
the actual polarization which is the the
difference between the phase the shown
here fee x n py it gives rise to
polarization so if you think of it as
light propagates storage this Raider was
traveling towards in space could be
unpolarized which means the phase
difference is zero so there's no
particular kind of oscillations in this
out of this wave or it could be somewhat
polarized in the middle case life could
be linearly polarized with phase
difference of zero and in the later case
is what I called this is probably the
more generic polarization signatures in
nature where like this near a polarizer
linearly polarize s ort of in between or
call called partially polarized or
elliptically polarized and if you
project this part
from from space into your XY plane which
is coming in a second able to see that
the linearly polarized light the middle
one describes a line as it travels
through space versus the partially
polarized light it describes in the lips
so that's why elliptically polarized
light is commonly referred to partially
polarized light and random sort of you
get these random projections now if you
want to learn something about
polarization capture polarization we
want to be able to describe this ellipse
and we want to describe it in terms of
what is this major axis what we call it
angle of polarization and what is the
ratio between the major and minor axis
which is known as a degree of linear
polarization now I represented these two
quantities in terms of this stocks
parameter so we can think of them as
sort of your temporary variables and the
way you can compute your stocks
parameters is by capturing the scene
with four linearly polarized light in
the linear polarization filters in other
words I need to know what is the scene
what is the light as I filter it through
a zero Degree polarization filter 90
45-45 and then I can tell you everything
about polarization in a nutshell you
need to sample your life filled with
minimum of four polarization filters to
be able to see something about
polarization and this is what how people
have actually capture polarization using
division of time you rotate theater a
polarization filter or a retarder in
front of your camera Co multiplexing
time it's a pretty straightforward
except you have to be very much aware
that any wobbling that can happen in
your rotation will actually cause
serious polarization errors A one A one
arcsecond wobbling if your rotational
retarder can cause about one percent
error in your polarization measurement
it could be somewhat random if you don't
know about 20 years ago or 15 years ago
people came up with this division of
aperture and where you put your
polarization filters right at the
aperture of your sensor so you put
multiple microlenses and polarization
filters to be able to capture
polarization properties and people have
been doing this thing for the visible
spectrum through the mid with IR and a
spectrum there a couple of other methods
in my lab where we kind of start working
on the sensor we said well there is
actually a great parallel from the stoop
previous method how color sensor have
actually evolved over time division of
Time amplitude aperture and software
essentially 1976 the bear pattern came
around where you integrate your color
filters to green red and blue on top of
a imaging array and gives you a really
compact robust color sensor and this is
what we use predominantly today and this
is sort of the challenge that we set
ourselves and said can we actually
create a similar sensor that would
actually incorporate these polarization
filters in directly on top of each
pixels and one of the main challenges
has been fabricating reliably this
polarization filter a polarization
filter is nothing more than a fence
bunch of lines that are in parallel
except if you want to sense polarization
light in the visible spectrum this fence
has to be on the order of nanometers
luckily none of abrogation and
technology has kind of caught up and
allow us to fabricate some really small
structures today so we've been able to
use interference lithography in our lab
to fabricate this aluminum and other
metallic wires gold silver at about 70
nanometers going down to 20 nanometers
lately and we can orient them in random
orientation and this is sort of a
scanning electron microscope of the
structure that sits directly on top of
our pixels in our imaging sensors if you
look at under an optical microscope our
camera has a new shine 0 degree
polarized light you can see that the
zero Degree pixels are transparent 90
degrees block light as they should
because polarization theory tells us
they should block orthogonal array
polarized light so it's been kind of a
lot of challenges of how to integrate
this nanotechnology nanostructures
directly on the single sensor this is
something that we've worked quite a bit
in the last couple of years of
monolithic integration of various
nanostructures and we're not just bound
to this lines we've actually
experimenting with different holes
across this and so forth to get you in
spectral or additional filtering on per
pixel base the nice thing about it is
now we have this high resolution
megapixel 2 and 4 megapixel right now
pixel size of 7 microns and sensitivity
throughout the whole
spectrum and it's monolithically
integrated so one thing is you are
capturing polarization information that
every frame which it's not the case with
time division polarization imaging
sensors and it's very robust sensor
we've used the sensors from underwater
to putting it on balloons and it still
gives us a very good polarization
properties through here there's just
kind of an example we didn't have a
chance to see the demo this morning this
is our little trusty horse that's the
made out of plastic every time you have
a reflection light will become polarized
and it does depend the degree of
polarization so what you see in here is
the intensity image and on purpose we've
chose a scene where you cannot discern
very much the shape of this object very
much the middle the top right image is
the degree of polarization meaning how
much like this polarize dark means
there's no polarization information
bright means is highly polarized this
target so we are rotating a our
polarization Macbeth's chart different
linear polarization filters to kind of
tell us yes we are supposed to get
highly degree of polarization and the
angle of this filters are are these
filters oriented a different angle so
you get different colors we are mapping
angle of polarization to color meaning
red means light is oscillating
horizontally that ray disc entering the
scene is oscillating parallel to your
imaging sensor or blue quill be
something that's orthogonal it's or
anything and again both from the
grayscale image which are the kind of
two different sets of images that we are
capturing from the angle of polarization
you can see actually are capturing the
surface normal information from the
sensor using at every single frame
essentially you're captured without
playing too much with the lighting
conditions and you're getting reliable
information even down to few photons
something that you don't even capture
very well a difference between your
target and the in the background so
people have looked at it 3d shape
reconstruction based on polarization in
CPR community using division of time
multiplexing polarization cameras now I
think there's sort of an interesting
opportunity where at every frame
essentially you're capturing
polarization can you couple it with the
fact that you are can be tracking an
object and
same time recovering it its shape and it
will post some very interesting computer
vision challenges as well now this was
about a couple of years ago and we sort
of stopped there and said well you know
you have your color sensors they are
capturing some you know this is what
most of the time we are kind of used to
looking at information and we've been
kind of dive into the polarization world
but this sensor is actually oblivious to
color like how do we actually add color
and polarization in the same at the same
time so we use actually let's get skip
to the next slide we looked at some
various imaging techniques and there's a
basic physical principle that says
different wavelengths will penetrate
materials at different depths in other
words if I have blue light majority of
my life 99% of my photons that impinge
on my photo detector will get absorbed
in about two microns in my photo
detectors red light actually penetrates
much deeper into your silica all right
then there are actually some problems by
where the reason it penetrates also deep
into your into your silicon versus green
light majority will actually get the
bezoar about 67 microns so if you
actually place vertically stacked photo
detectors the different depths at half a
micron micron to two microns you can
actually start discerning what kind of
wavelengths you're getting so we sort of
fabricated our own seamless technology
we use commercial technology as well
from fobian and essentially on top of
this vertically stacked photo detectors
we've deposit these nanowires so each
pixel this 0 degree pixel actually is
able to sense red green and blue
actually even more spectrums but we
typically limit ourselves to red green
and blue and the same is the case for
this neighborhood of two by two pixels
so now you're getting your color
information at every pixel and you look
at polarization information on the super
pixel the resolution that we the first
generation is a VGA format running at
about 25 frames per second we've moved
to a 2 megapixel there's a lot of data
that comes out of this sensor so getting
this data into your computer is somewhat
of a challenging task so 2 megapixel at
40 frames per second we're sort of
limiting a dual-band camera link
interface this is some of our images
that we are able to obtain a relatively
recently it's our color image sensor
Macbeth char the colors are still not
the sharpest they do they do require a
lot of nonlinear image processing and
you'll see why in a second up here we're
actually presenting degree of linear
polarization so we have our linear
polarization filters that do exhibit
high degree of polarization so therefore
they are red and down here actually you
can see them different colors because
they actually reflect like this
oscillating at different angles so we
are capturing both angle and degree of
polarization the ink endemic vest chart
actually polarized is light and
depending what kind of think they
actually use to fabricate it you get
different degrees of polarization which
is kind of a known fact different
degrees of polarization give you this
part this is the spectral response of
the camera you're getting red green and
blue or red ring nebula relatively broad
band and this is where it requires a lot
of challenging signal processing to
shape it up to look to get good polar is
a good color information and up here
it's actually the polarization
information from a neighborhood of
pixels as we are changing the incident
angle of polarization I just have one
kind of comment on the on the processing
it's actually a lot of interesting
problems are coming out of this sensor
it is a unique sensor it is sort of
resembles bear pattern but it does
possess its own image processing
challenges so you could port calibration
interpolation directly from color to
pull to polarization but actually
polarization is more mathematically
constrained than your colour image
processing so it does lend to some very
interesting interpolation technique that
we're exploring in our lab using
correlation based and calibration which
I think essential and we've shown
actually if you know something about the
statistics of the scene you can recover
your full resolution in this kind of
sense so you do the sum of the
resolution but with some really clever
interpolation you can actually recover
most of that resolution and lastly you
know one of the challenges in a lot of
these sensors are used remote sensing a
different community in the optics the
way we present data I think is a really
lousy way we use grayscale to present
degree of polarization that it's a
really poor man's version to present
data so I think there's some interesting
ways to present this this data so I'll
end with this slide we have
I ative kind of polarization imaging
technology ranging from vga format to
high resolution for megapixel and 30
megapixel right now on polarization and
spectral polarization it's a really
interesting field of merging these nano
technology nano structures with existing
imaging technology there's some very
interesting problems that you could be
solving by carefully engineering your
nano structure where its spectral
filters polarization or you can play
around with many different combination
of this information so with this I like
to conclude my talk you are there are
about 100 and by making this nanowire
smaller we're actually able to increase
I do think it's actually the reason we
are getting 100 is due to optical cross
talks you are mixing information the
same thing as in color thing as long as
you can properly model that I think I do
believe the official ratios are in order
of magnitude higher but you need to
understand was ring was happening in the
pixel neighborhood
we have both right I mean you can
engineer right there are some angles
that this is very problematic right
majority of it will get absorbed into
the into the wires some of it does get
the does get reflected yeah you do have
multiple reflections in there I think
that's also one of the problem there is
an anti-reflective coating it I think
it's a question I think that also causes
additional reflections I think you can
engineer this wires if you don't have
sharp edges you can actually mitigate
this problem a little bit better yes
right we have a couple different
applications we are pursuing I would
suggest to our name in the biomedical
imaging very looking into endoscopy
we've actually shown that a lesions or
add enormous in the in the column you
can actually detect it with polarization
in a wood polarization actually captures
is the index of refraction so healthy
cells versus cells that are somewhat
questionable do have different index of
refraction so it gives you a very good
screening technique you do have to
narrow your spectral range with that
application there are a couple of remote
sensing applications where you know
man-made objects pop up very nicely in
scattered environment such as fog
haziness underwater so this is kind of
complimentary I did have to say that you
know in this technology you know having
both polarization and color is key right
adding the value of polarization
polarization will give you certain
benefits in some situations so I think
you know having both of these modalities
something is crucial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
