thanks i hope so if the first demo about
cities was about integrating all kinds
of different data I think cosmos is all
about massive scale as hi Bo mentioned
the system is tens of thousands of
servers you know close to an exabyte of
data and thousands of jobs running every
day and it's just a massive system that
is a tremendous asset inside the company
so the third demo that I would like to
show you is around power bi and I'm
going to night invited on Owen who is
the leader of the program management
team for this team and this is also
partly built here in China and really
showcases how an end-user we're really
empowering end-users to slice and dice
data in new ways to show you that your
name thank you for cash and so I wanna
when we talk to customers about their
data they always talk about the struggle
they have with the velocity and the
volume and the variety and for them data
is really a key part of their business
in fact we I was in ebc REM with delta
airlines and they talked about you know
in the flight business and the friend
the struggle that then how they compete
for the price for a seat they just
cannot compete anymore on the price of a
season of light however how they can
compete is how they run their business
and how quickly they can make decisions
that impact their business because that
really will in fact they're cogs and
they gave examples like knowing when a
storm is coming and how do they plan and
for that and once the storm has hit how
do they reposition crews and airplanes
so that they can recover quickly how do
they make decisions on what price to
hedge their fuel costs on these are all
really key decisions that they want to
make with the data and that data to
drive that decision comes from a variety
of places some from with
the company and then some from outside
and and so they're just kind of and
similarly with banks they're looking at
how do I make dua dua loan this money to
the small business and they're looking
at well how do I determine whether that
business will survive and they've
learned that one of the key indicators
for them is actually thing if they've
track the packages coming to and from
via UPS they can have a better indicator
of whether that business is healthy or
not and so if they buy and use the data
from UPS they can make a decision a bank
is making a decision and whether to loan
money or not and so as we look at sort
of those new the new possibilities that
both the cloud and the accessibility of
the data and the speed at which we can
go from data to insight that is really
the framework that drove our investment
in a new offering from microsoft called
power bi so what is power bi power bi
has sort of two sides of the solution
the first one is looking at using excel
as the key tool of how you might drive
inside how you might visualize the data
how you might draw decisions from and
then another key part is how do you
actually share those insights how do you
collaborate with others we're using
sharepoint online in particular part of
office 365 and at Microsoft leave these
two incredible assets and office itself
is used by more than a billion people
and office 365 has had such phenomenal
growth one and for enterprises now are
an office 365 subscriber and so as we
built our power bi solution where we
extend that by looking at new ways to
visualize and discover data and then
share and collaborate and access that
data so with that in mind I'm going to
show you so I am I will start this by
saying I am NOT a scientist but for the
next 10 minutes I'm going to pretend to
be one and I have a hypothesis and
please don't critique my scientific
abilities here I have a hypothesis that
maybe obesity if we look at worldwide
obesity that it's strongly correlated
with them with GDP and I'm going to
extract
and say if as country's GDP grows do
they get fatter and bigger or is that an
actual correct hypothesis or not and so
with that in mind I'm going to so just
real quickly officer power bi for office
365 here is in preview you can sign up
for it and right now and and and on do a
search and power bi for office 365 and
you can learn more about it so let me go
ahead and pretend to be that scientists
what I did before this i went out and i
discovered i did some searching using
bing and i found that actually the who
the World Health Organization has
actually some really good data on
obesity and i found that you can see
here on this web page that they have a
pretty good data about it each country
what is the prevalence of obesity and
you can also see a heat map i also found
that if we want to look for gdp data I
found that Hans Rosling head in
Gapminder land or because i also got
some really good data on gdp population
size and growth so I found these I went
ahead and I downloaded some of these
this data to my laptop in case the
network connections bad i'm going to try
and do as much of this demo as possible
live so i'm going to go into exile which
would be the primary experience for most
users and you will see in excel that
there's some new tabs here and these are
the extensions for power bi so you can
see this tab called power query so the
very first thing I'm going to do power
query is a really useful tool for
getting data from different sources and
merging them together and doing some
transformations on that days as it comes
in so the very first data I'm going to
do is I've actually downloaded the
obesity data from the who website and
I'm going to actually open and that data
so I'm going to open it it's a CSV file
and you'll see here I download it and
this is the file now what happens here
is it's going to open the file and
you'll see that the data is actually
quite raw it went ahead here and it
shows all the data and now I want to do
some simple clean up of this data and
this is a wonderful thing that power
query dam has done is you can see that
actually the first row i'm just going to
make the first row a header and i
actually don't need a lot of these
columns here I just need
country and I need the obesity
percentage so I can just right click
remove those columns I'm now going to do
some more clean up on the state because
i don't need the rest of it but i do
need the value so i'm going to remove
these columns and so I see the year
actually I don't even need the year I'm
going to remove this and then the data
value oh this is actually the obesity so
i'm going to rename that so i don't get
confused obesity percent and remove
these columns and wanting i was cleaning
up the data now what's really nice about
power power query is everything that I
did our is captured in these repeatable
steps you can see if I started I started
with a source I first wrote was a header
I then removed from columns i renamed
some columns and then I remove some more
columns and so here's now the data I
think they're pretty good i'm going to
call this one I can rename this query
now this is obesity percentage and then
I can see I'm done now it's gone ahead
and it's going to process girl and the
data in excel so I can start to do some
interesting and things with this data
will just give it a second here as it
processes it and you can see now the
deed is all cleaned up and it is save
this model so if I was to come back
later and refresh it and and it will
pick up the latest data so that's
another interesting way that I could
have put the data in this is I could
actually have taken it directly from the
website and so that's another new
capability so if we go out here in the
World Health Organization i'm just going
to copy this URL you'll see this this
web page is actually pretty rich web
pages it has a lot of information but
what I really want is this table and
that's actually possible now with power
bi to very easily I just copy the web
page I hit ok you can see it's looking
here at who and the who organization and
it's going to bring in the data and it's
going to scrape that website and gonna
build a table directly from that web
page so give it a second here
so one of the things we really want to
do is realize the data comes from
everywhere and it's actually how you
merge a mash up the data is where where
the insight will come from now my hope
is that we can then see this will give
it a few seconds here
one of the beauties of live demos
okay here's the date and you can see how
it it's actually scraped it and here is
it's actually pulled up the data from
that table right from the website and
actually parted and just like before I
can do some really simple cleanups of
this data and actually get the exact
same data directly from the website and
again if when i refresh it as there that
i can get the data i acting since i
already have that i'm not going to use
that one but I'm going to discard it now
another place i'm going to show you
where we can actually do pretty
complicated transformations on the data
is i downloaded an Excel workbook from
that Gapminder site and it will had GDP
data and so let me open that up now this
data is in a form where I think a lot of
scientists how they store their data and
you can see again I have maximized this
you can see they're a little better you
can see here I have all the years where
we have BMI data by country so again I'm
going to do some just very simple see
how easy this is I'm going to that's the
first row I actually am only interested
in the last 30 years for my nice reports
i'm just going to easily delete that
delete those columns I want to remove
those and this is actually pretty
difficult to charge it in this format
because it's already been pivoted so I
have I would very simple clicks I can
unpick at the date I'm going to select
all of the columns and then i'm going to
right click and then i can unpick the
data and you can see now it's made a row
for each data so it'll make it much
easier for me to an to merge so this is
the year so i don't get confused what
values are this is BMI and oh no this is
GDP sorry per capita let me do that gdp
per capita and then this is the country
i'm going to merge this and going to
give their name to this query I gdp per
capita and i'm now done
give it a second does it transform one
of the things that power query does to
is it doesn't load all the data in fact
these tools are built for millions of
rows of data new in 2000 XL 2013 is this
new data model and the avec put focus on
making sure we can support data that's
larger than 2 million rows of data and
so that's another kind of key part so as
you're doing the model it only loads in
the first set of data so you can start
doing some of the transformations and
models and then when you hit done then
it's a it's going to actually go ahead
and start processing the data so it's
pulling this in now let's give it a
second to complete and now I'm going to
merge those two data sources remember I
got one from the CSV file I got another
one from an Excel workbook and I won't
want to put them together so that can
create a nice interesting report sorry I
did that was my fault user er I didn't
hit done and so I have now done that now
I'm going to merge those two reports and
i'll just show you how easy that is so
here i'm in power query i'm going to hit
this button here called merge i'm going
to say ok I have gdp per capita and then
I have another table which is the
obesity percentage I know that the
unique key is I want to do it by country
and then I hit OK and now it's done that
it's merge those two together and I
don't need the country name I just need
the obesity percentage i'm just going to
expand that table and now just with a
few clicks I've now got these two tables
and merged together and I'm going to hit
done
and now that data was all merged and you
know this one table had years and other
table didn't have years and it was all
very easily merged and very very simply
now another option for me to find data
is instead of me doing all that work of
finding the population the GDP the
obesity is I could have actually done a
search and within my organization and
see if anybody else had done this work
before and maybe they already is a model
that exists and if there is maybe I
could use that and have avoided all that
work that I just did so let me just go
ahead and see if anybody I'm signed into
the microsoft office 365 tenant right
now and we have this new feature called
online search and and actually this i'm
going to show you one thing just to tie
in / caches and one thing that we do
here is we have a we we have data that
we've included from the public so that
could be from data.gov or wikipedia and
we've also include data from the azure
marketplace and then we also include
data from your cooperation so for
example if we were to look at city list
of cities in china and for example as an
example of a search and when we look at
the smart city initiative we could
actually see is there any data out there
to find that the top cities and let me
go ahead here in search for a second and
then we'll do a search of the work for
me
search okay so now it's going to do a
search and we'll see what I can find
it'll search across and pop the public
data that we've indexed as well as the
adder and you can see here oh there is
data actually hear one of the nice
things i can do is i can mouse over it
and you can see a preview of what that
day it is and where do they come from so
this was actually this is a list of
cities in america and i can see this
came from an internal microsoft employee
because you can see the email down here
but you will see that there's an icon in
some cases it'll say where did it come
from some places it will be from it'll
show a w if it's from Wikipedia but let
me go back to BMI which is what I was
see if anybody within Microsoft has done
another model that I could use instead
of all the extra work i did there for
that five minutes and i do find that
somebody has actually done a model
already and i see if I can see it oh and
they did exactly they have BMI GDP and
population by country and year I was
like okay that would have actually saved
me that time so now I'm going to
actually use their model and instead and
what the power query will do is when we
share you can share up your model and to
sharepoint online as the power bi site
and then other users within the oreck
can use that model and the data it'll
preserve the relationship to the data
and it'll actually refreshed the data as
the new user the data is in store just
the model and so i'm pulling that in you
can see that it's processing now you
probably see that it's going out and
each of the sources and to pull that and
data in so this may take a little bit of
time so what I might do is let me let me
do that in the cooking program so they
let me go to the kitchen and I have one
in the oven so let me go let me go pull
that one out for a second so I have
already got i'm going to do bring up
this one and i just going to show you
now how you might visualize that data
okay
so here's an book that already now very
easily in Excel I can go in search and I
can do a Power View create a new power
view map 10 even sorry should label the
content oh ok well i have a report
already built and i am just going to
show you here using the data that exact
same table i created a report and very
very easily and it just looks at BMI by
country and one of the nice things that
it has is this play that you can look at
over time how did the day to change so
we can now test my hypothesis as GDP GDP
is here on the x-axis and BMI is on the
right and we can say over time as gdp
grew for a country do they in fact get
fatter or not and so let me go ahead and
play the data and so we can see and it
is pretty interesting to see the data
move you do see that countries are in
general am set as set of countries
aren't in getting wealthier and however
some got fatter and some did not and let
me just point out if we take a look at
the united states as an example and we
can see a clear graph that as their be
Emma as their gdp grew as GDP has grown
over the last 30 years they have indeed
obesity has risen but there are places
where that's not true and so let me if
we want to replay if we take a look at
Japan as another example let me put
replay the model and see what happens
with Japan so you can see Japan is down
here they have in these gotten richer
but they have not increased and gotten
fatter so here's our some very new
insights that we can draw from the
report so with that in mind I'm going to
switch back and and to Prakash 22 here
so I'm going to just share with you and
so what you saw here today real briefly
we saw a lot i spent a lot of time in
power query is how we can actually bring
data in and clean up the data merge data
together and i didn't show you power
pivot this is more advanced
capabilities where you can actually do
intricate and data modeling of the data
and and then i showed you power of you
how you can create a very very simple
report and local and visualize and the
data then there's a set of other
capabilities to that if we had more time
I would encourage you to go out and try
the preview QA share the models we did
see that and and behind the scenes this
is actually a pretty intricate system to
bring all of this data together oops so
um and as you can see we're around we
have stuff coming in from Windows Azure
the web because we've dated in the
marketplace internal data we're indexing
that the company data and the models
that users have created and we've got
this index and we then have IT controls
of how they can set up and
operationalize very popular models and
workbooks and then the information
worker can discover what other people
within the organization of don and then
build and extend those models and find
new data sources and build new mashups
and so with that I'm going to hand back
to Prakash thank you so that was a quick
example those of you who've seen hence
Rosling and his videos you might go
search on youtube or somewhere now all
of you can behance wrassling and do
these types of demos really easily right
there in excel so just to summarize you
know what we've seen you know the modern
data driven applications have a number
of key characteristics or requirements
they need to process and handle a
variety of data from words numbers to
the images voice video spatial sensor
data web logs massive massive volume
petabytes coming up on exabytes of data
terabytes of our tens of terabytes of
data per hour to process gnashing public
data with private data that's very very
important to be able to derive insights
and also being able to process data in
real time in a batch way for historical
analytics and also in a predictive way
applying machine learning and
and those type of algorithms so a modern
data platform for data driven
applications needs to provide all these
capabilities and really quickly
Microsoft provides a pretty
comprehensive platform for these
capabilities based on a variety of
different products it's not one product
that makes up the Microsoft data
platform is really a infrastructure
layer that's based on either on your own
premises based on windows server or on
our public cloud which is called Windows
Azure and then again we'll have a whole
session on Windows Azure for research
and then sequel server which is the
brand for our data platform but really
encompasses a variety of technologies
from relational to non-relational or
Hadoop 20 lap to streaming data and
others and then integrated with the most
broadly used information worker tool set
which is office and Excel so that's
really the entirety of the Microsoft
data platform if you were like cern in
the morning talk and you had a budget of
a billion dollars a year roughly you
could build all this on your own if
you're not then you could use a platform
that a commercial what provender are
provides so just to give you a sense of
the level of investment Windows Azure
you know it's our public cloud service
it's a worldwide service it has data
centers in North America in Europe in
Asia here in Hong Kong Singapore we are
putting up more data centers in Japan
Australia and also right here in China
and we're actually the first
multinational to announce our public
cloud service in China provides a
variety of services from compute of
various kinds virtual machines of course
not only windows virtual machines but
Linux virtual machines to storage you
know sequel storage full-fledged
database capabilities also blob storage
table storage as well as networking
virtual networking so you can connect
your private environment to the public
cloud environment and not only those
basic capabilities compute storage
networking but also higher level
capabilities like easily be able to
build websites to be able to do
streaming media applications to be able
to build
mobile applications all of those type of
capabilities and finally with the open
programming environment this is
something that most people do not
realize but Windows Azure not only
sports the Microsoft programming
languages and frameworks around net c
sharp but also java PHP nodejs python
any language that you want to bring
integration with github all of those are
part of Windows Azure is really a
comprehensive public cloud platform
another question I know a lot of people
have in mind is what about Hadoop and as
I mentioned on the previous slide we are
actually providing a version of Hadoop
on our platform it's called HD insight
it's built it collaboratively with
Hortonworks which is one of the public
with one of the entities that has a
public distribution of a dupe and it
really brings together the best of the
open-source hadoop world with the best
of the microsoft world in terms of the
programming language and model that
being compatible one hundred percent
compatible with what's out there in the
public domain but with the enterprise
class security manageability high
availability that comes with the
microsoft platform and also built into
windows azure so that you can provision
a Hadoop cluster which is one of the
most difficult things to do as a user
you can literally provision that with a
few clicks in about 10 minutes and
that's amazing capability and you'll
hear more about our HD inside offering
in the next couple of weeks we're
actually even going beyond that I don't
have a whole lot of time to cover this
but we're thinking about how to
integrate the hadoop world with the more
traditional relational world so that you
can have a system that spans the two and
you can define schemas that span the two
you can define queries that span the two
and we can intelligently parse those
queries figure out what needs to be
solved by the Hadoop part of the system
what needs to be solved by the
relational part of the system run all
that machinery bring the results
together and present it to you in a very
easy-to-use form so that's something you
will hear more about in the future as
well and then the last thing i want to
touch on is the windows azure
marketplace for data which as shenae
mentioned and showed it's really
important to be able to have a library
of datasets that you can call upon that
are provided by 3rd parties because you
might not have all the data you need in
to do the analysis so we have a actually
marketplace for data and data providers
on Azure it's called data market com you
can go there you can browse all the
existing data sets if you have a data
set that you want to provide you can you
know provided on there either for free
or for a fee you know and you can have
different business models how you want
to charge for it on a subscription basis
on a per-user basis and we have a number
of data sets actually from across the
world and across different domains
whether its population data UN data
weather data finance data you know legal
data all kinds of providers on there in
that marketplace so that's I think I
think key part of the modern data
platform so really to summarize I think
we're in a now a new world with this
data explosion data coming from devices
sensors mobile social networks and
really also a new class of data driven
applications that are being built and
you saw some examples of that in fact I
tend to think data is the new currency
data is really the goal that people are
trying to mind when they are building
these type of applications but to build
these type of data driven applications
requires as you saw fairly complex
machinery to be able to handle different
kinds of data the scale the volumes the
rate of data and to be able to do rich
you know analytics and derive insights
and as you saw Microsoft provides
actually a pretty comprehensive platform
for those of you who not familiar with
that platform I really encourage you to
go take a look there are a number of
resources out there if you want to learn
more about Windows Azure or the big data
on Microsoft power bi that sinead showed
a sure for academic as i mentioned
dennis has a whole session on that and
he will cover a lot more about that as
well as all the key science efforts at
Microsoft Research so with that come to
the end of this session if we have a few
minutes we can take a couple of
questions if not we should in questions
