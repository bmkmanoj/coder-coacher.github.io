million people they suffer from heart
failure 25% of those patients actually
emit back to the hospital within three
months and then about 50% of that
population readmitted a hospital within
six month nearly one in five
fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries
they get readmitted to the hospital and
the cost of that is about twenty six
billion dollars of which about seventeen
billion dollars are avoidable University
of Washington Center of data Sciences
has done a phenomenal job creating this
machine learning predictive analytics
tool for readmissions what it does is it
creates it actually tells you exactly
when to discharge a patient we use a
stack of technologies to make it happen
at the lower most level we have big data
integration platforms that we use in
Azure so sequel as your and its related
components we use a variety of virtual
machines of different sizes on Azure for
the modeling components and then
modeling itself we have started using
Azure ml so we have an external layer
then we have a communication layer and
then we have an analytics layer once the
appropriate model is selected it will
get passed to the analytics layer where
it will get scored and the score is
going to come back and being converted
to JSON or XML or even as an hl7 one
piece of that deployment is an
administrative dashboard that helps
track the ten riskiest patients as
example currently being seen and helping
manage those risks the second thing that
we're working on now is to actually
deploy the risk score so when a patient
gets pulled up into the cardiovascular
dashboard you know along with all their
vital signs you can also see you know
their u-dub risk of readmission for
heart failure score right there I think
you know the real benefit of a tool like
this is
that it really is looking at what we now
consider to be population management
which is not just to look at individual
patients alone but look at individuals
in cohort with a whole population of
patients what makes the most differences
is that you get to actually see patients
getting better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
