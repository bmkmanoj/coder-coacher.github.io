thank you my is great opportunity for me
to share with you and today my talk is
about the last calif i'm encouraging
dentist battles visual context morreion
and i'm tom from information technology
research group activity ok um they
before i just gave you no more detail
partying type of imaging i were to share
this time on arm this is the young as
she described on at UCR from the very
same of the HD approach a and it should
be an interesting process control and
data collection and inspiration in via
the clinical routine and so any young
they are a student or events to live
permanently in the processing so here
only left inside the top so i can see
the
to see the position and basically
proceedings as there are no teeth when
they meet the Asian estas and any
precautions for some publication RIT and
Chicken brain and also the history
probably in illness okay so after the
coaching Dasia stop flexin ma Delta so
those are textual data and then after
that yeah they based on Lucy Arctic
essential crushing de yada yada and ma
machine spectacles an issue okay Darren
Taylor asked for this and some questions
relate to you know the cosmic history
and also in general social history about
the sea and also review of the then he a
system of the patient okay then
artillery harm the second iteration they
proceeded paypal make a requirement
necklaces and NT survey suggests tragedy
that try to keep an illusion of
and if the performance enhancer on
problem than facing energy efficient
velocity the patient in various
combination all making or testing for
sample protesting or any other party huh
testing and and also our traditional
method ECG or Egypt as one-dimensional
and particularly Nadia are they also are
making something up anything study and
examination for some x-ray or CT or MRI
ok so this the the after those beyond
the desert correction ok we basically
are one tea and 2d or 3d component and
then the based on that I came down
starting a different league are most
likely not a tunnel six then the based
on different days actually and she
patiently ordinary then the after that
also the devastation of the result of
the treatment by you know the
combination game
the aging skin into seeing that what's
going on before and after treatment and
wisdom of the unlimited city nouns that
kind of tradition make each other for
couple times in order to perform of
hypothesis energy for certain in the
range of the operation then indication
they are getting better and no further
care quiet earlier cases or n ot patient
serious problem so that's the end the
whole you know the processing about in
town in cream of the team and how we
collect it up our department data and
also vectors of the integration okay and
and for this fear because in that you
know the end for one patient for many
times you know a lot of time photography
will visit in
testing and also the price for you know
the appletv nations they are central so
that no fear in Antigua the dentist
which allowed a physician to the tomato
ok so in that case you know the staying
for those he re- election particularly
know the image study and Jerry wasn't
about the humanity and 2d 3d and report
equally talented man ok so we stadia
dosia each area of study a tree
providing we pushing on the rule for
immunity hold the position to HST screw
Foley and in charge inside human body so
stay down it bring the result another
the time so I was a problem which HTC
are and I was over traditional ok so the
for those who you know the ping routine
can see on the Jerry lot of reality in
Quetta and then for those tests and
business commercial dr joseph e.m
determine who asked a bunny
actually and fresh the third percent
over white story to the year 2010 and
also night the same of crunchy that's
how r g as she was to creating the
luxurious so that means you know
completely and also those that are
really confident proteja we're talking
about those that are normally just came
from the captured by the protein and the
cell and the tissues in LDL open
different organ system ended before
boarding Angelyn task upon that we are
we can capture image via reaction
interracial time and already know Kate
curated all human body changed time and
here they are where will the state were
cuddly very powerful you know the
loud engines and also a message via data
and also calling of it really increasing
the total number of the chemical
examination that perform every day in
hospital and also you know we used a
wide range of the ER in each modality
for our Tiffin Olin style and after the
exam related and also and those in
baggage attorney Heshy between the you
know the creative force of the lock
behind a special and temporal resolution
so provided with magic as I said and
infertility medical tent family they
also are generally 32 are integrated
applicant is the structure of the
component part amico and histology and
ended generic information and also in
OTR yearly about the prisoners medicine
that means without generally a critical
telephone relate to be people screaming
the ankle of depressions but also relate
to other patients healthy so we want to
monitor and also also have encoded
offensively Madison that means if you
have been a pocket money and you know
they naturally meetings games caught
Justin just entitlement and so for those
young and here are some example showing
young farmer imaging data on in the
journal of clinical team and eleventh I
can see those are traditional and free
nation the tutee image part of course
you know orders are to Nolan's up she
pressed together so we cannot see any
the 3d content and important last year
is showing the we use the temperatures
as teachers to unity normal teams
oh boy and we also have like that
emotion is really 3dr they are 3d
components of the human brain and that's
about it it's one showing the whole body
cancer remission and ensure the spirit
of the cancer different on the human
organ system and the right hands are
here on one is really sure we combine
also can combine it from madera together
to be provided only the structural
information also confidently to care
okay and so the review for the
functional midget are they are
partnering with initiative of Africa we
came down make that injection they
thought they are those chaser to human
body and then try to extract synoptic
about chemical of the attendees for
somebody with a pair of ethical codes in
salim abbud ngt technical diga what's
going on for the team work reaches
higher efficacy or Google's and solely
of the chaser connect model which is
about you too Terrance and my furniture
imaging and provides a functional
changes so instead of traditional in a
way only market
prevention okay and we can use this
function which to a captured unit even
organs function changing the different
organ systems like brains and hearts and
Kenny okay and from the the previous
about December can say they are the
functional image actually provide the
are they got the quantitative you know
the results body human function change I
you know the solution is not the
articles of the aptitude of a tracer
construction of the tracer image so in
that case in other statues you know to
have a interview the combined capacity
imagem para together that means in 30
when you take the most functional
changes a real resolution you also can
take er a combined with the detail is
function of the and internet better
location of those detention chains so
here showing at the left hand side here
that means they should be functional
candies image and then all the Middle's
are showing the structure our teacher
from the city and then this cigar the
combined in each year showing the young
though sleep are you can detect the
point of the sea precisely our
verification or closely
Chinese okay and for those the vast
scale of dancers particular disco ball
indigestion oh and the normally involved
the hundreds you know several hundreds
of the nice lies the whole body and our
memories that we stole that such kind of
Alaska selling the pajama convocation
system the tax system in hospital oh you
can just all india the vendor usual
archiving which is you know the viable
threat or work for you to invite any
heart meeting depositing 10 okay and for
those large tears on the you can see the
position you know normally takes a long
time for them to say they each wrote the
whole data set you know the whole body
thursday and then after that into
terrorist alert the transsexual view and
such to view and review in order to not
happen
we are to report those who have the
moral vision so they call our while also
for the interest and then after them I
need to manually market and empty better
temper at the clinical report together
and it takes the wrong time to wonder to
see the whole body case okay so this
year we really looking for energy down
on a bad way to make you know the
integration good inspiration for
prostitution so then the young so that
many of you know the young the situation
you're welcome you know Parvati trying
to develop ERT is very intelligent
analysis of those large scale define
Contessa and heal together not to
mention the they don t include on the
first one is the Microsoft D color that
energy image at mentioning Wednesday's
young they are keno to a party Simon the
this quarter leverages the open the
doors open source perform for making
deeper
we came along to a truly the last year
test and then metal make a competition
and comparable amount of the biomedical
imaging terrorism and other ones
projects quality Sarah project has
former in the EU and it's flames called
visual concept church in Germany in the
yard and my deal is purchased the they
proposed chuang challenges on trying to
sort of a large scale image data
analysis program and then particular
focus to about the first ones about the
anatomic detecting so they wanted a
musician about the generate automatic
charity and atomic detection and into
providing the computer analyst position
and it's like India the challenges about
the show of this liminal case and this
was called a kind of Batman literature
and it'll our detention for tea tea tea
p delta about the research to necto see
a neutron and condition okay and for
this the professor the project are the
current unstructured data or those who
depend on us to provide a microsoft
research on the michael sebastian okay
so the so the today I'm glad to just
focus on the
children in a place so that it actually
is about indie and all generally who
called it come true so young so the for
the last game admin lieutenant as the
cr1 crucial wanted the marriage within
the physician try to make the analysis
based on the patient's image and the you
know the large data setting for the
previous case efficient energy wanted
chicken broth the same sin antes de
young data compared the the kinetic case
which is the patient to be objective and
in the database and then we use that you
see those similar initiative reference
sets and it will turn to for fishing
they can make sure you know the correct
assets of the so that's the broader idea
for you know that the arm you have a
lunch date at the image data set and the
offline is the shredder University are
two key features and input and for the
new on the range and then you get candy
and new features that make a comparison
and then find out some positive energy
results ok so the painting to find the
image is wasted on contents and then
and also search for a gremlin case
actually another price important role
for in the case based reasoning and
based medicine circle and for this topic
listen year army car actually run cup of
tea workshops there's called money
advent cool comic ice cream petition in
support and charger in OT sort of this
and help the help of the losi ask a
final to me to death and Isis and the
true okay and for the of the fishing
point of view the they really want to
make use of these family biomedical
imaging and NASA tiny to to find out the
similar of the sort who are
characteristic resurrecting rather than
just over yet english appearance like
the normal archimage so basically they
want to you know the Richard beta those
hinge it was a similar special contest
and those contests each year the coast
we laid to rest logical areas structure
and and in providing a second opening
improve in to use managing the compress
as president part and then she tells the
kind of patient and also long in there
and can also use this judicial tentative
and as I came into to create to generate
some press and patent see patterns
together with the you know some other no
image no image information for example
that then change information for me just
like the previous oh ok and here are
just showing the young this case study
49 16 OCT okay so the young solely on
testing in which is in the best image we
are tending to even consider our
analysis and we are the leading cause of
cancer protector and especially for
non-small cell lung cancer and assist
sto states the art the most comments
attack and here no we want to arm at a
yachty they don't see out the
intelligent analysis of the CRT is
really young English aspect particular
the lung cancer imaging and ontology are
the final in continuous and non-jews and
also the the patterns of the
distribution of the spirit of this we
have Kansas product others okay enfa
Lily on they go see are the special
context of the dreamer you can see our
here's the full data sets total Devon
the most left column here sure he
actually the lung cancer in the crow
to the inter span and the second one
sg's the lung cancer the close to namida
style party where we think you have a
plan for you and it's little one showing
the cancer and she just have not touched
with the millennium and also the chest
wall and the last one entry showing the
cancer actually get in touch Jason
easily in the chest wall and all those
he notice that context information
actually is quite related to call the
lung cancer stage and then also are
performing use of information for the
children and funny they threw the plants
can meet each other and the best ideas
you would need to firstly chairman would
reach extraction and for feature
clicking on another two to capture those
special another and context information
related to pathological structure and
here we make use of the special feature
and holding and normally people use the
Howard attention regional international
supervision classification or use the
pillow and modeling and holy use SPN
method and for the young they a special
feature and calling
the original classification are although
you know provider e34 you know the
making those Tea Party forcibly tomatoes
after Lana the different regions for
example the lung years and years and in
from Inferno and the tumor and internal
bronzer chidiya allow you to make those
further you know the Romanian fortune to
generate the OC especially chassis angle
I always was destined for the
classification that was dull and second
approach POF as we are allow you to you
know the dal makhani education part 8 30
are normally are entities dr the local
area university such ability into the
squirrel product structure and in for
this and because this to avoid ethics
quiz or trousseau cannot bring me you
know precisely how they extend those
features of the pathology results and as
little one has a year in charge you know
the bringing more principled word to
provide a start efficiently of those he
founded combine those features 10
different are scarce Activision but yes
dear you know this no because of those
as a to hardy which is for those about
the distribution so in our recent study
will provide American go on to contact
your special descriptor and the matter
of this is which I to make use of the
first pool our motor cortical activity
on radio creation for the subdivision of
OC partisanship those are the special
feature Colleen and also we are
currently president Ghani the
classification and also the segmentation
so basically we are just using I need to
detect the pathological center and use
this venture to articulate those big
ugly ass attribution and then we can use
the package already placed enhancement
approach to the corporate better
performance and here are the arms
freedom emerges esta Loco feature
extraction and a special each other
temptation I think he really has been at
the framework OD a social Center
detection and a context-based petitioner
model
so the for the local feature attraction
of the hotel know that many are
different appreciate flexion techniques
but we have for me at all incidentally /
pray the very well for middle C is the
lung cancer and the related the
temperatures appearance penn station and
for the petrol engine detection instead
of really going to detect a boundary of
mutational posted throughout the region
we only need to detect the sensuality
and understand opponent is the addition
and based on that we can use them as
yahoo vector C detection and after that
i can take you something about Cody and
Cory structure and for that you know
provided multi-layer and then solution
and the fidelity are this activation we
actually provide the detective were to
you know to make a keynote presentation
to make sure you know this and most of
the young those contact a pasty the
notation can be hard in group okay and
also a ticket to carry our a young OC on
a subdivision fire on the other people
division and also on the based on those
er the lung cancer out those collision
we also proposed each other teacher
conference use needy or recorded median
arteriors and material cost area of the
order so make sure you know the
estimated standard SATA vision you have
all life across wife and quality and
crosswise give an order so basically you
need to check the median nerve section
and anterior section and jet here is a
fancy Australia settings were based on
this lady a solo para poner okay and the
last stages party will use the trouble
learning 1080i Pennington actually harm
vectors these organizations in manager
okay and we comparability they approach
with the other you noticed a robust
approach that the spm the local features
and no POF suit and we have the Omo
performanc in history can get a great
movie star and also check this data
efficient in our local hospital and it
also trading activity performance and
here's impressively the ritual book so
the first one first the role here can
see the most left hand side mission the
parish the current image precision try
to looking for
and then can say the right-hand side
area but also top of the decision
resulted in sydney in a no matter how
scared they help the different scale a
patient presents and intensity we can
find out that those cases are looking
for all the general region showing the
whole area they actually just wasted in
the stadium which is the middle side
ability between to land view and you can
see they're going inside this free case
you know open see that dosti on a
similar case with the hometown and
legacy of the economy the contextual
aunty teacher point of view and can see
no matter is the left and locating the
nearly level or the right man for you
they opened each other so it's
impossible to use to you know
traditionally body image experience it
to find out and the second row usually
Tim regime is close to in assisted in
the land for you but closed the meanness
again and the still one is the final
order a similar case in that you have a
chamber region actually touch with the
the chest wall and the last one which is
in most that you know the the early
stage of the chamber it should be at the
Chamber's it Feliz in inside around view
instead of getting
just or an order in the stadium okay and
then you look based on this you know the
premise valley where discount with the
situation in the hospital and we
actually came in a further two don't
ingesting finalist min case but for
those human case we actually already get
a lot of the other three are and all
those fish shaped the content and for
those the and evidence have we actually
can get relative up to help making dr d
/ completed non-conscious paging and
here than showing the are definitely a
consideration by station 1 a and 13 and
20 to three and three days will be and
stage for and foreign oil just showed
need is 20 years old survival right you
know the on 671 stencil showing the
different stage of the other not answer
and for this you know today we can boot
up the also make use of those little
fishes knows math better to make the
heart the temple changing and SS full
impatiently before german and after
treatment for example in this case the
most americans i show the patient get
better you know the couple take
advantage of illusion and then after the
right hand side cute is really cute for
education the archer chillin and
osteology version this period then we
can now are checking those temporal
changes to to make an essence of taking
another health how the evolution of
those are the treatment myself and we
also can energy the culturally hard Penn
State imaging data analysis and here
they are using for those who we can make
is whether an essence of those people to
chamber spread to the whole aura that he
from the lunch we had the organs into to
provide in our usual information for
honey are for the treatment and um based
on those become the whole body you know
the desert is the result and we can also
make the Henschel toasty and quirky
using one order to try to find out
something of the illusion a transfer
order call that is a man and of course
for this distant matter also need to
combine with each other in the
development from the no image of the
information
for example the young ones they are
mentioned before another sea change
information okay and we also use ability
of the context the modern computer via
special temple the entity for the
personal health sprinkle and eventually
we will also go beyond the pasty
narrative and then basically another
propriety they are different than the
station of the human the related video
related avrt all those he has wrinkle
there in silence the gravity is the
distance in addition one do is install
the front end and because the disks in
point a here there's not any imaging and
I'm a maternity shirt from the hospital
skin after the dragons are you in state
on you can actually turn out the OC
disculpa for those people point contest
and most friends I english at the time
lon chaney in other business okay in the
last class and also on the album digoxin
only just a whole body have imagery also
particular honoring each day and SS for
a rectangle Sicily Ã¶zlem artistry and
try to find us a minute
potential in the teaching station of the
house the ultimate is the main early
detection and the sammobile of the
research why she is joined Atlantic and
Kentucky thiaj the boy Prince Bradford
hospital semi and also Jonathan's school
medicine and in our med school and this
is an officially gives a propriety out
sir colin is he to second and also nami
na sequin so thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
