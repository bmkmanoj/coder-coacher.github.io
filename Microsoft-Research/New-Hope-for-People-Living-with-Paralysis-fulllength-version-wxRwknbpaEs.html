this design of the platform allows you
to innovate quickly it allows you to
test out a design it tests out your
ideas very quickly in rail environments
collect data and then say if your design
is working or not working which is a
very big motivation for innovation we
are developing a textile based
capacitive sensors that could be built
into clothing bed sheets pillow covers
and even wheelchair pads so the idea
here is to use these sensors as
proximity sensors to detect gestures for
people with paralysis so people with
paralysis can use these gestures for
controlling the environment whether it's
lights switches televisions making a 911
call or even making a nurse card love of
things essentially provides the software
framework on top of which we have built
a data collection unit data processing
unit and gesture detection unit there
are individuals that have troubles with
use of their arms there are different
adaptations that people can use in rehab
now but they're either quite expensive
or they can cause damage to the skin
with long term use and so so a real
potential in this particular project in
that it was touchless and they were
really looking at keeping something that
was quite cost effective therefore it
would actually be something that
individuals that have disabilities could
afford and would use in everyday life
we're looking at a system perspective
where you don't develop the pieces or
layers of the system independently you
look at how each piece fits in the
bigger system you make sure you're
designing that piece in the context of
that larger system if you end up
building all the pieces separately you
get a very disjoint system that's not
optimal and in particular we're looking
for extreme miniaturization and things
like ultra low power you really have to
design each piece to do what it needs to
do and nothing more I broke my neck at
the age 17
in a surfing diving accident what I went
from about 9 foot to about a half foot
my board hit I hit and the wave hit and
that's how it became an incomplete
quadriplegic I think that in research
teaming up engineers and physical
therapist really creates a team that has
a broad perspective my goal is to work
with these engineers who have great
creative and innovative ideas and as
it's being developed have the end user
in mind so that they're developing it
knowing the physical capabilities of the
end user whether that's somebody with
spinal cord injury or stroke or some
other physical disability one of the
most rewarding things about this project
is not only working at the circuits and
algorithm level itself but being able to
see a direct impact all the way up the
stack the whole way up to the user to
see a user actually use the system and
when you see that product work and
that's what's great so great about this
microsoft framework is it's trying to
accelerate bringing that technology into
a larger framework where we can see an
experiment at all levels very rapidly we
want this product being used by people
with paralysis all over the place and
making them more independent in the
short term we have to solve a lot of
research problems out there but in the
long term what I envision is is actually
a commercial product my hope for this
project is with this technology to have
folks to have injuries such the
quadriplegics or other types of
impairments of there may be upper
extremities to be able to be more
independent to have a confidence that
they don't have to rely on someone all
the time this way they can live their
life and
normal as possible and to be able to
just get out have fun and enjoy life
level things brings down the barriers of
doing research with connected devices it
brings down the barriers by allowing
people to deploy its Kim and deploying
diverse geographies and that is the
power of the lab of things
