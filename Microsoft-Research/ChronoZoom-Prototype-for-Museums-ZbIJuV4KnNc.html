you
welcome everybody Roy's Zimmerman I've
been working with Alex this summer and
even before this summer on chromosome
chromosome has been something that's
been incubated by MSR for number of
years
I'm spoiled but where my
but this summer we invited Alex to come
in as an intern to see if we could
really adapt chromosome or a museum
specific environment and he'll share a
little bit more about what Chronos is
his history with it and what he was able
to do with the summer so well Thank You
Roy introduction so I was making a proof
of concept of using her own zoom as an
application for museum exhibits I will
tell you a little bit about what groans
UMI's and then I'll talk it about my
internship deliverables so current zoom
was built by microsoft research in
collaboration with Moscow State
University and University of California
Berkeley MSC was working on this for
almost three years i think i was also
participating for two years i was
working on visualization system
monitoring system the master staff
corona zoom is a visualization tool
which represents the time events based
on their historical events based on
their time so mostly it uses historical
content data inside chromosome is nested
if you see the screen left which means
it makes it more structure it more clear
to navigate and explore and it used
multiple media types to display the data
such as images videos and so on
chromosome contains of three main
elements timeline exhibit e an artifact
time lines represent us as rectangles
and they represent continuous event in
time span they have start and end date
and their primary goal is to be as a
container of other events like timelines
and exhibits and also true structures
the data exhibits represented the
circles and this is a particular event
related to some point in time and their
primary goal is to be container of
artifacts which
the core content of chromosome artifact
is an informational unit this is what
people usually trying to explore the
look media content and read the
description of how to because this
shows and covers the area of exhibit we
choose to museums because of some of
features of chromosomes such as you can
show as much data as you want on a
single screen because of zoom experience
in panel in experience so the data
amount is unlimited it is interactive
which makes it very attractive for users
and semantically of data which gives a
different experience of exploring the
data in the context with other events
this way it was very interesting to try
to use it in a museum experience as a
building of my internship we
collaborated with big history
researchers who told us that they would
like to have other representation of
data inside corner zoom based on
geographical experience they want to
connect exhibits with some areas on the
map we came with this idea to our Museum
partner wisdom of history and industry
in Seattle they never seen cross them
before we show the consumed and told
them that we would like to have with map
view experience and have a museum
experience for curran zoom they were
very excited about this and we were
making a map view for them when the
history researchers the key requirements
were to display data on a specific area
it's maybe country continent state and
not just point on the map longitude and
longitude possibility of using
historical map since its toll which
represents historical data so you might
want to use map with other boundaries of
countries are the names of countries
since it's about representation and
visualization I've shown the date on the
map not about showing details that's why
I also don't need to show reverse name
of places roads and it should be easy to
I mean this and this should be flexible
so we can deliver different types of
visualization for our partners solution
for this was using d3.js and top maps in
top adjacent it's a very popular bundle
it's open source d3.js is one of the
propellers visitation libraries for
javascript there are a lot of open
source topologies for maps they have
different level of detail ization in
different level of precision for
locations the maps can contain map of
rivers lakes and oceans and seas or my
poor countries map of places you can use
in common light utilities which are also
a distributed free you can filter this
data and use only map of us for instance
of my poof I frico or any other location
and you can manipulate with different
manipulate different map sources and
merge them like you can merge map of
countries with map of rivers for
instance what
historical maps
it is possible to applause historic maps
here but this is a quite popular format
so probably if someone will make open
source historical maps they will deliver
this in this format so we can use it
later however our missing partner later
told us that rather than make additional
features they would like to have a
different application for chromosome
from museum because of museum
restrictions for instance a lot of
museums do not have an internet access
for their exhibit all day restricted and
current zoom with online tool we use
online media and we need to be connected
to internet also me zoom applications
should be secure users shouldn't have
permissions to access system settings
close application open other
applications from them within the
browser so it can be closed which is not
very good and they don't want to have a
creator of exhibit who will stand nearby
in time to time check if it's running
properly if no one ruin it and there is
still working bodies because of condom
architecture to serve their needs we
need to deploy database and web service
locally also support local content
before this we were supporting only in
media URLs for media content because of
legacy legal issues we cannot store the
content on our servers so whenever
supported uploading of files especially
local and local windows user with
restricted access makes it makes up our
application secure you cannot access any
system settings you can close it all we
can do is just interact with this
application for our demo version in
museum
I supported authoring using local
content and display in local content
also I did anti agile feature which
resets the viewport and application to
its initial state after it was idle for
a few time so next museum visitor will
get the same experience as user before
him and make it easier to access and
explore the data on the canvas with this
result we came to a museum and on one of
weekends who made a demo using surfaces
three we gathered a lot of user feedback
and we prioritized a feedback and select
it for key features we can still
implement until end of my internship
first of all we noticed tablet is
definitely not appropriate device
everything is very small which causes
different user experience they were
trying to Inuvik to use the tool in a
different way also items were very small
and ticks were not text wasn't readable
by some people we need to use better
navigation system and despite the fact
out of users realized that they can use
panning and zoom in and zoom out they
were not trying to use it to access
other exhibits also they complained
about having full experience for images
and videos again they knew they can zoom
in and zoom out but they want to try to
apply it for images and videos and we
noticed that my neural artifact which
aside artifacts of exhibits usually
ignored by people probably because
they're too small so we made these
improvements and make the demo recently
to our other museum partner seattle art
museum and mow high on my peopie screen
you see here and they were very excited
about the result in our progress and
they shown interest in using this
prototype one of their exhibits also
ruined Laura going to Contreras and
sales career where they can get our
other museum partners and show them the
demo and also since it's open-source
bundle for museum we are looking for
university partners or some open source
community who can
continue develop and maintain this
project so I will demonstrate you this
is exhibit we made with Museum of
History in industry sorry this is our
navigational panel to make content
easier to achieve let's say I want to
find boring care plane as you see you
can zoom in and zoom out but people want
to try to do this on images and same
with pictures these artifacts were not
explored by any user so that's why we
made full screen which shows the same
data but in a different view it shows
all the artifacts there more accessing
their more useful representation I think
because it showed all of the data of
exhibit on one place you can easily
navigate to other exhibits which are the
closest in the future or closest in the
past I cannot access the left button
unfortunately also we made full screen
experience for images this is not the
best image because it's low resolution
this one should be better we can domain
and the march on the images same for
videos
see what we need if we can wait for a
minute then we will see the idol system
that probably you saw that initial
application looks like this this is and
this is cleared this is what you will
see when they come to an exhibit this is
how it rosettes now i will show you
opt-in system oh did you do anything
special to handle the further multi
touch capabilities of the ppi what
happens if you get multiple people can
become you know a good day i received
only two weeks before and we had a lot
of things to do it CC I cannot do
anything no system settings windows
button is not working this is secured
application yes everything is okay
I will use my laptop because it's easier
to author with keys keyboard and mouse
rather than touch and it's supposed to
use this keyboard and mouse so this is a
author own experience as you notice
there appeared some icons on the bottom
of timelines this timeline has icon of
Earth which means it has some web data
if I click on it we can see the map of
those America it contains some of data
in Brazil this is also the full screen
experience for display and exhibits
I can easily pull through it and to show
other map right here not currently nine
maps I can use let's say map of us this
is very simple tool to author we just
select item you want to add and choose
the area where you want to add this and
don't think I'm making it no proper
arrays but this is just for Emma
so map is now my father yes we can
explore events on web upon us and now we
create a demo exhibit using local
content so what's working properly you
some of our content of mo hi I hope they
will allow me to do this three will be
enough let me add a video
so now I'm generating some nails which
also stored locally and here's our
exhibit yes so this is how we do that
now you're not creating a deep zoom
pyramid you're just creating a thumbnail
you got the high res just too yes but I
creating different different resolutions
of the some nails yes yes okay now go
back to my presentation you do nonlinear
tool and select example you had
something that looked like we were
talking about the universe the timeline
of the universe in one of your slides
and so this looks this is really cool
for relatively short periods of time but
like this say oh I can show you a
production version of website
this is exactly the ideal is actually
designed yeah that's what the public
version of the site does not producing a
sensitive person sees its show zoo
history from the Big Bang humanity to
intervene and justice
effective any segment of time from all
of it to a single day
and the offer ed allows you to build
timelines of any of those skills the
limitations right now are as long as you
don't go farther back then and for
my five billion years or into the future
beyond right now no now you can go into
the Viera up to nine thousand nine
hundred and ninety-nine dollars so yeah
oh they'll be the minutes of the
passport so that you wouldn't believe
scientific discussion to start else how
much resolution that's what Alex finish
up and we can have the general
discussion I would like to thank Rowan
Lori for supporting me during internship
and guiding me helping to establish my
connection with museum partners and to
make this prototype I also like to thank
j beavers for helping me with
engineering questions to Curtis funk for
giving us museum partners and for his
the feedback on map view for Stephen
tracker for his ideas about map view for
our hi friends who made this exhibit
possible and who trusted us to make this
exhibit and shorten their Museum and
through other ms our interns who gave
feedback and their ideas on my project
thank you I like so many times would you
estimate that you met with moi over the
course of you know your internship to
iterate and get feedback from them I
think four to five times
do you think that was sufficient yes
so it's interesting that this list
actually scoped to use within museum
because what i sees people that are
trying to be without
want to be online so from the local
storage perspective is there any thought
given to what if i want to create this
locally but then push it right online
which is i built now last year with ivan
on basically
um hey
it you know in selling this till really
my colleagues cuz i'm an archivist and I
don't
his face and I have lots of people
like me who would like to provide this
information to chromosome
this history is actually really
important
so then
that their problem is it's not already
stored on the internet so
the local storage thing like is there
sort of a model for you can do your
local storage and then push it to Azure
and here's the model for pushing into
Asia and then
then take your local data and shove it
in courtesy and you're only offering
ones for both places it is possible but
the only problem we're not we don't want
to store any data on our servers and
because of legal issues so i guess the
current closest solution to that right
now is if you can store everything on
your onedrive then you can get it all
into the public-facing web site so you
make your bed and I think we actually be
offering to how that plugin so young
kids point to a local teenager video
goes to my onedrive it will certainly
pop-ups and Lincoln so and you can put
videos up in vimeo and other places so
it doesn't have to be a singly located
so it sort of solve your problem that
there's probably some extra or i can
show you few seconds so this is the
public-facing free website frozen
comment now if you sign in
one time I did this for a delegation of
Mayors from Puerto Rico and I got my x
for somebody i got the lines inverted
and i was typing my password in as i was
the sign in page in their life
so if you log in you can customize the
background image this is the collection
name but as I was saying here's where
you can pull images from so my
background image is currently from a
museum that i was talking to it
change the background image
so I
Shh
city of said say so if I say it changes
in a lot of mountain could change that
we've got opacity flexibility now that
we didn't have before enable kiosk mode
was the very first thing that we did for
the public-facing web site so that if
someone wanted to take the online
version and put it into their museum
they enable kiosk mode and see it
changes that all of these icons go away
but it still doesn't solve the internet
access problem
and I muster an athletic mode you still
can having these things but that's what
that's pretty close to what he was
asking you think you ready to meet you
it's like twist on what you were saying
that don't think about local storage
first think about how you make yourself
available online author timeline music
disabled yes
but
so if you go down to you know your
search you can search on one drive to
find whatever
you have there too long is it sort of in
at URL format that's how it waits to
whatever the phone
I was mistaken I thought there was a
mechanism to selectively
final
Oh
but we also now have managed editors
which allows you to add equal to your
list of authors so you can do shared
offering with anyone who's
which is one of the most requested
features from students and teachers we
first will descent two classrooms and
they didn't want to have to have crowds
over one little screen I want to do
alex is is it the case at all of the
changes that you've made to handle this
the museum on premise sort of sandbox
environment is at all part of the
mainline protestant source in github or
is it a fork from using and this is a
poor committees
so the only other functionality that you
know that really pops out that Alex
didn't cover is the these icons are copy
and paste which may be something that
people two people working microsoft
so you can copy any timeline that's on
the public site or that's shared with
you and paste it into your environment
as long as it fits within your temporal
parameters so it can't copy the whole
big bang timeline and copy dat dere
timeline if your timeline covers a
thousand years
and that if you
depth at favorites
and you go to your home screen this is
my yeah this is me Rosie so these are
these are collections have been shared
with me so I can go ahead and edit the
Wadsworth museum's collection and these
are the ones I've favorited over
but that's in your profile so if you
were like i have just
I managed the library
make you favorite from being taken
library would ya
you like that something
I've got a question since pit just
around your user feedback for five times
the museum
it's probably got a lot of valuable
information
well I mean it's a great way to improve
it especially I was intrigued by the
fact that
how did you collect your data
or any other insights you had from that
experience that might be inclined
from this for five visits we were
talking with executives of museum and
gathering their features and showing
them our progress work had only one
demonstration we just was looking at the
users I can share it because you
together if you're interested was it
sort of was it a Wild West experiment we
did you play and just have people come
in and try it just observed and yes okay
so it wasn't a structured experiment
also know they were just going around
the museum and someone they're coming
for our exhibit and looking at it some
some people were invited and give them a
chocolate museum collect their feedback
at yet
they just write it on the paper so they
are a questionnaire yes but they were
not giving it to anyone they were just
asking patients right in this on a bit
yes but I can say that questions for
like an equation here we were asking
questions based on what this user and
they were walking around with the
surface pro 3 yes they were
and did you do any
else is recapturing
how long his state
history programmatic
no for this is we just wanted to see how
they will use it when with with other
improvements now we can make some medics
what where they click will be mmm that
was sort of a next days that they
logically went to go was let's see where
they spend more time on the side
do you have one year which say five more
days do you but this is there a Zurich
cookbook is there something that we can
hand off to public sector if this
started catching on with libraries in
museum I'm saying from a hardware
configuration installation how do you
get up and running from buying the kid
getting in so doing have better plans
yes I will publish it ever seem to get
help with instructions and I will I hope
my application will be published in the
store on the other when I look it out i
was running windows 8 application so
it's a windows 8 at it it just renders a
lot of a page I have it made for
restricted access for windows local user
right they can run only this application
and only directed it I can I do anything
else it's a perfectly perfectly suited
yes
there was another one last pack way that
Chronos
has been used that we didn't think of
the University of cal state university
fullerton has taken it and basically
used it to create his his course webpage
but he's using it in a timeline now so
week one
go ahead
he's got this whole syllabus here his
homework assignment is you know watch
these videos before you come to class he
gives students you know a heads up and
week for whatever it is when you're
gonna have a quiz these are the things
we need to think about so he said that
his students are finding us more
accessible at digestible than the
traditional web site with the drum done
folders folders so that when he teaches
in class the next semester eaters
changes only days yeah and because
because all of his documentation is on
his onedrive as he's updating the
syllabus the update under heavy shows
there and in fact he's shown this to
chief information officer at Cal State
University is thinking of figuring out
how they need a drop Moodle and adapt to
this for his whole mms or build this on
top of his LMS and we're talking about
today three actually might want to join
us with maybe that's awesome I mean
there's so many opportunities I'm really
excited
and that local those deep strange that's
a big
I think it also probably
interesting for schools because that was
warming shoes
blockb on their backs
saw
certain videos for whatever reason or
block YouTube
wrong or you know concern is just there
that was a policy
ray they just block it off and so
experienced business
Oh
so
being able to serve up
done
being the manager of his face I know
Michael something like that
but they will happen if I don't like
something lock it down okay good I'll
come in yeah that's a really well thank
you all for coming Alex heavy eight here
for another week so if you have any
questions for it please all up with him
soon and although it's not vanishing off
the planet so it's certainly be able to
track him down and me too thanks much I
know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
