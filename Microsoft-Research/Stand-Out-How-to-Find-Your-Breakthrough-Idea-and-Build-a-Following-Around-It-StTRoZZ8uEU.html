hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
thank you so much for coming my name is
Amy Draves and I'm thrilled to welcome
Dorie Clark back to the Microsoft
Research visiting speaker series her
first book reinventing you focused on
creating your own brand in stand out she
interviewed several thought leaders and
chairs how to identify the ideas that
will set you apart and how to promote
them successfully she is an adjunct
professor at Duke and a visiting
professor for the IE Business School in
Madrid she has guest lectured at Harvard
Stanford Wharton MIT and more and in
2013 and 2014 she was named one of the
100 must follow people on Twitter and
this year's Forbes put her on the list
of 25 professional networking experts to
watch in 2015 please join me in giving
her a very warm welcome
good afternoon so two years ago i was
here at microsoft speaking for the first
time I had a new book coming out then it
was called reinventing you and at the
time when I was doing research I
actually had interviewed this fellow his
name is Stephen rice and he was and I
think I think still is for the moment
the executive vice president of human
resources for Juniper Networks yet your
neighbor down south in Silicon Valley
and he told me something interesting
which was that whenever he is asking
people interview questions for that the
highest level jobs at juniper he's you
know trying to try to figure out if they
should get a really high ranking job he
asks them one question which is how are
you reinventing yourself and he says
that if people don't have a good answer
to that he didn't want to hire them and
they really struck me and that was one
of the anecdotes that I included in
reinventing you I actually include him
here in this presentation today because
about a week ago I got an email from him
and he said that he had been thinking
recently about our conversation and he
realized that he actually hadn't been
practicing what he preached he had been
doing the same job at the same company
for for too long and he needed to
reinvent himself and so he's actually
going to be moving up here this summer
to now take a chief human resources
officer opportunity at the bill and
melinda gates foundation so that's
that's someone who i think in a lot of
ways we're all in this position that we
want to try to find ways wherever we are
in our jobs to try to reinvent ourselves
now microsoft is an incredibly exciting
place and there are many ways you can
make a mark but i think all of us have
found at one time or another in our
professional lives that we feel like
maybe were you know we're hitting a
plateau we need to keep reinventing
ourselves within the context of our job
or within the context of our community
so two years ago when i was here
it was a little bit of a moment of
turmoil it was literally a couple days
after Steve Ballmer had announced that
he was stepping down there were people
just flooding in saying reinvention yes
that's that's what we're after so two
years later as you guys know things
things are looking pretty exciting the
the ink is good and a lot of things are
happening at Microsoft which I've been
really pleased to witness in terms of
the reinvention of how people are
talking about Microsoft and how how
things are are being approached but
there's a question that happens
naturally which is once you have
reinvented yourself once you have
shifted modes once you have changed into
the place that you want to be you're in
the process of becoming how do you then
become recognized as truly being the
best in your field how do you stand out
in the place where you want to make your
mark and that's why i wrote my current
book because i wanted to solve the the
problem of what comes next in an
increasingly crowded noisy world you
know in a world where you know amazon
and google and facebook ur are getting
all this ink how do you find a way as an
individual and as a company to say we
are the best and we are doing amazing
things and I think Microsoft is
exemplifying it these days and I wanted
to try to really get a sense by
interviewing about 50 top thought
leaders in a variety of different fields
everything from business and technology
to real estate and genomics to
understand what makes the people who are
recognized as being the best what makes
them the best and how did they come to
that place so today I'm excited to share
with you some of the the things that I
learned in the course of interviewing
these people about how people found
their breakthrough idea and then in turn
how they came to be recognized for it so
the first strategy I'm going to share
three with you there's there's more
the book because there's there's so much
we could talk about but i want to share
three top strategies with you about how
some of the best thinkers are able to
develop their breakthrough ideas so this
is eric shot he actually used to live in
seattle he moved over a couple of years
ago to New York where I met him he's now
a top scientist at Mount Sinai Hospital
in New York but what's interesting about
him he is recognized as one of the most
prolific and interesting biologists
operating today he has written more than
200 peer-reviewed papers on everything
from Alzheimer's 2 diabetes but when he
first started out he was actually a
fairly controversial figure in the field
there was a lot of blowback that he got
and a lot of times these things go hand
in hand of course when you're doing
something really interesting really
innovative there are critics but what
Eric's special sauce was you could say
was that he didn't actually start out as
a biologist that wasn't his training he
was a mathematician and a computer
scientist that only later went into
biology and as a result in the late
1990s when the kind of technology
emerged it would allow for rapid gene
sequencing a lot of biologists look at
that looked at that and said what's what
good is that what good is that going to
do us but Eric because he had trained in
quantitative methods and was comfortable
and familiar with it saw the potential
and said let's let's get on it and as a
result he's been able to make some of
the the most critical breakthroughs in
biology of the last decade he's been
profiled twice in Esquire magazine alone
but what that comes from and I think one
of the key things that is really a
driver that I discovered in the course
of writing and reporting on stand out is
that he was willing to mix perspectives
he was willing to mix disciplines it is
very hard if you are steeped in the
ideology of one company or one field or
one way of doing things to even see what
other potential options are
to even know what they are there's the
old joke that someone asks a fish has
the water and he says what's water and I
think that's true for a lot of us that
if we if we are not consciously seeking
to draw on past experiences we've had or
expose ourselves to new ideas and new
disciplines it becomes very hard to see
what's the way that things have always
been done versus what's the way things
must be done so the first step is
learning to mix these perspectives
something that's also really important
is the concept of what i will call
tackling a worthy challenge you hear
these that these days especially in the
tech world you know there's there's
almost an epidemic of people seeking
startup funding with these tiny
incremental improvements oh you know it
does this tiny little thing we're the
uber of window-washing please give us
money and of course that's not really
what the world needs if you want to
create something they can get people
excited about it if you want to create
things that people are dying to work on
to be part of to write about to invest
in it has to be a worthy challenge from
the beginning this woman is Rita McGrath
she is a Columbia Business School
professor and she wrote a book a couple
of years ago called the end of
competitive advantage and this is
something that that actually you know a
lot of people you know here and
elsewhere talk about I mean we we all
understand I think intuitively that
change is happening more rapidly than
before disruption is everywhere but the
problem is we don't necessarily know
what to do about it no one's created a
roadmap for handling disruption but
people are aware that the products that
they had and loved five years ago are in
some cases obsolete because things have
happened so fast and moved on so what do
you do well Rita McGrath wrote this book
and part of the reason that she is
considered today one of the top strategy
thinkers in the world there's there's
literally a ranking it's called thinkers
50
every couple of years they ranked the
top 50 business thinker she is number
six on this list and the reason is that
she was willing to go headlong into
those questions to look at what do you
actually do in an era of disruption and
so she threw out suggestions things like
instead of annual budgeting switch to
quarterly budgeting so you can pivot
faster so you can innovate more
innovation can't be something off to the
side of your organization it has to
become core to the the fundamental
operations because that is how you can
survive and thrive in that new context
now if you are tackling a big challenge
a worthy challenge it's it's quite
possible you're not going to solve all
of it it's quite possible you're not
going to address the totality of it but
because people are already paying so
much attention to it even if you make a
small improvement even if you get
partway there you are going to get a
disproportionate amount of energy and
attention when we think about Elon Musk
going to the moon or something like that
these these are the kinds of visions
that get people excited what what are
our moon shots literal or proverbial
another strategy that I outlined in
stand out is the niche strategy this is
a pretty helpful pretty pretty good
entry-level strategy into thought
leadership and expertise I would say
part of the reason in general why I
think this is so important you know why
why does it matter to have breakthrough
ideas or you know to build a following
around them why do we care it's because
ultimately we think about where the
workforce is going where the economy is
going I mean you guys see this all the
time there was an Intuit study that says
by 2020 forty percent of the workforce
is going to be freelance or contractors
there's there's a push toward
commoditization for just about everyone
unfortunately
and what that means as employees is that
if we want to stay employed if we want
to have the kind of careers we want to
have where we can work in great places
and advance and grow we need to make
sure in a world where you can get
someone to do almost anything on Fiverr
or Elance or freelancer com we have to
give people a very good reason to hire
us and not someone else that might do it
cheaper and if you develop a reputation
as an expert does it have to be a world
expert and of course not everyone can be
a world expert in something but if you
can develop a reputation as an expert in
your company in your division in your
community for something that gives
people a reason to seek you out
specifically that becomes the best kind
of career insurance possible and so one
of the easy ways of beginning to dive
into this is the niche strategy so this
is so Paul here he is a political
science professor at Occidental College
in Los Angeles and he's an expert on
Cambodia which might seem like a bit of
a narrow topic in some ways if if he was
choosing what to study just based on
what would be hot and sexy you know
what's in the news all the time he
probably wouldn't have chosen Cambodia
but he chose it because when he was a
baby when he was less than a year old
his mother fled Cambodia at the hands of
the Khmer Rouge she had five children
she managed to get them all to safety
they were refugees first in France
eventually they made their way to the US
where so Paul grew up graduated got his
doctorate he wanted to study his
homeland he wanted to understand what
that was like but what he told me and
part of what I think makes his
experience his strategy so interesting
is you might think on the surface that
being an expert in Cambodia is pretty
narrow limiting your options but the
truth is if done right it's not
as he told me Cambodia is the first
store but it opens onto a hallway and
you can open just about any door from
there he became an expert ironically you
would you wouldn't imagine as a
political scientist necessarily but he's
become a recognized expert in criminal
justice he gave a popular TED talk based
on the fact that he had become expert in
studying the Khmer Rouge and the Khmer
Rouge tribunals he studied and wrote his
dissertation on foreign aid in Cambodia
and has been able to extend that to
becoming someone who is quoted and
recognized for his expertise on foreign
aid in general and because he had
studied south southeast asian livestock
extensively he had studied their
agricultural practices he was actually
able to become a noted expert again
cited repeatedly in the media when the
bird flu epidemic broke out you can
start with Cambodia and go in a lot of
different places and similarly for all
of us if we can find a niche if we can
find a place that we want to go deep
that is powerful for a couple of reasons
one is that once you are recognized as
being truly an expert on one thing you
build connections you have opportunities
you get to speak at conferences you get
to meet people from the media whatever
it is but you make connections as a
result of that initial expertise and if
you are able to then strategically move
into adjacent areas you can leverage it
there's also phenomenon in psychology
known as social proof which and the halo
effect and it shows that if you are
considered an expert by other people if
they if they look around and say oh well
you know you know he's on TV he gets
quoted in the media that impresses them
and by extension of the halo effect they
assume not just that you're good at that
one thing but that you must be smart
overall you must be good overall these
are things that are really powerful
psychological force
is so if you start small and start with
a niche if you're able to then expand
out into the adjacencies you can do
quite well so the question I have for
you what are the niches that you can own
inside the company or in your field and
how then can we expand it out
strategically so the final piece that I
wanted to share when it comes to this
first part about how to develop your
breakthrough ideas this is the story of
a guy named Michael waxen burg Michael
lives in New York he's an IT manager at
a financial services company and about
15 years ago his family was deciding
whether or not to buy a condominium
there their apartment was being condo
wised and they had to decide whether to
pull the trigger and do it so they
started going to open houses like a lot
of people right but Michael was a very
analytical guy he wanted to keep track
of the open houses that he was going to
and so he started writing reviews of all
of the properties that he was going to
and he posted them on a website a real
estate website called Street easy now
lots of people go to open houses some of
them even write reviews but usually
because they're doing it as a hobby
they're pretty short reviews they're
pretty they're pretty crappy let's face
it they don't put a lot of time into it
michael had written these beautiful
in-depth reviews they were so valuable
to other people that before too long he
started to get emails through the
website I love your reviews they're
brilliant would you represent me but he
wasn't a realtor so at first he'd offer
some advice and they'd give him a box of
chocolates but that was all he could do
but eventually he kept doing it and
before long an actual realtor wrote to
him and said look if you haven't gone
through this yet I will sponsor you you
already have a client base and so
Michael took the courses became a
realtor and now to this day has a very
successful lucrative side business that
he doesn't have to market at all because
the clients come to him through the
reviews now
what does this tell us for me what I
discovered in the course of doing this
research about thought leaders is that
one of the things that is most powerful
especially in today's world where
everyone has an opinion everyone wants
to share their opinion on the internet
and half of what we see on the internet
is opinions about opinions about blog
posts about other opinions if that is
the world that we're dealing in if you
can be dealing in fact if you can be
dealing with original research and data
as compared to just opinion upon opinion
upon opinion you will actually get
noticed disproportionately talked about
disproportionately the way that Michael
did it was through his own reviews that
he wrote about properties you could
review anything you could you know
review smartphones or bed and breakfasts
or beers doesn't really matter there's
other ways to create original research
too if you are a data person you can
crunch data you can conduct surveys you
can do interviews with experts or
interviews with people in the field to
get their actual experience you can
write case studies you can write white
papers but whatever it is if you are
creating original primary research
doesn't have to cost a lot of money this
can literally just be thinking like a
journalist and going to talk to people
but if you do that you will set yourself
apart from the people who are doing
half-baked efforts you will get noticed
for it so the first half of all of this
is about how to come up with your
breakthrough idea how do you how do you
begin to do this and in fact I'll just
mention briefly if for folks who are
interested in that question you know how
do you apply all of this to your own
lives I'll mention that on my website
Dorie Clark calm do rie CLA RK i
actually created a free 42-page workbook
that i adapted from stand out where I
asked 139 different questions that can
walk people through how to come up with
their own breakthrough ideas
build a following around it so I just
wanted to make sure you guys knew that
that was available for free on my site
but the first part is coming up with
this idea the second part though equally
important is how do you spread it
because we can't rely on the old
platitudes that we've been taught that
just yo yeah you work hard you'll get
noticed you'll get appreciated that
doesn't work anymore that has been
broken down because we live in a world
where everybody has a gazillion you know
Facebook friends and LinkedIn
connections and Twitter feeds going in
there their inboxes is pinging all the
time we are overwhelmed with connections
we're overwhelmed with information and
the result of that is that people unless
literally it is your spouse or maybe
your immediate family if you're lucky
everybody besides them is paying only
half attention to you they're not really
cluing in and so somehow we have to find
a way to rise above the noise we have to
crack that code so what I learned in the
course of researching stand out is that
when it comes to spreading an idea it's
actually a three step process that
people go through the first step is what
I call building your network this is
one-on-one connections because you have
to make sure in the early days of having
an idea that you are vetting it first
with a small trusted group of advisors
you need to do it frankly because a lot
of our ideas don't start out that great
it doesn't mean they're bad ideas but it
does mean that sometimes they need a
five percent tweak or a ten percent
tweak to make them great and sometimes
there are bad ideas and you need someone
that you trust to tell you that if you
can do that if you can cultivate that
circle that is enormously powerful the
second step is building an audience this
is where you're going from one to one
communications to one too many
communications and I'll talk about this
in a minute
but this is the more traditional version
of marketing this is where people you
know when they think how do you spread
an idea this is what comes to mind right
it's blogging it's podcasting it's you
know sharing things on social media it's
giving lectures it's somehow making
yourself and your ideas findable to
like-minded folks who are interested in
your message and then the third and
final step is you've gone from one to
one communications to one too many the
third and final step is about many too
many communications this is where your
audience turns into a community and they
turn into a community because they start
talking to each other that's where the
magic begins because they're able to
help spread your message beyond what you
could ever do on your own but so where
does all this start well in some cases
it starts with what this woman carrie
anderson dead she is now a professional
speaker she started out as a journalist
she was an Emmy award-winning journalist
and in 1989 she formed a essentially a
mastermind group of fellow journalists
where every month they would meet and
get together and trade ideas talk about
the profession share resources share
advice about different sources it was it
was helpful it was very powerful for her
but a few years after that she switched
careers became a professional speaker
and she thought well you know maybe I'll
form another mastermind group just for
speakers so that I can have that
community so she did that too but over
time she has kept both of them up now
you know given given the way the
industry has gone unfortunately half of
the people who used to be journalists or
no longer journalists but they're still
meeting one group was founded in
nineteen eighty nine the other 1994 they
have been meeting literally every single
month since then she says that this has
become the formative experience of her
professional life now not all of us in
fact probably very few are going to have
a mastermind group that
for 20 years but I'll tell you something
that we all can have and should have and
that is a group of trusted friends and
colleagues that we cultivate and can
turn to when we need to for a lot of us
we are on reactive mode if somebody
emails us and says hey let's meet up
let's have a cup of coffee you'll say
yes to that person but we're so busy we
probably are not proactively making the
time to invite out to coffee the people
that we really would like to be with and
that we can learn from and that we know
we ought to be holding close to us in
order to learn more about ourselves and
just have the companionship of a
professional who we really believe in
and trust we need to get more deliberate
about taking back our schedule and
building connections with those people
proactively so I challenge you today to
think about who are those four or five
other people that you like you respect
that you want to learn from and how can
you find ways to invite them more into
your life whether it's inviting them for
coffee once a week whether it's just
shooting them a quick email to stay in
touch when you maybe haven't been in
touch for a while but how can we be more
deliberate about that now of course the
other challenge that many of us face is
the fact that some of the people that we
already know are going to be really
helpful and important to us in terms of
our professional lives but for a lot of
us we still need to meet a lot of people
I mean the reason that networking is
important is that for literally almost
everyone you don't currently know all
the people that you need to know in
order to get where you would like to go
ultimately in your career so how do you
expand your network how do you do that
strategically because you know you could
of course just sort of get lucky and
maybe someones in an event and you meet
them but there's a problem because a lot
of the most successful people are also
the ones that have the most demands on
their time if you just send them in
email and say hey can we get coffee can
I pick your brain like everybody says
you're going to go to the bottom of the
list because they are too busy and
unless you have a very good reason
they're probably going to say no but
this gentleman was able to come up with
a strategy around that which I thought
was pretty powerful and which I included
in stand out his name is John Corcoran
and John is an attorney in the Bay Area
he's also a podcaster he has a podcast
and a blog called smart business
revolution and he decided that he wanted
to expand his network using the podcast
as his leverage that was the tool that
he had and he realized all right I can
do it so he started to make a list of
the people that he would really like to
get to know and he invited them on his
podcast guests the amazing thing about
that number one no one ever asks how
many listeners your podcast has number
two if you ask at the right time
especially John wanted to meet a lot of
business authors so he would ask when
they had a book coming out they'll
almost always say yes so john told me
that just an incredible thrill for him
was Daniel pink who if you like business
books many of you have probably heard of
he's a well-known business writer you
really wanted to meet Daniel pink and so
he waited for his moment when Dan Pink's
most recent book came out and he asks if
he could do a podcast and Dan pink said
yes so John just releases the audio but
he says that he always likes to do the
interview with video and the reason for
that is he wants the other person to
know what he looks like so that he can
build an actual relationship with them
he thinks that's really important even
though John was interviewing him in San
Francisco and Dan pink lives in
Washington that they would get to see
each other face to face and so several
months later john told me he was at a
book event in San Francisco it was
packed there was 500 people in the room
and so John you know is waiting
patiently in line he's never met dan
pink before and he goes up and he gets
finally to the
table where they're doing the signing
and dan pink looks up and says oh hi
John and that was the moment where he
knew that his strategy worked so in the
intervening several years he's made
enormous connections he's been able to
talk with his heroes and build the kind
of network that a lot of people can only
dream of but he realized that when
people say lead with value sometimes
it's not totally clear what that means
but one way that I like to think about
it if you ask someone can I pick your
brain you're you're asking for their
time the first interaction is is a favor
from them to you but if you say can i
interview you can I share your insights
on the internet with my community and
with anyone who who finds it then you're
leading with value because your first
interaction is you doing them the favor
of helping to share their ideas so
that's a powerful tool when it comes to
building the network you need that first
step the one-to-one transmission of
ideas in building your ideas so I would
be remiss when we talk about audience
building this second phase of sharing
your ideas with the world if I didn't
talk about blogging now blogging is not
the sexiest thing anymore right we have
a lot more things that are sexy people
love talking about periscope and
internet piracy they love talking about
you know Pinterest and Tumblr and and
how much you know whats app is being
sold for all these things that's what's
sexy now but what I'm interested in is
what is effective for you as a
professional and for all of us these
days as knowledge workers it's really
important to help other people
understand how you think now if you're a
coder there's there's other ways to do
it you can you know post things on
github and and get noticed there but
especially if you're someone who is
trafficking
in the ethereal in ideas if you're a
project manager you're a marketer how
does anyone know if you're any good I
mean they could call references but we
all know unless you know they have the
back-channel of who to talk to
references don't really say very much
you want to give people a way to
understand how you think and the reason
that's valuable is that number one it
gets your ideas out there so that those
like-minded people can find you but
number two it is a way of de-risking
someone doing business with you it is
very risky to hire someone it takes time
it takes money you might be hiring a
headhunter your training somebody it's
tens of thousands of dollars it's a
reasonably senior employee how can you
make it less risky for someone to want
to hire you or for someone to tap you
inside here at Microsoft to work on a
special project or if you're working
with external folks to have a client say
I want to work with her on my team how
do you make that less risky or blogging
is actually incredibly powerful because
just about anybody can you know snap a
picture or you know send a two-sentence
tweet it doesn't necessarily tell you a
lot about the person or how they think
but if you are able consistently to
share your ideas thoughtfully 700 word
essays people really begin to see how
you think but the most important thing
it's not about putting words on a page
necessarily some people hate writing and
that's okay there's podcasts there's
videos it's about sharing your ideas in
a sustained fashion that's what's really
crucial here to make your ideas
accessible to draw people in and I'll
tell you another story about another way
that you could potentially do this this
is a guy named Mike Lydon he actually is
a former employee of mine I got to know
him more than a decade ago when I hired
him for his first job out of college and
so of course I have taken an interest in
what he has done since he sadly he left
us far too soon I was
running a non-profit at the time and he
went off to graduate school to become an
urban planner so he worked at a at a
prominent firm for a few years and in
2009 which as we know was not
necessarily the greatest time in world
history to start a business in 2009 he
decided that that was the moment that he
was going to start his business now this
was particularly challenging because if
you're an urban planner who pays for
that who hires you most of the time it's
governments this was this was not a time
when governments were feeling flush and
so Mike knew he was going to have to do
something dramatic in order to get
noticed in order for people to want to
do business with his nascent firm so he
became interested in a phenomenon called
tactical urbanism he actually even named
came up with a name tactical urbanism
and he decided that he wanted to try to
capture case studies about it you know
what how what people are doing when they
do it right or what people are doing
when they do it wrong and so he created
he gathered them together created this
book of case studies and this is not
something that's necessarily going to be
the next 50 shades of grey right you're
probably not going to get a big
publisher to publish your case studies
about tactical urbanism but he decided
he wanted to share it it was important
to share it to add his voice to the
dialogue so he put it together as a PDF
and put it on his website for free
downloads and amazingly within just a
couple of months 10,000 people had
downloaded it she's a huge number if you
think about the total number of urban
planners in the country was making a
splash so he and his business partner
decided to double down on it and they
created tactical urbanism volume 2 and
put it up on their website same thing
PDF now they were getting even more
pings into them a South American
planning firm wrote to them and said we
love this can we partner with you to do
a volume just with South American case
studies they said why not so they wrote
this book they put all three PDF
for free on their website it's now five
years later a hundred and sixty thousand
times these books have been downloaded
today Mike's firm literally will receive
rfps request for proposals from
communities that it will say written
into the RFP we want a firm with
experience in tactical urbanism they're
writing it for him if you are willing to
share your ideas these days more than
ever you don't need a fancy publisher
you don't need someone in New York
telling you you can do it it's about
creating your ideas creating new
research putting it out there and being
willing to share it sometimes even just
a free PDF can make all the difference
the other thing that's important here is
somebody who who made his name working
here for a while Robert Scoble many of
you may be familiar with him technology
opinion leader extraordinaire he told me
something interesting when I interviewed
him for stand out which I think a lot of
us can apply I mean fundamentally when
it comes to scaling the impact of your
ideas we have to think about leverage
right we have to think how do we get
more leverage and so here was Robert
squabbles life hack that I will share
with you he says he gets a lot of emails
of course and a lot of times people are
asking him questions well how do I do
this or how do I do that how do i get my
startup noticed and he says that what he
always does is he writes back and says I
will answer your question but not on
email he says if you write your question
on Quora a QA website I will answer it
there and the reason he told me that he
does this is he says if I email one
person I'm helping one person but if I
put it on the internet that's helping
five people or 50 people or 500 people
that's how we have to start thinking we
have to start thinking about how to get
leverage in our professional lives how
to help more people share with more
people
finally I wanted to share this story
with you guys because I think it's
something that we all can learn from it
might sound like a little bit of a
paradox to suggest that somehow we can
or should should get luckier but this
gentleman his name is Anthony Chan and
he is a venture capitalist and a few
years back he wrote a book called heart
smarts guts and luck he and his partners
wanted to try to understand what made
successful entrepreneurs successful and
so they did hours and hours of
interviews and really trying to probe
into the questions about how did they
think and what motivated them and what
they came up with what they discovered
is that all of these entrepreneurs
really fell into four categories the
four described in the title of their
book the entrepreneurs were either heart
driven smarts driven lock driven or they
were guts driven now some of these make
a lot of intuitive sense right if you're
a hard driven entrepreneur I mean we can
all think of people that are just so
passionate you know of course they're
going to succeed because of that passion
that they keeps them going smarts driven
you know we we think about you know the
bill gates's of the world right
everybody knows their their brain has
just carried them forward and you know
they made it happen we think about guts
there are a lot of people there are a
lot of stories when it comes to
entrepreneurial success of the people
that were turned down a hundred times we
kept going the people who created a
company and failed and they pivoted and
pivoted and they finally did it because
of their guts because of their hood spa
but luck it's almost a little weird in
some ways to include that in the
category what could luck possibly have
to do with it but what Anthony Chan
discovered was that this was not just a
subset of people that were you know sort
of the dunces of the entrepreneurial
world who just you know suddenly got gut
tapped and discovered like somebody
discovered them at a shopping mall luck
means something very different luck it's
turns out is actually in orientation if
you boil luck down luck is something
that we ascribe after the fact it is a
post facto designation what luck looks
like in the moment because who knows
what's going to turn out to be lucky
right what luck looks like in the moment
is a hybrid of curiosity plus humility
if you have those two things which not
not all of us do maybe we all want to
maybe we all aspire to but not all of us
do in the moment if you have curiosity
and humility you can become lucky and
the reason for that is that so many
people you know they go to a networking
event they're constantly the people
scanning over their shoulder looking for
who's more important who should I be
talking to now they're always trying to
to get to the next thing to drive to the
next place where is the luck driven
entrepreneurs are the ones who are
actually willing to hang back just a bit
they're the ones who are willing to talk
to the person in the corner they're
willing to talk to the outliers the
person who's dressed in shabby clothes
or the person who's older than everybody
else in the room or whatever they're
willing to see where it goes they're
willing to see what they can learn from
that person and from that encounter and
it is only later that we call it luck
because they were willing to have the
conversation and to take the chance
spending their time with someone that
everybody else overlooked if we can get
more luck in our lives that's also one
of the most powerful ways that we can
begin to share our ideas and to stand
out so with that I would love to open up
the floor to your thoughts and to your
questions and thank you so much for
coming
it's also mentioned by the way I am
signing books afterwards so if anyone is
keen for that I'm hanging around for you
so folks had thoughts anybody want to
dive in feel free if you do because we
are here for you microsoft anybody yes
sir um just when you're where you talk
about niching down i think that
resonates really well because that SOB
just just a thought on the topic and
going a slightly different way that's
one of the strategies i've used with
teaching retail sales people how to sell
hmmm cuz i do windows and office
training here and what I've continually
tell new salespeople is you've got 5,000
10,000 different things in your store
forget it find one learn one learn
everything about it then learn the
product next to that on the shelf or do
that with technology or do that with a
feature there's so much stuff in what we
do you know with office go ahead be the
person in the store who learns publisher
and then learn the other stuff separate
from that so i think that's that's just
a really interesting thing that right by
just chunking it down like that getting
really specialized to be able to then
grow from out there and then those
people then tend to become the overall
expert so i think i was really
interesting to talk about that way yeah
great great story thank you so much for
sharing that and it's absolutely true i
mean one of the case studies that I
profile and stand out is a guy named
Michael Leckie who is a vice president
at Gartner the big research firm and he
told me that when when he was first
starting out he was really interested in
in his case in coaching and training and
development but he didn't know that much
about it right i mean that's where all
of us start you're interested in
something that you don't know very much
about it but he decided he wanted to
learn and once make a point of learning
and so he essentially apprenticed
himself to an outside consultant that
gartner had brought in and he started
hanging out with this guy and taking all
of his sessions and eventually he would
start assisting with a session
then he would start co-teaching the
sessions and before long he actually had
developed a reputation within his
company as being the go-to guy on
coaching and development and you know if
you at that point had taken Michael and
compared him to the world experts in it
I mean he wouldn't have compared he was
just starting in a lot of ways but he
knew more than other people in the
company and he was honest about what he
knew and what he didn't and he was
willing to share his knowledge and so if
over time you develop inside an
organization or inside a division as
being the go-to person on something who
knows just you know all it is you have
it you start out all you have to know is
more than your colleagues you will
become the go-to person and that gives
you a kind of gravitas that you can then
use so that over time you can learn more
and more to truly become an expert and
to truly master whatever you're doing so
great story thank you very much thank
you let's go to the gentleman in the
back does the future belong to
specialists is there still a place for
journalists ah yes the profound question
so niching down the niche strategy it's
one of the paths definitely not the only
path I actually I wrote a piece for
entrepreneur magazine just a couple of
days ago they came out and it's called
what to do when you have too many
passions and this is something I've
certainly faced in my own life you know
maybe some of you guys have to it's kind
of two people in the world right there's
there's the people who just you know
they know their thing they want to
pursue it and then there's kind of
Renaissance people where it's just a
little harder maybe they are generalists
I said to a certain extent fit into that
category myself if folks are interested
they can find it up on my website Dorie
Clark calm I actually have about 400
articles there so there's a lot of
material but what I suggested in that
post and and will say here is for all of
us if you're not sure if you have a lot
of passions if you're not necessarily
sure what to pursue first even because
you want to do a lot of things I am a
big advocate of placing small bets and
I'll tell you how I did this in my own
wife
so I you know since I was a kid I wanted
to write a book I thought it was really
cool just wanted to do it but I wasn't
really sure what to write a book about
because I know I had I had a million
ideas and so I actually started out in
2009 that was when I got really serious
and I'm like I'm gonna do it I'm gonna
make it happen and so I wrote three
different book proposals that year
convinced that one of them would take
but in fact I got rebuffed on all of
them because they said nope sorry you
are not famous enough to write a book
and I realized then that you know the
world it kind of changed you can't write
a book and then become famous from it
you have to kind of be at least sort of
famous and then you will be permitted to
write a book so you have to as they like
to say you have to build a platform and
so I realized for me you know I was
comfortable writing I liked writing so I
figured all right I'll get a blog but I
there was lots of stuff that I was
interested in so basically what I did
each each blog post was a little
experiment you know what what do people
like what do they respond to what is
sticking and it turned out that one of
my very early blog posts that I wrote it
was called how to reinvent your personal
brand and it came out in the Harvard
Business Review they liked it enough
they asked me to turn it into a magazine
piece for Harvard Business Review and
when that came out I got approached by
three different literary agents who said
would you like to turn it into a book I
was like ah the market is spoken and so
that was that was my first book
reinventing you that I was able to
create interestingly enough yet another
blog post that I did around around that
time ultimately turned into stand out as
well but so I'd say if you have a lot of
different passions don't you know don't
feel like you have to choose take it
take it as an opportunity to try lots of
things and then the universe and the
market will tell you what people want
you to concentrate on and you know it
doesn't it doesn't mean it has to be the
only thing you do but it can be the
thing that you do first so yes ma'am
curious about your ideas and interviews
with people on tackling the worthy
challenge so wondering if in the
entrepreneurs that you talked with you
saw any trends or patterns with people
who took up the worthy challenge well
you know one one thing that I heard from
a number of people about this kind of
worthy challenge question and I think
that that this is a little bit of a
Commons strand throughout the book is
the fact that it's it's really important
I mean if we if we are coming up with
our breakthrough idea if we are creating
something that is genuinely you know new
and valuable contribution that we can
make it's not necessarily something that
that comes and hits us like lightning
from outside oftentimes it is something
that actually germinates from inside
based on our own personal unique
experience that only we have because
that is what enables our perspective to
be different on an issue and so one
person that I interviewed who I think is
indeed sort of the epitome tackling a
worthy challenge is a woman named Rose
Schumann rose when she was 18 years old
she'd grown up in suburban Maryland she
was 18 years old she and her family took
a family vacation to Nicaragua and they
went there because her stepmother was
Nicaraguan and it was to visit her
stepmothers family it was shortly after
the Contra war that this visit took
place and Rose had never seen anything
like this and she had grown up in a
comfortable suburban environment all of
a sudden she's thrown into a place where
there's poverty everywhere people are
hungry there's one literally one
streetlight functioning in the entire
country the infrastructure is just gone
because they've spent a decade at war
and it's struck her hard enough that she
said I want to do something about this I
want to make an impact and so sure
enough she went off to college and she
studied international development while
she was there and after she graduated
she got a job at an NGO and so while she
was doing this well she was immersing
herself in this passion of hers that
stemmed from her family vacation she was
walking around one day and she suddenly
noticed something that we all probably
see all the
time you probably see it on the
microsoft campus here but it just hit
her in a different way that day it was a
call box you know the little boxes like
in a transit station where you just push
a button and you talk to somebody a lot
of people have been trying for a long
time to solve the problem of how do you
bring the power of the internet which
you know we all know is incredibly
helpful and beneficial how do you bring
the power of the Internet to the world's
poorest people so your may be familiar
with a one laptop per child initiative
that's gotten a lot of press Rose
thought about that and she said all
right well that's good but first of all
you have to figure out how to make the
laptops be cheap you still have to get
you know money for them even if they got
it down to a hundred dollars a laptop
it's still a lot of money you have to
somehow figure out how to keep them
powered you have to somehow figure out
how to keep them safe you have to teach
people how to use them and then you have
to make sure they're literate which is
pretty hard for the bottom let's say 1
billion and then you have to make sure
that they're literate in a language
where there's actually stuff on the
internet in it which is very hard for
people if they are from rural tribal
communities how do you short-circuit all
that is there a way to cut the Gordian
knot and Rose thought about it and she
realized you could make a call box and
so she spent the next four hours
feverishly taking her journal writing
down her ideas what was born that day
and in fact has become her life's work
for the last decade with something
called question box which is an NGO that
literally does this in rural villages
they will plant these question boxes
these these call boxes where villagers
can go up in their own language push a
button ask a question to a person
stationed at the other end of the line
who is usually in a city who is
bilingual and who has an
internet-enabled computer and those
people look up questions in real time
and feed the answers back now its
operating in a lot of India and Africa
right now and in fact last fall during
the height of the Ebola
demak in Liberia roses question box
played a pivotal role because all the
aid workers had to leave they all had to
vacate these villages and one of the
only ways the dilla jerz could actually
get reliable information about what was
happening and where and how to protect
their families was through the question
box where they could talk to people at
the other end of the line so I would say
to your question that when it comes to
developing ideas that matter the kinds
of things that that you are proud to
share and they can become part of your
brand inside the company here at
Microsoft and in the world a lot of
times it starts with our own experiences
and finding the message the gift that
only we can share and that that enables
us to to keep pushing through if you're
able to find your idea through some of
these strategies and are willing to
share it are willing to be generous by
writing about it talking about it
enabling other like-minded people to
find you it can begin to gain a kind of
traction in the kind of power that will
help your career and also help the world
so I want to be respectful of
everybody's time I know we've got
meetings and all of that we have books
in the back some people are all cagey
about it I won't be pleased by my book
it's awesome I think you'll love it and
I would love especially to meet you so
thanks very much I'll be signing books
is there anything else that you need Amy
all right team Microsoft thank you take
care
