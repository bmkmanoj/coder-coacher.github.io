you
ed and get started with the first school
we have the Royal Danish Academy of Fine
Arts and they will be speaking to you
about their project Luca lie hello we
are from the Royal Danish Academy of
Fine Arts the School of Design and I'm
Nicolina I'm perfect I'm Monica and I'm
younger and we have worked with a
project about children and technology
which we have explored through a method
of participatory design okay we have a
problem with the clicker oh yeah that's
it yeah so thank you very much thank you
so now is the break sorry we are
experiencing technical difficulties okay
yes so children and technology we're
gonna talk to you today about Enya who
is a daycare teacher in Danish daycare
and we're going to share with you her
greatest fear but first we need to talk
a little bit about the Danish context in
Denmark most young children are in
daycare every day and it's a normal
daily occurrence to go on field trips
and the daycare will take the children
out into the traffic in the city and
they'll be walking through open nature
areas in Denmark now we found that
through our conversations with teachers
that they experienced a lot of stress
and worry when they go on field trips
because they have to keep track of large
groups of children and so Enya told us
that her biggest fear
in her professional life is actually to
lose a child the stress that Anya and
other teachers like her experience makes
them be very strict with the children
and very preoccupied with actually very
preoccupied with counting them and
figuring out where they are and very
distracted from actually teaching so you
could say that you know a simple
solution to this problem could be to put
a GPS monitoring device on the kitten
let that be it we tried out this
approach with a prototype that gave off
an alarm
whenever at you and whenever a child
came too far away from the group yeah I
heard some people laughing yeah as maybe
you can imagine they didn't really like
wearing it that very much it felt quite
restricted by it and they frequently
came up to us and asked if they were
allowed to take it off so that was a big
insight and actually later in the
process when we tried out a more playful
interactive prototype that put some of
the responsibility of figuring out where
they were supposed to be on the children
themselves we had a lot of better
response to it but more on that later we
explored this issue or this relationship
between trust and responsibility with
Professor Ian campement from a Danish
University and he told us that children
naturally developed by pushing
boundaries by exploring them and that
they will only learn to take
responsibility if they are surrounded by
a trusting environment one last insight
was that these daycare teachers are busy
and they expressed a lot of concern at
the idea of having to carry around a
device in their hands that they have to
look at so frankly they feel like they
have their hands full so for our design
solution we found that our product
should allow children to explore these
boundaries in a safe way that children
should be able to learn about
responsibility through the acts of play
and that we wanted to work with how to
create engage
she went from the children so that they
would enjoy wearing the product so that
they would feel like it was their own
and they didn't want to take it off
Patrick is gonna tell you about how we
obtained the first two goals and Monica
is gonna talk about how we worked with
creating engagement through a
participatory design process all right
thank you
my so this is our concept called local I
which is a combination of the word
location and the Danish word for play
actually local I has a very unique
approach to solving this mentioned
safety issue as it's not just monitoring
the kids but it's actually teaching them
to be safe through responsibility and
play so the concept is a wristband won't
buy children children and teachers on
daycare field trips and when activated
always get represented a small glowing
dots on the pants and this allows group
members to easily find and play with
each other on greater distances so to
define a safe zone boundary a teacher
simply draw it on a map in a smartphone
app and this is only quiet once and can
be done from the safe home at the
daycare center so when children gets
near this predefined boundary
their response starts to vibrate
increasingly and this tactile response
is to remind the children not to get
further away from the group if a child
chooses to ignore this vibration a
teacher gets a a vibration alarm and the
teachers location or the child's
location is shown as a red dot on the
under teachers band so we work with this
kind of graduate response which leaves
room for the children's natural
expression of boundaries and in the same
way teaches them about responsibility as
Noble I mentioned we didn't want this
product highly sophisticated product
should be just another interruptive
element in the teacher's day which is
why we design locally with a
low-resolution
ility interface which communicates the
information in a very calm and direct
way because of this local I don't
require very much attention
which then can be focused on what is
most important which of course is the
case yes but even this functionality we
show here does not make a product that
the children would necessarily want to
wear so I'm going to show you how we
work with creating more engagement from
the children through a participatory
design process so to develop playful
functionalities we created prototypes
that could create colors and light and
vibrations we included groups of
children and actively playing and
creating ways to use these bands so in
this video you see the children using
the prototypes and in contrast to the
monitoring prototype that we tried
earlier on these more interactive
functions created a lot more engagement
from the children so one of the
functionalities that grew out of these
playful sessions is that the colors
change when two kids put their
wristbands together when we try this out
with the kids they incorporated the
color change into their play and use the
different colors to signify roles in
tech games and because you have to be
two children cooperating to change the
colors we found that it encourages
interaction and communication among the
more shy kids we also picked these
location-based games such as treasure
hunts and hide-and-seek
where we were using low-tech paper
prototypes and compasses to simulate the
functions of the response
so these location-based games they may
they motivate the children to make use
of larger areas and this results in
physical activity and in exploration of
the nature so underneath and you can see
the other group members represented as
small dots in a given direction for the
children we found that it made more
sense for each person to be represented
as a small dot rather than grouping dots
or showing an arrow and this is because
children of this age are very concrete
in their understanding of objects and
relations so one person is one dot
including children it does changed and
shaped our product
and created a product that the children
would be engaged in not only the adults
you to conclude we have experienced that
children are very innovative beings and
they will make up many new uses for very
simple product at first we worried about
how to include children in the creation
process but we found great great
possibilities in engaging them through
play during this process we began to
think of our product more and more as a
platform for play which can be utilized
in many different ways by children and
adults this concept of group navigation
almost like a group since we believe can
be used in many other situations for
example in sports and mass gatherings
such as demonstrations and festivals in
this project we'll learn the importance
of regarding children as true
stakeholders can technology and non
disruptive solutions and the importance
of working with stakeholders in a
concrete context these learnings enabled
us to make a tool for learning group
navigation through play the multiple
functionalities of local I included
vibrational signals color chains and
direction to other group members instead
of Enya spending all her energy and
being strict at the kitsch you now can
focus on what is most important for her
creating a joyful environment for living
great thank you thank you does one of
our critics wanna start us off excellent
excellent job I loved that you shared
the story of putting the wristband on
the kids and how much they hated it
that is a true part of design and it
wouldn't have been an honest
presentation without that thank you I
had a question two questions is one did
you test this with parents and what did
parents who were not in location think
about it if you did test it with parents
and then the second question is what
happens in the failure mode what if the
technology doesn't work what's the
back-up plan and does that make Anja is
she satisfied with the back-up plan
teachers that we had involved and they
were saying yes but they should not be a
sleeping pill oh of course you still
need to be aware and to keep an eye on
everything and this is their
responsibility mainly so it will be a
hill but it's not a replacement for
anything what's the first question
well we spoke to some parents in the
beginning who did not really like the
the monitor ation of in kindergarten but
that was mainly when you had cameras and
we're sort of very tracking them and all
through the day so this this approach of
I mean you don't use the information you
can't sit look remotely and look at them
it's mostly for like locally them
knowing where they are in relation to
each other I think that softens up the
whole monetization
thing that high a couple of questions
I'm first felt again I agree totally the
the fact that you got the feedback from
the kids and included that in the
presentation is huge did you two
questions one did you did you what did
you think of some of the various
previous prototypes of this like where
net or
the wristbands at Disney things like
that and to in talking with Anya and the
kids did you find that there were any
field trip activities where the games
that the bands afforded were disruptive
of the activity versus were not and what
how did the the activity that the band's
afforded change the field trip
activities I think I can talk to the
last one actually a large part of the
pedagogy of Danish daycare centers is
that we have less of a preschool
approach to it and more of an open play
approach to it so in most cases when you
go out and explore areas it would be
sort of open play where the children and
the adults would sometimes play together
and most of the times just the children
playing by themselves so in those kind
of situations I don't think it would
have a disruptive effect one thing that
you could push the product further would
be while they're in transport we also
consider this quite a lot because that's
a big part of the field trip is that you
don't get into a bus in Denmark and
drive somewhere you go through public
transportation and go and so for that
part of the trip I'm thinking that that
yeah how could we put it that it could
be we were speaking about that it could
be maybe on a on a nap or something so
you can customize for which kind of trip
you're going on if you're going into the
S train or to the buses you can sort of
customize it to understanding when it's
all the children in the bus
is there somebody missing or when you're
walking on a street and there is traffic
out here is there a special limit where
you cannot go through the street but
apart from the safety thing it's also
very much about seeing each other and
playing with this which making also the
the awareness footage kids of where's
the other where is the other group
members where am I supposed to be in
according to the other group members so
just the fact that this this awareness
is created hopefully also even though
it's not the boundary is not created it
still will help for the safety but about
the disruptive effect a big part of the
the project has been about how to make
some how to make a product that can
exist in the periphery so that you don't
miss you're not interrupted by it unless
something's wrong but you can use it
actively if you feel that it enriches
the experience or you can use it somehow
so that's I feel like that was what you
were we're getting at right yeah so
first thanks a lot yeah it was really
interesting I first just wanna make a
comment that I I really like the visual
language you used in terms of presenting
it's interesting because you used a low
fidelity of of the concept which is
appropriate because it's your primary in
a real setting so it's set in context so
congratulations it shows good set it
gives conviction your abilities
designers right so the second thing is I
Denmark has a terrific tradition in
participatory design you invented it and
and and I like how you practice but I
have really interesting a question for
me that I'm fascinated by when did you
engage the professor to talk about this
notion about let's say the epistemology
that the the how children burn in the
boundaries and that when did that happen
in the in your design process I think
that was about half way in we had of
course done a lot of research about the
pedagogy or the year like the theory but
we wanted him to be an active partner in
talking about the product so about half
way in because I think this is more a
comment a question for because it's real
interesting it's a lot of people who
have not engaged deeply in participatory
design in it that she was just you get
the clients to do the design as in fact
here there's clear conceptual leadership
that can only come from a design
professional and but then you work with
that and and and couple it and and how
you have managed it and and it's really
really well so congratulations it's a
it's a very very well thought we've run
out of time so guys we'll have to
continue this conversation later should
I thank you very much thank you again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
