hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
afternoon thank you for staying my name
is Erika diuretic I'm the chair for the
session on education and this is a good
time to cue verifies there is a parallel
session on life sciences hey if you
interested in that one is in the room
104 just downstairs here so this is
probably your you're right choice this
is the best session to stay and welcome
we have three presentations here and
also to know to mention that this
session is broadcast live so then people
around the world watching us so this way
we'll try to stick to the schedule every
presentation will be allocated 30
minutes which include questioning so we
suggest keeps like 20-25 minutes to
present and then questioned him so there
are three exciting presentation and we
the first one will be on instant lab to
a platform for operating system
experiments on public cloud
infrastructure this will be presented by
group from Germany and led by Professor
andreas poles who is the operating
system in Middle where Professor it has
a planner Institute of University of
Bodom he is have long record of doing
very interesting work from both research
on distributed system middleware and
cloud but also he doing very exciting
work on teaching and learning this
environment and this is what he will be
talking about he's also have and we need
to upload and race for bringing five
four students here his PhD in master
student who are also not only helping on
his work but also learning
yeah and one of them Christian new house
will also help him to present and there
without just pass the microphone to
andreas thank you thanks thanks Arkady
okay good afternoon everybody title of
the presentation is instant lab 20 and
as Arkady mentioned Christian law house
who is PhD student in my group will give
part of the presentation and we have an
emma is another PhD soon she is almost
done and contributed to the paper listen
Kessler and french ligue are two master
students who work in the implementation
of in simpler what is instant lev about
it's not about cloud curricula if you
read this announcement for Microsoft you
might think that everybody is now using
the cloud for teaching but it's not what
they are telling here is that your
curriculum should incorporate some cloud
related material we think in the
opposite direction it is about doing
traditional or covering two additional
software engineering topics covering
operating systems topics but using the
cloud as an infrastructure where you run
your experiments what kind of
experiments for many years almost 10
years now we have been giving
undergraduate and graduate lectures on
operating systems using Windows as a
case study materials have been available
since 2006 I believe as curriculum
resource kit and there is also a version
of divinos karma which is called wkbt
News research como which we use in our
experiments so our instant lab started
out as an idea or started out from from
our expertise in using windows as a
vehicle for teaching operating system
concepts to undergraduate and graduate
students venice by itself is interesting
de vinos research Colonel gives you
access to all the internal
all the details if you pick up the right
DVD there are three DVDs and you can
choose and your chances one set to pick
the right one where this winners
research Colonel will be on so it's in
the faculty resources this is good this
is interesting what do you do with
Windows research como we define the
three-phase approach and phase 1 and
phase 2 the you face and the M phase are
pretty much applicable to any software
engineering project first thing is you
learn in our faces we call this the you
phase like user mode you concentrate on
OS concepts you talk about api's and
systems programming then comes the M
phase where you talk about monitoring in
other software engineering projects that
will be like testing so you want to
observe the concepts at runtime you want
to introduce the monitoring tools and
you want to do system measurements and
then comes the K phase and this is
unique to operating systems that you
talk about the kernel which means
students are asked to implement new
system calls for instance are asked to
change system data structures like the
list of processes and so forth and
obviously this works well for Windows
but also far as operating systems like
UNIX or Linux if you want to now after
giving this lecture over and over a
couple of years to challenges came up
one challenge is your equipment will
eventually retire right you get a new
notebook computer you have to set up all
the software you figure that the
configuration you use on the other
computer is no longer available for
download so you have consistency
problems if you run the tests and
demonstration and experiment environment
it is a question of work just effort
setup work but it's also question of our
aging and changing software so the idea
was instead of doing this on the
presenters notebook instructors notebook
or on a student's notebook
every time new the idea was to put the
test and experiment environment in the
cloud actually there are two separate
problems one problem is you want to keep
experiments in a recruit reproducible
form this has been solved by using
virtualization and in fact alexander
schmidt former PhD of mine who is now
with microsoft he produced an entire set
seven or so of experiments which are
available via msdnaa and target wlk and
windows 7 they come as virtual machine
images so you take them run them on your
computer and do the experiment the other
program that you as presenter as
lecturer have to set up your environment
locally in order to run these virtual
machine images this problem remains and
here the solution would be if we have
everything in a cloud then we would just
go to a browser-based interface and run
experiments from there this brought us
to the architecture print out a
blueprint for for instant lab to read oh
you want to have front end this one and
gives you some interface to the
experimentation you want to have
management for evil machines and turns
out that these common type experiments
are in particularly interesting because
in order to do kernel development or
kernel debugging on operating systems
you typically need two systems you have
one system under test and you have a
second system with where you are under
debug on now with cloud none of the
cloud providers today offer you to
connect to computers via selig serial
link 0 line and then expose them to the
internet so vm management is an
interesting fashion also storage and
then we've just ver not sure about your
right interface turn out amazon was
early and the de facto standard so we
defined our architecture to use
amazon web services as interface but we
also have provided for other clouds one
of them is a private cloud hyper-v based
which runs in our data center and then
the question can come comes up how do we
address students and as long as you do
everything in your own private word in
your university in your lecture you know
the students obviously but what if you
want to go bright a broader scale to
give you an expert and an idea what what
to expect from the environment this is
the screenshot running little
performance monitoring experiment in the
cloud and hear your web browser-based
interface shows some paging activity
this is another screenshot showing
debugger and debug II so two systems
interconnected why a virtual serial line
and this this is so-called common type
of experiment and this is actually a
little movie showing our management
infrastructure which allow us you and a
lousy and an authenticated and and user
to start up little machines and to get
an interface to the machines and to link
the these systems into the system under
test and end and debugger it goes slowly
this is something you have to notice as
well all this cloud vision is nothing
like on demand and next second you have
the system running but it takes time
bring up virtual machines takes up to 10
minutes also in error and any other
cloud public clouds but also in the
private flow so the story is basically
if you wait long enough you will get the
screenshot you saw before okay let's go
what is and now we change roads and
Christian is talking a little bit about
his research
yes em this is the part that I'm going
to talk about because it's the bit in
this project that actually concerns me
so up until now we've been talking about
instant lab as a sort of closed off
version that we've been using in in our
own University where we use it for
teaching students and undergraduate
opera operating systems class and maybe
just a few connected schools but the
part that I want to talk to you about is
what's the actual to a two point O part
that in making instant lab public so
there's a current trend of making
teaching material available online
increasingly there's of course the
Microsoft faculty connection M which the
windows resource kit is is part of their
we contributed to this with the
curriculum resource kit with the
exercises and there's actually Stanford
making has been making lecturers
available for quite some time now and
there's a huge supply of online lecture
material on on iTunes U which our has a
partner Institute actually contributes
to as well and I think about 1% of the
german-speaking downloads are actually
hpi lectures that have been recorded in
our place and similar to the Microsoft
faculty connection there's the academic
aliens of IBM and we want to follow that
trend with instant lab and by not only
making teaching material available
online but actually putting exercises on
the internet for to be used by the
public and we want to do that by by
using public cloud infrastructure we
actually have been doing this by in the
current version of instant lab but we
want to do this on a fully self service
platform and that's the actual tough
part that I want to talk about so like I
said M instant lab as we've been using
it up until now has been limited to a
group of users which means it's it's a
number of views that you can actually
oversee and you know them because
they're the students at your university
but if you actually make it
available to the public as in as in
actual to point o its first of all a
potentially very large group of users
and the second fact is you know nothing
about these users they come to your
system fresh and you don't know who
you're dealing with and the problem with
that is first of all how do you deal
with the administration effort to to
administer I've managed all these people
and secondly how do you decide who gets
to use which resources of your platform
and this is the reason why we want to
make instant lab fully self managed in
the future and there's two important
points here that I'm going to explain to
you the first very important thing is we
want to make the self-management
completely working on trust
relationships we redeveloped with the
users and secondly we want to want to
have the provisioning of experiments to
take place fully automatic em in the
future but so about the motivation for
having access control based on trust I
don't want to do this we provide
experiment resources to the public and
this experiment resources actually cost
money and resources on a platform even
if they may be plenty they're still
costly and there and they're limited at
some point and we know what what cloud
platforms can do up until now is
actually to cap resource at a certain
level so if you want to say maybe hand
an amount of resources to have student
worth ten dollars this is not currently
possible you can just grant access and
hope they're not going to exceed your
limit but what you might want to do is
is through hell
this is work okay Brooks very well is
that okay okay so as I was saying is we
assume you might want to do something
with this like this with your resources
but the question is now how do you find
out who a few users who initially know
nothing about is an expert who is a
beginner and who gets to be an advanced
user um well our idea is that um use the
interactions of the users with a
platform to constitute a user's
reputation shouldn't switch to this okay
um so we use things that the user does
on the platform to constitute a
reputation of the user so that for could
for example be successfully completed
experiments and the evaluation of the
results of these experiments we could
look at community interactions so if
users provide good advice to other users
on the platform that could constitute a
good reputation of a user just as well
we intend to have online lessons and in
quizzes so we can actually test for the
learning process of these lessons and
not least referrals and recommendations
made by others for certain users so this
is ew's reputation but um there's a
different term that that we need to use
for that and that is trust and Trust is
what you actually make of these
reputations so actually em all these
things that constitute a user's
reputation you have to bring on your own
weighting scheme and your old
calculation school and by that you
derive a certain level of trust you
place in that user and just to explain a
little bit more about that concept of
trust it's the degree and twitch you're
ready to actually confide in someone
who's using your platform and it is
specifically not am a yes or no value
but it's actually on a sliding scale for
example a trust value you have an a user
could be 0 point seven three and the
second important thing to note is that
it's a multi-dimensional value so you
don't only apply that trust value in one
general category but you can rate users
and services
you think they provide a correct
computation or they are reliable or they
do not intend misuse of your platform
and it's also something that can be
applied between humans between actual
services on the internet and between
services and people and this middle
category is actually what we want to do
because we're providing a service and
that service makes decisions based on
how much trust we place in the user and
the question is now how do we actually
develop a trust relationship with a user
like I told you when someone first comes
to this platform we know nothing about
the people they just sign up with the
platform and what we want to do in the
first step is we want to assign an
initial trust value to that user because
we need some value to get started with
and everything we can find out about the
user in advance we use to constitute
that initial trust value so for example
we might know from a user's email
address that he's affiliated with a
research institution or that he's a
computer science student and this would
actually go to be a reason to assign him
a higher trust failure and what we do
then consequently whenever the user has
an interaction with a platform like
completing an experiment providing
advice to other users we use that
according to our own calculation scheme
to influence and potentially increase
the trust value we have for that user
and I'll tell you we want to use that
trust value to actually control who gets
to access which kind of resources or
we're imagining to work something like
this we to each one of our resources we
label them how expensive and how high
level these resources actually are so
there might be these user mode and
metering experiments that we don't write
so highly in in cost value so we don't
require as much a trust value for these
experiments but for example for the for
the colonel experiments that involve
cost intensive to virtual machine
debugging sessions with the platform we
require a very high fat faster before
the user and for example in a case like
this when a user comes in with a trust
value of 0 point eight five he could
actually do
first two categories of experiments but
the most expensive category of
experiments is not yet available for to
that user only if he completes further
experiments on the platform and
increases his trust on you so and this
it from my side and I would give the
floor back to undress to summarize this
is the idea so you have something which
is called reputation you have trust and
you have basically history on the
platform this history is established
through experimentation this is one
piece of history and two tests its
students undergo tests and then we have
the idea of community basically you can
also sync of ranking schemes that ebay
uses and other two dot Oh kind of
applications typically use turns out in
order to run all kinds of experiments it
is very desirable and and necessary in
fact to connect the public and private
cloud here so we have planning and
ending are in the process of building
our own private cloud in the in the lab
and we evaluated the different platforms
available for for building cloud
infrastructures today and came up this
open nebula as platform of choice this
is due to the fact that not all private
cloud platforms support all kinds of
virtualization techniques for running VM
images in the cloud and I mentioned
before our previous infrastructure was
hyper-v based and this hyper-v or
Microsoft virtualization is supported by
open nebula but not in other cloud
private cloud infrastructures the next
big thing is authentication how do you
out n dicate somebody whom you don't
know the idea is when a user comes to
the platform for the first time he
we'll get a signed in an ID random ID
basically and using this ID we can
recognize the user later on we want to
have a session concept we want to have a
single sign-on we have want to have
secure connection between the users
display at the cloud computer where the
experiment runs and turns out there is a
number of options how you do the
authentication so you we are we're
currently are planning to go with open
ID in this in this place and connecting
with the cloud from the browser that
sounds very easy but if you ever try to
acquire the boot screen from your
computer for screenshot or whatever then
you know where the problem is if you do
carmo experiments then most of the
action happens before the operating
system actually starts so you want to
display the boot screen from your system
under test why are some remote desktop
protocol while you ENC you want to do
this in a secure fashion and you want to
do it in a portable fashion so that it
can be displayed in any browser on the
market which means IE for maybe maybe
not our current solution is based on on
JavaScript and html5 however we are also
planning to support outlet based
approaches that would run in very old
browsers because if you if your target
audience is the entire internet
potentially then you can you cannot be
sure about the environment that's that's
being run by the consumers
it has a platen Institute important we
started 2010 there is a project which is
called future sock lab I diverse to
acquire are up to date and
pre-production hardware from a number of
vendors for experimentation with large
databases and consolidation
visualization high-performance computing
so large renders large computers we got
a couple of actually three of ddr 1980s
which are have 64 cause 128 logical
processors and two terabyte of memory we
got also from fujitsu couple computers
IBM is giving a system which is not
int'l architecture so number of partners
among them SI p and there if you would
be interested to connect this the lab
there is a call for project twice a year
there's a steering committee and you
just can go and propose a project title
and project proposal and volley
ventually get access to the computer
resources and latest edition was 2000
core computer which is basically a
cluster in a box if you will but this
thing has really a thousand compute
cause each of these nodes comes with a
char byte of memory so it's 25 termite
memory it's about I believe 100 terabyte
of SSD and then some some storage behind
so this is not big in terms of the
exascale and whatever have you their
projects but to be available at a
university institute it's it's not bad
either so this is the place where we are
going to run our private cloud and that
brings me to the conclusions so first we
learned that maintaining operating
systems experiments so that you can
demonstrate it to your students that you
can assign give assignments to students
and just use it for teaching this is a
cumbersome task if you want to do it for
a number of years in a row I mean doing
it one
is interesting doing it a second time in
a third time becomes a challenge on a
provider side virtualization is the
answer because you can roll up
everything and put this into a virtual
machine image and show the virtual
machine image on the student however the
student still has to maintain his or her
environment and putting the experiments
into the cloud would lift that debt
burden on the consumer side next we
learn that not all the clouds are equal
right and in particular public clouds
none of them I mean error there are some
some not not really announced features
but none of the public clouds today
allowed to talk about collocations so if
you want to say please put these two
virtual machine images on the same
physical hardware there's just no
vocabulary for doing this and it can get
even worse if you want to ask for
co-located physical computers the best
you can say is get me on the east coast
or the west coast that's the level of
granularity with the conclusion form
from that observation is that we need to
deal with public and private cloud
system simultaneously we need a generic
architecture for public and private
clouds in our first experiments because
Amazon was readily available we choose
amazon web services st Kwazii standard
but we have interfaces to the other
clouds as well and the final our bottom
line basically if you want to go
internet scale if you want to provide
experimentation and teaching offerings
to many students then everything has to
be self-managed you don't know your
audience so the notion of trust and your
reputation is crucial in any picture and
our approach is to adopt techniques that
have been established for social
networks this concludes my talk thank
you for your attention
hey a couple of questions I'm sorry I
didn't understand what you do with the
windows kernel debugger okay yeah this
is the thing there are a number of
experiments you can do on an operating
system you can write a program that
exercises certain api's or you can use
performance monitor like here and and
see the value of performance counters
changing and so forth but you also can
go ahead and say I want to change the
colonel I want to implement a new system
call and this is what we do with our
students right I'm sorry the the you
can't attach a debugger to a virtual
machine across the internet so that's
what I meant by what do you do with the
windows kernel debugger no no the
windows kernel debugger is a piece of
software which comes from Microsoft
obviously and this makes assumptions
about the underlying hardware and one of
the assumptions is that this windows
kernel debugger will talk to the debug e
via a serial line and now the question
is if your debug e or if your debugger
is running in a cloud how do we connect
those two and certain virtual machine
environments allow or have the notion of
virtual serial links and others don't
and the challenge is used one of the
public cloud infrastructures of your
choice set up to VM images and get them
running and have them linked together
and this is not possible
more questions thank you undress thank
you okay group of seven our next
presenter is from Singapore is the
Faculty of nanyang polytechnic in
university and its a golem he will be
talking about how they implemented cloud
computing teaching in the university
also interesting aspect as in gary is
working with Microsoft Innovation Center
and they set up some technology center
that they helps introduce teaching to
other universities in the region okay a
very good afternoon to everyone thanks
for having me over here extremely
excited to attend this event despite the
16-hour flight from Singapore so forgive
me if I'm a bit slow this afternoon all
right um I'm Gary I'm actually from the
from Singapore and one of the leading
tertiary Institute's nanyang polytechnic
and i'll be sharing with you this
afternoon on how we collaborated with
microsoft in order to infuse cloud
computing into all our IT diplomas in
nanyang polytechnic let me start off
with just running to some agenda that i
have planned for this presentation I'll
probably talk a bit about nanyang
polytechnic or in short nyp i will speak
a bit about the curriculum that we have
the structure and this will really form
the background of how we actually infuse
cloud computing into our actual
curriculum then of course i'll go into
the gist of the whole presentation about
cloud infusion and how our students can
benefit from that not forgetting a
practical approach by project
development some a lot like to highlight
some student success
in various areas and going forward how
do we see this collaboration going and
how will we be taking cloud computing in
nanyang polytechnic to a higher level
and we'll end up with short Q&amp;amp;A so let
me first start off with what nanyang
polytechnic is all about we are
basically located in Singapore small
island in the eastern part of the world
establish in 1992 so we just celebrated
our 20th anniversary so we are
relatively young about 20 years old and
our vision is really to be a premier
polytechnic of global distinction and I
will share with you how we've actually
brought ourselves to the global stage
got our students known by other
universities around the world at the
moment we have about 15,000 students and
about thousand three faculty members
working across a single campus in
Singapore we were awarded the innovation
excellence award in 2009 and this is
really something that I'd like to share
because Daniel Polytechnic prides itself
with being innovative using IT in
different ways for students to think and
do things differently and more recently
in 2011 we will award the Singapore
quality award and this is really a
recognition for our world-class standard
in terms of performance excellence and
this award is actually awarded every
year to only one or two companies in
Singapore so I have a short video clip
on how the whole journey started so this
is a about a two minute video clip
so what exactly is cloud computing will
cloud computing essentially lets you
store data on someone else's computer
server to companies like it because it
helps them run more efficiently they
don't have to maintain as many internal
you can access software or your
information online without having it to
be stored locally total cloud spending
will top 40 billion dollars by 2012
that's almost triple what is your time
it's the opportunity and the cloud forms
the basis Windows Azure is Microsoft's
cloud computing platform is that it's
designed to be a place to run your
application at scale out on the internet
now with the launch of the mic nyp
Microsoft cloud Innovation Center in
April last year it's really to us as a
landmark collaboration because we are
bringing together the best of Education
and the best of software technology the
objectives is really to train students
through curriculum by infusing cloud
computing in every single aspect that we
teach daily at nanyang polytechnic this
collaboration also allows us to access
the latest in the cloud services
provided by Microsoft and this includes
things like office 365 and many many
others the center also engages in R&amp;amp;D
research and development work to provide
solutions to the industry and this is
noteworthy because the students will be
working a close supervision with the
lecturers involved to deliver actually
real-life industry projects to clients
we will also train students in
professional certifications and Ezra to
attain their microsoft certified
professional developer certifications as
well as of course internship
opportunities for our students in both
local and overseas Microsoft
subsidiaries this article at a bit on
the business times in Singapore really
articulates the difference the things
that we are doing and at the end of the
day we are going to train 4,000 students
to be cloud ready by the time they
graduate after the Koreas stay in
nanyang polytechnic this picture was
taken during the launch of the center
and we are really really happy that it
was actually graced by mr. Kevin Turner
who flew down to grace the launch of the
cloud innovation center 19 april 2011
was by far the most stressful day in my
working career for to lunch actually the
center but i'm happy to mention that the
efforts the hard work and all that has
gone a tremendous have done the students
a tremendous
allow them to reap the benefits of all
these hard work and efforts that we are
put in let me just touch on on a bit
about the curriculum structure that we
have for students over the three years
we actually have at the moment seven IP
diplomas from the School of Information
Technology the flagship one being the
diploma and information technology which
was started in 1993 that was the first
IT diploma that we actually launched
today we have total of seven diplomas
and if you notice by the names we
actually fuse in both business and
engineering together with IT because
it's-- but predominant force in every
aspect of our lives today we have a
staff training of about 142 today and
annual intake of about seven hundred and
thirty students and Ollie the cost
structure basically divided up into
three different years in the year one
and year two we train our students in
the call and fundamental aspects of what
I tea is all about subsequently they
will actually specialize in areas which
they are interested in it could be
information security it could be games
design it could be many many others
specializations that we have we also end
off with a semester project at the end
of each semester basically one semester
it's about six months and we end up with
a big semester project where students
will in teams of four to five members
and they develop and deliver a actual
solution that is cloud ready on your
three students similar to all other
institutions we send our students out
for company attachments as well as doing
a final year project we also have
created a option of general studies and
this is ready to train students outside
of vit curriculum things like effective
presentation skills leadership training
and this is really for them to hone
their soft skills and also life skills
and in our diploma plus program we
actually call the students back
during the summer vacations to actually
equip them with the necessary technical
knowledge in order to pursue
professional ID certifications such as
your microsoft certified professional
developer and all this added up together
we of course hope that the students will
be able to learn some soft soft skills
and also hold their life skills as well
now the gist of the presentation is how
we actually infuse cloud into each and
every aspect of our education this chart
pretty complicated but let me just
summarize what happens now in our
collaboration with Microsoft we've
signed an agreement for three years
starting in 2011 right though the
agreement is going to be for three years
we are pretty sure that this marriage
will probably continue much much longer
now in our year one year one of
collaboration we took it progressively
and we infuse cloud computing into
thirty percent in the first semester
it's for six months and subsequently
increased it to fifty percent we believe
that this progressive approach will
allow students to undertake and
understand cloud computing progressively
rather than going with a big bang
approach in our year two we are
expecting a hundred percent cloud
infusion in all seven IT diplomas that
we have and of course in our year tree
we will expect that four thousand
students will actually be trained in
cloud computing to help in the manpower
needs for Singapore oh I've classified
it enters under several different
categories in terms of certification in
this area we have actually sending also
staff for certification to actually take
the certification so that they will be
able to train the students and will
launch diploma plus modules to actually
help them in terms of preparing
themselves to take the three exams that
will qualify them to be a MC PV in
Windows Azure so we are targeting the
first batch of students to actually have
the first certification sometime in the
later part of this year
in the area of industry projects which I
will share some later as well we've
started on things like service to
development canet development and along
the way well of course start with
windows 8 project development as you can
see my slides are also natural inspired
slides ok so working together with
Microsoft we have actually developed
this cloud for classroom hip and in this
kit why it does is that we have a series
of lecture materials as well as hands-on
labs so we are using this and you can
see it's pretty comprehensive we have
all the way the entire spectrum of
introduction to things like more complex
stuff like cloud security in terms of
identity and access control as you're
reporting for analysis business
intelligence and analytics so we
actually have this entire package of
materials which we are using and we
cherry pick some of the materials to be
fitted into some of the modules d in the
year one year to a year tree our cloud
infusion framework this portion may seem
familiar to you you may have seen it in
some of the slides now basically I've
class divide it into three different
parts one is like the cloud computing
modules now although we have the diploma
plans modules and all that which I
mentioned the cloud computing modules
are actual cloud modules which are run
every week for 30 to 60 hours throughout
the semester and these will basically
teach students the entire spectrum of
cloud computing I'm daddy once they
finish these modules they move on to
their final year projects where they
will also use a cloud computing
knowledge to deliver solutions to the
industry and subsequently for students
who aspire to get their professional
certifications from Microsoft they can
actually opted for the diplomat plus
program as well which is conducted
during the vacations the whole suite of
microsoft software that we actually use
in order to help our students gear up
and understand what cloud computing is
all about from productivity or the way
to platform over here in the area of
project development we have actually set
up a centre for IT innovation this
center works closely with the industry
to bring in projects real-life projects
for students to actually work on
together with their supervisors these
are the industry partners that we look
for look this so far and since our
inception we have about 180 projects
with 85 different companies so far we've
also gone into patent fouling we're with
our fault 29 patterns and achieved 21
that were granted so far later on I will
share with you one of the patterns that
we file using cloud computing as a
platform so yeah this is this is the one
I'd like to share with you it was done
by my colleague back in Singapore and
it's virtualized cloud storage now we
know that cloud computing provides all
of us the convenience the usability and
you know anytime anywhere access to
information but security is one main
concern so when you have a confidential
document a physical confidential
document and you don't want anyone else
to know the information after you read
it you shred it right so in this project
what we did was it's an R&amp;amp;D project we
took a logical file a computer file and
rather then upload it a single entire
file up to the cloud what we did was we
shredded the foul into several pieces
all right and we use information
dispersal algorithm so actually split
the file and at the receiving end if you
want to pull back the foul you have to
use the same algorithm in order to put
it back right it's pretty complex and
I'm not the principal investigator for
this project but in general the idea of
this project is really to allow a more
secure transmission over the cloud
we also have other cloud innovations
such as the as i mentioned students will
actually go out to companies to actually
work in their final year for internships
so in order to track the progress and
all that we have actually developed a
industry learning progress law whereby
students can actually lock down the
progress in terms of what they're doing
the task they've completed and this can
actually be accessed by both the
supervisors as well as the persons in
the company right we've also developed a
collaborative framework for a major
telco in Singapore this is to help their
knowledge management and collaborative
learning environment using a sharepoint
online and also in the area of GIS we
have developed the first GIS application
on the windows phone using s3 as the API
and more more bit of RND refused cloud
computing Windows Live to actually
control home applications via remote
commands to the windows live application
we've also worked with Microsoft and
also together with our students to
actually develop a whole suite of
Windows Phone 7 apps that were that you
can find in the marketplace and this was
actually developed even before the
official launch of windows 7 windows
phone 7 i'll just end off a little bit
by sharing some allow student success i
think more recently in april this year
i'm sure you've heard of the microsoft
imagine cup it started to be the premier
IT competition for students and students
from the school of information
technology at nanyang polytechnic
actually clinch the national champions
and their solution was everything about
cloud and Windows 8 they will be heading
to Sydney Australia in July to actually
compete in the world why finals in
Singapore we also have the first-ever
microsoft office 2010 ambassador
and this was a national search for the
best student who makes use of Microsoft
Office to both managers personal and
professional life going forward we
believe that the collaboration with
microsoft and nanyang polytechnic will
definitely allow us to continue
delivering top-quality cloud based app
education and no extra cost now the no
extra cost is it it's actually really
beneficial thing to us because we are a
nonprofit organization and for all our
students to try out cloud computing
using Azure I think this is definitely a
big step forward we will also cultivate
students through expert advice and
you've seen through the video that we
have educational seminars held in
nanyang polytechnic together with
microsoft and we do knowledge sharing
information exchange and all that during
these sessions and of course singapore
is also adopting cloud computing in a
very big scale on a very big scale and
by training all these students to be
cloud ready by the year by the end of
three years it will really enable us to
meet the manpower needs of Singapore's
IT industry so with that thank you
any questions you're free you mentioned
things like a hundred percent
involvement of cloud computing or
something right I'm not quite certain
what that meant that that means one
hundred percent of the students hundred
percent of ninety percent of the courses
one hundred percent of the students so
let me take you back some slides that we
okay as you can see over here in our
year one and year two we actually have
the call and foundational modules which
our students run to right so what
happens is that we will infuse cloud
computing generally in this sector here
because these modules are something
that's to all students will actually run
to right versus an elective over here so
we will infuse all the cloud elements
inside the core modules so that every
student has an opportunity to learn
about what cloud computing is all about
and if they come over here in a year
tree and they still want to know more
about cloud computing they are modules
such as the cloud computing security
cloud computing business applications
and all that which they can learn more
in-depth knowledge on cloud so it's
hundred percent student infusion in
terms of them understanding what cloud
computing is all about what fraction of
the courses have significant cloud
computing components okay so in our in
our seven IT diplomas we have actually
infused cloud computing mostly in the
year to curriculum because that's when
the students are actually brought up to
a level where they are able to
understand the different concepts that
need to be taught any more questions I
have a question so do you provide access
through the university labs or student
accesses from home from do you see any
changes in the pattern of using computer
at the moment the ESRI accounts are
provided free from Microsoft so the laps
are actually conducted in the on campus
but as cloud because it's a it's an open
open space right so what happens is that
the students are able to deploy even
from home do student and faculty like it
I think once we have actually done the
fundamentals of what cloud computing is
all about they love it because they have
the ability to do it upload their
solutions from home from in fact
anywhere that has an internet connection
and they are able to see and collaborate
together as a team the question in the
back here Steve okay d we actually using
the cloud for classroom kit and this was
actually developed together with
Microsoft within puts together the
questions thank you very much Gary's
income while while our next speaker is
setting up and just briefly if you
interested there is a DVD with cloud
computing resources available these a
curriculum resources provided by
Microsoft and by some of the speakers
and this is a good opportunity to
introduce our next speaker soon 11 she
is from postech she's a professor there
and she will be talking about teaching
web-scale data management using
Microsoft Azure swanbourne actually is
one who contributed several curriculum
resources and classes she implemented in
both operating system but also in
databases and the latter is web scale
data management is her speciality she is
graduated from University of Illinois
and she has a lot of collaboration and
very active in some ICL I Triple E
committees and talking about the
contribution of curriculum and access as
i mentioned Microsoft provides today the
latest is five months pass to be used by
faculty and students and it does not
require not required
credit card okay and this is very
important we find some student or
faculty reluctant to use credit card
because sometimes student forget and get
charged so there is no credit card and
if you're interested e we have a
web-based applications oh you can
approach me for a quicker solution with
this I will introduce the next speaker
thank you are Katie for the introduction
today I'm very happy to talk about my
experiences of using Microsoft Azure for
teaching database classes and my name is
sing one and I'm an associate professor
at poster Korea so let me start my top
with establishing the background of my
Institute and also the course offering
that I'm going to talk about today so
postech is a pawn university of science
and technology and pong is actually the
name of city we are located at which is
right here we are another young school
we are about 25 years old we are a
little older than nyp was still very
young and we are a top-tier researcher
at university we have about 10
department in undergrads covering a
science and engineering domains so every
year we get about 30 undergrads in
computer science so that's quite a small
number we are our vision is having a
very small private university of good
faculty-student ratio and in our
department I we have about 20 computer
science faculty okay person in terms of
research interest i say i'm a database
person and myself and many database
researchers are actually working with
web data so we are not just working with
nicely structured database table data
stored in a single machine but we are
interested in supporting various forms
of data collected and growing every day
you know an unprecedented scale on the
web so there will be my research
background and with this background I
teach
well I taught operating system class too
but mostly I teach database classes in
both undergrad and graduate level so
today I'll talk about our undergraduate
course offering which took place in the
fall semester at last year so this could
be viewed as a infusion of windows as
your technique or the database
curriculum but it is a little different
in a sense that it's a little different
from what shared in the previous talk in
a sense that it's not a separate module
of introducing windows as your technique
it's more like we are offering a very
classic database curriculum and try to
infuse windows as a mini segment a
project segments such that students can
view new challenges in terms of data
research and the industry needs so I
don't share more about this in the later
slide so if to talk more about this
course offering this happened in the
last year in the fall semester there
were about 40 students registered and
every week we have three hours of
classroom teaching covering the classic
data based curriculum material and we
have one and a half hour of lab where I
can introduce many database techniques
to the students so I think many of you
already took database courses but let me
remind you of what are the topics that
are typically taught in the database
curriculum so we talk a lot about this
nice table data so if you are amazon.com
and you have information about millions
of products you are selling and we
assume these kind of information are
stored in this nice table so this will
be a example information of camera that
are currently sold at amazon.com so in
database class we talked a lot about how
the information we have can be nicely
represented in the table forms like this
and also the background formal
techniques of relational modeling and
now
algebra for representing data in the
table forms and then we talked 'used
about this a lot in the preliminary
session there is this nice language
called sequel declarative cycle language
where users can specify what they want
so that they can narrow down a large
data into the one they actually need so
in this curial this person has only
about six hundred dollars as a budget to
buy a camera so a lot of cameras are not
relevant for this user then it will be
narrowed down to this camera so then in
database class we talked a lot about how
to write what you want in this kind of
language and then we also talked about
Curie processing techniques of all kinds
of techniques for getting this kind of
result very fast so that will be the
very classic scope of database
curriculum and since this sequel
language and working with database
management system with all those
structured data are very relevant to the
industry needs and research we spend a
lot of time teaching students how to
work with this database management
system and also how to work with
securities and so on so that is the
classic scope and possibly what you have
learned in your database courses and in
terms of lab projects there are usually
two directions 11 of the direction is
building some web application using the
database as the underlying storage so we
talked about this camera tables then we
built like amazon.com like web
application where users can use this
kind of you I to specify what they want
instead of writing psychic Uri we cannot
expect Amazon customers will write what
they want in terms of security then this
web application will translate this you
are input into the relevant securities
then present the result not as a table
but this nice dice output for the users
so since a lot of
commercial websites are working like
this this is very relevant to the
industry needs so we this is one
direction of course projects and another
direction is looking into what's
actually happening inside the database
engine so just like operating system
courses are doing some kind of project
to read the kernel code and modify it we
heard about this in the first
presentation of this session database
management system is another big code
corpus that is being discussed in the cs
curriculum so we again in a lot of
curriculum we discuss what's going on
inside of the database engine and since
this is a very complex code base there
is a simplified version of this code
base provided from University of
Wisconsin and also if you want a open
source database management there is a
nice code base originated from this very
campus UC Berkeley so using a lot of
database curriculums use these two kinds
of tools to support projects where
students can actually modify the modules
inside the database engine or add
something like ranky reprocessing on top
of the existing working database
management system so this was the
background that's what has been usually
being taught in the the regular database
curriculum so today I want to talk about
why we combine try to combine ezer
introduced as you're into this database
curriculum the first reason is that the
this curricula classic curriculum has
not changed much for the last ten and
twenty years I took database class as an
undergrad in Korea and also I took like
database as a grad student in USA and I
also taught database classes in USA and
korea and all those curriculums follow
pretty much the same format which is the
format that i just showed you but within
this 10 or 20
years there has been a lot of changes in
terms of the topics that has been
discussed in the both research and
Industry so I think this is suggesting
that there is a gap between what's being
taught in the curriculum in terms of
database versus was being talked about
in the research and Industry fields one
example is this term big data
opportunities will be the topic of the
panel tomorrow and this has been
buzzword in both research and Industry
and you can define this term in any way
and my personal favorite definition is
from Wikipedia so wikipedia says in
information tech technology big data
means datasets that are large and also
growing so large so they become awkward
to be processed using existing online
database techniques so we want to work
with this big data either collected from
a science as top as we discussed in the
plenary session this morning or
collected from the web or collected from
the sensor this is just too big so to be
stored searched or shared analyzed or
visualized using the existing technique
so I'm I my favorite word in this
definition is awkward I think this is
actually emphasizing the gap I was
talking about so the technology we are
talking about in the classic curriculum
are often too awkward to support big
data that are being collected in many
sources these days so people so why is
it so awkward and people talk about like
three challenges of supporting big data
and these three challenges all start
with letter V so people talk about this
as a 3 v's of big data it is aqua very
awkward to support storage search and so
on because volume wise it is a very big
so we sometimes this data cannot be
stored in a single machine and also they
are growing and also these data need to
be
says so fast either we were real time or
near real time so these search or
analyze computation needs to be very
fast and if you rely on one node this
kind of velocity cannot be achieved and
also another thing is this variety so in
classic database curriculum we talk
about nicely structured data on the
table but in actual data that is
collected from the web is in a variety
of forms including search logs
unstructured text videos and audios so
the good data management technique
should support a variety of forms so I'm
thinking the goal of this curriculum
design of introducing sort the data base
curriculum is to expose students to see
these new challenges that have been
discussed in research and Industry so
students can realize that though we
talked about like database management
system hosted in a single machine in the
textbook students will be able to see
that sometimes data are just too big so
maybe those data need to be stored
distributed over multiple nodes or
sometimes analyzing this data is too
complex that those computation needs to
be distributed and also a lot of time
our applications should support not only
nicely structured table like data but
also a very ugly forms of data different
forms of data so the goal of designing a
project for my course who is exposing
students to these three be challenges
but while doing that I do not want to
lose the original material because they
are still very relevant for the students
so I want my course to be backward
compatible in the sense that it is
covering all the original materials and
add new material but when we are doing
that we want to minimize the additional
learning curves because if there is too
much over head for the new material
students will complain a lot so this
will be my design goals and toward this
goal what the spin
civics of what I did was that again this
is not generating a new course talking
about cloud computing or how to work
within windows as or rather we are
covering the classic database material
using in my case I'm using the textbook
from University of Wisconsin and also we
are still covering all the details about
database management system and sequel
kure either we can use either regular
database management system like sequel
server or we can use sequel as or for
this purpose and then we want to add
this Big Data projects so that students
can see sometimes they need to work with
large data of various forms with
distributed computation and storage and
specifically we use Twitter graphs in
combination with structured data so let
me show you details about this Twitter
project so I think a lot of you are
using Twitter and even for this
conference we have twitter feed so
Twitter as of this year has about 140
million users and in this graph each
user is a note and each note has
structured information about the user
like name or gender location profiles
and so on and then there is this
relationship between the node but one
specific one particular thing about
Twitter is that this relationship is
asymmetric and it may not be mutual so
in facebook if a is a friend with be
that automatically means B is a friend
of a but in Twitter a may follow B but B
may not be following a so inspired by
this asymmetry I designed a very simple
problem the students can work with so we
provide a large graph of many Twitter
notes and then what student needs to do
is to they need to upload this to the S
or block and then they need to store the
relationship between Twitter accounts in
as your table and then what they need to
do
is to count for each user how many of
their follow our relationships our
mutual so for some user they have 10
followers and this user is following
back all those 10 users in that case
mutual count or ratio will be hundred
percent or 10 but there will be another
user who is following a lot of people
but not followed by those people and so
on so different accounts have different
characteristics and we can sort of use
this mutual relationship count to
explain to kind of different
relationship well if the graph is very
small then counting this mutuality of
the relationship will not be very
expensive but in a large graph like
Twitter graph this kind of computation
can be very complex so the design goal
of the students will be distribute this
load of computation and storage the
competition to multi-well nicely such
that this kind of job can be done in a
scalable manner and since building some
web application on top of database is
also an important experience for the
students we will ask students to build
this into a web application but when we
are doing that we are providing a
template code so this is an example of
web application and each button
represent each step that I just
described and when this is click then
the module will be called and we
actually provide what kind of quotes
that need to be written for this module
so students will providing this template
is just to reduce the learning curve of
the students so that students can start
right away with their projects so what
they need to do is they need to store
this large graph to the cloud storage
and then ask multiple instances of note
to work on a different part of the graph
to count the mutual relationship
of each person and then they can ask to
count the mutual relationship count for
every account and then those count can
be aggregated to figure out the users
with high mature relationship counter
ratio and then there is sickle as you're
storing the structured information of
different Twitter accounts and based on
this ID that we figured out based on
based based on this idea we can carry we
can execute cycle Curie's to come up
with two to get the information that
user information about the ID that we
just found so this will be how this will
be the overview of this project project
and so we provide this code and one once
students fill out the this template so
actually this is not a lot of code is
about 250 lines in c-sharp code so in
terms of amount it is not big but
students still spend a lot of time
figuring out how to work with Windows
Azure and so on so still it costs
student a lot of time and then once
their codes are up and running they can
check it in the using s or emulator here
it's so this screenshot is showing that
three instances are apparently working
on counting the mutual relationship and
once they are done they can use what has
been developed in the emulator and
deployed in the actual web app at the
azure and again students have a lot of
these to invest a lot of time to figure
out how to do it so to reduce this
learning curve we provide like video
materials so that students can follow
step-by-step without spending too much
time figuring out how to work with these
tools so that was the brief overview of
the project plot problem that we worked
on and in terms of outcome
quantitatively students evaluated the
quality of this project material
quantitatively in terms of in the
average of four point six four out of
five point oh so I see this as a
positive sign and from there qualitative
evaluation of the majority of students
found that adding this kind of material
helped them to see this new challenge
and actually help them to understand the
challenges in data base management new
challenges in managing big data and also
the pejorative students found that this
kind of experiences will be helpful for
their future careers and in case of you
are interested in doing a similar kind
of project for your course I uploaded
this all the materials like the template
we use and also the PowerPoint
describing these projects and also the
videos all nicely zip and upload it on
in this website and i believe it is also
available from the kit that you have so
i would so if you are interested in
doing a similar kind of project you can
use that as a reference and also can
give us feedback about how we can do it
differently for the future offerings so
with that I want to conclude this talk
so in summary for me I find adding Ezra
was useful to help students to see these
new challenges of supporting big data
and how to extend what the techniques
they learned in the textbook for
supporting those new type of data and
always students learning curve is deeper
than what instructors think when they
are exposed to the new tools and the
news new source code so we do students
need to be hand hold it in the beginning
and for that always the template or
video resources are I find those
resources are quite helpful for students
to start with the initial part of their
projects and thankfully students found
these projects quite relevant and
helpful for their projects there for
learning database curriculum and then
since this big data is not just relevant
to database field this big data
challenge can change the way we think
about algorithms or data structures and
various part of classic curriculums of
cs so it is good to have like separate
course on cloud computing but i think i
am thinking many of you are coming from
different domains and maybe teaching
different kind of courses but i think it
will be an interesting thing to have
some kind of mini segment to help see
help students see like the classic
material in a different angle of having
a big data or having multiple nodes at
hands so I think my talk is one example
of doing that in the classic database
curriculum and I'm sure if students find
this helpful then maybe this kind of
busy segment can be developed for other
computer science curriculums as well so
there will be the end of my talk and I
would be happy to answer your questions
thank
thank you any questions he is a mission
here at first question is how many
database curses do you have in your
caracal right we are small small
universities of you only have one each
or both for under okay so this this is
what I have the impression that you
introduce elements of distributed
databases in there in there for in the
undergraduate project yes the offering
that we talked about is for
undergraduate students and students
taking this course is mostly sophomore
and junior level undergrad and so they
do not have knowledge on in the internal
aspects of the database like indexing or
transaction management in the beginning
yes but like the second half is talking
about the internals how the internals
work so they do learn about that at
about at the two third point of the
curriculum and the project is introduced
around that time so they have some
initial working knowledge of the
internals of data based on the data it's
a thank you thank you
so it looks like the premises that you
are going to have in the future these
these platforms as the main vehicle for
students to be learning on you know for
example Azure yes but they do actually
cost money so I'm wondering how is the
funding model going to work out for
supporting student accounts for pitching
for this one we collaborated with
Microsoft so we didn't have funding
issue but to make it sustainable I think
we need to come up with a good model to
come up with the cost maybe Microsoft
can keep supporting us or we can figure
out more sustainable way to manage this
collaboration any more questions did you
find student motivated by using this
Twitter project yes since well social
network data since students actually do
use them both Facebook and Twitter quite
actively so they find it more fun and
relevant to work with the social network
data then usually the previous project
mostly worked on enterprise like product
data which is something that students
for students it is harder to relate on
those data then like relationship
between friends and figuring out which
account has like different types of
accounts they find it more interesting
yeah do you recommend any other public
accessible big database that could be
hooked up for projects I think as soon
as you expand your focus of data not
just to the structured data but to
unstructured data the public data set
you can work with is increasing
exponentially
because of those public big data have
there are so many public big data set
posting well that just in the domain of
social network service but other domains
so that can be easily acquired and so so
there is this link to open data there
are lots of in terms in these linked
craft forms of data there are lots of
big data sets that students that can
motivate students and also similarly
present these three big challenges so I
think different data set or more
interestingly the combinations of data
set will be another good project target
