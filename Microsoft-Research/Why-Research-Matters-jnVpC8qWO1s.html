Microsoft Research is that we share a
common philosophy and that is we believe
in the transformative the changing power
of technology and we want to make
technology that makes a difference
research has been essential for the
improvement of the lives of mankind and
it's true research that we discover new
science science that makes the lives of
people better that heals people that
avoids diseases that protects the
environment so research is an essential
part of being human and I think it's
going to be with us forever research is
essential to any country or economy that
wants to grow expand and develop into
the future research and innovation are
critical to economic development but in
particular I think that fundamental
research is very important to solve
those blue sky problems in the next five
or ten years research is about creating
new ideas at every scale of course you
love the big breakthroughs and there are
big breakthroughs that microsoft
research has done or that Microsoft has
done assisted by things in in research
but you also do a search for all of the
medium-sized ideas and the little ideas
the ideas that are not the oh my god
it's a dramatic breakthrough thing but
still make a product better make someone
like someone's life better
