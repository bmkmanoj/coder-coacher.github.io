okay so I look so this is going to be a
talk about logic types concurrency
non-determinism a pretty vague title so
but namely I will essentially focus on
an approach to integrate non-determinism
into a curry our interpretation for
session type so to speak so I will start
also with a citation from type for
programming and with a picture and we
can see their people Lucas s already in
the deduction we can say that type of
programming just a special case of
programmable specification and when can
of course with type as a synonym for
specification and type checking as a
synonym for verification this view fits
well with the typist preposition
paradigm of axiomatic semantics and the
propositions types paradigm of
intuitionistic logic so of course
everyone knows are fruitful and
successful has been this idea of Korea
our in the context of functional
programming although also I think
everyone knows that it is not so easy to
see how to extend of this paradigm
towards concurrent programming in the
sense that for example in these
classical case you have this
correspondence between what is really to
independently we've defined things I'll
say lambda Kappa on one side and
intuitionistic logic on on the other
side so in fact on the other hand
recently we have developed with the
training and others this new
interpretation of linear logic is a very
natural session type system for and
independently find a programming
language which is essentially the pie
calicos video session types which
session pipe disease the typing
discipline in which you can define
protocols according to each process is
my nicely interact with each other so
some of these work of course is inspired
in in some work we believe that we look
at ten years ago or something on
substructure logics for concurrency but
of course is it if it's a different spin
offs ok some care lives about these
these are this type system when is that
one gets
this is a very natural session type
discipline ensuring that locked freedom
and sessions fiddly five led by these
brutally logical means proof conversions
actually turns out to express laws of
observational equivalence production
matches process full internal reduction
and is actually also confident and
terminating and you can compute a normal
form of a process which essentially
defines its behavior with a greedy
external environment so it is also true
that in the very same paper a few
paragraphs below besides that we can
also excel at this correspondence a turn
it into a predictive tool if a concept
express it in typed feel but absent in
programming or vice versa it can be very
fruitful into both areas to investigate
and see what the corresponding concept
might be in Jellico in the other context
so what what about non determinism okay
so it turns out that non terminating
systems to resist these that reasonable
analysis in terms of a carry our
correspondent essentially because proof
reduction must be compatible with with
if proof proof if proof sir to represent
processes should be compatible with with
the process with action and since and
since I proof real action should be
compatible with profile entity then it
should be compatible with behavioral
equivalence so does not make much sense
to think about and non deterministic
notion of reduction to start with so in
this talk I will sketch a possible
turnaround to this issue in a purely
logical base the way so let me just
briefly overview the type structure of
this linear logical motivated session
types so the idea is to understand the
several with neurologic connectiveness
as protocol descriptions so for example
the dancers means denotes the protocol
that starts by sending a session of type
a and continues with a session of type B
and the part means that denotes a
session that starts by receiving a
session of type a
and then continues as a session of that
be so those familiar with session pipes
can usually a recognized you the
familiar type structure of of a session
pipes by the way I'm base current
presentational in classical linear logic
wheeler with a rule of mix so there is a
natural duality on session pipes which
mirrors the the two partners which
flip-flops the protocol in which two
matching patterns of a protocol are
involved and it's essentially
corresponds to linear logic negation the
form of our typing judgments are pretty
standard so we have a process and to
context typically linear cortex and the
Cartesian context of linear context
registers the types of the open sessions
and the Cartesian context register the
types of shared servers which are
replicated entities in the in the
environment okay very well so let me
just show you some a couple of typing
rules cannot go into the tiling to them
at they are pretty natural so starting
for the composition rules of parallel
composition are represented by the
respectively by the rules of cat and
weeks so cat represents dependent
communication so process P and Q
communicate through channels X which
exhibit matching protocols you can just
plug them together and hide the
communication channel and we can also
compose processes independently by the
rule of mix in such a way that there
will be no communication between the
evolving processes for for a standard be
sealed we can see that the tensor is
interpreted by by the output process and
the input is interpreted by the way by
the part in more or less expected way
what is interesting in these
interpretation is exact if you look now
if you look to the principal kotori
directions applying to the several proof
rules you can essentially recover
standard reduction rules from the by
kalco so he retrieves the communication
rule and if you look to the site whether
rules as for example the
typing rules for termination for
inaction and if you look to the
principal reduction in this case we
essentially retrieve a structure
congruence which means erasing the unit
from the code from the composition and
if you go on and on and look for example
for the rules were at fault for the
additives which are in this case
corresponds to the place and with
connectives oven your logic you then
essentially retrieve the reduction rules
for four case where in this case for
anonymous choice of course you could
extend these to label choice to label
sense in the expected way for just for
the sake of readability of a half a
program so this is a very simple example
a lot can go through in detail over it
essentially there is this a composition
of two systems estoy furry body and the
client Ellis the server body offers
movies and it offers two options either
the user sends that sends the title and
the credit card and gets back the movie
or it sends the title gets back the
trailer so in this case Alice asks for
seeing the trailer of Solaris so these
protocols are just as I can be typed by
these a linear logic formula and you get
a typing refreshing for this to full
system ensuring that the system works
well is that lock free and protocols are
our follow that ok so about non
determinism so our idea of introducing
our donut ammunition essentially is
based on these two ingredients so you
actually introduce this is a kind of a
choice process but this choice process
to essentially represent the superposed
alternative sites of the computation so
you will never actually reduce this
process to any of these components
during production and learn lassie
certain situations so and the moreover
they they can essentially proliferate so
during a computation you can get further
alternatives or a turn at some point the
computation you can absorb alternative
states because they are essentially the
same for example this rule which
expresses I the impotency of behavior of
Sam with respect to be similarity turns
out
also to be de Rivel in our framework
like in terms of a proof conversion so
this is when part of it second part of
it is at level of types and what we do
at level of types is to to be pipeful
you introduce two new dual connectives
to express non-determinism so
essentially these are kind of a magnetic
operators when we express the type of
sessions that might produce any session
of type a this is a kind of a power a
power construction if you want and the
dual type so these are classical things
so this is a dual that which is the type
of sessions I may consume consume one of
those non deterministic sessions in our
system we have these also this kind of
natural ability so it could be
interesting to look at the typing rules
briefly so I cannot go into details
about how these rules FF come out so
there is lots of engineering of
inference rules going on here I guess
but you can look to the to the paper to
see more in detail but essentially we
have a proof rule to introduce a
non-deterministic type from from a
deterministic one a basic injection of
the single time so we have a rule to
combine non-deterministic behaviors
through these alternative process which
essentially corresponds to flattening of
the power set domain so if you want just
as an analogy and a rule for promotion
of the co non-determinism which allows
us to plug any everything on the
community air from the outside through
cut if everything in the context is
already non-deterministic okay so what
what can we say about these rules so we
can extract some reductions from this
and the basic reduction corresponds to
promoting an optimistic type to a
deterministic one once you get the basic
introduction rule and you get with
deterministic thing okay so this is very
easy and this one is more interesting
and essentially is mapped at the level
of the process calculi not in a
reduction but in
in a question during the kind of
structure congruence and it essentially
allows us to to propagate as you see
here so we have a process being parallel
with with an overlapped state so the cat
reduction what it does it just to
propagate the P so it's the both side of
the of the of the of the the other the
update say that the alternative space of
possibilities so essentially turns out
this replica response to the
distribution of parallel composition of
a shy so where we all known behavioral
equivalents in the world of process
calculi okay well so we can get out some
some basic laws and so this kind of of
principles are are desirable in our
system and okay they have been they can
be really really realizable by specific
topic places so just for a very very
simple example about to conclude so this
is a extension exactly an extension of
my previous example but now you have
this who identity which would
nondeterministic can behave like Alex or
like Bob and alex is like before I wants
to see a preview of Solaris but Bob
actually wants to buy inception so you
can compose the system and the system
now gets these types so for example in
this case it is very simple to type the
who process just by giving it giving it
a non-deterministic type of the same
blood type as before as far as the body
of the server is concerned which is not
the PPC that you can try to recover it
will slide you type it with with a co
deterministic type which is possible to
introduce here because the rest of the
context is empty if in the case there
were any other open names here involved
in the definition of behavior of body
they should be also given a
non-deterministic types of at the system
is kept sound so very very briefly just
to terminate what kind of results you
get so get cut elimination holding so
the system is sounds and sense from a
practical viewpoint you get it our pipe
our
processor l5 persistent go wrong so they
are deadlock free confident and
termination terminate occur can show
that using a pretty standard logical
relations kind of argument and we also
have that reduction so internally
election actually preserves
observational equivalents because non
determinism is essentially represented
by keeping open all the space of
possible of possibilities well pretty
much like in sign in a quantum state in
the quantum mechanics finally it is
interesting to see what what if what if
you just add to our operational
semantics that the typical collapsing
rules of internal choice and what we
what it turns out is that if you do that
you obtain this kind of thing
interesting postponing result which size
that are Aoife follow me if if if a
process reduces to a think of this form
so a choice of prime components or prime
is something which is not trivial
internal choice itself then of course
using the extended reduction rule you
can obtain the corresponding reduction
to a particular collapse it state okay
of course you can do that just by this
is this is easy part you can do that
just by applying these rules at the very
end of the reduction but on the other
hand we also have the converts so if you
if we pick up the set of all processes
of all prime process is to each given
initial process reduces okay then the
set is actually in our case this is
finite finite that to structure
congruence and it is possible to in the
original system without collapse to
produce a reduction to a state that
represents the all set of possibilities
okay so this is essentially what I'd
like to show you this is a gift too I
would like to offer look at for the
occasion of this sixth decade so thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
