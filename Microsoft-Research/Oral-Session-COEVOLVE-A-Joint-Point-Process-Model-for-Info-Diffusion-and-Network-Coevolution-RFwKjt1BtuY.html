you
the second talk is entitled co-evolved a
joint point process model for
information diffusion and network
coevolution we have lay song here from
the Georgia Institute of Technology's
and he'll tell us with more about this
one I think so I run for attending the
first offer the student of my cannot
make it due to visa leaves you and the
last author I'm going to give the
talking's that this is a joint work with
a bunch of other students from Georgia
Tech and also my collaborator menu from
Max Planck Institute so essentially
these work is about the information
diffusion the network coevolution when
we look at the online information online
social network it essentially it's a
information network people go online for
some purpose either they go to Twitter
to find useful information or they tried
to connect with friends to share some
joints of life or they go to Cora's
something else to find or cry knowledge
or in Lincoln you try to find job
opportunities so essentially there's a
to process going on in this social
network one is information diffusion
process another is the evolution of
network due to this information
diffusion process so I'm going to use
these running examples in my talk
essentially you have a small number of
users in this social network David a
sofa Christina Bob and Jacob they are
linked to each other in such a way and
there may be some other users by the way
ignore them for the moment for instance
they we may treat about signing
information at 1pm right saying that
that this is a cool paper and then
Sophie respond to it and agree with that
Davis twits okay and then these
information my propagate further down to
the followers of Sophie for instance
Christian may also treat about it in
this information propagation process the
source of the information which is Devi
is explicitly acknowledged in all these
tweets and retweets okay and Jacob now
sees the information and retreat again
at beginning Jacob is skeptical about
the the information but afterwards
Baba's a treat about his paper and agree
that this is a good paper and then also
in Bob's tweets it's going to
acknowledge the sources of information
which is David so now
jacob has two neighbors which is
teaching at our particular paper and and
the particular source of information
from Davy and then Jacob go and check
again and really this is a good paper
now Jacob view that this information
source which is David's were useful so
he decided to create a link directly to
David okay at 145 so essentially the
information diffusion process is going
to drive the creation of these linked in
this social network in turn the creation
of this new link is going to sort of
change the way information diffuse
across the social network for instance
the next time when David about a car ok
and then jbug copy is going to see
immediately and we respond very fast
okay in three minutes Davie it's going
to respond and greed that this is a
really good car okay so essentially
there to process going on here most
specifically there's a diffusion network
behind it and then there's an
information propagation process or
information diffusion process in this
hypothetical information network and
then diffusion network structure is
going to support the spread of
information and then the information
diffusion process and it's spreading of
the information is going to drive the
creation of the link in this social
network in turn when when a link a new
link i created the information diffusion
network is going to change and alters
the way that the information propagate
in this process essentially we want to
model these two processes which are
interacting with each other and we want
to feel different data previously there
has been lots of work on just looking at
the network structure or the evolution
of network structure itself they also
has been lots of model or modeling the
information diffusion it by itself
recently people are able to sort of
collective information or data which is
both about information diffusion link
creation and able to do some kind of
empirical study about the interaction
between these two processes and people
find perkily indeed the information
diffusion process is going to drive the
creation of links so but if you look at
a model probably's model for these two
interacting process still missing in the
literature so essentially the goal of
the paper is to provide such a joy
probabilistic
for both information diffusion and
networking illusion and then we also
want to sort of figure out where how do
we actually similarly went from such a
probabilistic model efficiently how to
ask me parameter from such a model and
whether the model is going to generate
realistic-looking information diffusion
chases and what it's going to create the
evolution pattern of the network which
is realistic as well and whether the
model can make very accurate prediction
okay this is a go of the paper so I'm
going to start with the sort of the
modeling part how do we actually
formulate this problem into a
probabilistic model so the way we
approach this problem is to sort of
distinguishing to type of events in this
social network the first type of event
is going to associate with the tweets
and retweets so we are going to
essentially represent each one of these
Twitter oratory as the triplets
containing both the destination and the
information source and a tie when these
retreats or Twitter going to be created
for instance when they be generated is
original tweets the event is going to be
recorded has a.d.d 1pm right and because
the sauce it is original twits the
source and destination are the same and
when Jacob retweets a tree originally
from davie we're going to record it as
JD 135 so we can nor in the path when
where these information is propagating
we just take the destination and the
source of these information and record
it down and also the corresponding time
point the second type of event in this
information diffusion that we will try
to model the coevolution network
structure is going to be this link
creation events again it's going to be
some kind of triplets containing both
the destination sauce and the time when
the link is going to created for
instance for this particular link
between Jacob and David you can record
it as JD 145 of course each one is note
in social network is not going to just
generate a single event it's going to
generate a sequence of events for
instance Bob is going to generate
original tweets at the 4 p.m. and then
Jacob is going to retreat it and you're
going to record his retweet as JB for 10
right and the Jacob and also generates
original tweets are you
j j5 yeah so essentially we can organize
all these events or tweets or retweet
generated from David according to the
source of this information so we are
going to organize the audience event
generated in Jacob as several timelines
each pilot is going to correspond to one
of these sources and we're going to Rico
explicitly the time when is particularly
to you are generated so you can do the
same thing for all other nodes in a
social network for instance Christine
ball by ann-sofie David they all have
their own sequence of timelines
similarly for Jacob you also have a
sequence of increasing events at the
beginning he creates the link within
Christina Bob later he creates the link
between today v and you can create
another link to Sophia at some other
point in time so you can also record it
in sequence of linking events for this
particular user J as several timelines
each one corresponds to one source where
the link is coming from okay a for
instance in this particular case we only
consider the creation of link once and
that's why the corresponding tie line
only has one event so mathematically if
you want to model these sequences of
timeline these sequence or event or
point processes typically use the
so-called counting process to describe
it essentially you take each one is kind
line and you just count the number of
times that you have a particular events
up to time T right so for Jacob you have
a sequence of retreating events you have
a sequence of counting process
associated with it so we call these a
retreating processor identity reviewing
in the sense that each one is China is
going to correspond to one source so
it's keeping the identity of the source
similarly we can also model the link
creation some counting process a but in
this particular cannon process for the
link the value is just zero and one is
driven by the information diffusion
process to describe these counting
process of privatized and commonly used
quantity is going to be this condition
intensity function which is going to be
the conditional density over the
condition survival function okay this
edge so the meaning of these
intensity function is going to be the
probability of event occurred in small
time interval between T and T plus delta
T and but given that it hasn't occurred
before time T so once you have these
condition intensity function then you
can privatize you're counting process as
the integral form plus some kind of
assuming martingale okay depending on
how you actually privatize these
conditional intensity function then you
have very deep be a bit different type
of point processes very different
behavior for instance some familiar a
condition intensity function is going to
be edge it's going to be constant it
doesn't depend on time it doesn't depend
on the history this is going to
correspond to a Vanina Poisson process
where you tend to see event happening
and tie in a more uniform fashion the
currents are you well is independent of
each other ok you can also take into
account history and design your
conditional intensity function to taking
the gal in history for instance you for
each event have in the past you can add
to the intensity of something happen in
the future you can add function which is
XP the difference of your current and
historical time TI and the if you have
lots of event having in the recent past
it's going to be high intensity we're
often yours already has some kind of
convolution between the kernel function
e XP minus T where this County process
ok it's very good for more in self
excite-ation behavior we're going to see
how it's going to be using the later
diffusion process model so another one
I'm going to introduce is something
called survival process essentially in
this particular process you only allow
event to occur once once occurred the
counting process is going to be one and
then you look at a difference between
these counting process of one if it's
one you zero out ok you do not allow any
further you went to be generated we are
going to use these Poisson process for
the diffusion process and also the link
creation process the Hawks process is
going to be used in this information
diffusion process and the survival
process is going to be used for modeling
the link creation if i put these
specific examples of process into this
big picture of interactive process
between information diffusion and
network creation is
to be something like this the diffusion
network is going to be many many
counting processes for each pair of node
but the value is between 0 &amp;amp; Wine's time
arriving and information diffusion is
going to be also recording this comp
process empty it's going to be modeled
by hawks process and then Poisson
process and a link creation is going to
be driven by this information diffusion
it doesn't going to model by Poisson
process in the survival process and most
specifically I'm going to explain these
information diffusion process using an
example and also the link creation
process example you can see the general
formula in the paper so essentially for
this information diffusion process we
want the model to phenomenon the first
female name is going to be original
twits people just general original
tweets using Poisson process out of
their own initiative for instance today
we can tweet about his own ideas right
so you have this County process MDD for
original cheats it's described by this
gamma D D and it's going to be constant
due to some just own initiative so when
Jacob trying to retreat the original
tweets from davie he's going to look at
that the number of tweets from his two
neighbors which is creating Christine
and Bob if Christine and Bob they have
retweeted that they were often and then
Jacob is going to expose to many many of
these tweets from originally from David
then intensity of a job Jacob retreating
Davey is going to be high okay we try to
capture these the higher exposure that
the higher intensity or returning
someone in this camp Rosa essentially we
are going to use Hawks poses essentially
we are going to first look at the
counting process from Christine how
essentially you can't you two smaller
exposure due to Christine and these
chains going to be the exposure due to
our Bob write you something together
aggregate information for all these
neighbors which is going to retreat Ed
Davey and then passes through the hawks
process tomorrow this long-term memory
so this is our information diffusion
process you have such a process for each
one is note and for each one is
information sources okay similarly you
can use point process to describe
d-link a creation process okay so
essentially the we try to capture these
intuition that if Jacob is retreating
we're often there the tweets originating
from Davy and if he hasn't created that
direct link to David is more likely that
the Jaguar is going to do that in your
future so essentially the intensely
function describing these counting
process a JD is going to consist it's
going to look like this so first you are
going to check whether the link has been
created or not if not you're going to
have some intensity and then you're
going to look at the how many times
Jacob has retweet some twit originally
from Davy okay if you do the lock and
that means that the Davey is really
useful very good information sources it
has a higher likelihood being linked
okay and then of course in the end we
really respect to where the information
is coming from Jacob may have some
exploration right he might just randomly
create some link to other people right
so essentially we are going to just use
these a Hawks process and also the
survival processes described these two
interacting point process and as you can
see that the in his link creation
process you have these natural changing
over time and also for the information
diffusion process there's also these
these network which is changing over
time that's how the two component tied
together and interacting with each other
okay so in the paper we have designed
the efficient way actually two similar
you went from these this joint
probabilistic model and here I'm not
going to explain the data but instead i
am just going to show you a simulation
of the the sort of the retreating events
sample from the process and then also
the link creation events center from the
process so the coloring of this no is
going to correspond to intensity process
so we didn't sort of visualize the sauce
identity because the is hard to
visualize and you can see that the
treating events and
link creation when essentially interleaf
with each other in the end you obtain
some network so we have some algorithm
which allows us to scale out to millions
of nodes you can check the paper for
detail and another nice thing about a
model is you can actually ask me the
parameter of the model from real data
suppose you have crawl your Twitter data
set and then within a time window
between 0 and T it contains n node and
then it has a bunch of a retreating
events are also a bunch of in creation
events you can actually estimate a
parameter using maximum likelihood you
will have one ton for each one is
retreating events you also have one term
for each one is linked creation events
and then you're going to have some
normalization turn with respect to a
pair of nose so the nice thing is using
the model explaining earlier slice the
intensity function gamma and lambda is
going to be linear in the parameters and
that translates to the overall objective
function is actually comparing them out
motor parameters and you can actually
find a global optimum of your your
primary estimation and then another
thing if you dip into it further is the
estimation procedure actually decomposes
DD couples according to these motor
parameter ok and you can paralyze it so
as you increase the number of samples on
you can find that you can estimate
predator increasing well ok so the
question the next question is what are
the generated Network assimilated
network in general realistic properly as
we see in real world networks so indeed
we can do that we can actually control
these parameters alpha beta alpha
corresponding to the link creation
primary that Duty information diffusion
beta corresponding to these excite-ation
retweet citation parameter and as you
increase this parameter you journey
network which range from you know random
graph to graph which has a degree
distribution which has a power-law
distribution which you see in the real
world network so if you compare this
network these are the diversity of the
type of network you can generate from
such a model you can also look at the
diameter of the network as a wolf over
time diamond essentially shrinks over
time
okay also observed in real world network
so you can produce a bunch of other
statistical real Network not just the
related to network structure you are
also related to the Cascade information
diffusion process as you increase these
information diffusion juvenile in
creation process you will see that you
will see more often these fat and short
cascades which is also observed in real
one network finally I have three slides
just briefly explaining these real
experiment for predicting the
information diffusion process we take to
the data set which contains the millions
of users are millions of a link creation
and retreating events and a feeder model
using this convex optimization and once
we feel the model using the eighty-five
percent of data and we're going to
predict fifteen percent of data comes
into the transient future so we find
that by jointly model deconvolution
information diffusion process and you
can actually predict the creation or
link more accurately than alternative
models similarly if you try to predict
the next retreating events using this
convolution model you can also predict
much more accurately than alternatives
so with this I'd like to conclude
essentially what I have presented to you
is a joint point process model for
information diffusion on the one hand
and also the network coevolution it has
a very simple generative model and you
have an official simulation and
estimation procedure it can reproduce
very good or realistic looking
microscopic property and making very
good predictions so essentially there
are many possible extensions you want to
you can do for instance we haven't look
into the birth and death of the nose you
can also model the link deletion process
you can also incorporate many of these
know the attribute information and tweet
contents to make this model more
realistic more predictive i welcome you
to have any suggestion about his model
thank you
and could all the spotlight speakers
maybe just line up on the side or on the
side actually so are there any questions
we have time for one or two questions
thanks very much deep talk hey so you
have a triple and you say the originator
of the tweet and there was final
recipient of the tweet and then the time
of the tweet are the three things and
I'm my sense is if if David tweeted me
and I tweeted someone else no one would
link to David but if David tweets Oprah
and Oprah tweets someone else everyone
links to David so I'm wondering what is
the role of the intermediate people and
their kind of importance in the creation
of links and what is the effect of
leaving that out of the model or is it
implicitly included in the mall yeah
it's implicitly included model so
actually Arin note is going to have
these information diffusion process
counting process and when you try to
generate some kind of retreating events
you're actually aggregating comes from
all your followers and if they treat a
lot or where often is actually going to
boost your you're tweeting probability
since you implicitly included okay they
aren't any other questions let's thank
both lay and Marin thanks sorry I am I
have a question are you here speak yes
over there
yes so as time goes to infinity you will
get the complete graph right so that's
right so it's a bit frustrating I mean
it would be nice if there was more
interesting stationary distribution so
maybe I mean you you added to it at the
end with the link deletion so maybe did
you think about that like exactly that's
the extension are talking about you can
either allow you for node birth process
and death process so you have growing
number knows then you want a complete
graph and you can have linked the
deletion process that will also prevent
you from having a complete graph so it's
very easy to incorporate and you still
care kong's optimization for estimation
of parameters you still get is efficient
simulation algorithm we have some pre
minimal work on simulated this type of
process but it's not in the original
nips paper but you don't know what is a
stationary distribution I mean can you
know you don't know about a station of
it we don't have a close for formula for
that yeah it would be nice to have it
