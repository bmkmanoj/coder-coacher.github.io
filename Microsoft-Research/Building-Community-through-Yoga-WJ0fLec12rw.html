hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
what's up everybody that is a little too
hot hey how you doing post-lunch posed
to break everything it is good to be
here and envy to be back here this is my
second social computing symposium so I
wanna that start with a thank you i
don't even know she's still here i think
seda an appointment but Dana was the
first one sucked me into this room and
into this world in some ways and so many
thanks publicly to her for doing that
the four years ago now it's actually
four years I also one lecture I'm
actually dark social that's how it works
so whatever Alexis magical says I he
took that from my life I'll do a brief
intro of me and the topic and then we're
gonna jump into a bit of a conversation
after I set up who is here with you my
background that's most relevant here is
is one of creativity comedy community
digital things I worked for five years
at the onion as the director of digital
there and trying to really push the
bounds of expression of fake journalism
and of comedy through digital platforms
and that was a lot of fun to do I did
write this book how to be black and i
started the compass company which is on
theme for our topic in a very strange
way because it's kind of trying to see
innovation more broadly than it is often
understood and that is can we smash
together you know humor and creativity
in tech to build and new things and
teach in new ways so what we actually do
is you know lectures and workshops and
consulting work engaged in making tech
more human and making comedy more
playful and accessible through digital
we do a convening facilitating
provocation set of work featured in
comedy hack day we get hackers software
developers and comedians together to
build funny apps intentionally and the
winning app from our first one which is
at pivotal labs here in union square
with shout roulette it allows you to
find people on the internet you disagree
with
and then yell at them in real time using
the magic of the internet which is great
for a democracy I think clay would be
proud and not Americans those who hate
America Tom coats so and then we have we
are third division is making things we
have apps in a pipeline one about better
brainstorming and making your meetings
suck a lot less which is really a
process app and the other tentatively
titled location-based racism which you
could find the preview screen at
location-based racism calm and it uses
big data as well as mobility and racism
and put them all together and allows you
to find racism right around you that
which people say does not exist is right
behind you and we are willing to
satirically reveal it to you by pulling
in from very social services so that's
the that's the quick scan I wanted to
bring people to this room who I don't
think have been in the room before and I
know them all through various
circumstances I'll just go into order of
their seating though not necessarily in
there talking because when they yell
over top of each other a lot to my
immediate right is a style Weiss taya as
she briefly introduced herself earlier
is a skydiver in a wingsuit ER and
really just a human flyer I meant taya
back in college he's always had a sense
of adventure she's the right travel
guides and there was an incident
involving a camel in sub-saharan Africa
which maybe she'll get to or not but the
camel did not make it and she was a part
of that process taya also graduate of
the Woodrow Wilson School and has a
whole other policy background in
fighting gun trafficking and traveling
all over the continent of Africa
teaching with police forces about
violence against women and children
which is one of the bodies of her work
that I most respect other than jumping
out of planes we don't have to so she's
you know we'll talk to her a little bit
more and show some video Alexa and I met
at South by Southwest I've only known
her just a short of a year and I saw her
talk at a TED event we were in the
lineup and I hate was like she's
this book the misfit economy which is
busy looking at rogues and vagabonds and
narrow do Wells and the people on the
fringe of society and finding innovation
there and it's like it's not looking at
hackerspaces reckon is not looking at
PhD programs it's not looking at the
sanction parts of our world and so the
book is coming and we're gonna get a
more preview of what she's found in her
journeys through that to her right is
the first person I ever a second person
I ever met my sister it's my sister
Belinda and in addition to being a good
older sister and not abusing her age and
strength advantage which he held for a
time for a time which is over now oh no
Belinda and I don't have looked up to
her she's sort of an innovation how I
live but I think most irrelevant to this
room 20 years in journalism she did the
newspaper newspaper thing and we had
parallel jobs director a real news
organization the lasting state journal
which he last served as assistant
managing editor previous adapt dallas
morning news USA Today normals lose
record a bunch of quality teaching of
writing an expression left all that to
teach yoga in the hood Atlantic because
that's how journalism
choose your path and then last but
certainly not least on adhered of us who
I met vay romantically and strangely in
Paris I wrote a balcony engages give the
beautiful talking museum and he his
fiance my wife were there free to park
or some of you may know her Anand is a
writer primary he is emerging into his
own face time on air broadcast all the
conduct of New York Times his columns
really covered broadly to called
curtains about innovation and change its
politics its tech its culture and often
the reading of those who when he travels
about as much as I do so I wanted him
here as a zuv chronicler and curator
when you see it around the world from a
variety of Rome the Derek VaShawn was
supposed to be here and he has two
little girls and they both got the flu
again and they just had it like enough
to go so he hadn't really lock down and
take care of them Derek's perspective
was one on a former host of Al Jazeera
English at the first notice that they
ever had global musician digital music
entrepreneur as well as public speaker
about what is cool what you doing around
the world he's going to live in some
examples from his experience on the cop
Africa with satellite radio most mobile
payments etc so we made such on those
anyway but he sends his regrets it
wasn't personal it was extra this is a
spam that he wants to preserve so I'd
like the way we're gonna run it is I'm
so I'm going to start with Belinda and
ask her to talk a bit about her work in
the transition and then we're going to
kind of pilot networks go out or pause
and kind of it should be someone and it
would pile back into each other but the
question that we're starting with is
tell us about what you're doing and also
wherever you see it or been a part of
innovation in a civil of unexpected
place that's great well thank you I'm
Melinda and everyone calls me just me
what happened to the other microphone
sitting illiterate I'm the owner and
founder of just be yoga and we are a
donation-based yoga studio in lansing
and the just be does mean for you to
find yourself and just be yourself but
it's also just me so there you know it's
been a really interesting transition and
in many ways the whole journey is one of
innovation having finally decided that I
wanted to be more connected with
community rather than just writing about
them rather than helping journalists to
figure out how to go in interview and
write about community I actually started
this company while I was working and so
I was running this and teaching yoga and
cleaning up a website first thing in the
morning and you know assigning stories
and I just decided I couldn't do them
both I was really feeling the
disconnection a lot the key of what I
wanted to do though was to do it
donation-based I was really seeing a big
gap that didn't need to be yoga can be
really simple we don't need anything we
can move all the tables right now and we
can be doing yoga you don't need a
seven-day dollar yoga mat you wanted it
yeah you don't need a seventy dollar
yoga mat you don't need to wear any
fancy clothes but I wasn't seeing any of
that showing up in yoga studios that
I've been to and I mean I've lived in
dallas I've gone to yoga around the
in Boston when baritone day was there
I've done yoga in a lot of cities and it
can go upwards of twenty bucks i spent
twenty bucks yesterday to do yoga aerial
yoga so i really wanted in the time that
i was in the paper running a free weekly
class and eventually donation-based
class I started realizing that when I'm
going to the grocery store now people
aren't running and hiding from me as
that editor lady I met yoga lady and I'm
that person who helped raise money to
save a dog or I'm that person that
helped raise money for some families on
Thanksgiving or I'm that person you know
who helped do a protest against guns in
our community yoga actually means
connection and union and I really
started to want to live that because I
started realizing that i was very
disconnected from community and just
that brief amount of time showed me that
so i decided to go out on a wing and a
prayer and jump out and in june and said
what the heck you know in the end of the
day i can always still write probably if
they'll have me back but that i wanted
to give it a go and see what real sort
of impact that we can have in community
Lansing has need i'm from lansing
michigan i'm a native Washingtonian but
i live in lansing michigan and I
actually do love lansing bear Tony had
put up a hashtag of love Lansing that
that hashtag has a story onto itself but
you know I mean we have a severe obesity
issues we have severe poverty issues
26.9 percent of Lansing is impoverished
we only have a hundred and fourteen
thousand people in the in the darn city
so I wanted to really see what ways that
that we could do some impact first can
we make it affordable and accessible and
so that's what we're doing it now I'm
also now extending things to try to be
of service can yoga be of service can a
business model actually serve community
and not have to be a non-profit to do it
and truly have an impact and help help
folks so we are now a part of the yoga
service
conference in the yoga service council
and I met a wonderful woman and we're
doing training now for why 12s our yoga
12-step recovery where we're going to be
teaching how to stay out of drugs by
using yoga so we have a whole bunch of
training that's coming up 250 bucks a
pop that's a lot i just finished
describing the poverty that's going on
in our community so we developed a yoga
scholarship fund now we couldn't pull
together and get a venue and hold a
silent auction and spend all that kind
of money so we used 32 auction it's
called 32 auction com if you guys
haven't heard of it it's a wonderful way
to raise money really quickly and really
easily so in two weeks time we raise
eleven hundred dollars for which we were
able to do provide scholarships for six
people who are going to eventually train
people for substance for substance
recovery thank you very much beyond that
as far as innovation the key takeaways
then I'll let other people speak in a
moment is I have two clients I have the
clients who can pay the clients who want
to pay and pay more and care about their
community and care about how they spend
their money those are the folks that I
approached through the Twitter through
the Facebook through the website because
they have the access they have the
smartphones I approach targeting them
almost just the same way I would be
targeting them if I were an editor in a
paper saying I need this audience to
care and try to pull them in but
otherwise you know my cleaning lady
barely makes three hundred dollars a
month she is never going to come to my
yoga studio because of a tweet she
doesn't know what a tweet is she doesn't
have a smartphone she has a flip phone
so that's where the shoe leather
marketing comes in I need them both so i
will present about yoga in as engaging
of a way as i can in a community center
in a neighborhood center at a Senior
Center I've gone to schools I've gone to
the boys and girls club I've worked with
the roller derby team in order to help
promote yoga and find innovative ways to
let people see a how relevant is yoga
and it's not just something weird and
and be start to bring yoga down to a
level of community where it's needed and
I'm not just talking about moving our
bodies but we can talk
a little bit more about the benefits of
yoga later if we want and maybe even
hang upside down just so that Trish will
feel feel better about it so I'll hand
it over we're good we'll just dive in
around view with diamond so any
questions or disagreements or hateful
statements that you know wait they hate
yoga you hate yoga just want to go in on
it um I did want to follow immediately
talking about you know your CH the
shifted use of technology and you know
what tools are you using to keep this
thing going what's we're at the social
computing supposing what platforms and
what's the impact in region right well I
mean as a business owner I would
probably say that I was able to launch
fairly cheaply and quickly just because
WordPress exists because I understand
the internet because I understand social
media so we look bigger than we are in
lansing there are bigger yoga studios
that make a lot more money than i do but
if you were to pull people around
lansing the only yoga that they know is
just be yoga so i would say that by
being able to use the tools in a smart
way in a really inexpensive way so i
don't have a lot of overhead but that
has helped me attract the people who can
support the people who need the support
so that that would probably be the the
first big key
wait so this donation this donation
model which I just find so fascinating
and and can I share the number you
shared at lunch so ninety-five percent
of the people end up actually paying so
it's not so the donation thing ends up
being a symbolic value in a community
and you don't really lose a lot of money
by doing it what is it about the current
age that's I mean there's a bunch of
different places that have tried this
and it's working what is it about now do
you think that catches this or would
this have worked 50 years ago in Lansing
100 years or is it something about the
internet and community today I think
that there's a big wave they're
interested in local support and local
business as well as seeing the impact of
their work immediately I think that we
have social conscious but mailing it in
and maybe it's generational now but
mailing a check isn't enough for some
people that they want to be a part of a
fabric and feel as though they can see
you know the effect of their work we
have a suggested donation of eight
dollars a class in most cities a drop in
is fifteen dollars for a class I paid
twenty as I just said the other day I
generally have you know I was telling
him that I'm fifty percent of the
affluent people will pay me twice as
much so folks will pay me sixteen
dollars to twenty dollars for the class
and that helps supplement those who pay
me five dollars those who haven't paid
me at all I had a married couple who are
unemployed for two years and they came
every single day and were unable to pay
and then when the husband got a job I
suddenly saw this donation come online
there was a whoa where'd that money come
from but he was extremely grateful for
having had the opportunity to be able to
get out of the house not scream and yell
at is why I even talked about it's your
fault it's your fault and maybe we're
going to lose our home and and wanted to
give back so it you know you can say
we're paying it forward we're paying it
back word that it's karma yoga whatever
but I do think that people want to be a
part of what they're helping and be a
part of their community as opposed to
just mailing it in so it seems like
there might be something possibly
revolutionary around the mixture of your
classes and I don't know exactly I'm be
interested to hear you talk a little bit
about
happens when you open this up and then
you have the people who are donating and
the people who are going for free
obviously from different worlds some
connected some not connected and what
that looks like and whether you think
there's some kind of bigger social
change that might emerge from that well
I can hope for bigger social change I
have City Council people come to class I
have state representatives come to class
one of the Republican I want him to do a
testimonial for me I have the unemployed
we do have mixed community classes of
all abilities as well as all skills but
i also have tailored our classes across
across the spectrum so we offer 40-plus
yoga we offer yoga to excel one of my
latest blog post is our biggest
controversies people are saying that
it's an insulting name it's yoga for
bigger bodies and I told them well in
New York there's a class called fat yoga
so if you think I'm being insulting yoga
started that you're offended by your
shirt size and we have classes at lunch
time to make it accessible because we're
really close to state government in
downtown Lansing so I like to think that
we make things very accessible and not
just for the able and fit body many of
us think about yoga in terms of what we
see on the yoga journal cover and yoga
is not about being skinny or being
fashionable or being able to get your
heel behind your head it really means
can you find a deeper connections with
mind body spirit connection and a lot of
us have really lost mind body spirit
connection we're really focused on one
thing and we think that that's going to
satisfy us and then later we're all
stressed out you can't move your body
what is it the soul of our feet where's
Linda the soles of our feet stimulate
our thymus and so we're sitting on our
butts and we're not stimulating our
thymus and so we can't move and we turn
it off the thymus that's and then we
return into really irritable people so
we had folks connect who didn't know one
another previously people come I trained
the Lansing roller derby vixens right
there and folks come just to be able to
meet a vixen
and.and folks have connected to network
for jobs and for connections with
Michigan State University which is also
very nearby anyone out there want to put
yes in the back you just flew to it
right well I wanted I'm really
interested in what I would almost coin
conscious commerce or hand-to-hand
commerce can we create a new model for
our capitalist adventures and that it
doesn't have to be can I get as much
money as possible and you can't have any
but can can i benefit and have a roof
over my head and be able to eat and
maybe come to New York every once in a
while but I don't need Alexis and I
don't need anything bigger and can we
collectively sustain me and can I
sustain you with what it is I have to
give but that being said i also have
created a non-profit so the free being
yoga network is being created solely for
service and that will be doing yoga for
special audiences domestic violence
victims homeless shelters those who are
recovering from substance abuse that I
said about why 12's are as well as
at-risk youth so the photo of me working
with the boys and girls club is work
toward that end because it isn't
affordable and accessible to them and
there's more grant monies possibly
available for those kinds of programming
but where the the studio itself is
something separate and it is a
for-profit venture and the service and
in the service arm will be something
that you know that we're that we're
doing for nonprofit anybody else up yes
really committed to
rather than taking
you will share out your lessons
sort of episode
is a cultural openness
resource sharing
cause of what I think we have much more
profit
we have very few of them
most of the sherry stuff is happening
with
she said that were mr. affiliated
really
thank you thank you i know i just want
to try in just a little bit more and i
know that the rest of my panel you know
has awesome awesome things to talk about
like flying but but it does take a lot
of extra extra effort to spread the word
so i can be thinking about how I'm going
to use facebook i'm going to use twitter
how i'm going to use soundcloud how I'm
going to do all of those things to
disseminate my podcasts and my videos
and everything for those who were going
to give me big money but I spent a lot
of time also going to neighborhood
associations and finding out do you have
a website do the people who are in your
neighborhood use it because I don't want
to put anything on their website if
they're not going to use it what's the
best way to reach out to your resident
organization different apartment
complexes have newsletters etc and I
just finished having a conversation with
a huge apartment complex nearby and the
woman says you know our website is
awesome but we just finished polling
everyone who lives here and they don't
use it they are only really use and
they're trying to make it a bulletin
board to say these activities are going
on in in our complex as well as in our
neighborhood but those people live there
and they just figure I don't need to
look at the website because I already
live here that they don't see it as a
tool so I'm recognizing some of the
limitations even in my own community but
I can help them try to see how they
could use these tools to inform their
community of the things that they need
as well because having come from media I
also know the news that my community
isn't getting I know what general
Lansing isn't finding out about that
they can afford and that's good for them
as opposed to I mean we could tend to
just be writing about capital you know
the state capital business forever in
the lansing state journal and not really
tell people what's going on in the
neighborhoods and sadly we actually
don't know what's going on in the
neighborhoods but that's a different
conversation I'm video first or you are
talk first jump oh yeah yeah what's
what's super interesting about sort of
where the three of us come from as
storytellers is the kind of relationship
that you have with the communities and
with the people that you're telling
story is about and I think often within
this field it can be really exploitative
you know you're using people for these
stories and what I admire about what
you've been able to do now is you know
departing a bit from that profession and
actually getting embedded in the
community and actually offering and
being of service to people and I don't
know if you still feel like there's hope
for you no more traditional storytellers
like us and what our level of
responsibility is to some of the
communities that we work with I haven't
given up what I've given up is I have
given up on mainstream media so my
departure you know is a step away from
that but you ask anyone who's ever
worked with me I'm an extremely
passionate person when it comes to
storytelling learning how to interview
how to get rapport how to immerse
yourself into an environment and really
tell the story to a deeper level but we
don't have that time particularly if
you're on a treadmill of pumping out
content and you're also down to a
newsroom there's more people right here
then we're in the entire newsroom by the
time I left it you know I arrived at a
newsroom they had 75 people and I depart
from that newsroom with 21 people that's
that's no way to serve a community of
114,000 much less three whole County's
so you know I think that I haven't given
up on storytelling and I do use the blog
to tell the stories whether it's of a
disabled some disabled brothers who've
learned how to play Tai Chi and go
beyond disability or whether it's
working with a sex offender who never
really finds freedom because he will
always always have to check in with
somebody or whether it's working with a
woman who's bipolar and I get to get her
off of lithium and she gets to drive her
car again those I mean that we all know
I mean any of us who are journalists in
the room pick any of those three and
those are awesome stories to dig deeper
and deeper into never mind the yoga
aspect of it I just I'm just a
of the fabric of their story and helping
them find their story themselves rather
than always getting to be able to tell
about them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
