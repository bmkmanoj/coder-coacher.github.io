basically a set of promises that bomb
makers can make to their users we tried
to we equated it a little bit to sort of
Creative Commons and in creating some
sort of like proactive license or
agreement that we can make that would be
really easy to like you know select I do
this with your personal information I
don't do this with your personal
information because bots are
scary so uh we basically created a
generalized list of potential user
worries so things like you know
encryption of content what to do in
certain like abuse situations not you
abusing the bot the bot abusing you what
happens in like self harm and other
emergency situations what happens when
personally identifiable information is
collected verifying the authenticity of
the bot or of a human various
information sharing human visibility of
the interaction like our humans reading
all the stuff that you're saying to this
bot content ratings for parental
controls publicly stated bot ownership
so who owns the bot is that you is it
your company particularly important for
HR bots and jurisdictional restrictions
so location of date data you know where
it's traveling internationally so yeah
that's what we did if you have any
questions or thoughts come find me
afterwards
sure i'll just post it in a post and put
it in general and then we can follow
from there so if you want to follow up
directly with me i would love to create
some sort of a community organized set
of this information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
