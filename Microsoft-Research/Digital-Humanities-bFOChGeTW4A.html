good afternoon we are now starting our
social digital humanities in these Latin
science workshop I would like to see you
that you might be witnessing a historic
moment because as far as I know it's the
first time session on digital humanities
is organized is organized for at d Latin
science workshop so we hope it is indeed
the first time and they will have
opportunities to organize and other
sessions in the next event this session
will have two panelists professor
Eduardo Max who is professor at the
department of political science at the
University of San Paolo who is going to
be the first to make a presentation
fessor Eduardo marques or was also the
for a former director of the Center for
metropoli metropolitan studies which is
one of the apes' peas CPD's it's a
center which has a long experience in
employing digital techniques to make
research and indeed professor Eduardo
markets introduces these techniques to
make research at the center so here
he'll make his presentation and the next
presentation will be professor a cloud
pianist I will present him afterwards
each presentation will have 30 minutes
and then we'll open the discussion to
the audience ok professor advised
no touching seiko significant kita be no
somatic Africa see now to the bay no
sorry well welcome you all um as Martha
said my name is Eduardo marques I'm a
professor at the department of political
science at wispy and also a researcher
at the Center for metropolitan studies
and the presentation I'm going to to
make explore several of the the studies
and the public policy oriented studies
we did at the center in the last years
and so that's the idea ok
well the this presentation I'm going to
try to stick to the presentation because
I I tend to speak too much so I'll try
to stay on the presentation this
presentation focuses on the use of the
delivery of geographical data base for
the social sciences Social and urban
sciences in Brazil and this is something
relatively new for the especially for
the public coming from the states and
from Europe several of the users I'm
going to present here are relatively
common but they are very new in the
Brazilian case so some years ago
Brazilian lacked almost completely
public access to and dissemination of
large databases especially in
geographical format but since the 90s
the situation has improved substantially
with the free free of charge provision
of data from official agencies
especially the National Bureau of
Statistics but also other agencies such
as impede the national spatial statistic
spatial research institute but also the
actions of several research institutions
such as my sensor the sensor from Milton
metropolitan studies actually these are
centers of research had a very important
role in pushing the official agencies
for providing these kinds of services
they didn't do this I'm going to give
you some examples of this later on well
this produced an important momentum on
the understanding of social phenomena
and academic circles but also
contributed to the public sector
providing support for decision-making
processes what kinds of uses have been
made of quantitative and geographical
analysis for urban and social phenomenon
this presentation shows some examples of
this of these developments stopping with
words and I'm sticking with images from
this point on
so I'm going to present a lot of
examples of things we have been doing
and discussed this while presenting so
we have been mapping social indicators
and finding detailed segregation
patterns this was something that was not
possible in Brazil 10-15 years or 20
years ago since we didn't have census
tracts databases available the National
Bureau of Statistics didn't deliver this
these databases and you could buy some
of depending on the city you could buy
census tracts day databases geographical
databases but for say 15,000 or 20,000
dollars the database okay and this kind
of this kind of use may provide a very
very finely grant granite detailed
analysis of the spaces of the cities we
can also map segregation by social
groups using geographic information
analysis this is a simple map of the
distribution of high-grade professionals
but to build this there's a lot of
statistics on the the the the census
data to construct social classes
considering one of the most important
social stratification classifications
which is this a GP which is the name of
the guys who created the classification
and with this kind of this kind of of
data we can analyze social classes in
Brazil in a much more detailed in in
precise way then the literature on
social sciences and urban studies did
until the 90s okay and we can also map
this and analyze the spatial patterns
for example this is these two two maps
are both for the metropolitan region of
San Paulo the first one is high-grade
professionals which which is a top of
the Occupational structure and the
second one is the skilled manual workers
which is the for this labor force okay
and the darker the the higher the
percentage of the group as you can see
the two maps are one a mirror of the
other okay so you have a very very
strong segregation pattern but also an
avoidance kind of pattern in space and
this becomes very easy to to grasp
looking at the maps we can also analyze
spatial growth this is a map of slums in
San Paulo and in a small part of some
following the eastern zone comparing or
superposing 1991 and 2000 parameters for
favelas okay so you can analyze spatial
growth using this kinds of of analysis
and you can also discuss difficult
differences constants concepts and
definitions of urban phenomenas this in
this case the similar kind of thing
favelas also but favelas in two
different senses favelas according to
ebay share data on 2009 2010 but also
favelas according to the moose polity of
some power and the there's a difference
between between this street information
in what concerns the limits obviously so
you have read the the favelas according
to invasion 2010 in green favelas in two
thousand according to Bashar in grey
favelas according to the municipality of
San Paulo you have all the possibilities
you have the older you have fellows who
continue to be favelas favelas who were
not favelas and became favelas and
places which were considered favelas in
are not anymore and favelas
in according to the municipality with
different superpositions with the DB j
so the pretty the hope it's not GIS
techniques and statistical techniques
used in the social sciences here are not
only to present data but also to try to
understand what these data are about we
can also compare growth patterns this is
again the metropolitan region of San
Paulo in the left-hand side you have the
the growth in the 1998 and this in the
2,000 years Reds are areas which had
negative growth in the decade light blue
are areas with very small growth and
dark blue are areas with high growth
rates okay as you can see during the 90s
you had a very clear pattern center
periphery pattern of decrease
populational decrease of the center of
the city of the metropolitan region and
once you go to the peripheries you get
more growth okay and this pattern is
completely different here and during the
next decade so there's a portent
discussion now and the public policies
in San Paulo about there was a very
important discussion about this bearing
and how this area which was the area
which had more infrastructure and good
living conditions was decreasing
population alee and the outskirts of the
city which had no infrastructure were
increasing a lot but you have a lot of
discussions now to try to understand
what caused this very very strong change
in the in the decade and we can do this
just looking at the maps and analyzing
the maps and comparing the maps visually
or we can do this in a more hard way
using spatial statistics this is the
these are the two
the two motor index graphs for spatial
statistics for each of the maps the
previous maps okay sorry this this map
here is associated with this with this
graph here and the other way around with
the other one and what's this a special
statistic thing it's very easy to
understand spatial statistics Oh modem
apps are Mora 36 arms let's compare a
variable of one geographical unit with
the average value of this same variable
in the surrounding areas in the
neighbors of those of that place so it's
uh it's a measure of spatial
autocorrelation okay so in that it is so
that they indeed these and this
information may be graphed so here you
have the gay the the growth rate of one
single area and the growth rate the
average growth rate of the neighbors in
this case the the the growth rate of the
area is much higher than the growth rate
of the neighbors okay and after mapping
the and after graphing all the
information you can create a regression
line and with this regression line you
can compare quantitatively the two
parents and as you can see there's a
significant drop in the in the
correlation between areas and their
neighbors in the decade and this is also
it's also possible to see this in the
slope of the two lines we can also map a
social structure in space and discuss
the changes of the patterns in this case
this is a map of the metropolitan region
of some problem in two thousand 2010 and
these are spaces considering profiles of
social classes the other maps I I've
showed a word maps
thematic maps of one single category the
presence of high higher grade
professionals but even in the places
where high grade professionals are very
present they are thirty percent of the
whole population which is there you have
seventy percent which belongs to
different social classes so you can
analyze this with fractional analysis
and closer analysis to try to
discriminate profiles of social classes
in spaces and create classification of
spaces so space of the elite space of
the middle classes high middle classes
space of the manual workers and so on
and so forth and analyze and comparing
the maps in comparing in spatial
statistics the kind of analysis I have
showed before you can analyze the
changes on in social structure also this
is what is done here here you have you
can investigate segregation patterns
using indexes boda statistics in another
segregation index dissimilarity index
and try to compare try to analyze which
group is more or more in our last
segregation segregated and which group
is getting more segregated or not but
after saying all this we can just try to
analyze distribute events and analyze
spatial patterns I like very much this
this map there's a map that presents the
the recently born children / / / the
address of the mothers filtering by
mothers teenage mothers ok and in each
of these this thing's in its a dot is a
case and the map presents all the cases
from 2002 2005 pooled and I don't know
if you if the person's from from outside
Sao Paulo can see this clearly
but we don't have the limits of the city
this is the municipalities of some
problem it this is the points the cases
themselves create a perfect map of the
boundaries of the city of the
municipality of support without the
boundaries because the the the the
pattern of distribution of the cases is
so peripheral that they draw the
boundaries of the city and we can do a
lot of can try to use this
disinformation these informations to the
public sector to help the public sector
do better policies and now i'm going to
present a series of slides with results
of studies the central for metropolitan
studies did for public agencies this is
a part of a large study we did to to the
ministry of cities which aimed at up
producing creating a methodology to
estimate and map precarious settlements
in 576 76 municipalities with the
production of maps for 517 miss
apologies okay and this is the
metropolitan region of ballet which is
in the north of the country near the
Amazon forest and in red you have the
census tracts which the beige ahead of
the official agency statistical agency
said they were favelas and now and the
yellow ones are the ones which we found
there are similar completely similar to
the ones that ebj classified and should
be considered favelas if Bashar changed
its classification we can also study
access to public services and to
equipments this is a part of a study we
did to to the municipality of San
follows some years ago it's in the north
and the
East Zone of the city and it's a we did
a series series of studies using spatial
analysis and spatial statistics and
statistics to of social indicators to
try to analyze spatial mismatch between
between equipments and the demand for
services in this case schools so in rad
in blue you have the e each dot is a
school and the small squares are small
areas are the census tracts and
considering the distance of the the
census tract to the nearest school that
the centroid of the census tract you you
can find places regions where for
example here or here or here where new
equipment could be built and this can be
sophisticated by a different level of
school of education and so on and so
forth there's another another study we
did comparing slums with several health
situations in this case the dots are
pneumonia cases of persons who were who
became went hospitalized with pneumonia
and the small dub I don't know what's
the color of this green census tracts
are favelas so there are although
there's a general pattern of
distribution of this there there are as
specific clusters of pneumonia cases
near favelas and this can be studied
indeed and we can also analyze the
distribution of votes and try to see if
they're there are patterns of electro
electro dynamics going on and how this
in and try to analyze if the
these patterns of the distribution of
votes are associated with social
conditions or with social classes or and
analyze electoral behavior this this is
the municipality of San Paulo again with
the votes for two local councillors in
one specific election the red is more
vote the yellow is less vote so in this
case you the representative has very
peripheral pattern of distribution and
in this case very centered in the richer
area of the city what do we need to for
doing all this GIS software is and
statistical packages with statistical
analysis which does which can include
statistical spatial statistics tools we
have been saying has worked towards this
this goal we have we have a partnership
with EP with the national spatial agency
brazilian agency and they had a GIS
software freeware software code to have
you and this but it's there's a very
good it's a very good GIS software but
it's quite a complicated and it lacked
several very simple quite simple
sometimes tools to to do things and at
the same time it had a lot of things
which were too sophisticated for the
common user so we have a partnership
with them and we customized that they
have you program for local policymakers
so there's a new version of Java which
which which is called devil política so
she is social policies which is software
which we understand is much better for
the average user of municipal service
and we have also in this this this
software includes a certain several
tools for for spatial statistics we have
but providing the the the software is
not everything we have to give train
meant to people so saying has the sense
for metropolitan studies has a line of
courses which are depending on the the
user a student paid or not depending on
the Association the public agency has
we've saying and we have been training
hundreds of I think probably around a
thousand technicians in the last eight
years using to use first to use a
commercial software but once we had they
have you customized we started to use to
have you in the courses and we have have
to have GIS GIS data bases which are
provided by several institutions such as
bj saying an EP I Bashar it now the
National Bureau of Statistics Brazilian
Bureau of Statistics is providing a lot
of databases in GIS format but they are
still they still have a lot of problems
and they have to be worked very
intensely before becoming operational
this was not like this ten years ago 10
years ago we didn't have any database
for this so you had to go to the market
and sometimes depending on the agency
you had to go to the market to buy dub
data the public database in the private
market okay we have the addressable the
addressable street map for the
municipality of San Paulo which is
absolutely essential to localize
and this to do actually this awesome to
do this kind of exercise which is
associated to addresses but also with
this also to addresses and this also
addresses all of them were impossible
without a dress ball map of the city end
up the polity of San Paulo had a map
until and until 2004-2005 maybe the the
map was not delivered nor the moon is
policy simply didn't allow anybody to
get them the map but the database was
available these exactly database was
available in the private market for
thirty thousand years or fifteen
thousand dollars so one of the things
which is very very happy very important
to to this kind of use in Brazil
recently is that the databases became
much more available because the several
institutions be started to provide the
databases for free okay and i think the
center for metropolitan studies has a
role on this pressuring to break this
monapali the one apology of databases
buddy bashar now is doing a good job
what you getting better to provide
databases for free that's it
so thank you professor professor Eduardo
marques for such an interesting
presentation and for making it on time
our next presentation presentation will
be professor Claudia pianist he was also
professor at Goosby and got his PhD on
computer science at MIT he has been
working at IBM for almost 15 years and
pivot type of them in Brazil am i right
so please
I first of all thank for invitation
thank you all for coming and as vessel
Martha said I work at today at IBM
Research Brazil and I lead a group i'm
going to talk a little about that and
then before was at OSP today was seeing
some of my ex-students as professors
here is always fun especially when they
cheated on the exams but the after that
I went to MIT then I for ten years I was
at our big lab in in New York City in
close to York City and now I'm here in
Brazil and just how many of you knew
before I said that IBM has a reasonably
big lab in Brazil okay so I second
really talk about so this is the view
from our life it's not bad well there's
one of the sites of our lab this is at
the back of it is a IBM building Rio the
back of it is the Orca so it's a very
nice location but we didn't set up a lab
here too because of the view I mean we
in fact we set up a lab in Brazil
because of the talent we have with we
thought we had here and a talent we are
finding here but our goal is I mean is
be one of the labs of the IBM Research
Organisation IBM research has 3,000
researchers in 12 labs over the world
our goal is to be about 100 100
something in two years we are about 60
people right now we are started two
years ago it's not a bad ramp up and in
fact we have two sites one is some Paulo
another review about half and half of
the researchers and we decided to focus
in four areas in Brazil okay each lab of
IBM tends to focus on different areas
and here in Brazil we have a large group
in in natural resources oil gas water
issues we have a group that focus that's
called smarter human sister that focus
on social development doing a project on
accessibility for example we have my
group work in service I'm going to talk
a little more and have a group who does
microelectronics especially packaging of
micro devices and that's in view so what
about the thing is IBM discriminates
between research and development so we
are not our indie organization we are
our organization our focus is to do
science but also to bring science to our
business but not as a development
organization which IBM has a lot more
people than research what do I call what
service systems research basically what
my group is interested is in looking
into which service systems that are very
dependent on information and try to
reinvent and create new technologies for
those systems things like banking retail
education telecom media entertainment
those are information based service and
that's the kind of technologies we are
trying to address in terms of needs we
have a very motor disciplinary group and
that's essential to work in this area
and we focus in four main areas of this
space one is in computing service
platforms the other is services the live
I T services another one that does
social business analytics i'm going to
talk depth about a project on that area
and also you're interested in how
improve client experience
in terms of service service context one
important question is why do you want to
do service research in Brazil and with
it and the way I see it is is this we
are in a very special moment in the
world very unique there's a big
transformation or we're going on and we
are not talking about the climate change
that's the other one what what we think
is important especially in this context
is that in the next 20 10 20 years more
than half of the world is going to
become middle class and this is
absolutely new in terms of social
context so of course i have to say oh
how do you define the middle class let's
think this is a disposable income I mean
we have work I mean before people have
money enough just to live or less than
money enough to live now we have more
and more people getting the point that
they have disposable income and it's
interesting where where's where is going
to be this middle class and the question
is simple china and india through the
graph here the the bottom curve they're
receiving oops is India right Yes No
this China and it is is India not a way
very wavy gravy sort ok this is the
world this award except China ninja okay
that's the answer ok and a little of
this is Brazil effect and it's also
where all the consumption is going to be
so this in 30 years we expect half of
half more than half the consumption of
the water be of in terms of middle class
it's a huge transformation and
interesting enough question is what's
the impact of this so we think that's
what that there's this collection of
problems related to this growth so this
increasing disposable income that will
be the key challenges that we have to
face besides the climate change and
although related to that and it's like
how can we produce energy without carbon
without producing karma because there's
going to be a huge spike driven by this
clay and water and food and how to have
to learn how to make products in a more
sustainable way otherwise we ran out of
research but very important when people
become middle class they increase their
demand for services and service
productivity is the thing that hasn't
grown in the last 20 years so I'm the
answer to that question in too many ways
is related to the fact that this is a
key problem to address how can i make
service banking retail your education
health all this service that people need
more productive and with better quality
and so i want to talk a little more
about this and but first see why Brazil
well the issue is in Brazil we cross
that line four years ago I'm not sure
you all read it I was surprised when I
hoped so more than of course it depends
how you define middle class but there's
a trend here if it was 54 to Elizabeth
and we think that Brazil is the place
where we have a read the the framework
they need for new service for this class
so it can use Brazil as a testbed for
these new kinds of services that have to
be developed to new ways of doing
service
and also because this middle class is
not exactly what we expect what we know
from is studying these middle class is
that that middle class is not the 1950s
American middle class in the 21st
century it's not the Jetsons which is
exactly that portray no one thing we
learn about this middle class is they
don't want to become Americans or
Italians which is normally what
middle-class wanted to be in Brazil they
want to become something different which
are more like brazilians with it's
possible income and but one thing we
learn is they don't tolerate bad service
quality so our challenge is to produce
service that quality and scale because
this is half of the population and
quality I mean if you give you the new
middle class they are asking tolerant 2
q's in supermarket as the a class in
Brazil they don't they don't buy into
this thing of I can tolerate worst
service for less money and the problem
is when you look at the old technologies
that we develop for the 1950s middle
middle class and beyond was either about
quality or scale so supermarket was our
solution norvasc a solution but not our
call it was a weighted to deal with mass
movement of goods into households from
the small stores that existed before and
again when you look at the quality we
say oh just put more people let's put 20
students per class that's so that's
great quality does that scale know how
many millions and millions of professors
are you need in China and India if I use
the 2200 do I have ways to produce
enough of these teachers right know how
to graduate millions throne
steam so that's the car so the real
challenge is how to do that both things
and we the way we see is we have to
rethink how we deliver and how we do
services and so in that and there's a
large important part to be played by
computer science and social side but in
many ways of sticking to my main area of
work which is computers I say these are
areas that computer science can really
help this new service one is finding
better ways to use social analytics I'm
going to talk more about that the other
is find a ways to remove people from
front and back off see automate things
the other is make whenever have humans
interacting providing service make them
more effective and having technologies
to make that more effective another is
find ways to deal with infrastructures
of this countries which are 10 to 10
then will be still very poor in the next
20 years very complicated and enders
very important thing is make services
into products so we say make rubber
robotics and devices i mean the simplest
case of that is in the past I used to go
to a pharmacy to get my blood pressure
knowing by a small device I go at home
and measure it for most needs is as good
terms of quality is as good as the
pharmaceutical guy assistant blah blah
barely could do pressure anyway so I'm
not I don't have time today to talk
really talk about automation for
thoughts but it's a huge area it's a
huge huge air and we have seen the first
guys doing this but they are doing their
easy services commerce commerce is a
very easy service hard I don't know
 have talked about health
education those are difficult things but
this is a good start so so there's a
huge space for robotics at home and then
the Japanese are ahead in that area they
are really thinking and so you see here
in this is a ice cream serving machine
this surgery sometimes it's an issue of
precision here's a messenger he's a
machine to help paraplegic people eat
and this is a robotic cleaner you can
buy one of those and then ice challenge
you to say what is this machine for an
idea the the one oops sorry this one
here okay here any suggestion okay
cleaning toilets goes rear end cleans it
Japanese come on have to an team had a
profound own culture influenced in Japan
inheritor to take that so but of course
there's a huge explosion and that's what
I'm going to give you a concrete example
research we are doing in Brazil in
meaning data about people in a level
that we never had before so for the
first time I think we can actually do
quantitative social analysis in at large
scale I mean because this data is
sitting all over this place we cannot do
now because these people are defending
this data like crazy too well so it's
hard but the potential is there and help
find ways to connect everyone and find
ways to mine all this information
because then we can start to think about
how can we predict better the behavior
people how can we understand what's
happening with the population so we can
respond for instance by preparing health
services to what's happening and things
like that so what we are doing is
looking at this problem and trying to
develop probabilistic models of this
behavior so we can predict and analyze
just so I understand how many people
here has I have a computer science data
analysis background okay
so there may be too many equations for
some of you and you feel for some of you
but maybe a thing gonna work out okay so
I'm going to talk about a project we
started last end of last year the middle
and mamas middle of last year of a
simulation of subsea medium it is a
effort of a lot of people we have
experts of different areas we have an
expert in simulation we have experts in
text analytics we have some well he's
there is working with us and a lot of
people and what so what we are trying to
do when we think about thing about
Twitter as a simple example of social
media Twitter so what companies are
doing now basically strike to first to
listen what's going on which is already
a lot of work properly listen to
understand what people are chatting
about but in this is normally where
first stage is monitoring looking what
sort of but n it is apparent of
analyzing it or really making the kind
of conclusions that Eduardo slacking but
we see we see this for many activities
that you let a company organization
wants to do in this space there is also
a need to plan those kind of campaigns
and there's a little problem with the
social media explain example it is viral
means it it's hard it's very hard to
understand how fast information will
propagate there because of the way it's
connected in the way the formation flows
so we had a recently an example of a
airline company in Brazil which decided
to do the black friday kind of promotion
and said I mean tickets would cost
whatever and they were expected at this
viral campaign they expect I think
50,000 people around that two million
people show their website
22 much viral well the website crashed
and I don't say I don't have the numbers
were probably half of the people
actually managed to get a promotion
anyway they started they got maybe
30,000 people happy 1,900,000 970,000
happy why because they couldn't plan
they campaign and it's hard because it's
viral okay so what we are trying to do
is to model those systems no matter the
propagation with this and then and we
are looking to this in a very practical
how can I use this median in the best
way possible how can I anticipate is
going to happen how can I in the case of
a campaign how can I predict what's my
return on this I mean work we sell
technology for companies that's the kind
of question they ask but right now it's
very hard to get any of these answers
and what our approach with and this is a
very nice show technology I mean this is
a project let's still have one year or
more to go okay i'm going to show you
the base first but our it is we're going
to sample the network and then we with
sample that what they are talking and
the network structure then we do
sentiment analysis and topic analysis of
what they are talking then we do
predictive modeling of user behavior
when you receive a message of top why
what you do you retweet your post honor
thing you said you send them as saying
not why all this kind of behavior and we
and to make this happen because
companies we do agent-based simulation
of this let me tell you so this is the
method it's basically what i just said
so this means relator is what what our
people are doing so there is some people
in research who are building very
interesting models of what the nodes do
but they don't look at the whole network
the whole predictive modeling of what's
of the behavior and there's a lot of
people who are doing modeling of the
network and how they propagate
information but don't do a good job of
modeling how different
is the behavior of each node normally
there are some all nodes work at the
same way and we think the reality is a
mix of dose and especially social media
where people become followers of other
people not necessarily because they
agree or they like that person I mean
and this would be clear in the example
it is so what we did for sample we this
was around September last year so with
site sample to understand what is
happening with the American elections
and with so this we took sample from the
last month of debe Obama Romney campaign
he and this is the job of somewhere
who's out there is a PG student of
Hobart so what we did is Mindy we take
the Obama network 20 million followers
and if you take one more level of this
network you have the whole twitter
basically ok everyone is a friend of a
friend of Obama of a follower of a
follower of above friend no it's another
thing so we did a sample we then we took
a sample of the tweets that these people
talked and we had about five million six
million tweets in one month which is a
good sample of this most of that don't
talk about Obama or Romney they talk
about other stuff in the end we had
about 25,000 email tweets about Obama or
Romney after all this I believe is about
this 25 thousand users okay so we did
learn it as a same thing I analysis
using sort of standard techniques said
what they're talking about Obama or
first about Obama Romney second positive
or negative and so here is sort of how
it looks like so this is one month okay
and in purple you have
the message the flow the number of
methods here this the other ones not
Obama not Romi so this decision this is
Sunday now this HH blog this is a day
and because the way most of us so have
during the day people talk there is a
little peek in evening people talk more
and to eat in the evening and the sub
Saturday Sunday who cares for tweeting
except when it close to football time
and then people start picking again okay
and I was and this is what people went
what they talked about Obama if you
removed the order so this is the
different these messages according to
being positive negative for Obama
positive negative or Romney normally
Obama positive dominates but there are
peaks where Romney positive dominates
okay when you look at the messages the
political message that people sent it's
very interesting this pattern so most of
time is positive about Obama think that
is huge for pics here which are those
four peaks an idea during the last
month's of campaign debates the three
debates and the vice presidential debate
any Jinxy went during the debates Romney
negative dominates people talk bad about
mom or Romney more than anything else
gender debates so we did it so we have
another data now can we model this so
what we developed was a basic Markov
chain model of each node of the network
so every node has its individual model
which is calibrated according to what
that note did during that month based on
basically saying things like if we
received a positive message what's the
probability that it sent a positive
message about a bomb and so on very
basic about very initial we are still
working to improve this and so we did
this the classical structure to way to
do to this this behavior model is
probabilistic behavior mommy I'm not
going to enter in details here but also
we had to module not only what they say
but how much they talked and that
because we saw that variation in
behavior through time and we did this
small module as a mix of transition the
period of the day and the defect at
Sunday and and and and Saturday they
have smaller people are busy doing other
stuff side sweetie so then we put this
in a simulation model so we we take it
at each step we take each agent we take
a random probability that determines
what's the next step if a person if that
nodes going to post a tweet or not and
so on and to validate what we compute is
the distance between what we predict for
each topic for its sentiment for the
vote total volume and the actual number
during that month and take the square of
that in the sum for all points and this
is what you're doing here so but this is
a lot variation of volume we have to
basically normalize this so we're
basically what's the distance between
the two curves that's the simplest way
to see this okay so here is here is the
actual curve for one week and here where
we are you're getting there okay and at
some point we have to was not working
well and then realized the issue was
that the u.s. covers four time zones so
the night in fact is a little shorter
than you expect so you have to move that
and then this
system improved still work to do but
this is a sort of how we the actual
error so imagine that we should be here
in the bottom if you're perfect and we
and you see that a short knighting
proved this point here is just the ramp
up phase of the model that's normal but
let's look what happens when you look at
stop again sentiment of this network so
the error is the worst errors effect
Roman negative and that's the that's due
to the fact that the sample is remember
easy the sample is large but it's is not
a pattern easy to to the probabilities
the local probabilities are not good but
it'll Mitchell to finish and I think we
about time show you a little example of
what kind of analysis you can make with
this crime scene which know so far I was
trying to match the data sort of success
not much good progress but we are
interested say let's look at each of
engagement how important our people who
are people that in organizations are
very engaged in a process and engagement
we define as how much a node reacts to
what it receives whether it's reading
and propagate sort or act in response
okay and particularly we are interesting
what happens if Obama or Roman said I'm
not going to use tweet anymore forget it
but also in the second layer in the next
lab would say what if the most engaged
guys stop doing okay again this is a
sample there are some errors here but
it's more than a type of analysis so
let's look at all topics okay all that
traffic so what we expect this again
here there ideally if we were perfect if
it was no change we would be here
so if we remove Obama it's the not much
chance that there is change but not much
if you move the top Tim engaged guys
that follow him it's here it gets a
little war simulation you remove
important guys it gets worse if you
remove the top 100 engaged guys then it
gets start to get a lot worse so these
guys are important but if you just
remove a hundred randomly notting not
considering a jury see that the effect
is less than removing the abelian gauge
guys so that means also as Hades saying
this it's also share so shows the
simulation seems to be working is
matching our notion but what seems then
we look not all topics but people
talking about Obama and again removing
Obama is here is Obama has more
influence than the first the top 10
engaged guy following this is
interesting so that shows that the three
or four key sites that follow you have
less importance in change in the system
then the center of the network if this
is analysis right oops sorry finishing
this so it's also and then film over the
top 100 again it's you have up a lot of
impact which is more than than random
hundred so this is the kind of thing you
can start doing basically the question
here is could be summarizes is worth
doing marketing social media and we are
not ready to answer this question but
that's the kind of analysis you can
start to do it with this kind of tool
because you can simulate it under
conditions that we're never going to see
in the real world okay so to finish we
still have a lot of stuff to do I mean
in each of the PCs and the whole but we
think it's a very important way to try
to understand the system it is the kind
of research we are trying to do in this
space
I just want to finish one with one more
comment which is I think this area of
data analytics and social eternally this
is really important is really think of
but we have an incredible shortage of
people who can actually work with that
data I think I think it's a very
important time and this is the right
forum to talk about this but for to find
university programs that may be moted
some OT department that look ins how can
we create data scientists in the volume
that big data will require big data will
require a lot of data science to look at
it and we don't have those people we
don't have them okay people who
understand statistics who understand
data mining who understand enough
computing computation not proposed
exponential search to that space and
also people can bring this all these
conclusions back to home into the social
and to compare with the social truth
let's put it with the ground truth of
this phenomena I think it's it's very
important to look into this kind of okay
thank you and
Thank You professor Claudio pianist for
such a fascinating presentation so now
we have time for the audience to make
questions comments yeah please please
sure can everybody hear closure is it ok
ok ok ok I don't know whether it's being
taped or not oh ok so i was wondering
because Eduardo's presentation was
mostly geo centered and yours was at the
end of course you covered lots of
subjects but yours at the end was tweet
centered how can you combine both
approaches so that you have a Geo
Twitter centered analysis it would
probably show you distinct trends and
and it would refine your both of yours
analysis can both of you guys comment on
on combining these sources of data one
issue is really on yeah is that not all
tweets have geographically much though
not all three tweets have geographical
information where they were sent from ok
it's because you have to enable that
explicitly in in twitter and also you
have to be in a device using a device
that has GPS or some other so but some
are and I've seen people doing this kind
of analysis we haven't done but I've
seen it's very interesting the kind of
data
you can get I don't know about Twitter
exactly but but this is one of the
frontiers of of the social sciences
which work with social network analysis
in a broader sense which is to combine
mapping of relations with the mapping of
the territory or to superpose the two
things this is my ex it's a coincidence
because this is exactly my field that's
what I do is connect segregate spatial
segregation in social networks try to
analyze the role of space and
connections and different patterns of
relations in social phenomena and but
this is really it's an interesting topic
and it's in the frontier mobile phone
companies have that kind of data I mean
if you come by if you have access to SMS
and then you know the closest station
that they were where they are sent from
so and that's kredel II and also that
you know who they are talking to its
telecom companies have the best
databases about people relationship I
mean it's really impressive also because
it's very pervasive to society so there
are an incredible good position in in
this space if they learn how to do later
on with the small end while we don't
have this big n data what we do is to
ask people about their relations and
their locations where they live where
they and try to analyze in studies
specific studies for specific social
groups what's how the superposition of
the two parents of networks happens
so it's great to hear the talks I think
the social media is very helpful or
meaningful today in understanding social
topic social scientist but if you want
to extend this to natural science how do
you get the truth out of comments right
rumors tend to spread and people tend to
make extreme comments when they spread
spread them in social media so any
thoughts on how to distill objective
information from these tweets and things
like that well I would rephrase the
subject as the the problem connect
cognitive data so how to work with
cognitive data data that pass through
the cognition of the the person who
answers or who tweets or who answers the
phone and everything and because uh
there's no truth or no lie in this thing
people behave considering the
information than they have in the way
they process the information so if
someone represents reality in his head
for example my data one I just finished
a large research on the role of social
networks and segregation on poverty in
Brazil with a very tiny for your
standards sample of 362 person's
personal metrics and not only egocentric
networks with personal networks and it
was very hard to get this small sample
because you have to stay there several
times interviewing people and everything
and this so this was this your question
pass through my mind when I was starting
the research and I get completely
convinced that people use the networks
they understand so there's no natural
hidden in one specific place which is
the true network that the network is the
network which is associated to the
actions of the persons and the actions
of the persons are associated with the
cognition they have so I think through
cognitive data we we get a lot of a lot
of of the infamy exactly the kind of
information we need we have to filter
food for lies specifically but depending
on the situation you don't have to do
it's not logic to think that a person is
lying so the person is not is just
thinking the world with its own hand so
let me let me give you example things we
saw in research for example we look at
people checking data but on Facebook and
so on and people tend to check in in
high-end restaurants and places like
that although you couldn't expect these
people to go to those kind of places
every day if you just look at that
particular aspect of what got exposed in
social network you get a biased view on
the living standard of these people for
example
I just just a compliment on a totally
different subject but it's about the
same thing birdwatchers okay and there's
lots of citizen science which is built
on bird watchers reports and it's been
kind of recently discovered that lots of
birdwatchers lie their sightings because
they want to get I don't know bonus
marks for seeing rare birds where they
don't exist so you create a completely
false view and then they start
twittering each other about the bird
they saw which does not exist and then
you build your database of observations
of birds but built on that but if your
subject is about prestige and the how
people try to find status in a specific
situation this is the data you you want
to have so it's the problem is the is
matching the data with the question with
the analytical question different
questions so first the issue of rumors
first we have to understand that
traditional media is as sensitive to
rumors as many of your social media and
I mean I remember watching to the 911
thing happening live and for two hours
CNN was saying that a bomb a car bomb
had exploded in front of the secretary
of state of Washington and they were
wrong and it just silenced about that so
they erase the fact that they made
mistakes of this guide I mean this
happened the same again at the boston
bomb biz it's a normal pattern of
traditional media newspapers they get
into rumors they spread rumors that are
false that's there are false in factual
terms okay that's one side what I think
it's an interesting topic of research in
rumors is to understand whether the
diffusion patterns of factual
communications and ruined and wrong
mutations is different from in these
networks because they made go around
certain nodes for instance and maybe we
have a way to detect patterns of
diffusion that's all this is more likely
to be a rumor this is less likely to be
ruined because the way you to diffuse
through the neck maybe I don't know if
it's true but it's an interesting topic
for us to look at and in some way it
replicates what happens society where
rumors then not by the best to some
people which are more conscious about
fact-checked no no good question but
going back to the last piece of that say
I think we should look at social media
Twitter Facebook Tumblr read it all this
not as community of statements of fact
but as a collection of social signals is
what people want to say and they want to
say things for different reasons okay in
the case they could what's interesting
when we look at I say well this means
that the data is not reliable the
question is not about accuracy but
sweater if there is a constant bias
there because everything think about the
bird watch they tend to see more birds
to normal so look and data it means not
that it's it's wrong means that if you
discounted advise if you measure this
bias you probably can still use that
information but it's counting the bias
for practical for credit reports this is
extremely hard to do well but in
critical situations may look say that's
what I want to go and then you have to
go to kind of small sample interviewing
fact-checking methods to crew to
understand that where your biases and
try to counteract that in in the demand
structure them as the whole dynamics of
the now but it's very hard we're first
we are in the beginning
of all his research and second is a
moving target every day social media
change and the way people use change is
not as intuitive as a whole so whatever
you can do now it's not going to work in
one year that's that's my our feeling in
this arena but at some point gets stable
I hope to be there this is a terrific
session and I really enjoyed the
presentations but I I can't bear not to
say something and has to do with the
notion of fact statement of fasting and
so I think we're seeing in this
discussion two different tradition that
go back hundreds of years in terms of
thinking about that right so from a
science point of view let's think the
rare bird example we would say this kind
of bird is very rare statement of fact
right from a social science humanities
point of view we would say our society
now currently believes that this bird is
very rare we would say that humans are
currently constructing a reality in
which that bird is deemed to be very
rare and and there's a huge difference
right so so you know from our our side
social
we would not believe in objectivity the
truth some some you know instead we
would say that a society or route
consider something a fact consider
something a fact if we all you know most
people agree that okay and so then we
would we would sable why is that well we
would say okay well let's think back in
time you know we used to all say it was
a fact that the Sun you know revolved
around the earth or that you know
molecules always interacted in a
particular way or that on and on and on
right so so it's a very interesting so
what people are in and i think it's
interesting the two presentations 11 was
coming from the notion of theories about
human behavior social networking to help
people and so on and then looking at the
data the other one was looking at that
data and then working backwards you know
a kind of date of discovery working
backwards out of that you know and it's
so interesting because the big data is
is integrating forcing together
conversations in terms of you know
theories about human behavior theories
about human thought and so on and then
going and looking at evidence we would
say and then the other way around
starting with the data or what seemed
and then working backwards right so it's
so fascinating and then to have these
discussions in which the vocabularies
that everything right is is so and
that's why this moment is so interesting
I think anyway I just love these
presentations and it's going to be fun
you know decades ahead to look back on
this discussion
let me ask some more comments on on a
different topic what about human
resources to work on this field Claudio
mentioned the end of the talk the this
important topic and I would like to to
hear from you how how can we start doing
things in order to prepare people that
would be in some five years or ten years
or 15 years able to work on this shoot I
would like to have some some ideas I
think it's two ears better no I think
the demand is growing I mean I'm not
social media only I mean I think we are
generating data incredible speed and and
we know there's a lot of interesting
observations that can be taken from this
data but it's very hard to find
professionals in Brazil outside Brazil
that can handle data properly okay and
more and even more difficult people that
handle that kind of volume of data
properly and so first thing is make sure
that everyone who leaves the computer
science course knows probability well
and such an see I think that's a very
important skill that even I think in the
US they remove that from the core ACM I
believe course yeah I heard in our some
of some course
basic I mean no I mean no I admire
people who who can do a statistics well
and I can't okay but there's so much you
can do if you do that right and there's
so much wrong stuff you can do if you
don't do that well okay you pretended
you're seeing things I mean I mean at
least they should know that correlation
is not causation that's the first most
important thing but but statistic is
sophisticated let me give an example of
that there was a lot of prayers about
this guy that shown that correlated when
after the earthquake in Haiti the
correlated geographical position of
posts and you could find where the most
damaged buildings war and so wow that's
cool that's a very predictive tool and
now I can just look where the tweets and
messages are coming from and I know
where the buildings are effect that was
wrong because he didn't correct his deal
in the circulation in the context of
considering only the places where
buildings exist and when you look and we
said okay let's correlate this data with
only the areas where buildings actually
exist and then it's a negative
correlation people don't tweet on top of
piles of rubble which is also obvious
but good so in this basic statistics you
have to be aware of what your
correlating what are distorting fecha
lenders take the measures in data
science have need to know that and right
now we don't find that skill we have
probable guys with statistical
background which have a hard time using
the kinds of tools we are talking here
and data side the computer science
understand database but don't have the
an electrical statistical tools I mean
not even making the complex where
Professor Chad went of going back to to
the field and compare that with
with qualitative work and even it's more
more rare to find but I think it's
something we need if you want to move
into this air of big data we need this
kind of people and I think in short term
the issue is giving that more and more
of that option to computer science and
twist our traditions to people and then
looking to master courses and then
training to to to create this kind of
view from people who ever had gone
through well I think in the social
sciences looking from Brazil which is
the only place I really know about the
teaching and the formation of persons in
the social science and not in to not in
for not in 10 I think we are improving
we are really improving but it will be a
very long walk until we have a lot of
researches I think we are in phase 1 of
this of this process we were ten years
ago we were in phase zero so it's
something I really think it's something
yeah it's it was hard to find social
science professors who knew quantitative
methods basically quantitative methods
so even selecting new professors to to
teach methods was something very
difficult in Brazil universities and
nowadays you have a critical mass of
persons working on different research
fields but who do methods
I think we are going there but it will
be very hard to get there to get to to
to dialogue really with and to analyze
big end data the social side I have one
question so we know that when we say the
word big data we are talking about the
volume of data this business of data the
risk that some data is easily outdated
and so on so and but we also know that a
big data is expensive to to get it
requires a lot of work sometimes data
available is not the same sometimes not
most times data available is not the
same thing as data that can be treated
in order to get inferences and go in and
make analysis and so also what is your
opinion about sharing data sets so the
present situation is that most data sets
ow are almost private in Brazil in the
sense that each researcher has its own
data set or each research side Center
has its own data set so and we would get
more and more efficient efficient use of
this data set if we share it so I
suspect you you agree that we should
share data set but if you were to to to
start sharing data what would be your
priorities if you were to to be engaged
in such a
endeavor well I agree with your
rhetorical question and a completely in
favor of that and I think I also agreed
that the large majority of the the
researchers and the centers in Brazil as
we say sit on the data and on their data
and do not exchange data do not and I'm
but I'm not sure about the answer to the
last question I think we should have a
structure of incentives to make people
get the data available this I think
internationally this was done by the by
the reviews by the journals that obliged
people to open the data this could be
something that could be tried in Brazil
that the the journals pushed people to
only publish if the researcher presents
the data or gives the data to a kind of
consortium or something like that but
there's another possibility which is to
try to produce or two incentive eight
exchange of data actively I would say
that this the information I don't know
the information about social register's
is something really basic of kinds of
what he was talking about the telephone
companies something that can describe
people and not necessarily about I think
data on the connections of people are
very very interesting and important but
the most basic things are about
whoo-hoo the persons are and where there
are and what their attributes are and
now we don't know this already and so
this could be a start but I'm just
trying to answer you its first answer to
everything do you know how why is there
are so many research works with Twitter
date and that's basically because you
can sample a certain amount of the
public stuff for free and the second is
buying large amounts of Twitter data is
relatively cheap I mean you can buy I
mean something around I'd say 20 million
tweets for public or public for 23
thousand dollars cheap in terms of
research okay so that's in that you
cannot do with Facebook just as an
example in the retarder besides and you
can buy from other media so part of the
issue is that I think there's a larger
issue and then I'm really saying this is
not this is my personal person of your
not my company's view that this land of
digital data in words is so new that all
our legal system is absolutely obsolete
to handle it I mean I day I saw a
researcher I forgot his name now I said
basically if you look at the way data in
social media particularly is controlled
at this point this is the it's basically
pre bill of rights era the data belongs
to the land where you are so this is
before isn't thousand thirteen right
Bill of Rights so this before the first
the first
lego landmarks in terms of personal
rights so at some point we as a society
we will have to discuss what we think is
reasonable as the date the rights of
personal data and we'll have to agree
that and that's a political process so
that's the this the basic structure that
will have to go to at some point when
things stable become a lot it became a
little easier to talk about it's very
hard to do that while the things change
as it was going up Henry said that I
mean princess sharing becomes difficult
for instance you can buy tweets from
Twitter but you cannot post a single one
of them publicly you can only talk about
aggregated it that's the rule yeah
someone created and when you enter to
Twitter its copyright stairs period they
owned a date okay and that's again
things that we have to discuss and i'm
not i'm dying only about twitter because
i am more familiar with it it's not
particularly criticism i think different
areas handled it and then we have to
handle issue the issue of personal data
private things that i want to be proud
it's a it's a very complicated
structured in some ways that we will
have to to look into models like which
the medical profession has done in terms
of data and color codes of conduct I
mean it's not trivial to to do but all
of this have to be done in the context
of a really rethinking of our legal
structure around this what water what's
a reasonable agreement with data
collector like Twitter Facebook Arab I
mean right now is everything belongs to
that space there's a that's the normal
and they i also have legitimate issues
to say why they want to do that because
they won't have to they also have to be
protecting some ways from people saying
that
abusing there's all this good so very
completely release gas is very
complicated but we should try to work
together many consortiums of invictus
companies that provide access to the
data under certain conditions of course
respecting privacy and so on so we can
advance this this kind of ofsted thank
you Eduardo marques in clay of GOP
honest for so interesting contributions
to our current and very young young
young debate on digital humanities in in
