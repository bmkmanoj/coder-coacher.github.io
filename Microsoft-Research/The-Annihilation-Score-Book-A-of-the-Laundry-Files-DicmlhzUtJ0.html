okay thanks thanks everyone for joining
today I'm Jeff Jones I'm formerly from
the trustworthy computing group i'm now
in corporate communications and i'm
privileged today to introduce charles
stross and he's going to reading from
two books actually one of them than the
annihilation score I assume actually
everybody who's here is his probably
read him but if not I'll say a couple of
things I am honored to do the
introduction I'm super impressed with
his imagination extreme creativity as
well as the variety of his writing so
the first book I discovered with
singularity sky I've read the merchant
princes and I've read I'm going to
confess the first three books of the
laundry series and I'm a little bit
compulsive in that I have to read them
in order so I haven't started the latest
one but looking forward to it so with
that I will turn it over to char thank
you very much a date before I get
started can I ask for brief show of
hands how many people here have read the
laundry files earlier books okay so
almost everybody knows almost everybody
knows what they're in for um a couple of
words of introduction just in case
though the first four of these books
were sort of my agent didn't know how to
sell them at first humorous Lovecraftian
spy thrillers about the IT industry this
made no sense to anybody and to add to
the confusion the first four books were
all tributes to different British spy
thriller offers I started with a len
deighton um then Ian Fleming and the
Bond franchise then moved on to a less
well-known one over here but very highly
respected Antony price then Peter Adam
will be offered modesty blaise and then
I sort of got bored with this after
about ten years and decided to start
pass teaching urban fantasy subgenres um
if you've read my novella a coid which
won the hugo award last year that was
unicorns with a lifecycle brainstormed
with Peter watts
um last year's novel paresis chart was
what opening sentence don't be silly Bob
said mo everybody knows vampires don't
exist which tells you everything you
need to know about what that one was
about um the annihilation score which is
the novel i'll be reading from first is
book 6 in the series it's the first one
told but narrated by a viewpoint
character other than bob is told by mo
his wife of some years um big spoiler
now living apart and it's also another
theme one about an urban fantasy
sub-genre this is for superhero novel
the elevator pitch for this one was
Bob's exs former superhero team and
fight crime for a lot of committee
meetings involved and after that if
there's if time permits i'll be doing a
little bit of a reading from the not
quite final draft of the nightmare
stacks which is book seven which won't
be out until next July but first a chunk
of B annihilation score and I'm going to
start with the prologue um please allow
me to introduce myself no strike that
period stop backspace backspace bloody
computer no stop listening stop
dictating end end oh I give up will you
stop doing that start again typing this
time damn speech recognition and
autocorrect my husband is sometimes a
bit slow on the uptake you'd think that
after nearly 10 years together of which
we've been married for seven he'd have
realized that our relationship consisted
of him me and a bone white violin made
for a mad scientist by Alou ta turn
necromancer but no the third party in
our main aaj turns out to be a surprise
to him and he needs more time to think
about it bending over backwards to give
him the benefit of a doubt this has only
become an issue since my husband
acquired the ability to see Lecter
that's what i call my violin when i
argue with it for what he is he/she/it
whatever bob is very unusual in having
this ability it marks him as a member of
a privileged elite the Select club of a
cult practitioner
who can recognize when they're in the
presence of it and stand fast against it
rather than fleeing screaming into the
night like the vampire bitch from human
resources and what she was doing in the
living room at five o'clock in the
morning issues vampires Valens and
marital miscommunications I've gone off
topic again haven't I take free hello my
name is mo that's short for Dominica
Brian I'm 43 years old married to a man
who calls himself Bob Howard aged 38
mcwhorter we are currently separated
while we try to sort things out things
included but not limited to my
relationship with my violin his
relationship with a vampire bitch from
human resources and the end of a world
as we know it which is an ongoing work
related headache you are reading this
because you're presumably a new laundry
fish and I'm not on hand to brief you in
person yes I'm writing this under my own
name none of those silly code names but
my other half is so keen on if I were
you if sorry if I were him you'd
probably be reading a work journal by
side eyeing Braveheart or some such
nonsense but I'm not so let's keep this
simple it's quite likely I'll be dead by
the time you read this report or I might
just be on extended medical leave we're
required to keep these journals in order
to facilitate institutional knowledge
retention in event of our demise but
frankly DIY psychotherapy is so much of
a higher priority right now I've been
under extreme stress recently but
unfortunately a nervous breakdown is a
luxury I can't afford there's no time
for it in the calendar so I'm working it
all out as I go along and if you can get
past or V Bridget Jones meets the
apocalypse stuff you might also pick up
some useful workplace tips Bob and I are
both operatives we work for an obscure
department of the British civil service
known to its inmates of whom you are now
one as for laundry Bob works in IT well
I have a part-time consultancy post and
also teach theory and philosophy of
music birkbeck college in actual fact
bob is a computational demonologists to
a necromancer and I'm a combat
epistemologists is my job to study
hostile philosophies and disrupt them
don't
could law become clear later I also play
the violin a brief recap magic is the
name given to the practice of
manipulating the ultra structure of
reality by carrying out mathematical
operations we live in a multiverse and
certain operators trigger echoes of a
platonic realm of mathematical truth
echoes which can be amplified and feed
back into our and other realities
computers being machines for executing
mathematical operations at very high
speed are useful to us as occult engines
likewise some of us have ability to
carry out magical operations in our own
heads albeit at a terrible cost magic
used to be rare and difficult and
unsystematic it became rather more
common and easy and formal after Alan
Turing put it on a sound theoretical
footing at Bletchley Park during the war
for which sin our predecessors had him
bumped off during the 1950's it was an
act of such epic stupidity that we're
deeply ashamed and subsequently people
who discover the core ferrum for
themselves tend to be recruited and put
to use for the organization instead
unfortunate is everywhere these days and
so are hackers to such an extent but we
have a serious human resources problem
as in too many people to keep track of
worse for not only too many computers
but too many brains the effect of all
this thinking on the structure of
space-time is damaging the more magic
varies but easier magic becomes and the
risk we run is that the increasing rate
of former Turkish called flux over time
tends to infinity and we hit the magical
singularity in space-time breaks down
and the nightmares known as the Elder
Gods come out to play we in the laundry
refer to this apocalyptic apocalyptic
situation as case nightmare green the
bad news is due to the population crisis
we've been in its early stages for the
past few years and we're unlikely to be
safe again until the 22nd century and so
it is we live a curious double life as
boring middle-aged civil servants on the
one hand and as the nation's occult
security service on beat other which
brings me to the subject of operation
incorrigible I'm supposed to be using
this document to give you a full and
free
account of operation incorrigible I
suppose it is a decent introduction to
what we do here in the laundry the
trouble is my experience of it was
colored by certain events of a personal
nature but if I recognize that it is
highly unprofessional to bring one's
private life into the office not to
mention potentially offensive and a
violation of a charred guidelines on
respect for diversity and sexual
misconduct I can't let it pass bluntly
Bob started it and I really can't see
any way to explain operational
incorrigible without reference to the
vampire bitch from HR and worse her with
the gills or the Mayor of London the
nude sculpture on the fourth plinth and
how I blew my cover not to mention a
plague of superheroes what it's like to
have to set up a government agency from
scratch during a crisis and the truth
about the official home office superhero
team and finally my relationship with
Professor Freud Stein so Bob Bob I know
you're eating this you'd better tell
relate we need a marriage guidance
counselor of a security clearance
because this is what happened and I'm
now gonna skip forward a couple of
chapters and several very very bad days
indeed an hour before my alarm call at
about ten to eleven my ears registered a
distant ringing of a work telephone in
the kitchen it takes me 11 rings six
more than usual to get to the phone and
I pick it up bleary-eyed and panting yes
I gasped certain that something is wrong
then I realize what it is Bob would
normally have answered the phone because
he sleeps on the side of a bed nearest
the door ops desk is that agent candid
this is two calls in 12 hours yes I
admit and authenticate myself what is it
sorry to bother you after last night but
we have a the duty officer sounds a
reticent which is just plain wrong we
have a peculiar situation emerging how
soon can you get to Trafalgar Square
with your instrument what for we want
you to busk
flummoxed is my middle name you want me
to bust why precisely in Trafalgar
Square that you need a license oh the
police will cover for you um it would be
best if you looked casual and it's your
student out having fun something like
that I don't know how to explain to the
duty officer that most music students
aren't in their early 40s maybe I just
look young for my age I sigh I'll give
it a try what's the plan there's a
developing situation on the fourth
plinth and we need someone to keep an
eye on it who isn't going to draw
attention and who's equipped to
intervene if it escalates all our
reserves are committed to mopping up
after the last night something really
bad happens at the end of a reese's
chart and misses the night after so um I
know this sounds bad but when I say
we're scraping the barrel I mean we're
totally over committed and running at
one hundred and twenty percent we didn't
want to disturb you but there's no one
else suddenly it clicks you want me
because I'm socially invisible don't you
uh you could put it like that personally
I'd rather not but Colonel locket said
you'd understand he ends on a whimper
blue shifting into a wine and so he
should the landline phone is a 1940 zero
Baker like and steel monstrosity
otherwise my death grip would be
crumbling it to splinters at this point
I'll be there in an hour i snarl as
politely as I can and slam receiver down
so hard at it bounces the laundry is
regrettably top-heavy with men of a
certain age institutional culture
propagates down the decades and however
much we try to change it it grinds you
down after a while as it happens the
laundry is a lot better today than it
was when I was sucked into the machinery
a decade ago but it takes an entire
working career to climb a promotion
ladder and as with all organizations
shit trickles down from the top in this
particular case I'm forced to admit but
lockert has a good and valid point women
over about 40 becomes socially invisible
and I'm close enough to the tipping
point but if I don't take care of my
appearance I can fall foul of it it's a
very strange experience being the
invisible woman you can walk into a shop
or restaurant or a bar and eyeballs just
slide past you as if you aren't there
when you're trying to get served it's
infuriating at best
sometimes humiliating but in our line of
work sometimes having a passive cloak of
invisibility but doesn't set off every
detector within a kilometer can be
useful I grumble to myself as I refill
the cat's Bowl retrieve my instrument
run a brush for my hair and hunt app
casual where I'd ordinarily have
relegated to housework only days i pick
out jeans a cable knit sweater what used
to be a nice flying jacket of bob's a
comfy pair but worn pair of doc martens
by way of accessories liberty scarf and
a black bear aver to both seen better
days yeah that's my bow Homer to your
student persona baby for a moment I
contemplate going hipster instead but
that might stand out a smear of lipstick
and a bad idle ever handbag completely
ensemble and I'm ready to serenade for
one-legged pigeons of London skip
forward a little but taxi drops me
precisely outside the entrance to
Charing Cross tube station I head
towards the confused mass of pedestrian
crossings on the Strand that it takes me
a couple of minutes to make it to the
edge of Trafalgar Square right pause
beneath the supercilious gaze of a
one-eyed Admiral mentally drag my
middle-aged invisibility cloak tight
around my shoulders and take stock of my
surroundings in the middle of the square
fountains fronted by Nelson's column a
via each corner of a square for a fork
as a plinth free of a blimp are
surmounted by pompous Victorian
triumphalist statues General Sir Henry
have a log General Sir Charles James
Napier and his Nobby Nobbs king george
the fourth himself but over to the left
of the back is the infamous empty fourth
plinth and the instance i clap eyes on
it i realize but we have a problem the
fourth plinth is one of those eccentric
british affectations which we love to
parade around in public as a sign of our
broad-minded tolerance is actually just
another classical stone plinth
originally intended to support an
equestrian statue but it's been empty
for 150 years because nobody could agree
who to put on it then around the turn of
the millennium the royal society of arts
said oh can we but bar over plinth and
ever since then it's been occupied by an
ever-changing succession of arts
projects sometimes
at you sometimes an abstract sculpture
sometimes a random member of a public
reciting poetry or narrating Shakespeare
in semaphore I'm not making that last
one up today there appears to be a human
pyramid on the plinth well maybe it's a
rugby scrum or a public orgy or a
sponsored died in I'm not sure because
I'm at the other side of a square and
there are a lot of people in the way but
there's what looks like a pile of naked
human bodies up there with the odd leg
or arm flopping lymph limply over the
side I sit on one of the steps and
opened my violin case pigeons rattle and
flapped their way across the flagstones
but I forced myself not to let them
distract me at the far side of a square
I spot a van with a satellite uplink
dish on its roof in an open door a
journalist with cameraman in tow they
seem to be looking up of a plinth I take
Lecter and his bow out latch the case
closed and sling it on my back standing
with my violin in hand I look for the
police there's always a car or two drawn
up around the edge of a square but today
I spot three vans and four cars one with
the markings of an armed response
vehicle they're all parked on the west
side of a square and a handful of
bobby's inst Abby's a dispersed among
the crowd which is no thinner or thicker
than I'd expect for a weekday in one of
the nation's most prominent tourist
attractions no sign of anything
particularly unusual tho except whoa I'm
so startled by what I see would I speak
aloud but nobody pays me any attention
because everyone else is doing it to a
woman floats into the air in front of
the plinth she's a yummy mummy type
modestly dressed with a matching lee
accessorized baby in a buggy besides of
a range rover she's waving her arms and
legs in an upside like an upside-down
people clinging onto the pushchair which
is also airborne for grim death I can
just about hear her desperate screams
for help above the traffic noise and the
hum of a crowd as she levitates
alongside the four meter tall slab of
marble the pushchair tips sideways and
sheds its load a rain of baby bottles
and diapers slap splat to the ground
woman screams again and loses her grip
on the buggy it drops for a moment then
swoops and kisses for ground
controlled landing she however is not so
lucky whatever forces who holds her
airborne raises her higher then slides
her above the pile of bodies on the
plinth then invisible hands start to
undress her in midair I look around a
couple of a police are dotted around the
plinth but they seem reluctant to
approach it looking harder I see they're
putting down cones and unrolling
incident tape a woman is naked now
suddenly she stops flashing as if
paralyzed or stunned her invisible
assailant floats are slowly over the
plinth then lures her on top of the
mound of bodies but are already there I
desperately hope she's not dead I begin
to walk towards the middle of a square
sorry miss you can't go there I stop
there's not much point in trying to walk
right through a 2 meter tall slab of
London's finest who's just stepped in
front of you but looking past his
shoulder I see another couple of vans
pulling up cops in riot gear climbing
out and forming a line facing outwards
around the plinth I pull out my warrant
card and hold it where he can't ignore
it take me to your incident controller
right skip forward again a big navy blue
mobile command post is parking just
around the corner in power mal and my
guide point smear it I get to the bus
just as a lot of police officers
converges on it a short woman with a
no-nonsense attitude is giving the
marching orders I'm about to raise my
warrant card again when she turns and
stares at me and I recognize her oh good
says Josephine is this your mess it's
inspector Joe Sullivan I don't know I
just got here I shrug bo &amp;amp; fiddle in
either hand I feel common now that I've
got a professional for it to work with I
got a call an hour ago when did it kick
off wait she turns to her pussy beeps
this is dr. O'Brien she works with us
give her what she asks for any questions
bring them to me now get moving if I was
the praying kind I'd fact think my
wishes were answered Joe Sullivan is one
of our direct contacts with a
metropolitan police she'd worked worked
with us on and off for longer and I've
been doing field work she turns back to
me
started 78 minutes ago body one goes
flying up to situationist Art Show
heaven Australian backpacker
mid-twenties infrared camera on the
chopper says they're still warm and
breathing but they're not moving and
whatever is doing it likes its bananas
peeled she glances at her tablet up the
12 bodies now but nobody has any idea
what's doing it we sent at the bat
signal for officer friendly but he's not
answering officer friendly whatever us
his would-be Association of Chief police
officers but they're stretched too thin
he's probably still tangled up in
paperwork and witness statements from
his last call out her frustration is
palpable I don't want to have to call
them off trafalgar square but if we
can't find the perp well well i say let
me see if the office knows anything
we're standing next to a van with open
doors so I part my violin on the front
seat while I pull out the phone duty
desk O'Brien here can he put me through
to it whatever idiot thought it was a
good idea to send me over to Trafalgar
Square without a briefing oh yes dr.
Brown transferring you now good morning
moe I recognize Jerry lockets gravelly
voice immediately what's going on I
resist viewers to roll my eyes we have a
major incident in Trafalgar Square and
you're asking me someone is stripping
tourists naked in building a POW on the
fourth plinth paralyzing them to the
police have no idea in vert on the edge
of shouting distracts me i hunch my head
over to hold my phone against my
shoulder and turn to see what's going on
oh dear it just escalated I'll call you
back another body is floating upwards
he's hanging on to his bicycle the
handlebars legs pedaling furiously in
midair portly his suit rumpled and his
massive unkempt blond hair flopping
across his forehead he's instantly
recognizable as the mayor of london this
is a point where I know it's an American
audience here because the Brits would
have been rolling on the floor a minute
ago
oh dear our King Christ on a crutch
mouser Josephine her eyes round with
horror I Winston sympathy get him she
shouts cops are already converging on
the levitating mare like a pack of
hounds in pursuit of a fox the
unspeakable in pursuit of the uneatable
he floats above them calling for help
one of them jumps high enough to grab
the front wheel of the bike but dangles
for barely a second before it slips from
a mares grip he lands with a crash and
the mare floats higher-- I ring off then
fumble for the phones confusing massive
i console I get to be off cut sweet
occult sensors and countermeasures yes
we do indeed have an app for that I
raise the phone and slowly pan across
four square the mayor struggles aligned
in green the contours of the form field
outlined by the fourth phones modified
camera chip the bodies atop the plinth
also glow gotcha I think I tap Josephine
shoulder to get her attention and she
wills yes she demands don't be too
obvious about it I say keeping my voice
quiet and conversational but I'm merry
prankster is chilling out on the
northeast plinth between the legs of the
horse he's lit up like a laser Matloff
emerald in my phone's display but when I
tried to look at him with my own eyes
they just don't seem to want to see him
it's far too easy to focus on the
horse's head of a stone plinth beneath
it he's got some kind of don't look at
me field shimmering green contrails link
is sweeping hands to the body of a
current victim Josephine's grins
savagely charming I'll have my boys lift
him no I slide my phone back into my
jacket pocket then collect the violin we
have no idea of his full capabilities so
far he's given us telekinesis paralysis
and observation avoidance that's quite a
hat trick isn't it but we don't know but
it's all he's capable of and there's his
victims to think about if we take him
down does the paralysis suddenly we're
off if so they're lying naked on a
platform 4 meters up over stone flags
someone is going to fall and break their
neck if they start moving and then
there's a motivation is you to consider
so I pause do you have any ideas above
the plinth the Mayor of London is
twirling around his long access like a
chicken on a rota
sorry his coat has taken flight and is
flapping around the top of Nelson's
column like a demented Raven his shoes
pop off like champagne corks as our
prankster dbags V old etonian beneath
him that damn the TV camera is
presumably getting the lead item for
tomorrow for tonight's news public
safety comes first then I need to get a
couple of squads ready to rush in with
airbags Josephine decides someone to
disable him on my word she looks at me
then takes a deep breath and looks back
of a mare um can you distract him I look
around the square I'll do my best give
me a minute to report him then I'll go
and make a song and dance under his nose
starting in I checked my watch five
minutes go she passed me on the back
then heads back to the mobile incident
room I walk across the cradock Plaza
gaze downcast to avoid making eye
contact with the people i'm careful ii
avoiding the police are clearing the
northwest corner of a square by forming
a line elbow to elbow and expanding it
Josephine's obviously told them to keep
it low-key and friendly because there's
a marked lack of jostling and riot
shields they're having to work at it
though because if there's one thing
guaranteed to attract the attention of
tourists and locals alike it's a
spectacle of a levitating semi-naked
mare the square is stippled with a
flicker of camera fill in flashes I have
to shimmy to avoid elbows and backpacks
and oblivious non-native stopping dead
to peer at their tourist guides my line
of sight on Georgia for phys tenuous and
in any case I can't be too obvious about
keeping an eye on him rather than
heading direct to the invisible Joker I
stroll in a wide curve around the
outside of a square vaillant my shoulder
and bow poised finally I find a
reasonable pitch is nothing special just
a patch of flagstones beside a low war
but isn't already occupied by a tour
group or another musical hopeful but
it's about 50 meters away from George
and his unseen passenger and I've got a
sight line on the police presence around
the plinth and Beyond it the mobile
incident vehicle I own sling the violin
case and layer to open at my feet then I
flex my fingers Lecter is sleepy and
reluctant to rise to full awareness
which is good when he's in this state
he's more little more than a
instrument I checked the pickups and
switch off for small preamp what are you
doing I ignore him and start to tune up
I checked my watch it's time I launch
into the church owner from bus party
tour in D minor because I can do it in
my sleep while reserving ninety percent
of my attention to keeping track of
developments and more importantly Lecter
is used to me using it as a basic
exercise rather than the prelude to an
attack what are you doing he wins in my
head I let him see the statue through my
eyes complete with a disturbing blind
spot between the front legs of a horse
ah this is a bone mate this is a violin
made out of bits of human bone extracted
while the owners were still screaming
it's not a very nice instrument um I
turned slowly to gaze in the direction
of a plinth the mare twill slowly
stripped down to a pair of polka-dotted
Navy boxer shorts as I watch they begin
to slide south he grabs at them and for
a moment he keeps his grip but then the
fabric tears and they fly away oh my i
mouth nearly losing my fingering as the
Spangled and flicker of camera flashes
rises to a manic intensity is gonna be
on the front page of all the newspapers
tomorrow when I turned back towards my
target lend me your vision I instruct
Lecter as I stare across the bridge avi
instrument my sight Gray's out for a
moment and then returns some colors are
emphasized there's a strange lambin c2b
air between the horses hooves which
slowly resolves into the shape of a
seated human figure can I eat him ask my
violin no I convey for attention my
fingertips mine not yours Lecter whines
I'm hungry nevertheless I tighten my
grip and draw on the violins power but I
decide is inappropriate this calls for
something more contemporary something
darker I seek into a different form a
more rhythmic sinister melody wrapped
around an implicit beat Bela Lugosi's
dead for solo improv violin values of
mortality I relax my grip on left
Lecter's appetite and he strains forward
eagerly sucking on the energy source in
front of him the blind spot twists
twitches slightly then begins to shrink
arms and legs slide into view hands move
agitated laughing boy has realized that
something is wrong out of the corner of
my eye I spot the mare standing on top
of a pile of naked bodies on the plinth
he's waving and gesticulating in my
direction is he a sensitive shit nothing
to be done I press on raising the bow
for a second I flipped the switch on the
violins preamp is not an audio amplifier
and those aren't electronic pickups I
started subtle but now it's time to
party the bats have left the belfry and
I'm almost airborne whoops my ward
buzzes angrily and I hasty squirt juice
into it mojo sucked out to the joker on
the plinth was taken aim at me I land
with a painful jolt but managed to
absorb the drop with my knees I'll feel
it tomorrow rooted to the ground again I
increased both volume and tempo willing
into a screaming blur as the song rises
the strings begin to glow and now I
reach out with electus power and wrapped
my will around the target got you he
struggles as I lift him into the air
stabbing at me with pulses of near solid
air but would ruptured eardrums and
break bones if I didn't have a defensive
ward drawing on bonier infinite depths
of a violins power he screams
obscenities and lashes out at me for a
moment I think I've caught a giant frog
then I realized he's just plump beer
guts and like for bodystockings really
don't play well together put me down you
mother fucking hippie bitch put me down
or I will fuck you up so hard you walk
bow-legged for a month I tightened my
grip on him and he shuts up unable to
draw breath I see red literally heart
pounding and head throbbing in time to
the beats I'm imagining laughing boy
likes to strip the clothes off young
women in public as he adds them to the
pornographic sculpture he's building on
the empty plinth laughing boy thinks
rape jokes are funny laughing boy thinks
it's all fun and games until a mother
fucking hippie bitch squeeze it turns
his own mojo back on him does he I'll
show him I'll squeeze him until his guts
explode stop that I tell Lecter laughing
boy is turning blue in the face eyes
bulging as I dangled him above the heads
of a crowd I let him down gently in the
middle of a knot of rap police been
stopped the muse
dead and learn my instrument feeling
sick oh god oh god oh god I'm humble
residual power surge warms a protective
ward at the base of my throat I nearly
throw up I just nearly hanged a man with
a new severe what's happening to me I
put my instrument away and pick up its
case and begin to walk towards the
mobile incident command vehicle and
that's when I see the second TV uplink
van with a BBC news crew and the camera
tracking me for my reaction shot when I
realize they broadcast the entire
magical dual live on news24 so much for
secret agents and now let me just see if
I can pull this up um okay with you in a
second for a surprise extract from next
year's laundry files novel The Nightmare
stacks just a second while I resize it
slightly for easier reading um would of
introduction this is not a novel told by
Bob or by moe this one is about Alex V
somewhat nerdy banking IT person
introduced in the rhesus chart people
here every search art yeah I'm taking a
trip around various other laundry files
protagonists although the next Bob novel
will be booked 8 the Delirium brief
which I'm sort of working on in the
background for the year after next
meanwhile though um here is the the
nightmare stacks which is another urban
fantasy pastiche this one dealing with
elves but not in a good way so I'll just
read the introduction a vampire is
haunting Whitby its traditional it's an
hour after dusk on a Saturday evening
for weeks before the spring gothic
festival Alex the vamp a strolls along
the seafront his hands for a deep into
the pockets of his tweed jacket there's
a chill breeze blowing on shore and
here's the pavement to himself as he
walks eyes downcast and chin tucked into
his chest lost in thought what profound
insight does the creature of a knight
contemplate as he paces along the north
beside the beach opposite a row of
moonlit houses what ancient wisdom what
hideous secrets haunt the conscience of
the undying let's take a look inside his
head alex is fretting about his form p 7
64 employee travel and subsistence claim
which he will have to fill out once he
returns to his cramped room in a local
bed-and-breakfast it looks as large and
sinister in his mind's eye as a vision
of his own lichen stained gravestone
nevertheless it provides a welcome
distraction from the eldritch undead
horror but is his student loan company
statement and that in turn pales into
insignificance compared to the worst
dread of all how he is going to explain
everything that has happened in the past
few months to his parents early supposed
bits but are classified government
secrets Alex hasn't been a vampire for
very long and he isn't very good at it
yet but at least he's still alive unlike
several other members of his brood the
sea is coming in and with it the clouds
the wind is chilly on his skin and so
Alex turns and begins to retrace his
steps towards be a stairs up to the high
street past the pavilion on the
whalebone arch past shuttered cafes and
the museum he walks up the path to the
cliffside wondering if he's made a
mistake he's not sure if he's honest
with himself but coming to Whitby was
the right thing to do he's supposed to
be in Leeds where he'll be working for
the next few weeks someone booked him a
seat on a Friday afternoon train the
better to enable him to make it to the
office at nine o'clock sharp on Monday
they obviously hadn't got the memo about
flexitime hours and persons of homology
spending the weekend in Whitby was
entirely his own idea he has never
visited the small coastal village before
indeed he only knows about it for two
reasons Whitby is famous man oval
Dracula as the harbour Webber go ship
Demeter comes around and more recently
it plays host to a number of goth
festivals themselves attracted to the
village because of its famous Fang
infested for sure why Whitby if not
because of your beers cliche for alex is
not a golf well Whitby has one other
advantage it's not close enough to his
home city that there's any risk
running into his parents or younger
sister by accident whitby is alexs
excuse for not being in leeds while he's
not working and not being in ligious as
excuse for not visiting his family and
not visiting his family makes it a whole
lot easier not to tell them about the V
word which is an awkwardness is being
grappling with an ever-increasing
discomfort for months now like a zit
that stubbornly refuses to burst the
season for Goths and their steampunk
siblings may not be here yet but Whitby
isn't entirely devoid of a flagrantly
historical as it happens there's a group
of drama students staying in one of the
B&amp;amp;B is on the high street and as he's
passing the door it bursts open Alex
suddenly finds himself adrift in a sea
of mina harker's and Abraham Van
Helsing's a trio of diaphanous Lee clad
brides of Dracula eddying around him
they giggle and laugh at some private
Joker's base swish past bringing a flush
to Alex's cheeks alex has a bad case of
wandering male gaze a side effect of his
monastic upbringing and being about 24
years old he's mature enough to find
this mortifying but not sufficiently
strong will to suppress it in the
presence of so much well displayed
cleavage I say Alex skids to a stop just
in time to avoid colliding with a fellow
in white tie and Tails his red satin
lined opera Cape draped across his
shoulders I say old man the fellow DOPS
his top hat with Dwight gloves but
glimmer fee at reclaim the darkness
obnoxiously dedicated to staying in
character he exudes the
passive-aggressive politeness and
assured self-confidence that suggested
his Alex and not he who is intent on
occupying the wrong century Alex fights
hard not to take an instant disliked him
as he continues I don't think I've seen
you before who are you supposed to be
Alex does a double take he's not wearing
a costume but in the darkness his tweed
jacket an open-necked white shirt worn
with a scarf against the late March
chill Evan Lee resembles a period item
an imp of a Mallee perverse whispers in
his ear Quincey Morris he tells v AMA to
Dracula feeling slightly smug about
knowing his Stoker although in truth he
just skimmed the Wikipedia plot synopsis
on the train over capital chortles
Othello and I am sir arthur holmwood so
i suppose
makes us rivals in love for the hand of
a delectable Lucy at which of his
chiseled chin indicates a robustly
athletic student doing her best to
portray a consumptive Victorian beauty
not one of a now shivering Brides at
least until the fiend snatches her away
haha all right come on there's no time
to lose we received a report by
telegraph he adds confidingly but the
feens has been sighted up by the
graveyard we'd better head straight
there is Jeremy always this much of a
ham the first bride of Dracula verdigris
hair and a copper nose ring wearing a
pinstriped bustle dress and a necklace
of paste gems the size of quail eggs
whispers in the direction of a second
straight haired blonde clad in a crimson
corset in several yards of tulle is not
meant to carry but Alex with a vampire's
preternatural hearing can't help
listening in not usually he was hitting
the Red Bull and vodka pretty hard right
to observes then grimaces and adjusts
her fangs he youthfully mellow out after
once he gets his groove follow me
declares of a bumptious arthur holmwood
gesturing theatrically as he strides
purposefully up the cliff side path are
you coming bride one asks Alex brightly
I suppose Alex checks his priorities and
rapidly realizes but the alternative to
a torrid date with his form p 7 64 oh
yes of course but I don't suppose you'd
mind lending me your jacket it's Baltic
this evening as very sashay towards the
cliff Alex confesses even as he strips
off his jacket I'm not a larper really I
hope you don't mind now that's cool
we're just doing a dress rehearsal
tonight the green haired girl pulls his
tweet jacket on over her bare shoulders
Alex extends his elbow feeling a rare
fits of gratitude to his sister Sarah
for having hijacked the living room
telly for one too many Regency costume
dramas and years gone by and she takes
his arm I'm Cassie who are you Alex Alex
feels himself carried along out of
control as if he has indeed been
abducted by the alien and seductive
brides of Dracula he's not totally
unsocialized but he's a product of a
single sex schooling followed by
graduate and postgraduate studies and a
field of institutionalized gender bias
when you subject a statistically
significant sample
of otherworldly mail nerds to this
treatment what you end up with is a
certain proportion of 24 year old
virgins it therefore takes Alex a moment
to remember that most people would deal
with the current situation by making
friendly conversation rather than
wigging out you're rehearsing for
performance of Dracula for the festival
he eventually manages yes yes it's a
walking performance Cassie leans on his
armors they pick their way up the
steepening incline her hand is warm me
Veronica Ronne Louise of a bride's
behind the burberry front she sounds
slightly distant as if her Singh every
sentence inside her own head before she
speaks in the background Veronica
murmurs something inaudible of round two
fangs there's a confrontation of a park
a fight scene irma graveyard then we
pursue accounts to the ruins of the a
beef of a big climax is the whole
vampire thing very dramatic very sexy
what brings you to town Alex spots are
studying him sidelong and his guts
clenched as he realizes but she knows he
isn't in fact in steampunk draggle here
for the golf weekend experience he's
just one fashionable I'm Alex's brain
freezes as he remembers her fearful oath
the smiling man in the blue uniform made
him swear as he signed the Official
Secrets Act using a calligraphy pen
loaded with his own blood the gas that
requires him to act in accordance with
his perception of the organization's
best interest I'm a mathematician I work
for the government nerd out fool his
socially adept super-ego swears
despairingly that's funny Cassie stares
at him you're too short to be Alan
Turing she means Benedict Cumberbatch in
the movie you mean the GCHQ right the
spooks again that subtle pause in her
speech as if she's reading from an
internal script oh no I don't work for
GCHQ alex says hastily mortified no it's
much more boring than that which is to
say which is what he has to say to her
smoking-hot girl on his arm because if
he tells the truth his new superior's
will be extremely disappointed in him
with consequences which might be merely
embarrassing but which could potentially
be faithful no really I'm just here for
a weekend getting away from Leeds
because that's where work sent me a
thought strikes him do you really think
I look like Alan Turing
but they've reached the top of a hill
and a nearly at the park as he asks and
Cassie releases his arm hey Ronnie
they're already here we're late she
turns to him I'm really sorry but we're
on in 60 seconds and I've gotta get in
character and I don't have time she
slides out of his jacket and while he's
fumbling with it she opens a tiny
collection pulls out a pair of plastic
fangs sorry about this dick around for
the up the party oh yes says Alex Cassie
nods then she and the other two brides
of Dracula turn Ray's ver arms and
proceed to rival anger asleep for
Jeremy's not the only ham here towards a
small clump of mostly black clad
on-lookers in the middle of a parks
nearly manicured lawn he watches
Cassie's enchanting back receding his
moonstruck for all of 30 seconds then
his watch that his phone begins to ply
the right play the ride of the Valkyries
what the Alex pulls out his phone and
she's a most unwelcome caller ID its
head office hello Alex speaking I mean
dr. Shwartz here who's this there's a
brief pause please hold another voice
comes on the line male older weary
doctor this is the DM speaking oh fuck
the DM alex has heard of a semi
legendary reclusive Dungeon Master he
was covered in one of her Friday
miscellaneous sessions last month
briefings someone in external assets has
laid on for the surviving members of the
vamp a scrum to bring them up to speed
on some of their new coworkers he racks
his brain desperately trying to remember
what it is that the DM does for the
laundry something to do with running a
very peculiar Dungeons and Dragons
campaign or was it working with iterated
game fairy ensuring complete rule sets
in production systems based on applied
demonology Alex squelches a fort before
it trails off into the mists of memory
what can I do for you he asks according
to the duty officer you're in a Whitby
are you in Whitby dr. Schwartz if so
what are you doing there I was just
chatting up the brides of Dracula seems
like the wrong thing to say not to
mention an over optimistic
interpretation of a situation so he
settles for taking an evening stroll
what can I do for you Whitby the DM
pronounces the name of the seaside
village in a doom-laden tone but Alex
feels demands a more ominous payload
something like the fur
reich or mortal you just happened to be
taking an evening stroll in Whitby tell
me have you noticed anything out of the
ordinary on your perambulations across
the park for brides of dracula are
running for their lives pursued in
circles by a squad of fearless vampire
hunters brandishing stakes but look
suspiciously like out of season cricket
stumps no why did you see anything along
the seafront behind him the audience
claps appreciatively one out I mostly
saw the sea what were you expecting
mermaids a pause quite possibly and led
to believe that blue Hades with a class
free glamour can pass from her maid yes
but that's not what I was asking about
well I didn't see anything Alex hunches
his shoulders instinctively well apart
from be usual out of season tourists see
fronting a troupe of actors rehearsing
an outdoor performance of Dracula for
the goth festival did you even read your
briefing pack the dm's voice rises
angrily what briefing pack alex is
perplexed what please hold the phone
goes silent for perhaps half a minute
Alex makes his way along the side of a
path watching a van Helsing rescuers
sleepwalking Mina Murray from the
clutches of an undead Lucy Westenra
there's no sign of Cassie while he waits
of a dms resume Bacall finally a tinny
throat-clearing sound emerges Murr
speaker dr. Schwartz please accept my
apologies I'm monitoring operation in
your vicinity and naturally assume from
your presence in the grid of it you were
part of it an operation Alex shakes his
head I was sent to Leeds for next week
I'm working regular office hours some
sightseeing right now because of the
weekend why are you not in Leeds per
diem demands while specially as if
Alex's delinquency on his time off is
something he finds personally offensive
have you ever seen leads on a Saturday
night it may not be the real reason for
his absence but it's a perfectly
serviceable excuse the nightlight miss
city centre is more than a little
raucous well then the DM seems to come
to some sort of conclusion would you
like to make yourself useful dr.
Schwartz the field team is short-handed
and I have a little job you might care
to undertake and I'm going to stop at
that cool
and I should add that book is due out
next July so one a year for a little bit
and now I think we've got about 10 how
long we got left from for questions
about 10-15 minutes yeah okay um I can
open the floor for questions um okay you
Yusuf so years ago it's all around of
course first rocketeer their gym at the
short story holder war actually
completely blew me away when i first
read it i think it made some comments in
the past that which is kind of a laundry
thought that super serious like James
Bond food did that like stick with you
that turned into the laundry was a
credit inspiration how did that kind of
a ball um okay I began writing a Cold
War in 1991 um before I had any idea of
making people of craft Ian's story it
was going to be it was an attempt
getting across for sensation of what it
was like to grow up in the UK during the
cold war with the sense verte vast
remote alien intelligences could decide
to burn your face off and kill everybody
you know at short notice for
incomprehensible ideological reasons of
their own and I got a couple of pages
done and then hit a brick wall and
couldn't figure out how to make it work
and how to get that sense of existential
dread across and it stayed on the shelf
for about five years and then I suddenly
oh of course at the Mountains of Madness
is a sequel to at the Mountains of
Madness let's take Lovecraft seriously
what would have happened if the story of
a mountains of madness had been part of
our history well better been an arms
race to loot all the elder races weapons
from a city in Antarctica and of course
it would then end up with shoggoth gaps
and Cthulhu being weaponized and
everything went into that story so I
wrote that story and it worked pretty
much as a standalone but oh dear God
it's a bit of a Down Beat one uh I could
not do that at novel length and a couple
of years later um I had this idea I
wanted to do a slashdot reading
sandal-wearing geek this was sort of
nineteen ninety eight ish dot-com one
error who's fallen into a British your
classic CD British
I fuller secret government agency I
suddenly realized hello let's bring some
tentacles into this because a colder war
isn't funny at all the laundry files is
dark humor the whole way and seems to
work better for it but yet it was not a
dry run exactly but it gay it was where
I first began getting interval of
crafting thing into actually writing it
Oh use it yes oh I should've up Bob
mm-hmm character can you speak up a
structure sir chris um is bothered this
point just a vm running on a predator
hypervisor i'll have to get back to you
on that um we have some more questions
right is there some reason why we were
quaking in the present does um okay the
present tense versatile past tense
there's this whole grab bag of tools you
can use which tents you write in which
personally writing with a first person
or third person or occasionally second
person let me give you a tip never ever
ever try writing fiction in the second
person future pluperfect your brain will
melt um no the reason its present tense
is narrative tension the reader never
really knows what's going to happen next
flipside first person is a bit of a
giveaway that the narrator is going to
survive to the end of a book except in
glass house when I kill off in a rate of
two thirds of a way for the novel Sean
on Maguire's pulled that stunt as well
so it's usually a sign that you've got
an unreliable narrator but um yeah it's
just the immediacy mva immediate a punch
an impact and I started that way and
laundry files and I'm carrying on with
it other books I've written are more
conventionally structured in the past
tense I'm I don't think I've got the
guts to try and writing in town over
limber future tense mm-hmm I read the
first laundry files but myself and then
shared the series of my wife by
the audiobooks more breath by getting
memory and I was wondering if you had
any selection in a bulb and call the
process of pretty body of work or none I
don't do audiobooks and the rights
assault recorded book who then organized
everything themselves yeah it's all I
could in principle get involved if I
felt strongly enough about it to want to
get involved but I'd be negotiating with
people through my agent and it gets
complex and annoying fast doing that um
more questions there's some online
questions actually no question about the
audio books just sounds like maybe you
don't have an answer but wondering if
this last book because it's MO as the as
the narrator if you'd have been a female
but it sounds like you're not that's not
your fault okay then the other question
was maybe slightly pointed but it says
Bob Howard seems to have a problem with
all things Microsoft I will confess to
having worked for a rival operating
system vendor at one point more of a
point I'm just a UNIX guy my head
doesn't work I've made it I periodically
make an attempt to grapple with Windows
and it just doesn't really work for me
i'm currently when I'm at home I'm
currently swearing at a surface free
trying to make it do what I wanted to do
I mean I'm sure it's a very is a really
nice piece of hardware design and I'm
sure it'll work really well if you're
committed to the Microsoft application
ecosystem but virtually nothing i use
day to day for work is a microsoft
application so um yeah well i think you
were no um are we going to see angleton
again no comment that would be a spoiler
um Yousef so in the past I think you've
stayed a bit you can't write a sequel to
rule 34 because there's just not much
more to expound upon at this point no no
it's it's not a bad not much around
about what happened was I began
designing bat universe in 2005 and it
was said in 2017 it's diverged too much
also
around the time i would have begun
writing the lambda function with a third
book in the trilogy we ran smack bang
into what I call the Scottish political
singularity which we're not out of yet
you cannot write near-future fiction set
in Scotland at present it without it
being horribly obsolete within 18 months
it's just not doable so I'm probably
going to do more in a similar line later
but it won't be in that setting um you
had a hand up earlier will we learn more
about the black chamber yes in book 9
yep you're gonna have to wait so there
is a long term story arc planned out I
gotta get priority to people who haven't
already asked questions um one sec you
first I think I've heard rumors of maybe
a new three book sets on the family tree
yes um it won't be sold as merchant
princes book spell it'll be titled the
Empire Games trilogy book one dark state
comes out next September it's my big fat
post Edward Snowden grim meathook future
techno-thriller with alternate universes
but yeah an original working title
though was merchant Prince's the next
generation it's set in 2020 in in a
timeline where the Department for
Homeland Security has responsibility for
securing the United States against
threats from all other parallel
universes and then it goes downhill from
there someone back there had been
Hannibal you sir I was wondering for
thyroid glasshouse as the original book
I read of yours they have expanded into
the laundry files and whatnot I was
wondering is there going to be you have
any plans for any books that have you
know he gates T gates and all sorts of
other fun class I'll see things um I did
actually try to sell a sequel to glass
house a few years ago unfortunately
glass house was my slowest selling SF
novel in the US market and got a wheat I
might have enough clout to do it one of
these years but it wouldn't actually be
sold as a sequel that we sold as a
standalone novel and it's something I
wrote in 2003 so
coming back to it it's usually it's
difficult to maintain interest in a lot
of projects but you did ten years ago or
more I'd have to actually really feel
the need to say something in that
setting to go back to it so see a group
of popularity of e-books and audiobooks
affected your actual writing at all like
the reconstruction of your writing um it
hasn't affected the construction
particularly because it's just another
output format or rather it hasn't
affected it much yet one of the factors
that people really don't appreciate
outside the business is things like the
length of books being dictated via the
sales channels and the manufacturing
processes for example it used to be the
case but I could not write a novel that
ran two more than four hundred and
sixteen pages or my editor would scream
at me and make me take some of them out
the reason being hardcover books in the
US are still made the traditional way by
printing 16 up folding into signatures
and then stitching them and only a
limited number of bookbinder ease can
stitch big fat novels in hardcover so
the length of my novels was determinate
determined by the mechanical strength of
a sewing machine that constraint has now
been lifted but you know you can see how
this is going to change with ebooks the
length constraints it used to be imposed
by printing technology just aren't there
anymore so over time we're going to see
major changes I'm away things are
produced I'm not sure for example
there's any point in me ever bolting
together another short story collection
because individual short stories can be
published online and sold direct nothing
these go out of print and I think time
for a last question it's time air green
as the density of thinking becomes
larger it becomes easy because you're
evil things beyond space to come here
doesn't this mean data centers for cloud
computing providers are going to become
like this the ground zero
laundry like Oliver Microsoft and Amazon
how do you know they're not anyway i
think is it time to wrap yet right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
