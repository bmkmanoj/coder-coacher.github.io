why don't we get started so today we
have Adrian castle from ens it's
graduating this year supervised by Rick
Kenyan who's at Brown so he's going to
talk to us about random curves laplacian
send determinants okay thank you David
hi everybody um okay so in this talk i
will be talking mainly about Lou Perez
random walks in different and different
aspects of it so let me just so that
everybody is aware of what we're talking
about just recall the definition of loop
race run amok so it's a random simple
path it was introduced by Greg Lawler in
the 80s and this is a sample pass on a Z
2 with a very small mesh size and the
construction goes and follow you take a
random walk started from some vertex and
each time you create a loop in the path
so itself intersection you erase this
loop start again from the point you just
erase the loop from continue the random
walk and so on so of course in order to
to have I mean to finish this prodigy
this procedure you need to specify some
kind of boundary or so either you can
have a target vertex and you will kill
the random walk when it touches this
eventually bit this vertex so you can do
this on any finite graph or in and or
you can imagine for example here in Z to
having a very large box starting at the
origin and stopping the work when it
eventually touches the boundary so
that's that's a loop race run amok so in
fact loop race random walks are closely
related to uniform spanning tree sub
graph so i will just recall that right
now so this is a sample of a uniform
spanning tree on a finite square grid
and
it was shown by David Wilson how to
sample such a uniform spanning tree from
a lubra random walk and the way it goes
is as follow well suppose you want to
you pick some vertex in the graph and
you want to sample a uniform spanning
tree rooted at that vertex and oriented
towards it well the way it goes this is
so they've been with since algun you
pick any vertex which is not the root
you start a group rates random walk
which ends at this route and now you
keep this first simple path you just
waited and now you pick some vertex that
is not already on this branch just
created you do a loop rates run the more
killed when it touches the path you kept
at the first step and you go on until
every vertex is covered so by
construction this will yield yield
spanning graph which is a tree there are
no cycles and david has shown that this
is at the uniform measure on all
spanning trees well oriented but then
you can forget the root forget the
orientation and you you get a uniform
spanning tree now ok so i want to do to
to introduce just now a slight variation
on Wilsons algorithm which is that we
are not going to erase all loops that
are created but we are going to keep
them with certain probabilities so let
me well let me just have used this
notation so we pick some finite graph
and I denote alpha to be a function with
values in 01 which to any cycle in the
graph associated some weight so and now
we can well we can also put some of
course I didn't say but Wilson's
algorithm work for any conductors biased
random walk on the graph so imagine you
have some positive weights on the edges
you perform random walk proportionally
to these weights nearest neighbor friend
mark well if you do this you will obtain
a univ in the spanning tree with
proportional to the product of the
edgeways now in this slightly different
version what I want to introduce is a
probability measure on cycle route it's
burning forest which will have a weight
proportional to product over the edges
of the conductance times the product
over the cycles of a certain weight so
let me if it's not familiar to anybody
to everybody what what a cycle route
it's forest is spanning forest sorry so
it's this object here so you have an
underlying square grid a psycho rooted
spanning forest is a spanning sub graph
and it contains cycles but in a very
specific way namely that each connected
components contains a unique cycle so
you can see them pictured here on the
right you have a particular case of
cycle with expanding forest where
there's only one kind of I mean it's
connected so we call this a cycle rooted
spanning tree now the the algorithm of
Wilson i just presented for uniform
spanning trees generally generalizes
really quite easily to this setting in
fact in that case you don't even need to
specify any root and the algorithm goes
as follows so suppose you want to sample
a cycle routed spanning forest which has
a weight proportional to this factor so
this is product over the edges of the
conductances times the product over the
cycle in the cycle routes spanning
forest of their their weight
so what yeah this is a gamma i think
gamma is a cycle route in spanish forest
so it's it's that so it's a union of
disjoint cycles plus each cycle has a
tree rooted on it and the algorithm goes
as follow I mean I wrote it here but i
will explaining a cloud so you don't fix
any any route we're going to sample an
oriented 0f i will sell yourself or
cycle route is spanning forest oriented
in the sense that the branches can
oriented towards a cycle and the cycle
has some orientation now how does it go
you pick any ver text from the graph and
you perform a loop erased random walk
I'm not sorry for fumble random walk
bias by the conductances now when you
construct a silver dissected loop in the
usual algorithm would you would just
erase it but here are we going to flip a
coin with bias I mean with winning
probability alpha of gamma and if it
turns out the outcome is is positive we
keep we keep the loop so let me just so
you pick some random vertex you do the
work you make some loop you flip a coin
with a and you keep you keep this loop
with probability alpha of gamma this is
the loop gamma and you flip a coin with
bias of half gamma now suppose the
outcome was that you do keep it so this
is your first step of the output now you
pics you pick some vertex which is not
already on this path and you do the same
thing so maybe you will create some
other loop you will flip the coin and
you will it will say that you have to
erase it ok so continue and maybe
eventually you will touch this first
part so now you just keep that like that
it will be routed on this cycle so you
go on until all vertices are created so
sometimes you keep cycle sometimes you
erase them and you will touch something
which was already created and what you
see is that the end you have exactly a
cycle rooted spanning force which is if
you will
oriented but this is not this is not
important and if you follow it with sins
proof of westerns algorithm basically
you you see that it samples exactly the
the measure I had on the previous slide
so this measure okay so now I want to
talk okay so what we have just seen for
so far is that solu press random walk is
related to uniform spanning trees as as
was already known and it's all of course
with this modified version also related
to the cycle with it spanning forest so
in a way but the difference between the
two approaches is in the first case you
only have simple path I mean they're not
closed not and in here the properties
that we really construct certain loops
and we may see them as if we want
excursions of the loop right random walk
right because what whenever a loop is
kept of course it's not just a simple
random walk along this curve but each
time you may have created some loops
that you have erased etc so it's a
different kind of random path so in a
way this correspondence will enable to
study well either the trees using the
looper is random walk or the loop raised
loops using this trees and I will show
this will be the topic of my talk right
now so I went first to concentrate on
this special case where you have only
one connected component well a way to to
achieve such such a such a measure is to
take so let's forget for the moment
about edge conductances we just take
them to be all one and I will take for
any loop the same weight which is some
very small parameter
alpha which will suppose tends to 0 well
if you are in a finite graph then if
alpha is very small you're likely to
keep only one loop AB basically because
if you had k loops the probability of
having k loops will be proportional to
alpha to the k if alpha is very small it
will keep only only one group and in
fact you will have the uniform measure
on on cycle rooted trees with with so
only one loop so I want to talk now just
a little bit about this uniform cycle
with it spanning tree so finite graph
uniform measure on cycle rooted tree
which is we can also call it the
unicycle uniform unicycle so okay so
that's one so okay so this is a quite a
dense slide but it recalls different
result that I will now explain so this
is joint work with Richard Canyon and
wei wu from Brown University so let me
just explain briefly the notations so
here we so you have square root
triangular grid so suppose you have some
infinite periodic grid so we were just
suppose for a moment it's the square
grid but the two other grades will work
too and we take some large box of size n
now L so we will look at the uniform
measure on cycle rooted spanning trees
of this graph I can call this graph GN
and we have the measured pn uniform on
ciris trees so l is a random variable
equal to the length so when I say length
just a combinatorial length number of
edges of the cycle so I have somewhere
in this random cycle
so l is the length a is the area so area
just means for me the number of faces we
have a planar graph so the number of
faces inside the outside the loop and so
the results that I present on the slides
concerned the expected length an
expected area expected area squared and
I will talk afterwards about the higher
moment moments of the of the era so let
me start by explaining the first two
lines which are not due to me but ok so
let me just first explain ok let me
first explain the second line so in a
paper by eval and a Lionel divine they
have shown that the expected length of
the uniform unicycle is related to some
constant side that they call the looping
constant at least a ok I should explain
over this mean this this is actually an
equality asymptotically so so they they
have shown and I will explain in a
second how that's for Z to you should
take now n to go to infinity the
expected length tends to eight the
integer number eight which is a bit
surprising and I don't think we have
already a good explanation as to why
this is rational or even integer but
it's it's that and roughly to explain
how the arguments goes so what is this
site well sigh
is some constant that depends on the
lattice but is given by the loop race
run amok so suppose you fix the origin
here 0 you're on this large book n and
you take a loop price random walk killed
on the boundary now you can ask the
question for fixed n what is the
expected number of neighbors of zero on
this path so it's not it's a simple path
but ok you couldn't you can go to this
neighboring vertex like that and so I
mean you will have only one neighboring
vertex but you can go to it just
directly like that oh by doing some loop
and going to it afterwards so it's not
obvious what the expected number of
neighbors of the origin is in this
through praised path but it turns out
that as n goes to infinity this has a
limit which is X I the looping constant
and David Wilson and which is canon have
shown as for that for these different
grids well X I is equal to 5 45 third
and 13 to 12 now how the evil person
learning divine relate this to that but
I don't have time to explain it all but
it goes through the burning by ejection
of da which relates uniform spanning
trees to the obedience and pile and then
uses some convergence for the a billion
sign pile by a 3 ln yeah right and oh
sorry yes a delta is the degree of these
regular graphs so yeah so yeah okay so
so this proof of convergence was done at
least paper can be found for the for the
square grid but I mean so I think David
Wilson has worked
progress that it works for the other
grades and therefore using the same
argument as in Paris and Levine can
derive these quantities so it's kind of
interesting that also in these other
grades you get integers and which are
actually equals to twice the degree of
the dual graph well okay that doesn't
match what so the avid is definitely
requires an explanation but we don't
know for a moment ok so that was for the
expected length so you might think that
if this random loop has finite expected
length but it could be the same of the
error or not and turns out not to be so
in fact the the area somehow has a
heavier tail so let me just explain so
what we have shown is that I will just
talk for example about the square with I
mean the other cases of similar the
expected area on the box of size n grows
as log in and we have the explicit
factor it's 4 of x log in and now the
expected area squared grows as N squared
and the constant is some expect seasick
constant which is which involves this
this number I will talk about it in a
second but just notice that so the
constant in terms in front of the
leading term is something that is
lettuce dependent so these numbers times
something that just depends on the on
the domain ah ok I understand why you
might be surprised I didn't explain at
all what is d I'm sorry so a 1-1 ok
actually to compute exactly this
constant what we have used is some of
course we're looking at an infinite
volume limit but since we wanted to
convert some kind of discrete Riemann
sum to an integral or actually looked at
the scale version so the way we did it
is you take some
some domain in the plane and now you
push in the square lattice one over N so
each time this will define you some some
graph G n no it's just lies as a
discrete X proxim a shin of this domain
and we may define the same the same the
same the same measure the uniform
measuring the unicycles compute the
length and the era when I say length and
air it's always the combinatorial when
I'm not talking about the Euclidean one
which of course will tend to zero so but
if we have sort of this sequence of
graphs that have this boundary at
infinity in the sense that when they are
we skate they approximate this domain
then the constant in front of the
leading term of the arrow squared is
given by this this quantity so so
actually so this quantity you can so g
of z w is the greens function in the
domain with Derek a boundary conditions
and so you can just think of this
quantity as being the mean expected exit
time of Brownian motion from this domain
that is you take Brownian motion started
at some point Z then you integrate the
time it is spent at w of all points on
the domain so this will give you the
exit time of the domain the burner
motion killed on the boundary and now
you average this overall zzz so this
will give you the mean expected exit
time and so here are a few examples so
for the disk so this quantity at least
with this rescaling is something which
is scaling parents for rotation
invariant translation event so and it is
maximized for the disk so for the disk
it were it is worth one of a pie and now
for rectangle with aspect ratio tau it's
given by like this for example
so this this use just a small comment is
I mean one way to see that it is
maximized for the dist is actually to
relate this constant to this what I
called hero of d and so there's a
beautiful short paper of polio from the
50s where he computes this quantity
which has a mechanical interpretation as
being the torsional rigidity of some
metal beam of cross section D so you
take a domain D cylinder you asked about
the torsional rigidity of this this
turns out to be the quantity expression
from the minimization PDE problem and by
using some symmetrization he shows that
that it is maximized for the disc it's
kind of interesting now just one should
talk just a little bit about about the
proof of this result so I explained
these previous works now how about these
two what I call here critical wait it's
something that comes from the scaling
limit approach so in the scaling limit
approach what what we're going to do is
that we're going to express these
quantities expected area expected error
squared in terms of green's functions on
the graph and now here i have used the
continuous green's function on the
domain so what we have actually used is
some convergence of the discrete object
when we scale to the actual continuous
object and this could requires that
harmonic functions converge to
continuous our main function and then
you have to wait yo graph with certain
iso radial critical weights and turns
out that for these grids it is given by
these numbers and okay so this is why I
wrote down these numbers
now a word maybe now I will explain a
little bit about the proof so let me
start with the the area so i'm just
going to consider a case of a large box
of size n and actually the simple
observation you can make is that if
you're looking at a cycle rooted
spanning tree on this graph and now you
take it's a which is with free boundary
conditions 3d and now you take the dual
planar graph well this is going to be a
two-component forest which is wired on
the boundary oh let me just draw if i
have here a cycle some branches free on
the boundary and i will take the planar
duo this will be some tree inside and
some tree outside which is rooted on the
boundary so in fact a way to answer okay
and now what for example if we want to
compute the expected area we just have
to some for the further for the cycle
route 83 overall faces the probability
that this face lies inside the uniform
thirsty right this is just the expected
number of faces that are inside this is
the area so in fact we need to know
these probabilities so we want to know
given face what is the probability that
it lies inside the circle well if we
take the dual approach it's just asking
well if we pick some some face so it's a
point in the dual graph what is the
probability that it lies in this
floating component so the component of
this by 3 which is not rooted on the
boundary and then we can use some
electrical electrical network theory or
some results from already from yourself
about the number of spanning trees and
we can show that the probability that F
lies in this uniform spanning tree is
equal to the number so I will note
denote kappa the number while okay i
would just write number of spanning
trees of the graph divided by the number
of cycle rooted spanning trees times the
greens function on the dual graph so i
will put a star with directly a boundary
condition on this outer vertex evaluated
at phase f this is in fact the
electrical resistance in a network
between one point one point f here and i
mean if you put unit resistances on all
edges and ask what is the resistance
between this point and the outer outer /
things so we obtain that and actually
when we consider so okay so now how okay
basically what is the the asymptotics of
this well this greens function evaluated
at the same point for almost all places
will be a something like 1 over 2 pi log
n now this ratio number of spanning
trees / number of psychology spanning
trees is actually related to the
expected length of the cycle with its
spanning tree so and this was shown to
converge so actually this will this will
be roughly let me get it right
aight aight over n squared okay the
reason for that I will just say it in a
few words is that if you take a uniform
spanning tree and you add some random
edge well in you will obtain a cycle
rooted spanning tree but it will not be
the uniform measure but it will be
biased by the length of the cycle and
therefore if you compute the number of
spanning trees time the number of edges
which are not on those 3 and divide it
by the number of cycle waited spanning
tree you will get exactly the expected
length which is eight ok so using this
result you obtain that roughly this will
be 8 over N squared 1 over 2 pi log N
and so this is 4 PI that's just 1 over N
squared log M and now you sum over all
the N squared faces and you will get the
expected area is for pi log in now for
the case of the second moment of the
area it's a bit the similar approach we
just write that the expected area
squared is a sum over all pairs of faces
of the probability that both faces lie
inside this this sir st the cycle and
now the result is that
the probability to face is being inside
CSG well how can we compute that this is
a probability we're going to condition
on one place to be inside so let's take
F and F prime let's suppose F is inside
the cycle now what's the probability
that F prime will be inside well using a
either using the wizard algorithm or
some other technique you can show that
it's the probability that random walk
started at F prime touches F before it
hits the boundary and it's just a
harmonic function which is worth zero on
the boundary and one at F and which you
evaluate at F prime so the conditional
probability here will just be this
harmonic function which you can write in
terms of greens function as this ratio
of G store values at the F F prime
divided by G Star FF now using the
result we previously had for probability
of F which is that it's this ratio than
that there's a simplification and you
obtain
number of spanning trees number of cycle
widget spanning trees g-star of F F
prime now using the same result as
before this will be B dad and now using
some care and the convergence I
explained earlier I mean taking care of
these critical ways you can show that
this greens function will be an
approximation of the continuous one and
since you're now summing over all pairs
of faces this will be like a Riemann sum
for the integral which is written here
ok so now okay so let me just go a bit
working now it turns out that for higher
moments this a kind of simple rejection
by relating the cycle route spanning
tree it with dual which is just this
tree with two components and then using
the simple electrical properties turns
out to be much harder if you want to
take more points into account so for
example if I wanted to know what's the
probability that three specified faces
are inside the cycle which would be a
way to compute the third moment or this
one how to be at least we don't know how
to do it intractable but via some
automatic that I will now introduce we
were able to show that the cave moment
grows like like that and this is just a
constant that depends on on k and Auntie
so distinct neeks I will now introduce a
is more related to a scaling omit
approach so I wasn't we will now not
only consider this uniform cycle rooted
tree on the graph but rather try to
compute some scaling limits of crs F
cycle routes rain forest
so okay let me show some samples and
then I will introduce what this is and
how I wish compute them so okay so these
are different surfaces first one is a
sphere with its usual metric some other
curved surface this is a hyperbolic ball
and this is a flat torus so these signs
identified and I represented here only
the loops of certain cycle route
spanning forest which will be weighted
in order the day or macroscopic and then
we forget about all the branches that
cover all the graph I didn't say but I
we will consider some graphs embedded on
these surfaces which approximate them in
a certain way okay so let me now go to
this topic
for this presentation I will consider
only one case which is we take some
domain in the plane which is
topologically non-trivial I mean non
simply connected so there are some holes
and we approximate it by the square grid
1 over n z2 so this will be the graph GN
and this is the surface signal now on
for each n we will consider PN to be the
uniform measure
an incompressible cycle route is forest
what is incompressible it means that all
the cycles of the cycle routes spanning
forest so just do so like on the left
must be non contractible so they have to
enclose at least some of the some of the
holes this will ensure that they are
macroscopic when we go to the limit n
goes to of mesh size going to 0 so this
is the measure we can consider and we
can we can view it as a measure on the
space of multi curves of the surface
which are just collections of finite
collections of continuous curves which I
will suppose in this case incompressible
as well so non contractible so maybe
something like that something like that
and so if you consider for the surface
surface sigma omega to be so Omega K
means the multi curves with K curves so
this is a naturally endowed with
structure of metric space and we can
consider f to be its Borel sigma field
and I will define the two next notation
in a second okay so that's for example
what would be an incompressible CSF on
such a surface and this is the theorem I
want to prove so I want to prove as so
this is joint work with a rigid canyon
that there exists a probability measure
P so on the space of multi curves of the
surface Sigma such that the sequence p n
converges to be the idea of the proof is
a user's a classical paradigm so we will
show tightness of the sequence of
measure and then show convergence for
some specified events that form a
determining class for the proof for the
sigma field and then by using probes
theorem this will ensure convergence
actually to the to do to the probability
measure
yes this modernist answer thee the
condition is every cycle is
yes
yes yeah so I didn't respond sir
but you didn't yes the the number of
cycles is not is not conditioned I mean
it could be one could be more oh yes yes
certainly yes yes that's a the only
condition is that it's uniform and on
the space where the cycles are none
contrail make sure just some killer okay
so i will explain the second point in a
bit of detail and so let me explain what
are these cylindrical events which form
a determining class which want to
compute well basically there are events
like this one so let me explain what
this means well we take the surface and
now we will okay one approach to this to
the to the topology of curve is to say
well if we know the topology of the
curve with respect to ok the ok i will
add some blue holes in the surface and
then not ask precisely how the random
curve behaves on the surface but just
what is its homotopic class with respect
to this additional punctures and if if
the idea is that this will generate the
board signified because if you knew the
the probabilities for all these events
and let's say you take the squares blue
to be on a dense subset the countable
subset of the surface you will actually
get the precise information on the
topology of the curve so basically we're
interested in what i call here
lamination and lamination just a word to
say I so to be your home atop a class of
multi curves with respect to a topology
so I fixed now some blue squares and
additional additionally to the black
squares and the cylindrical event is
so II which depends on the blue squares
and depends on some lamination so some
kimono p-type with respect to this
topology and it's just but the event
that the crs f belongs to that I want to
be type now what we want to show is
convergence p n of e or this is e okay
so we want to show that this conversion
um now okay so in order to do that this
is where the laplacian comes into the
picture okay i will just recall
technology that was introduced recently
by richard canyon which is unable to to
compute exactly this the probability of
this event i have just shown so the idea
is that you take a graph and you define
a connection on a graph so i will say su
to the connection on a graph to be the
data for each oriented edge v V prime of
some matrix V V prime belonging to s you
two matrices and now the only condition
you impose is that on the reverse
orientation it's the inverse of this
matrix so Phi V prime V is 5v v prime
inverse
and given this data what you can compute
is around any simple closed curve you
can compute the product of these
matrices and this is what he coined he
termed in this context the Helana me of
the connection on this curve so this is
just mimicking some geometry language
but so I don't know me so this is on any
finite graph yes this is on anything
equal Alana me of Phi around cycle gamma
is the composition of the Phi v1 I mean
VI VI plus one if the cycle is indexed
body vertices VI now okay now Richard
Kenya has proved the theorem which is
that we should I write it okay see ash
here here assume that ok you can define
a twisted version of the usual common
natural laplacian on the graph using
this connection how does it work well
usually the laplacian axon functions of
the graph just like that
but in this case the laplacian will act
on you can imagine that the graph is
endowed like it's like a two dimensional
bundle so over each vertex you have a
two dimensional complex vector space and
f is now a section of this bundle and
the twisted version is that laplacian
phi of a section is F of V minus V V
prime V F of V Prime and that theorem he
has shown is that you can define what it
is what is the determinant of Phi of
laplacian Phi turns out that it's the
sum over cycle waited spanning forest
product over the cycles of the forest of
2 minus traced the hollow know me around
gamma so when you have matrices that are
in su to their trays is positive number
smaller than and 2 so this is positive
and this is actually so sum over the
cycle which spanning forest I introduce
so note that in contrast with the usual
combinatorial laplacian which which is
not invertible on a graph well this
operator has determined nonzero whenever
there is at least one cycle where the
whole Donna me is non-trivial not equal
to the identity in which case it would
be only 0 now let me call this function
Z of Phi now it turns out that
if we impose some condition there's a
natural condition to impose on the
connection this was for any finite graph
but now let me come back to the case of
our graph GN it's embedded in in the
surface in the weight so there is some
topology well you you can ask that the
connection be flat which means that the
Helana me around any contractible curve
is one I mean is the identity matrix
which means that no contractible curve
can count in this sum for a flat
connection because the trace will be
equal to two choice of the identity 2-2
it will be 0 so if you consider a flat
flat connection zfi is a sum over
incompressible see ourselves the same
weight product of a cycle 2 minus trace
on enemy of gamma now there's something
even more which is true about flat
connections which is that if you take
two curves that lie in the same home at
upper class namely the define the same
lamination has introduced with respect
to this topology they the trace of the
harana me will be the same this is just
because when you deform you can write it
as a product of one cycle which is
contactable and the other cycle and
since the contractible cycles have a
lonely one it's easy to see that they
will define the same trace of Halloween
so in fact more is true can write that
this is a sum over laminations then a
sum over incompressible CSF lying in the
lamination so some of the laminations l
some overseer steps lying in this
particular nomination l of a certain
function that I will call TL of Phi
which is the product over for any
representative of the
lamination is the product of the cycles
of two- trace of the hollow know me so
this just depend on the lamination not
on the particular multi curve which
represents it and now since this
instance of what I just said it means
that this can be factored out right it
doesn't depend on any of the particular
service F just it here and now what is
this number well this is the number of
CSF lying in l but this is the numerator
if you want of the probability we're
trying to compute because p n of E is
exactly the number see our selves lying
in in the lamination we have chosen L
divided by the total number of
incompressible cos x so i will write
this a of l for this number and for this
partition function just z0 now how now
how to conclude so and now i think i
think i wanted to show just well gimme
this
it's I don't it would be easier if we
remove it or I mean then the last eyes
are not that important i mean a key if
it's easier for you to follow if i right
in the middle okay so the question
really is to show that it's ratio now
converges ok so using the technology
with just written basically al is the
coefficient of the phone the TL of phi n
z phi this is z phi we want the
coefficient al in front of that that
function so I think function because now
we're actually not prescribing any
particular flat connection but we're
just looking at this as a function over
the space of RAD connections on the
graph and so now this is a theorem a
theorem from a fucking gun sure of that
these functions over the space of flight
connections are actually linearly
independent so asking for the
coefficient al is just asking for the
coefficient in this basis expansion so
if I just use the usual dual notation I
mean we're just asking for tea the
coefficient of TL in Z of Phi and this
is the dual of TL on the vector space of
functions over the space of flat
connection and / z 0 now by linear out
linearity this is TL star of that phi /
z 0 ok so this is a exact computation it
just is done on on the on the finite
graph GN but now we want to show the
convergence so in fact it was proved by
Richard Canyon that this ratio converges
so he has shown this using some discreet
discreet complex analysis techniques
so we know that the was inside converges
and now we need to show some continuity
of this operator this knot is not
obvious but we were able to show this
and by combining these two facts while
you obtain that this has a certain limit
so this is how you can start this limit
now let me say just a word about the
first so tightness tightness essentially
means to show that the curve remain a
simple and that they don't have for
example double points or and this relies
on previous work about the loop right
random walk because as I explained in
the beginning these USF's can be sampled
by means of Weston's algorithm and much
work was done by Eisenman bullshit
Newman and Wilson then SRAM then from la
laverna to show that looper is random or
converges to SLE too and we use these
tightness results in here so this is for
this convergence ok so this this this
example is just to show that this is an
incompressible see our SF on an end of
us and we can hope it has some links so
we do not know of a direct description
in the continuous like they exist SLE
for SLE 24 follow Perez run amok but i
just want to point out that in this
example the dual of this incompressible
see our SF which is conditioned to have
only one loop it's exactly a tree which
is rooted on this and this and I mean
since there ok in this example I think
it appears that there should be some
closing too easily but it's not it's
just a heuristic for a moment ok so
there are some other weights
corresponding to these pictures
that I have shown you that we can define
and I actually they require some more
technique as you show the convergence we
don't know of any more easier approach
so one of them is to look at a measure
on Psychlo rooted spanning trees so only
one component but if you take the
uniform measure of course it would not
have a scanning limit we have seen
before that the expected area it will be
very small if you look at the euclid ave
this message was partly motivated by the
romans range okay yes so I that's
exactly what I'm about to say so in this
particular case it's not the uniform
mesh on crst that has a scaling limit
but the one weighted by the square of
the area turns out that if you have
favored real art loops by pushing them
by a factor of the area you can show
that it converges and now in order to
get the moments of the area basically
this is just a change of measure and you
will see that the k plus 2 moment of the
area divided by the second moment of the
error is exactly the kate moment of the
area for this bias measure and so
showing that this has a scaling limit
shows that we scaled by the appropriate
fact that has a limit and then that's
how we get the moments so it's a bit I
mean compared to the first case is it's
much more intricate so there might be
some simplifications but we don't not
aware of them
hell yeah actually we didn't think of it
we didn't introduce this to prove this
they just realized that it was a
consequence inductively okay hello it's
okay Oh actually just directly you write
it so this is for the uniform measure e
k plus 2 divided by a 2 so this one we
know it and now this is the expectation
for the weighted measure of a to the K
okay but now a to the K just the
community row but if I rescale by N
squared under here this will be a
Euclidean error this so this has some
fabric I should multiply here and now
this is equal to N squared so you get
that it's this constant times n to the
2k Minister so just direct no it's just
a like a it's the expected average yeah
that's yes yes exactly okay so end and
there are some other measures you can
define using them for example on the
sphere I showed you there were oops
there were two loops it's because we're
not looking only at measures on crst but
they can be several loops and they also
waited as a function of the the era de
the enclosed is basically now how much
time do I have left
so I just want this is my last slide I
just want to to make a small comment so
the uniform spanning tree when you view
okay so this is not a uniform span of
you but think of the uniforms managing
you can view it as a point process on
the set of edges of the graph right it's
just a bunch of edges in the graph and
it turns out this was proven by Burton
incremental that for the uniform
spanning tree it's a determinant whole
process in the sense that the marginal
probability that certain edges on inside
this can be computed as so that case
edges are inside it's a it's a k by k
minor of some kernel well it turns out
that for these measures on crs f mmm
they are also determinant of all
determine mental processes viewed as
point processes on the edges however it
seems that they are slightly in a more
general class because for example if I
want to look at this particular picture
so maybe this is a measure on ciris f
but which is condition for example it
doesn't enclose any of the holes it has
to enclose at least a more complicated
topology well I can construct such such
a measure basically using some some
connection as here and then the
determinant of the laplacian will be a
partition function for these so i take
if i take a connection phi such that the
holo na me around any hole here is
trivial but the whole Lana me around a
more complicated pass is not so this
relies on the non commutativity of the
SC two matrices and it turns out that
this process is can still be thought as
a determinable process but it's Colonel
now takes su 2 values or quaternion
values non-commutative and in fact that
so I have looked at
little bit of these processes and they
share most of the properties I mean
known of the determination processes
because they're basically kind of
algebraic for example the number of
points in a domain is a sum of
Bernoulli's etc but I mean I haven't
been able to make use of it but they
seem to belong to a slightly general
more general class because for example
this process cannot be written as a
usual symmetric determinate or process
okay what I think I'll stop there
so even though this isn't that you said
the determinable process in the usual
sense you still get things like negative
association between variables yes yes
yes more devil notion yes yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
