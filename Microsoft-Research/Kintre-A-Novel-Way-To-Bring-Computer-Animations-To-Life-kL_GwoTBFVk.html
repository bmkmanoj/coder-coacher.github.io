animation system where novices can bring
the world around them to life we exploit
the flexibility of the human body to
make lively performances of inanimate
physical objects such as this dancing
chair or this bookcase which can be
controlled by the users body to walk and
jump
to make a chair dance the user first
waves a kinect sensor around an actual
chair creating a 3d model rapidly next
he puts the kinect down and moves his
body into position finally he says a
single word possess and the chair is
automatically rigged by our system now
moving the body leads to realistic
deformations being computed on the
static input mesh causing the chair to
come to life this is all achieved at
interactive rates imagine children using
this system for interactive storytelling
using household objects for example
scanning and bringing this stepladder to
life
and reenacting classic cartoon
animations
you
our system can be used for gaming
scenarios we can play dodgeball with our
possessed stepladder possess launched or
in fact with any object kinetra lets
users scan themselves to create more
realistic avatars we can switch bodies
with a friend and make him rampage
through a physics-based game multiple
users can also team up to create fun
animations such as controlling this
horse is
sound effects are optional 3 1 2 3 under
the hood we first capture a 3d model of
our object using Kinect fusion we then
perform orientation aware sampling to
create a sparse deformation graph when
the user possesses the object we
associate her tracked joints as
constraints on the graph as the user
moves we solve for the deformation on
the graph and propagate it to the mesh
our system does not require closed
meshes and can work with partial skins
for example we can animate this avatar
despite large holes in the mesh
to enable physics on arbitrary objects
we approximate the mesh as a collection
of sphere proxies
they move according to the animation and
efficiently handle collisions and
friction forces
we presented kinetra a system that makes
animation of arbitrary objects
accessible to all kinetra is a fully
interactive system designed to open up
character animation to a new audience we
demonstrated many different examples
where users can control arbitrary static
meshes including partial scans our
system makes character animation a
playful and fun experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
