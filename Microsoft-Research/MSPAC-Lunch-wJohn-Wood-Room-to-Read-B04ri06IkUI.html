hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
alright hey good afternoon everybody hey
thanks so much for joining us thanks for
coming i'm mike egan with our corporate
affairs team and honor to have all of
you with us and just a quick
announcements couple events coming up
hope you'll come back to this room
friday for lunch we have political
prognosticator nate silver is going to
be joining us some of you know nate
silver from his new york times blog on
friday so come back and join us friday
then coming up couple interesting other
speakers rorke Denver a Navy SEAL he's
actually the one that trains all the
other Navy SEALs is coming next week and
then following him we have gavin newsom
lieutenant governor of california who's
talking about digital government how to
transform government into the digital
age and then finally we'll wrap up the
month with General Stanley McChrystal so
I think a great great couple of speakers
coming up so we really want to thank
Laura dev all everybody at Kim Ricketts
books and everybody else and thank you
certainly the room to read an honor to
have John with us today but certainly no
one better to give that intro than our
vice president for our worldwide public
sector in charge of education please
welcome Anthony salcedo Anthony thanks
Mike so it's an honor to have an
opportunity to welcome John it's
certainly one of the great things about
working at Microsoft is we get to see
and hear from thought leaders from
around the world in various capacities
who come visit campus just a couple
weeks ago Sal Khan was here many of you
any of you see his presentation here so
it's i would put John in that category
and someone who's leaving maybe a
commercial sort of a life in business to
make a difference in the world of
education and for those of you who
follow a lot of political talks that
come here understand that education is
one of the most important priorities for
government leaders around the world
partly because technology has created
opportunity to really transform lives in
a big way and scale impact you can have
to information as well as create
opportunities for driving workforce
change now many of you understand John's
history know that he was a Microsoft
employee and did a lot of work in the
asia-pacific region for Microsoft and
made a commitment and a choice to leave
Microsoft to make a difference and make
an impact in the world now
all of us some of us like myself I'm
lucky to have the opportunity to help in
education while working at Microsoft but
in many cases there's big dreams ahead
and John will share a little bit of his
story room to read focuses on and John
will say this better but focusing on
digital literacy and gender equality in
many parts of the world and specifically
in Asia and Africa and this is a
critical area where technology can make
a difference so it's a great
conversation it's a meaningful topic
it's it reflects not only the work that
we have to do as a company and Microsoft
to make a difference in education but
some of the ways in which the world is
fundamentally changing in an opportunity
for us to bring thought and support to
organizations like room to read is
critical so I urge you to pick up a book
to learn more about the foundation if
you don't know already know it pick up
the sticker use your give dollars wisely
to help room to read if that's something
that you're interested in doing I
certainly do that myself and I urge you
to consider it as well as you make your
giving decisions for the year but
without further ado let me introduce
John wood from room to read
for those who don't know about room to
read I want to talk a bit about who we
are what we do update you on our results
which are earth-shattering and then talk
a little bit about the new book and tell
you if you stories from new book and
then knowing that dialogue is always
more interesting than monologue we'll go
to some dialogue and some Q&amp;amp;A our
mission at Runner is very simple but our
goal is very very bold our mission has
always been from the beginning and I
used to work in marketing and always
think that when you do marketing it you
got to say what you mean and mean what
you say and in our case it's very simple
it's used six words we believe there's
no better way to change the future for
kids across the poorest parts of the
world then through the lifelong gift of
Education obviously all of us here being
at Microsoft you're a hyper educated
audience without education you're not
you without education I'm not me and our
goal is to reach kids all across the
poorest parts of the world to help them
to also get a chance to be the first in
their family to get literate to get
educated to finish secondary school our
goal has always been very bold i think i
was very lucky to join microsoft in 1991
when the idea of a computer on every
desk in every home was considered to be
a bold unattainable goal and now here we
are being you know way way over that
goal when I started remarried when I
left Microsoft in 1999 originally I set
the goal of reaching 10 million children
by the year twenty twenty I believe very
much in the the balt my favorite Ballmer
ISM was you know go big or go home and I
very much when I said I'm going to quit
this world leading technology company to
devote my life to something I want to go
big or I want to go home and so
originally 10 million kids by 2020 was
the goal i'm proud to say than our
current trajectory we're actually to
reach 10 million children by the year
2015 the train will arrive in the
station five years early so we're really
excited about that and that's going to
let us take a deep breath then figure
out what comes next in year 16 17 18 19
of our life cycle some of you may have
read my first book the reason I one of
the reasons i love this title leaving
microsoft to change the world that I got
this title before bill could get this
title for his autobiography so I hope
that one day we can license the IP to
him and he can write version 2 but
seriously it was a really interesting
time for us after the book launch
because the book just kind of picked up
a lot of momentum and a lot of energy
and got read by a lot of people who are
well-connected a lot of people have
resources a lot of companies and as a
result of that we've been able to grow
incredibly quickly room to read in 2006
was already bigger than I ever thought
it would be but we really set off this
incredible growth tsunami after this
book came out and after Bill Clinton
endorsed it and after Oprah had me on
the show and did Oprah's Book drive for
room to read which was really exciting
Oprah raised over three million dollars
for us through Oprah's Book drive which
is really exciting and as a result of
that we've really grown substantially in
all of our programs as many of you may
know we really have two pillars of what
we do literacy which encompasses
building libraries printing local
language books expanding the access to
schools for kids who are out of school
and gender equality and education and
the gender equality part is really
important because two-thirds of those in
the world today who are illiterate are
girls and women and it's a simply
staggering number over 200 million
children woke up this morning and did
not go to school in the developing world
200 million I mean think about how many
microsoft campus is that is a bright
young minds who could get educated about
780 million people in the world today
lack basic literacy two-thirds of those
are girls and women and if we can change
that we can change the future forever I
think you can look around this room and
recognize it when the world is full of a
generation of educated butt-kicking
women that's when things really start to
change right yeah there you go thank you
had to get so we've got 20,000 girls in
our program today who hopefully will be
future educated butt-kicking women who
will go out and change things now at
room to read got to be very clear we're
not anti boy as a former boy myself I
would never want to be accused of that
when we open schools and libraries
they're open to both genders both boys
and girls but in the developing world
quite often you have more boys showing
up than girls because families who can
afford to only educate one child send
the eldest son I'm super proud of this
and actually a lot of people at
Microsoft have actually gathered
together in workgroups and said okay
let's break a school down it's 35
thousand dollars to build a school let's
break that down and have 10 of us each
contribute a certain amount of payroll
deductions per month and then have
Microsoft match it and bingo work groups
have funded schools we've now opened
1600 schools across the developing world
this is way faster than I ever could
have imagined over the last five years
on average we've opened
new school every 36 hours somewhere in
the developing world so we really are
making a lot of progress against our
goal of making a dent in those numbers
of kids out of school kids who are
illiterate a long ways to go but a good
town down payment on a dream in the last
couple of years we've invested much more
heavily than ever before and making sure
that the teachers and the librarians
have also gone through room to read
professional development over 20,000
teachers have now worked with room to
read to upskill themselves in areas like
literacy running a high-quality library
convincing kids to take the books home
to read and getting kids in a habit of
reading but the number i'm most excited
about is this next one room to read
started in nineteen ninety nine when i
went back to bahoon dhanda nepal with
that first headmaster it showed me an
empty library 450 kids who are really
eager to read who did not have
children's books in their library and i
opened that first library with my 73
year old father as my unpaid right-hand
man and now here we are today having
scaled up to about 15,000 libraries open
around the world in the last five years
we've averaged a new library every four
hours we're opening six new libraries a
day across the developing world the
average library reaches at least 400
children so about 2,500 kids per day are
being reached by room to read and that's
one of the reasons that microsoft
support of our work is so important
because we just want to keep growing the
number of kids we've served we want to
keep growing the number of books in
circulation we're not luddites but we're
pretty old-fashioned about the fact that
when you work in the developing world
and there's no electricity and they're
not on the datagrid you got to start
somewhere with literacy and a lot of it
starts here where kids have books in
their mother tongue and are learning to
read from a young age so 12 million
books circulating the reason i love this
statistic and as you can tell at room to
read i learned well under microsoft and
under bomber data data data data data we
were just constantly collecting data and
analyzing it but when leaving Microsoft
to change the world is released in 2006
the last chapter that book was titled
the millionth book and is all about
hitting its magical milestone of the
millionth book donated we're now 12x
that number and it's the last six years
so our growth just continues to go up
and we're really excited about that
seven and a half million kids across 10
countries in Africa South Asia and
Southeast Asia
I'll have access to our schools to our
libraries into our girls education
program so we're about three quarters of
the way to our goal of reaching 10
million children so it's gone faster
than ever could have expected and I'm
really really gratified what my hope is
is that this book which was released
just 11 days ago will hopefully take
room to read to a whole new level if you
look at those numbers of what we've done
in the last six years since the first
book was released my sincere and humble
hope is that this book will hopefully
set off a whole new tidal wave of
support for room to read and get our
story to be better known penguin is
releasing the book they're getting
behind in a big way and we're doing a 25
or 26 story city book tour so hopefully
we're going to be able to get a lot more
people involved if you are tweeting by
the way I'm at John Wood RTR and RTR
course stands for room to read but at
John Wood RTR 363,000 followers not bad
for a ex-microsoft guy but still a long
ways to go now a lot of people you know
kind of scratched their chin and ask us
how have you achieved these results how
have you gotten up many schools built
how many have you gotten too many
libraries open and for me a lot of it
stems from this whole idea that room to
read has that you can't help people if
they don't want to help themselves
everything room to read does is under a
community co-investment model where the
community members are coming out and
actually working on the projects and
having their own skin in the game it
could be parents who donate bags of
grain from their farm and those bags of
grain are sold off and turned into cash
which is then used to help by the bricks
by the mortar it could be parents coming
out and donating sweat equity to each
project we challenge the government's
and we work closely with the ministries
of Education in every country we work in
to say we need the ministry to agree to
provide well-trained teachers and pay
their ongoing salaries and provide
librarians and pay their ongoing
salaries so everything room to read does
is a three-part agreement between us the
local community and the Ministry of
Education and that's important because
they it stretches a dollar much further
be it means we only work with motivated
communities those who have skin in the
game and see it's going to make the
projects much more sustainable because
the local people have buy-in and I think
this is important because so much aid to
the developing world is basically just
an aid
dump right people go in and dump use
t-shirts governments go in and dump
surplus grain and really treat the
developing world as passive aid
recipients well we don't look at it that
way at all we know from our travels we
know from our local teams that parents
are the same everywhere they want their
kids have a better life than they've had
and that almost always means is Anthony
pointed out education education
education ask any parent in the
developing world whether they most want
for their kids number one answer is
always education and the good news is
they're willing to work for it I have
more shots than I can possibly show you
of hard-working local community members
coming out carrying the bags of sand
from the Riverside up to their village
to mix into the cement parents coming
out to dig the foundation for their new
school I love this photo because it's
one of several that i have in my
collection where we had a classic
problem during the groundbreaking we ran
out of shovels we had more parents than
we had shovels what a great problem to
have a very easy problem to remedy and i
love these shots from laos one of the
poorest countries have you been to Laos
one of the poorest countries in the
world on the poorest countries in Asia
but these are usually dirt roads during
the monsoon season they turn to mud
roads the vehicles get stuck bringing in
the building supplies what do they do do
they take a break they decide to wait
till the dry season do they try to call
a tow truck which is not you know good
luck and I'll calling a tow truck nope
they come out they get in the mud they
roll up their sleeves they lay down some
logs they get the vehicle over that
muddy patch they picked the logs back up
move on the next muddy patch that's how
hard the people in the developing world
are willing to work when room to read
challenges I'm going to say we want to
help you but we only want to help you if
you want to help yourself so if you are
a room read investor I hope you'll be
proud of the fact of knowing that the
local communities are investing
side-by-side with you like you see here
is the very very happy result one of my
favorite chapters to write in the new
book which is on sale in the back should
point out yeah still on sale on the back
good one of my favorite chapters to
write in this new book was titled
searching for soos how many of you grew
up as dr. Seuss fans how many of you
have kids who like love JK Rowling or
how many of teenagers love The Hunger
Games well we discovered early on
that one of the biggest needs that we
had was to find more books in the mother
tongue and we learned this because we
survey and we'd collect data and
everything we do and in 2004 we did a
study that went out and asked the little
people asked our customers how are we
doing what are we doing right what are
we doing wrong and so we ask the
students what would cause you to use our
libraries more often longer hours open
at night open on weekends number one
answer fifty-two percent of kids said I
want more books in the mother tongue in
this case Nepalese and Vietnamese well
that's seems kind of like duh right of
course kids want to be able to read in
their mother tongue they want to learn
other languages but if you learn to read
in your mother tongue first you can be
much better off academically the
challenge is that you can't actually
find the doctor suits the developing
world because the people are poor living
in a dollar a day or two dollars a day
so the for-profit publishers don't
publish books for children in those
languages so you can make a list as long
as my arm of languages we actually don't
have a properly functioning book market
for children because there's no
financial incentive but if you look at
the supply chain of poverty 780 million
people illiterate a lot of that goes
back to the fact that kids don't have
books in their mother tongue or at least
they didn't until we decided we would
become a publisher and what we thought
we would do is you know it would have
been fun to try to translate there's a
wocket in my pocket into the Khmer
language that probably could have taken
weeks or months of fun would have been
fun to translate Harry Potter into Zulu
and Sosa and setswana but what we
decided to do instead was actually find
local authors and local artists who
could produce original children's work
that kids could really relate to and
this is important to us because there's
no sense rly in translating translating
a book about the white Christmas and
giving it to kids in Zambia who can then
be confused about caroling and eggnog in
the fireplace right or a book about you
know mom driving up in a Volvo station
wagon to the split-level ranch house and
the kids in South African Township
sleigh well as who are those people what
are they doing what we wanted to do
instead was work with local authors and
local artists to produce high quality
children's work and so we literally have
searched for soos and what I want to
show you here I think we've found not
just the dr. Seuss of Nepal not just the
JK rowling of Kim
we found dozens and dozens of dozens of
really talented local authors and local
artists and remarried has become their
marketplace not just for their ideas and
their creativity their imaginations but
also they know they're part of the
solution because now they know that
millions of kids across the developing
world are reading their books we've
produced literally hundreds of titles
i'm not going to show you all hundreds
of them but i want to show you fifty
books and 50 seconds what i want you to
think about for a minute is pretend that
you're not you pretend that you're a
seven-year-old girl in post khmer rouge
cambodia are a nine-year-old boy in a
township of mpumalanga province in rural
south africa and there's a certain day
when your library opens in your school
it's one of six that open that day not
in your school but one of six around the
world that open that day and you stream
in through the door this new portal of
knowledge to fire your imagination
here's what you see fifty books and 50
seconds enjoy
so what do you think we found them we
found the JK rowling we found the dr.
Seuss we're insanely excited about this
program and for those of you who are
worried about the plight of the lost
baby elephant I want to assure you that
all of our books definitely have happy
endings okay so don't go home worried
about whether the baby elephant found
his mother for us are happy ending is
that we've now produced 850 original
titles using local authors and local
artists because we can print thousands
and thousands and thousands of copies
these books we now actually control much
more the distribution supply chain we
would otherwise so we can put literally
millions of books into our schools we
have something going on now called the
checkout challenge so if you are a rune
read supporter and you donate during
book tour the next two months our board
is going to match the first million
dollars donated dollar for dollar for
dollar so it's fantastic is that's going
to allow us to produce the next 150
original titles that will get us to over
a thousand original titles and milestone
a never thought I would hit the
beautiful thing about it is it's
literally one dollar equals one book
it's such a simple equation to change a
kid's life forever one dollar one book
so I tell the other story in a book that
I love actually there's cool people the
audience actually know some of our team
in Bangladesh so they will actually like
this story I talk a lot about GSD which
as all of you know working at Microsoft
there's a g-rated version an r-rated
version and g rated version is get stuff
done the r-rated version is slightly
different but it's really a key part of
our DNA and i feel lucky I got to work
here as long as I did because I learned
a lot about the fact that you're not
judged by where you went to school
you're not judged by your title you're
judged by how much stuff did you get
done that day that week that month and
for me getting stuff done is really a
core part of the DNA of the entire
organization of room to read and it's so
needed in the social sector to say stop
talking about the problem and start
acting on the solution room to read's
all about acting on a solution a story
from bangladesh that i just loved was
our country director Zaki hassan when he
started out and it's important to point
out that all of our results are because
we have really strong local teams we're
not sending American expats overseas to
go boss to local people around we'll
have strong teams in each country who
are local understand the local customs
in the local language well Zach Deena's
team went out to survey these river
islands that are called the char's it's
the poorest most marginalized way
and otherwise already poor country but
this is very silty land and the rivers
go low and the rivers go hide during the
wet season in the river to land in the
train are constantly changing well the
team could not find a single girl and
any one of the thirteen chards they went
to who would ever finished secondary
school not a single girl now think about
that how does your society develop if
girls don't finish secondary school and
if kids don't have educated mothers how
do you defeat misogyny if kids don't
grow up with an educated mother the best
thing in the world to teach kids not to
be sexist or not to be racist or not to
be misogynistic is to all go to school
side by side well why did the girls not
go to school well anything goes but who
knows geography note knows very well
what does Bangladesh it right underneath
the Himalayas right so all that snow
melt and all that glacier melts got to
go somewhere well it goes right through
Bangladesh for several months so what
happens is these little rivulets become
three kilometer wide rivers four
kilometer wide rivers five kilometer
wide river is very very fast-moving so
the kids of course they don't have
motorboats they don't have jet skis they
can't get off these little islands and
so the kids missed several months of
school and then they have to drop out
because they don't pass their examine go
to the next grade well fortunately for
us Zaki and his team are very
action-oriented very solution oriented
and they can both an innovation that is
inexpensive low-tech some of you can
implement immediately and as a chapter
my book one of my favorite chapters to
write was called boat to read it was a
new innovation from room to read that
was very very simple the idea of being
you can take these fishing boats you can
charter them for a couple of months you
can modify them you can put a little
library on them even and have books
inside and so these kids get picked up
every day to go to school during the
rainy season for several weeks and the
rule of thumb on the boat to read is
you're not gossiping you're studying
you're reading you're going to extend
the school day by the very nature of
being on the boat to read and i love
that stories i think sometimes people
make things so complicated in the world
but how are you going to go out and
create change and sometimes the change
actually is fairly easy to achieve
sometimes the change is right there in
front of you as a very very simple
solution another chapter in the book I
which I really enjoyed writing was
called the war on overhead how many of
you have ever suffered through a
mid-year review meeting or a budgeting
medium you have to justify every single
dollar you're spending like six of you
what happened to this company come on
more than that so I know myself that I
spent a lot of time trying to figure out
how to cut expenses how to increase
revenue how to basically run things like
a business and one of the things i
wanted to do at room to read was to take
that same private sector mentality of
cost-cutting and being efficient and
take it to the social sector one of the
first things we did was they came up
with a rule that was very simple it was
called the no land rover rule and the
idea behind it was simple why spend all
this money on things like
air-conditioned Land Rovers when you can
actually get around and use pickup
trucks or motorbikes or public buses or
whatever it might be and not spend money
on wasteful things that keep you from
getting the job done who in this room
I'm going to do a little quiz who in
this room is good at math okay sir
what's your name Herman Herman okay I'm
gonna play in a spot hey man you raise
your hand come on okay every game is
here for hundreds of volunteering all
right Herman a new a new land rover cost
seventy-five thousand dollars okay
that's your numerator you're with me
okay and Cambodia let's say a one year
of girls education costs oh that's start
really easy one a book costs a dollar to
print how many Khmer language books can
we not print this year if we buy one
land rover 75 thousand great okay you're
one for one now it gets complicated a
year of a girl's scholarship costs two
hundred and fifty dollars per girl per
year how many girls don't go to school
this year in Cambodia if we buy one land
rover then you find out that for
75,000 / 250 300 300 girls how many
girls don't go to school is your who if
we like 10 so our parking lot fold them
3,000 how many girls don't go to school
in 10 countries would buy 10 per country
30,000 literally that's the stakes we're
playing for so we decided let's figure
out a way to cut costs and one of them's
we do is go to our corporate partners to
say help us find ways to save money
Microsoft help us find ways to use your
world-class software without paying for
it I write in a book about being in a
board meeting with one of our board
members of Goldman banker and he was
telling me that he had racked up three
million miles in American Airlines he'd
been traveling so much and I rub my
hands together greedily and I said well
what's your password I need into that
account so he gave me his past when I
ran him down from 3 million miles 20
over the course of five years his
Starwood points ran them down to zero
and mentioned that at a Barclays
conference and a bunch of Barclays
bankers said we're competitive with
Goldman we're going to match Goldman
frequent flyer miles for frequent flier
my land now Barclays has given us over 3
million frequent flyer miles to fly
around the world for free credit Swiss
gives us free office space in London a
very expensive place to have an office
but you want to raise pounds because
there's a strong currency office space
donated by credit suisse in Tokyo in
Hong Kong in Sydney the Financial Times
hosted our inaugural in New York office
with 10 deaths so we're trying to do
everything we can to cut costs Nicky
who's sitting over here in this row just
closed a really big deal with Lenovo 500
laptops donated by Lenovo so every room
to read employee will have a brand new
laptop now think about that what's the
lenovo laptop cost let's say let's say
if it's a thousand right every laptop
means for girls and go to school every
laptop means a thousand additional books
can get printed now we're looking for
more software donations every one of
those lenovo laptops is going to need to
have world-class microsoft office and
windows software we would prefer not to
pay for it so if you have any ideas for
how we could do that Nicki sitting right
over there you know where to find us but
that for us is a key part of our DNA of
always trying to find ways to cut the
cost Hilton gives us a hundred and fifty
three room nights a year as part of our
corporate partnership with them
so if you have friends anywhere in the
business world remind them of this that
room to read now deploys 83 cents on the
dollar directly to programs because our
overhead is so low charity navigator
which is the rating agency for charities
has given us four stars their highest
ranking for seven consecutive years only
two percent of NGOs based in America can
make that claim and a lot of those
because of this whole no land or a rule
then spilling over into finding more and
more and more creative ways to save
money now one of the key things about
Microsoft that I loved about working
here is whenever whenever Microsoft saw
a frontier market or an opportunity you
just go after it all guns blazing and I
like the fact that in the private sector
when they see opportunity they scale
they hire they train they set targets
they get budgets they motivate and they
go go go well one of my goals in
starting runner Reed was to say well if
the world needs a good latte the world
damn well needs literacy so if we could
scale as quickly as Starbucks could
scale what would that mean for the world
now it's told that was a crazy goal
because starbucks of course pays more
money gives their employees stock
options gives them larger bonuses has
all kinds of reasons they can if they
can access efficient capital markets
like the new york stock exchange and a
nasdaq to get the capellini to grow so
this is absolutely a crazy goal how
could a little startup NGO open
libraries more quickly than starbucks
opens outlets well data doesn't lie this
shows starbucks post-ipo new outlets in
green room to read new libraries in blue
our first 12 years the evidence is there
it's clear we can actually out starbucks
starbucks and indeed by year five and
six we were out starbucking starbucks
and like two of you air clap for that so
thank you for the air clap we're really
excited about that let me in closing
this give you one of my favorite stories
that actually did not make it into the
book I just didn't know how to actually
write the story in prose it can only
really be told in photographs I'm going
to close with this this story is about a
little boy in India who was reading in
one of our libraries and our team saw
him wearing this metal they asked him
about where he had gotten the metal why
was he wearing this and the boy
responded
by scampering away he ran off and they
thought oh no we've scared this young
man and one of the teachers said no no
you've not scared him he's very proud
that you're asking him about his medal
he won that for being in a school play
and he's run home to get his costume
he's going to come back and show you his
costume so about ten minutes later the
boy came back with his skeptical
grandmother kind of you know swatting
him on the butt saying what are you
doing skipping school and the kid the
students had read a book in their
library about the great salt marsh and
under which Gandhi led the movement to
liberate India from the British and so
these kids then decided that they would
of course reenact to Salt March so this
is this is Gandhiji this is our young
friend after he stripped off the metal
and come back when his Gandhiji costume
and the course school just ground to a
halt for the day because now the kids
are got the adults interested the rune
read staffs interested so they've got to
basically reenact the reenactment of the
Great Salt March so here they are
reenacting their reenactment and I love
this story because number one Gandhiji
is one of 7.5 million children who now
have access to run rate schools and
libraries and literacy programs and
think about that one example of the one
little boy whose imagination inspired
multiple that by 7.5 million that's the
impact that room to read is starting to
have and what I love about this photo is
you know kids are always good at
improvising and this kid obviously
borrowed his gandhiji glasses from
Michael Phelps that this is I I don't
think an see that very well he's
literally wearing wearing swim goggles
but um so for me I mean I think the best
part of doing what I do now is just
meeting the kids all around the world
this young chap was that I met him in a
room read library in the Mekong Delta in
Vietnam the date of the library opened
and we were talking about i was asking i
was he excited is the first day you can
start reading books and he told me that
he'd actually snuck into the library the
night before he had climbed in through a
window with a flashlight and he excited
excitedly told me mr. john i read nine
books last night and just um you know it
just was fired up this young boy gyrus i
met last summer while in Zambia and I
asked him he was a 13 year old learning
to read a reading books on a regular
basis in a room read library and I asked
him what would you like to be gyrates
when you grow
up be something a very smart kid and he
said I would like to be the first zombie
in to ever be secretary-general of the
United Nations and I was like wow okay
that's a pretty good goal and he said
but you know but first I must build I
must build my resume first I must have
other jobs before I do that as well
Jarvis what do you think would be an
interim step between here 13 year old in
a rural village in the back of beyond
and Secretary General he said well I
will first be president of Zambia that
will be my interim step to being
secretary-general of the UN and I I love
that story because it sounds kind of
implausible right but then about three
months later I was at the United Nations
when Ban ki-moon and gordon brown
announced their whole education first
initiative to make universal primary
something that we pay a lot more
attention to it the government in the
United Nations level and bond ki-moon
told a story about growing up in
post-war South Korea saying that the
village he was from was so devastated
that school was outdoors the teacher had
a stick and would draw in the dirt and
that was their chalkboard was a dirt and
then one day bond ki-moon said that all
these books showed up and the teachers
were excited in the students were
sending them kids open the books and the
inside front cover the book it said this
book is a gift from the United Nations
anybody getting chills that kid learning
outside with a stick and the dirt and
books apply by the United Nations is now
the UN secretary-general from a society
that is used education as the rising
tide that has lifted all boats so at
South Korea is an academic powerhouse so
I don't think jireh says story or his
ideas are actually very implausible I
think it's actually possible for these
kids to do that in closing these just a
few of my favorite shots of some of the
kids we've met over the years of our
travels and a lot of times now people
ask me kind of what's next for room to
read what do you want to do you have
another big hairy audacious goal and I
think for us we really view this as
being possibly life altering and life
changing our Kennedy said give me a
lever long enough and I can move the
earth and I believe that if we all look
at our own family backgrounds there was
some relative somewhere who had that
lever who got families out of poverty
our simple goal for the coming
three or four decades to be part of a
global movement and to help lead it and
that global mood so going to be all
about one thing it's about saying that
never again should any child be told you
were born in the wrong place at the
wrong time to the wrong parents and you
therefore did not get educated and you
will therefore remain in perpetual
poverty we believe that notion belongs
in the scrap heap of human history we
believe that with your support we can
continue to move towards putting it
there and the same way they've been
moving against apartheid and slavery and
movements for women to get to vote and
there's movements today to vaccinate
every child we believe in a global
movement that says no more wrong place
wrong time it should be right place
right time because we were there for you
so I will close with that and leave you
with one final thought thank you very
very much thank you for we're going to
do a little Q&amp;amp;A but for those who have
to go or those who have egregious
schedules today we have done an express
lane with the books there's about 30
pre-signed books if you don't want to
wait around to get it signed you don't
have to i would ask you one quick thing
if you like this and you like the story
i would ask you this to do one thing get
a couple of extra books to shoot them
out to your teammates and say hey come
on let's do something let's get a
library Bill let's fund 10 girls let's
you know this is not a fundraising event
so don't want to turn it into one but I
want to plant that seed with you is this
is only possible because so many people
at Microsoft has supported room to read
over the years and we don't want to slow
down we want to accelerate so if you
just think about the fact that every
dollar is being matched by our board but
every dollar you give is also being
matched by Microsoft so every dollar you
can get your teammates to give will
actually be quadruple your dollar
becomes too from Microsoft becomes four
due to our board match so it's not hard
to go do something today that's going to
get a lot of things done so if you want
to give the book out to a few teammates
and challenge them we would love that we
would welcome that for those who have to
go no worries for those who can stay
will do about five minutes of Q&amp;amp;A then
I'll hang out and answer any individual
questions also a few of our team members
here our team members can raise their
hand if you want to meet any of the room
to read team from the San Francisco to
New York offices there's five of them
five of them here so any questions or
comments hi
your scholar program yeah the idea
behind the girls education program is to
work in places that have historically
had very low rates of girls finishing
secondary school and some of the parts
of Zambia we work in as an example four
out of five girls don't make it past 7th
grade so the idea is to give them
everything they need to succeed and that
includes the obvious stuff like school
fees uniforms book bags school supplies
less obvious things like bicycles that
they live very far away from school and
then also we have what we call life
skills coaching which works with the
girls to negotiate to get the skills
they'll need to negotiate key life
decisions so for girls in Zambia for
example it is how to not get pregnant
why you don't probably don't want to get
married at age 13 or 14 or 15 and drop
out of school what kind of career you
might have what is self-confidence mean
what does a life map look like how do
you develop a savings plan so for us it
started as kind of pure academic support
but we then grew those life skills
components also as we want to make sure
the girls when they got out of school
we're ready to negotiate life decision
now is it working we're very data based
in very evidence-based the Gates
Foundation actually funds all over all
of our evaluations so we can go test the
efficacy and last year did it we did a
survey had found out that sixty-four
percent of the girls who have finished
secondary school with remarried support
are now enrolled in university and
tertiary education even though we can't
pay a dime for it so we're really
excited about that and that's obviously
how the middle class starts to form hi
hi I'm it's a fairly big question and I
know we don't have much time but I'm
wondering how I was really struck by
this story of the girl named Malala
picking year old girl in Pakistan who
was assaulted for suggestion we wouldn't
be able to read in her area yeah I'm
wondering what your thoughts are on
situations where around the world where
of girls are not encouraged to read for
cultural reasons of religious reason
and what you see as the bedfordshire
yeah well I think if you take a
long-term view of it I think a lot of
the approach is that in my view boys and
girls should go to school side by side
from a young age and that's why we don't
build singer single-gender schools I
know myself growing up I think if boys
were to go to school subside with girls
and if every boy was to have an educated
mother I think a lot of this resistance
would move would would melt away eggs if
you think about like any of us in this
audience who have educated mothers any
of us in this audience went to school
and watch girls succeed and in many
cases kick our butts academically it's
hard to then tell that young man women
are inferior you should treat women
badly i mean if you grew up with an
educated mother and you grew up side by
side with girls doing well in school I
think that's not the only solution but i
think it's it's a real key part of the
solution I also tell you a lot of people
ask us you know doesn't remember you get
a lot of resistance to what we do and I
will tell you that I don't know what the
word is it's the opposite of resistance
we have the opposite every time we
announce our new plan for school
construction for libraries for the girls
education program we are oversubscribed
in a huge way by communities that want
it and we just have to have the capital
so we can say yes to them rather than
saying no let's do one more and then I'm
happy to do the rest during the book
signing hi hey so first thanks so much
for going to talk to is your real
inspiration to be mature
people and I just wonder if you talk a
little bit about what the involvement
from julies after I open schools and
after you naturally and libraries or how
how do you guys get ingrown and creating
tracks really your long term world yeah
why don't I have one of my team members
talk to you about that because that's a
very long complicated answer I can give
you the short answer which is basically
it's just like Reagan said about
Gorbachev trust but verify we trusted
the schools and remain open because the
communities have invested in them and
the government supporting them but we
verify by hiring outside evaluator who
make random unannounced spot checks on
the library's into schools and they just
calculate data all that data goes up
into a Salesforce they give us unlimited
usage of Salesforce so every school
every library is tracked in Salesforce
and we then compile the statistics and
find out ninety-eight percent of the
libraries are still functioning even
after they become independent
ninety-eight percent of the libraries
have checkout systems in place
ninety-seven percent of our ninety-six
percent of our girls passed last year to
the next grade so a lot of it is getting
the baseline conditions right by making
sure the communities are co-investing
but then a lot of it is also making sure
we're going back and actually tracking
what's happening but any of our team
members can give you even more
complexity of that also say that on room
to read org you can find all over all of
our evaluations along with six years of
financials we're really transparent
organization with our evaluations we
don't black line the bad stuff and then
post it online we posted online warts
and all the state of the world hears
we're strong here's where a week and
we're going to run a very transparent
organization so again I'm happy to sign
books and I'm please don't be shy about
getting your co-workers involved and
again thank you for thank you for coming
out today
