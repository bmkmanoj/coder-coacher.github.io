you
alright so next up hailing from the Big
Apple we have new york university part
of the interactive telecommunications
program and they'll be talking to you
about Bobo hi I'm Carolyn concepts yawn
I'm adecco suru I'm Joy Lee I'm Hayley
John and we're with New York
University's interactive
telecommunications program and we would
like to introduce you to our latest
invention bubble but what is a research
tool designed to detect our early
detection of autism certain former
child's future it is designed as a
sensory system including a toy a mobile
application and a web application we all
know someone that's been diagnosed with
autism and it is a leading child
developmental disorder today autism
peers in the first three years of life
and affects the normal development of
the social and community communication
skills autism affects 1 in 68 children
on average it costs 2.4 million dollars
to support an individual dealing with
autism and it is costing the u.s.
Society 137 billion dollars annually a
three-fold increase in less than a
decade autism is one of the most
misdiagnosed disorders in children due
to the length of time it takes to
receive an official diagnosis the
average age of diagnosis is still over
age 4 even though the diagnosis can be
done by H to the average lag time
between an initial initial warning sign
and diagnosis is over 13 months by this
time the child has missed the window of
early intervention services d services
ensure that the child's future will be
Jack one of the parents we spoke to Jack
one of the parents we spoke to whose
child was diagnosed at the age to
creates early intervention services as
one of the main reason his son now aged
5 has is of the spectrum and is
attending regular school giving the
positive impact early intervention can
have
we were confronted with the following
design challenges how many reduced the
time span in detecting autism and how
can we improve the accuracy of the
diagnosis how my rise to challenge to
design for a building sensors to create
life changing technologies we begin
tackling our challenge by first
researching how the current diagnostic
process functions we learned that there
are no medical tests for diagnosing
autism a diagnosis is achieved by
behavioral observations it can take up
to five different medical professions to
receive an accurate diagnosis the
science doctors look for are repetitive
behaviors such as Demi avoiding eye
contact and communication challenges we
looked into research groups that are
using technology to detect autism for
instance dr. Karen peers at the
University of California used I tracking
technology to determine gaze parents in
infants Jordan has semi at the
University of Minnesota developed a
computer vision system to identify body
movements that could indicate autism we
looked into toys are used to treat
children already diagnosed with autism
of--they is an interactive toy equipped
with sensors that teaches autistic
children positive behavior keep on is a
miniature robot to motivate social
interaction and response to petting and
squeezing we saw that there are
diagnostic tools and treatment toys we
think there's an opportunity to bring
the two together to create a diagnostic
toy that makes children comfortable and
gives doctors the information they need
to make it early diagnosis to that end
we created a working prototype bubble
which we hope you can see later at demo
FS baboy series research showed that
aids in the early detection of autism
and consists of three things ABA toy
which tracks behavior patterns in
children commonly autistic with children
with autistic autistic children colonies
a mobile app that informs parents of toy
interaction and a web application to
record analyze data this is dr. Perry
he's a child psychiatrist from NYU
Medical Center his specialized in
detecting child developmental disorders
he was the subject matter expert for us
throughout our research and now let's
walk through a hypothetical scenario of
how he might use boat row today he's
meeting with new patients flora and
Timmy laura is consulting with dr. Perry
because she has noticed that timmy is
not very social and lagging behind in
his speech so dr. Perry observes Timmy
for two hours and looks for signs of
autism for a more accurate diagnosis dr.
Perry prescribes bobo to timmy and he
would like to see how Timmy axe in his
home environment he also explains how
the mobile mobile app tracks and
visualizes Timmy's interaction with Bobo
and that he will be revealing Timmy's
behavioral patterns via a secure web
application so Laura and Timmy take
their new puppy pal mobile home and play
with him for the next couple of days
timmy gets excited picks up Bobo and
poked him around and discovers that
Timmy sings to him talks to him and even
tell stories so while timmy is playing
with Bobo Bobo has a set of sensors that
are designed to track autism symptoms
when timmy rolls bubble the
accelerometer and the touch sensor
understand what type of motion timmy is
performing maybe the bobo app allows
laura to see how timmy has been playing
and for how long Bobo also has a set of
cameras the track team eats I guess v
load software that tracks where a child
is focusing his eyes each green dot
shows where Timmy's ideas lastly then
Timmy interacts with Bobo Bobo also
records Timmy's responses via the
microphone and speakers in his mouth ten
years
after a few days of observation dr. pay
observes that Timmy does not respond to
Bobo when his name is called he also
observes frequent repetitive behaviors
and the timmies I guess is often
off-centered most of the times his eye
gaze is around his mouth by studying the
data from Bobo dr. Perry is able to
confirm his assumptions and diagnosed
Timmy with autism due to the creek and
early diagnosis Timmy will now begin
early intervention services as you can
see the bobo system creates a seamless
dream of communication between a child a
parent and a doctor the reality is that
to build to bring Bobo to life their set
of challenges issues around data
collection clinical testing and getting
adequate funding to build verbal that
said we're still motivated and excited
by the future possibilities Bobo can't
afford we imagine building the set of
sensors modular so it can be embedded in
all kinds of toys to attract different
children the aggregated data will help
global research efforts by creating new
information sources that researchers can
tap into we believe that our approach
can also be used in other developmental
diagnosis such as ADHD we believe no
more children to suffer from the
misdiagnosis of autism Bobo imagines a
world where kids like Timmy conceded a
feature differently we hope you would
join us on the mission to create life
changing technologies that make a
lifetime of difference thank you
excellent thank you guys and again I
just want to say that the audience is
for you to participate as well if there
are any questions or comments but
otherwise we'd go to our critics so this
is a meta comment I think it's really
worth while to take your presentation in
the context of what we saw from Israel
and with the tilt board and with the
first presentation from Denmark because
at one level abstraction you're all
doing this it's the same presentation I
don't I mean that the most constructive
positive way but what it illustrates
collectively because not everybody in
this room is a designer is that there is
a methodology there is technique there
is a profession that takes a specialized
that weed with specific skills of how
you approach to the commonality of
approach of how you want to experts in
how you do this I you you you're
properly trained and and and it did a
really good job I the thing I really I
think reinforces that is just that this
is not a topic that I would have
expected you don't know anything about
before you started you are working in
the you're in particular working in an
area that is this child of the
traditional classical industrial design
and you've brought that to interaction
design of and I'll discipline us with
this and saying it captured in this you
articulated your design briefer you
restated your design brief in two points
which each of which was measurable when
we talk about design in industrial
design how do you know you succeeded and
you articulate your brief in a way that
you could always measure where you were
in a controlled experiment way in a way
that it is follow some substance what an
engineer could understand as well as
well but but but with a very different
methodology it's really important and I
just congratulate you on having that
just razor sharp vision and use that
technique like just in a just
professionally thank you
I'm going to build on what bill said and
said you are properly trained and my
favorite moment was Caroline yeah then
you came forward and you stumbled and
what did you do all right you took a
deep breath and you kept going I was
beautiful and something that everybody
can learn from this is this is human
this is normal it made you real right it
made you a very real person and
addressing a very important and real
problem you did a wonderful job inter
going between each of you that was very
incredibly smooth and professional and I
I could see you I could envision you 10
years from now with a new product or
perhaps this product and that was lovely
to see thank you it's a huge relief to
me to hear that you're properly trained
and and I concur I I this is actually my
first time seeing this presentation and
I'm sitting here delightfully pleased
and one of the things I want to ask you
a little bit about is you talk about the
the toy as a diagnostic tool and the
situations you've got it set up in or
again very noisy situations because you
never know what's going to happen
whether the kids give it a light to the
toy can you talk a little bit about the
interviews you did with the doctor you
were working with and what kinds of
maybe more structured play you had in
mind in order for the toy to work most
effectively in diagnosis
okay I'll take that so we will use dr.
Perry who is a doctor a child
psychiatrist at the new NYU Medical
Center and he is a leader in his in the
industry and he was really excited to
have a chance to speak with us about
even the conversation of including
technology in the autistic the
diagnostic process and you know he he
was just really open to it he said you
know this can really work he was
positive about the possibility of this
coming this being a reality and gave us
some really good feedback on what the
census should test and you know the i
guess the professional insight that we
learned from him about the actual
process of diagnosing autism was really
helpful with our design process and and
really taking that into consideration
and how the toy can play and how the
main thing he told us is that the toy
needs to allow children to show
representational play which means how
does you show a normal way that a child
can play with a toy and how is it not
invasive to the child so I think I hope
that answers some of your questions and
to add on that dr. Perry was
specifically concerned about making the
system modular so it gets appealing to
different children and besides that he
wants to be able to collect data that's
abstract from like a pure observation or
video recording so he was very open
excited about the dashboard part where
dr. can get to view aggregated data your
comments wonderful well thank you guys
is great
it was professor liu j &amp;amp; hudson with
that there she is thank you sorry from
angling your name</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
