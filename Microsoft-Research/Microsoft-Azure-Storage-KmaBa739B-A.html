your storage one of the foundational
layers of the azure technology stack I
will give an overview of the features
that it provides as well as talk a bit
about some of the things that does under
the hood to keep your data safe and
provide high-performance access to that
data I will also demonstrate how to
create a managed data and Azure storage
through the azure portal via graphical
tools and we'll even look at a small
script that shows programmatic access to
the data the Windows Azure storage
services provide storage for binary and
text data messages and structured data
in Windows Azure they're scalable
meaning that you can store very large
amounts of data in it
also the underlying system will allocate
more resources as necessary to maintain
a good level of performance when many
things are trying to read it at once
Windows Storage is also durable meaning
that the things you store in it will
remain there and remain safe from
corruption as your storage is also
available meaning that it is always
available to your application this is
possible because of software and
hardware resiliency engineered into the
azure infrastructure Microsoft monitors
the service provides patches ándale
scaling and does the other work needed
to keep the service available at all
times the cost of storage is also key
you only pay for the storage and
transfer bandwidth that you actually use
the data and Azure storage is available
via a rest interface so virtually all
programming languages can access it and
as your storage account has a globally
unique account name each storage account
gives your application access to Windows
Azure blob table and queue services
located in a particular geographic
region you need to have a storage
account in order to use Windows Azure
storage fundamentally the storage
account represents the highest level of
the namespace for accessing storage
services you can explicitly geolocate a
as your storage account to a geographic
region or set geographic affinity with
other services so that the storage is in
the same data center as the compute
services you will be using each storage
account can have 200 terabytes of data
across all the different storage types
lobs tables and queues
a Windows Azure subscription contains
multiple storage accounts you can create
up to five accounts for a single Windows
Azure subscription the azure content
delivery network or CDN offers
developers a global solution for
delivering high bandwidth content it
caches blobs and static content at
physical nodes in the United States
Europe Asia Australia and South America
another interesting feature of storage
accounts is that they each have to 512
bit keys both of which are active there
are two access keys to enable you to
maintain connections to the storage
account using one access key while you
regenerate and replace the other access
key generally speaking you should update
your keys frequently to ensure security
a core feature of Azure storage is that
data is geo replicated every single byte
of data that you write into an azure
data center will by default be
automatically replicated to a second
data center that is at least 400 miles
away you can disable this geo
replication if you really don't care to
have this level of data redundancy
turning it off does reduce the cost of
storage by a small amount as yours
management portal also includes great
analytical tools for your storage
account and the objects stored within it
it provides much more granularity and
insight than for example a hard drive
within your computer this gives you a
different and useful kind of insight
into the performance of your
applications as your storage also
provides a facility to do background
copying of large data and in a
synchronous fashion this can be very
useful when you need to move large
amounts of data around all the data you
store into Windows Azure can also be
accessed securely over HTTPS there are
more sophisticated mechanisms for
signing and providing more granular
security over your pieces of data so far
I've used terms like blob and tables and
queues these are the fundamental storage
abstractions of Windows Azure storage
let's talk about them in more detail all
the data stored in Azure storage uses
one of these storage services the blob
service can store arbitrary binary and
text data using a key value system the
table service provides a structured
tabular key value storage mechanism for
non-relational data the queue service is
a reliable messaging facility for
applications and components to
communicate with each other programmatic
access to these services is available
via the Windows Azure managed library as
well as the azure REST API will look at
blobs and tables in much more detail in
a subsequent video internally as your
storage is a very complex system that
has been carefully engineered to provide
resiliency and performance for a huge
number of customers while we don't have
time to go into great depth about these
innards in this video there are many
great videos on channel 9
that drill into the internals of how
this is all achieved in this slide
we'll just take an overview look at the
internals when a request enters the
Azure storage system it gets handed off
to a layer of front-end boxes these
front-ends load-balanced to a number of
partition servers each partition server
handles a set of object partitions
whether those objects are blobs tables
or queues and the partition server layer
communicates with a partition master
system to load balance the lowest layer
of the storage architecture is a
distributed file system which stores and
replicates the data across many servers
and hard drives an important part to
know about this architecture is that the
partition master not only watches for
failure and gracefully handles those but
it also spreads the load from partition
servers that are experiencing too much
traffic let's walk through the simple
process of creating a storage account
and using Azure storage Explorer to look
at its contents first we'll download as
your storage Explorer from codeplex
by going to Azure storage Explorer
codeplex com
you can see here that storage Explorer 5
preview 1 is the latest version but it's
a preview the latest stable version is
version 4 beta one in order to follow
along with the examples in this video
you'll need to get at least version 4 so
we'll just click download here for the
most recent version we'll click Save
once it's done downloading go ahead and
run through the Installer now before we
can actually use the azure storage
explorer we need to find out our storage
account name and the access key here
I've created a storage account and once
I click on it I can select manage access
keys at the bottom this brings up a
dialog with the primary and secondary
access key I've blurred them out in the
video for security reasons remember
there are two storage keys for each
account so we can regenerate one of them
while the other is still active and used
by applications and VMs this ensures
zero downtime while still allowing us to
practice good security procedures and
regularly generating new keys now we
launch the storage Explorer we click Add
Account at the top and we enter our
storage account name our storage account
key i've copied from the azure
management portal dialog and i'll just
paste it here we'll select use HTTPS and
add storage account great now we see the
storage account in the storage Explorer
by default storage Explorer shows the
blobs stored in the account we can
change the storage type with the buttons
at the right let's go ahead and create a
new container will leave this public so
that anyone with the URL can access the
data as you can see our container has
nothing in it let's go ahead and upload
a couple of files these are from the
azure training course examples directory
once they've been uploaded we can
actually take a look at them sample that
txt is a plain text file so when we look
at it not only can we see the properties
of the blob and the metadata we can view
it as text and these are the contents
cut diamonds is a CSV file and when you
see the raw text of it
here but it's quite large now we'll
shift gears a bit and we'll use Python
to programmatically retrieve the
contents of a blob in particular the cut
diamond CSV blob and then we'll create
entries in a new table for every single
row in the CSV this shows some Python
code that uses the open source as your
Python SDK the first line connects to
the blob service and returns a
connection object then by calling create
container on that blob service object we
create a new blob container in our
storage account the first line here
reads the contents of a file named task
1 text the second line then calls the
put blob function to upload the data to
the blob service this slide shows the
code to read a list of blobs from a
given container the code is very simple
and straightforward in this video I
introduced the core concepts of Azure
storage and we walk through creating a
storage account with the azure
management portal hopefully you have
seen that Azure storage is very simple
to use from either graphical tools as
well as a programming API
however using it properly requires more
knowledge about the details of the
different types of Azure storage
