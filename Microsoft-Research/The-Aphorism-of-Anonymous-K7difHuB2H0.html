hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
well art by first thanking Microsoft for
allowing the anonymous studies cabal to
finally get together we have been
interacting on IRC back-channel smokey
back rooms for a few number of years
studying anonymous and this is the first
time actually we are meeting fully in
person so it's very exciting so let me
introduce folks and also tell you about
the kind of metabolism of the panel so
Josh Corman is a cyber security
researchers strategist philosopher
watching the emerging social impacts of
social media and hacking culture Brian
Safin burger knappenberger is a
filmmaker and he's here because he is
the director of a film called we are
legion the story of the hacktivists
which i really recommend and its online
he's also done a ton of other
documentaries for PBS National
Geographic Bloomberg and many others so
Quinn Norton is she let us know as a
skilled skilled typist but she's really
better known for being quite amazing
journalist and I think an all-around
sage in everything that concerns the
digital I'm currently the wolf chair in
scientific and technological literacy at
McGill but I'm most often confused as a
first year graduate student or a very
mature undergraduate so all right we're
just gonna begin um what we're gonna do
is because we're all talking about the
same phenomena uh we're gonna try to go
back to back to back although if people
are getting too fidgety we might take a
break and open it up for the audience I
am going to start with an overview a
kind of I often say anonymous is like a
kaleidoscope and I'm going to move the
kaleidoscope and give an introduction
but an unusual one and then we're going
to narrow the optic with the different
presentations so I'm just going to jump
in and my title is called the aphorisms
us so the aphorism is a fitting one
might say tailor-made genre to
illuminate on the political significance
of anonymous so why might this be this
genre refuses generalizations
systematicity all the while providing
pithy but very powerful intellectual
flashes about the topic at hand
anonymous to resists easy categorization
and especially generalizations but even
as anonymous is a fleeting army
unwilling to yield to statistics and
even sociological analysis they provide
momentary revelations of their logics
delivered through flashes of art digital
tactics and of course stinging words
like the broader mimetic culture and
troll culture from which it emerged
anonymous is quick to appear circulate
submerge and even vanish but then rinse
and repeat so today I offer you an
overview of anonymous with the aid of
the aphorism especially those of
Nietzsche the Enlightenment greatest
troll whose art aside from you know
brilliantly pissing everyone off at the
time was the aphorism which Marshall
McLuhan nicely defined as the fine art
of crafting verbal hand grenades so
here's your first grenade a subterranean
man is at work one who tunnels and mines
and undermines as though he perhaps
desires is prolong obscurity desires to
be incomprehensible concealed and ematic
because he knows what he will thereby
also acquire is it his own warning his
own Redemption his own daybreak
anonymous are subterranean sorcerers
whose art is to conjure spectacle but
unlike deboard society the spectacle
Anonymous has done so largely on their
own terms their magic resides in their
ability to exploit society's prevalent
technical ignorance which at times is
amplified by the media they are as we
know hackers on steroids and then of
course the distributed denial-of-service
attack
is the equivalent of the thermo nuclear
cyber war many of course responsibly and
accurately report on anonymous but it's
Quinn nort Quinn Norton brilliantly once
put it in a wired article we tend to
cease in and zero in on these types of
tactics and especially the figure of the
hacker and get a great majority are
actually not hackers although Brian will
focus on the hacker crews many in the
media also crave for a leader a
compelling character at minimum give us
a face anonymous rarely yields to these
demands and laughs back eventually
though the public gets what they want
for once the step State enters the fray
and they have already arrests are made
and people are unmasked and we get the
story of the hacker hero Jeremy Hammond
in jail in the story of the anti-hero
sabu the informant but their sorceries
not simply duplicity born from our
collective ignorance or distortions
there is something uncanny there is
something magical about anonymous and it
is their birth as an uncivil activist
political movement which our rests our
attention and it captures the
imagination aphorisms about the prank
and the accident are now in order for it
is the prank that laid the groundwork
for the weirdest accidental birth of
activist politics possibly ever to exist
nietzsche again maintaining cheerfulness
in the midst of a gloomy task is no
small feat and yet what is needed more
than cheerfulness nothing succeeds if
prankish pneus has no part in it X is
strength alone is proof of strength the
pleasures of recognizing the accidental
are not to be confused with the
pleasures of interpretation rather there
are a recognition of the points where
power convulses itself john roberts from
cabinet magazine so I've been known to
describe anonymous's tricksters this is
so because anonymous was in the first
instance internet trolls from 4chan
intentional provocateurs who offend and
prank simply for their own pleasures for
the lulz
in 2008 the church of scientology was
quite upset after this video featuring
Tom Cruise was leaked on the Internet I
think most people know the story the
church unleashed their lawyers to sue
publishers who posted on this and
anonymous Unleashed classic trolling
techniques back at them and buy all
precise estimates it was the mothership
instance of they're trolling they Jam
Scientology websites sent unpaid pizzas
to organization headquarters fax nude
body images to churches and of course
relentless phone pranking of the
Dianetics hotline so as part of the
trickery they too released a video and
declared war against the church of
scientology to invoke nietzsche anons
crafted the video for their own
cheerfulness it was earnest but
earnestly a joke but their trickery was
so crafty they got swept by their own
cunning and if anyone knows trickster
lore this often happens to tricksters
they get installed by their own tricks
so you see although a joke the video
unexpectedly sparked a debate she'd
Anand hit the streets to protest the
church or should they remain faithful to
their madcap roots well the answer came
in a global day of protests in February
10th 2008 held in over a hundred 27
cities over seven thousand participants
showed up and then this was the moment
of Transfiguration a political movement
was born soon after unrelated nodes
hatched and many started to identify as
bona fide activist albeit with a
transgressive twist but they did not
want to be gloomy in the midst of a
gloomy task politics they kept the prank
the lulz and integrated it in their
activist arsenal but there's more to
their subterranean magic and it lies in
their predictable chaos or is it they're
unpredictable logic and Josh will be
talking more about that they may be hard
to predict but they're not I think pure
chaos they rise up for reasons they're
triggered into action especially when
civil liberties loom but they make so
many appearances Zimbabwe Tokyo Quebec
Brazil Philippines steubenville oh and
the internet but their success is
unpredictable even
to them their world can be rather
confusing this much is already known for
every sense of a line of straightforward
statement there are leagues of senseless
cacophonous verbal jumbles and
incoherence ease anonymous screeches
sometimes it whispers senseless
cacophonous verbal jumbles and
incoherence ease they weave multiple
labyrinths there's various IRC networks
in exist in existence anonops boxing on
an onset sometimes they're at war
regional nodes are plenty Romania to
India to Brazil at times participants
are purposefully deceitful if you break
the law you must be clandestine deceit
can also be a tactic to coax headlines
out of the media they seek to expose
state secrecy but they keep their own
secrets and secrecy once accepted
becomes an addiction once said physicist
Edward Teller for at least a source of
pleasure as Georg Simmel so rightfully
noted they are not weapons of the week
the phrase anthropologist James Scott
uses to describe peasant politics for
the voiceless of press actors to
everything possible not to call
attention to themselves their safety
claims Dean Scott lies in their
anonymity and their politics are often
not seen as politics but an aggregate
they are anonymous on the other hand are
weapons of the geek they're anonymous
but perpetually call attention to
themselves they rage against the machine
but they also lied deep in the machine
they are the makers and byproducts of
informational capitalism system
administrators who fight spam so we can
get our email their programmers who code
software and then there's those adept
designers who are the contemporary
makers and ministers of desire these
crafters might even poached I'm at work
to work on their activism but anonymous
also houses the board the disenchanted
the mad that disables the merely curious
and of course the unknown they've become
multitudinous numerous and prolific the
collective power of the many rather than
the labour of one defines
ethical way of being they have shown us
the virtue of opacity and E legibility
what you want is famed and note the
price I'll claim to honor you must
sacrifice they shun the ruling ethic of
the century individual celebrity it is
frowned upon to seek public recognition
money fame for your actions those who
bear the self that is those who seek
public status are called out at times
chastise at times kicked out here's an
example from Internet Relay Chat of
someone being called out for their
status seeking behavior hey be can I say
you really love attention and are just
some wannabe wouldn't be surprised if
you're some fed just like Sabu
the other person says you can say
whatever you like a but you're wrong an
ace is back here just like this person
on Twitter and by sacrificing and
effacing the self it has helped their
spread a small fire demands constant
tending a bonfire can be let alone a
conflagration spreads taken globally
anonymous has become a symbol for
popular unrest a way to channel via
material tokens the deep disenchantment
with a dictator with a law with a
economy with a culture of rape basically
with anything but in North America and
Europe Anonymous has come to life as
privacy and anonymity are rapidly
eroding the movement provides a rare
countermeasure and deeds words and
symbols against the world that
encourages people to unmask their lives
where the internet remembers everything
about us we're histories are stored in
search indexes and government databases
at a time the government's ability to
surveil has grown exponentially
anonymous challenges privacy cheers for
anonymity but this may be nothing to
celebrate they're likely not to be our
saviors for many reasons well it's too
early to divine I sometimes think
Anonymous is merely the party at the
funeral of privacy and online freedoms
we will be small scattered darknets on
the
the internet after all is lost but to
finish on a slightly more uplifting note
I would like to end by juxtaposing to
last aphorisms 1 by anonymous and the
quote comes from Brian's film and then
I'll have Nietzsche close for us and
when I read the following one think of
an Irish accent because it's an Irish
accent anything like the Irish say even
if it's mundane feels like very
revolutionary yeah it's like go watch a
movie oh my god that will change my life
anyways anonymous is an evolving thing
it's like a phoenix it might
occasionally catch fire and burn to the
ground but it will be reborn from ashes
yes I know from where I came ever hungry
like a flame I consume myself than glow
light grows all that I conceive ashes
everything I leave Flame I am assuredly
