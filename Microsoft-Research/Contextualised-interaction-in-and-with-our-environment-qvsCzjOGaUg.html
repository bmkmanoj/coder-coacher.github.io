you
so hello everybody good morning I'm
really happy to present again my work I
don't know like a couple of people's
already some projects that i will show
today again do you give you a quick
overview like welcome from what my
background is I before actually start
the studied product design I was in
office administration in one of the
biggest furniture house in Europe and my
job was dealing with the whole later
after customers and so I had to listen
to all the problems what they have with
products their needs and also because I
gave loans I get all the informations
private informations about the
occupation how they live who they are
their age and that kind of like made me
more curious that are and I decided that
I actually want to work with that data
and make something out of it instead of
like just categorizing it and that's why
I started started studying product
design at the bowels University in
Germany so my background is quite
classical from that aspect from the
beginning on but the reason why I really
made product was really that I was
interested in the human behavior so
really looking into why people are
dealing with things how to do and to
look at the the mess kind of like what
what is in our life and to look then how
we can embed that in our everyday life
and how do we interact with it and also
considering like the next step of the
product so every product is embedded in
a whole system so I started looking
really more in the social structures and
the system of products in the context of
it that for example is a product about
like a new concept for dishwashers and
the kitchen is a fairly interest in
place because it's a one of the most
social place in the house it's what a
lot of interaction is happening and what
evolved quite a lot from at the past
through today so it I will can show a
quick video
the dishwasher concept actually in that
case is really like considering as I
mentioned before from the first step
like and you have the plates in the cup
board you have to put them on the table
you have to put them after you get dirty
into the dishwasher and then from the
dishwasher back into the cup board and
even if the kitchen is a very social
room the dishwasher was still like this
white Sun personal object but was smart
and very practical but still not really
embedded in the context of a kitchen so
what I tried to do was here really
considering how people interact with
everything so from the moment on like
that actually the dishwasher starts at
the couple itself and these tablets are
not that the plates are really from
categorized you don't have like plates
your glasses and your cutlery you really
in the end that tablets are already
structured based on your everyday life
so you mostly eat the same things for
breakfast you mostly eat or need kind of
like the same things for cutlery and
dishes for dinner and for lunch so kind
of like you can choose with tablet you
have and at the table you can more
socially involved ish Russia that you're
kind of like just everybody dumpster
dirty dishes inside you go to the sink
and in that research was also that in
the end older the dirty dishes even if
you have a dishwasher get collected at
the sink and then after or while you
actually wash it so there it's more like
you directly have a smaller dishwasher
plate put it into the sink close it like
industrial dishwasher and it gets
cleaned that it's more affluent flow and
how the kitchen actually works and
through that I get a more interested in
the interaction with our object but also
with other people so at this project I
was kind of like curious like how in
creative studios people work and it's
not like that you have any more like
mostly one table where you sit every day
and work it's often that you change the
position that you have to share projects
so my background is not a computer
science and also at that moment I was
not aware that there was quite a lot of
concepts long long time ago about a
digital desk but in that project was
it's fairly simple that it projects your
digital desktop on your desktop but the
point was also not like creating like a
perfect complex interaction that you
really project your whole computer and
it was more like just the overlap of
digital and physical and the opportunity
to share it with your surroundings with
your colleagues so that this lamp was
also adaptable if you actually work on a
table or if you actually want to present
it to more people that you can use your
walls or the surrounding and through
that I kind of like it will it was more
more that actually get curious about
interacting with our environments using
the environment looking closer what is
possible to bring from the environment
into our interactions and here I choose
an object what is really one of the
humans first tools and it's the stick
and it's an object what really evolved
from the beginning of human civilization
and adapted to our culture to our
tradition to our jobs and to our needs
what I think is fairly interesting if
you have one object where you can and
compare the different actions in a
social aspect so what's playing a lot
around like how am different
opportunities open up different aspect
of interacting with the environment
sorry and we're also looking into how we
kind of like get more involved with less
distraction so at that time there was no
selfie stick out I think now it looks
more ridiculous than when I did that in
2009 but it was also the thing like how
can the technology and not lead what we
are doing is what if it's really more
like
a silent helper and leads us through
engaging more with the environment and
also giving maybe the chance to bring an
interaction more outside and having like
a window with two other people to other
lives and also inviting them to year
outdoor and indoor little universe and
they were like quite old project what I
was doing but why I wanted to show you
that before is because the kind of like
build on the three Paula's that I'm
really interested in and it's like the
social structures and a human behavior
what I think every project is for me to
base on I'm very interested in the
interaction with the environment and
especially like bringing our interaction
inviting the environment much more in
all our products and contact
contextualized function I think it's
really important to understand the
context and then based on that
understand which functions we actually
need so i think it's not always the best
do you make very complex multifunctional
tools I think sometimes it's really
better to focus when the special needs
on a special function and to understand
the context of it and I think that
communication is a very important aspect
in every project that I made to then at
the next free for project I want to talk
a little bit more a little go a little
bit more in detail my final thesis at
the bauhaus already built on that and I
was fairly interested in education and
because I think that education at the
moment is not really up to date there's
this big gap between what is happening
in school and what is happening in the
everyday life in the private life of the
children and I think it's really
important to bridge that gap furthermore
it was also fairly interesting to say
that there was also still the gap
between how a computer get used and new
tools get used and all these different
alternative education systems so what I
did was I
we made a four-month research their
children and different schools in two
different countries between 6 and 16
years and created workshops with them to
really observe the whole complexity of
education and school to understand the
bigger picture and so on the work with
the children side i created a workshop
what was based on like five steps they
in the first week and the children got
like a little homework where it was
about like observing their everyday life
and observing school and the goal was
kind of like that they should bring
every aspects that they see in the life
what the kind of I would think that it
would be important to bring it into the
education system or into school so that
the big picture on the left actually is
what was the output that's like just a
little cut out what the children brought
I was quite impressed how engaged all
the children were and what I did also in
his workshops was that I was more like
the silent watcher and if there was a
question or they need then I was there
but it was all about like not
influencing the children I really wanted
to have like on a real output there and
so on the next step it was about that
the children really discussed what they
brought to see whether the overlaps to
kind of see various more needs to
develop it to then brainstorm about what
they could do what could they change
till prototyping and in the end
presenting into the whole school to
discuss that product that idea and why
it is important for them to the topic
also they were does it work yeah came
out free books about it that is the book
what is about the field studies one book
is about really the theoretical research
about school education how it involved
and then there's a whole book about the
field studies the research that I made
through the whole process I'm sorry
exactly and was what was fairly
interesting it's like I think it's a
little bit too small to see and it's
also in German is that the children
really didn't understand why mobile
phones are not allowed in schools they
already kind of mostly gave up on the
computers in school because they mostly
didn't work either the software wasn't
updated either the hardware had a
problem order they already were not
accessible when they needed it because
the school were too afraid that they get
broken because the children are free to
use it so the children always like had
the hidden mobile phone underneath the
table where they already used it as the
computer and like through looking closer
into that what the children actually
using the computers for in school the
mobile phone was fairly enough it was a
lot about research internet research it
was a lot about like presenting and
sharing and and it was quite a lot about
like the social network and just very
focused applications like language
software or just a calculator so in the
end I developed with with the schools
and with some psychologists and also
some teachers a fairly simple thing that
it's kind of like brings the mobile
phone on the table in school to make it
more accessible and there's also a short
movie about it but maybe shoes
so in the end the idea was that to make
it more useful their phones you just
have to extend the screen that it if you
have to read your text books if there
are Texas you kind of have to scale it
up a little bit on the other side what I
think was a really nice opportunity with
the mobile phone is as I mentioned I
think it's really important to to bridge
the gap between outside and inside and
also the gap between the different
classes and disciplines and because it
is always like in the pocket it's quite
accessible and children are already
always making pictures everything what
the interest what interests them it's
fairly easy to kind of like create and
connected there was also the console
refer of software but it's kind of like
a little bit optimized to the everyday
school
and what did additionally do that
because it was still like a product
design what I studied was like optimized
like from the product aspect that it's
very long-lasting that it's like hard to
break and as I mentioned before that
often the computer gets like I'm old or
the software gets old the electronic
display in the end is it snapped
something what you have to update the
mobile phone is already the hardware and
what updated all the time I'm more new
project but I am was looking into Israel
about information in context yeah who
was that design oh sorry what happen was
it on was the iphone hall ah no it was
Android it was a samsung phone so and
the idea was that it's with NFC that
it's the electronic ink display if it
needs like fairly not a lot of
electronic energies when the end it's
really it's not about that you really
flip through like home pages a lot it's
really more like if you have like
something where you have to scale up
your information you then kind of like
projected on your your e ink display
yeah sorry social media Instagram knows
just the kids do patient you just allow
them to carry on with their normal oh
yes so the idea was like that I think
and that is actually an aspect also and
after the project what will come up I
mean we had a lot of be human behaviors
like how you actually should behave that
your for example don't call attending
the evening or when you're sitting at a
dinner you shouldn't call so I think we
we shouldn't delete completely
opportunity of this that I think we
should also learn the children that they
have to understand when it's appropriate
to do something wrong
not but in the software was it was the
idea that it kind of like also blocks at
least some things that you focus more on
the context of school I think it is
important to have access to the social
medias that because it's a lot about
sharing it's about like creating like
also like pages where you where you
could create like contextualize projects
and I think also the phone what I i
think is a great opportunity that is the
chance for the children to write their
own apps in the end to optimize their
ways and to learn also how to do that to
create their own products in the end
yeah Maureen practical question is how
so how does this work I mean how does
the phone connect to this platform I
mean so in the end it was the idea that
there is online platform in the end you
know that the school or every class has
kind of like a little bit like Google
Drive their shared platform but you have
access to it with a fairly simple
software what is like optimized to some
functions of like as I and some things
that I mentioned about the calculator
and things like that and there's the
opportunity if NFC is like my phone had
NFC already embedded that you kind of
really trust in the end like send it to
the electronic display and there's also
the opportunity because so the untrusted
may have its own power and white line
person no it would be really that no it
would it would be more that them I mean
it has to have a tiny bit of it but the
idea is really to minimize that as much
as possible actually yeah just players
coming from the phone yeah phone talking
directly to this file is the phone talk
to the service and the service drive and
destroy so there that the display comes
from the phone so that in the end it
will just project directly what you see
on your phone at the moment but like a
whole date under the big big
data and the whole files will be is bill
happening on the on the platform any
other question a recent project that i'm
working in is more looking into
information in context in the end school
is also about like information
communication in context but here we
were looking more about like that the
structures and how evolved our
communication and also of the parameter
of time and space so information in time
and space and filtering information via
context what we did here was like that
we made a lot of interviews with people
and we actually started with surveys but
we figured out that the output was
fairly generic and that we were actually
curious especially about the little
details of communication by our people
really sending messages but what is it
and what triggers that the moment when
you send a message and what is the
content so we had fairly like private
and interesting outputs and
consideration and a big topic was also
that like time and space is really a
problem especially many people that
you're communicating with they are not
at the same city not even often at the
same country not even at the same
continent so just like the time zone is
a difference and but also even if you at
the same space our busy everyday life
kind of like often stops us from really
communicating with people and also what
what many people mentioned was that even
if you have all these friends and in
facebook or in all your social networks
and all these people that you
communicate with they are still like
these few ones that you actually have a
close relationship with that is either
your family you're really close friends
or your partners and most people kind of
like wanted to make a tiny bit
a difference to make those people really
feel that its meaning for what they are
sending and on the other side it was a
lot about the reason and what people
were sending so like this whole like all
the time dripping information like these
little messages that you send like on
facebook on skype they were all kind of
like triggered by memories that or the
environment something what's what a
person saw but reminded him on the other
person so you send like a little message
to the other person and we're in the
beginning we were looking how could we
make like memory more tangible but in
the end we figured out that memories
intangible but it is it gets triggered
and and it's sensory in the end so it
either reminds you like either something
visual reminds you or a smell reminds
you music reminds you on something so as
an output of the project what we created
was at a tangible voice based hardware
and software that kind of like feels
also less than a product as I mentioned
before I'm I kind of like see and think
it's in it's important that we not
always have something in front of our
face all the time and that you get more
involved in our environment and
something what feels more like something
that we own it so we kind of like choose
the icon of a very stone what is more
something where you're kind of like hold
on in in your arms and just carry it
around with you and as I mentioned with
tangible I meant that we it's actually
just embedded in the pattern itself to
make it feel more tangible so the shape
in the end kind of like leads you and
let you know how you turn the object so
then I've maybe show first some
interactions of it
sorry two screens are too much so in the
end the idea was also not like even if
it's in the end kind of like a it
reminds kind of a lot about the mouse
but it's about like really using the
whole environment not having a flat
surface to interact and even if you have
as a face that there's more a tangible
feedback so if you would turn it around
on its face just for the patterns on the
material itself it kind of like gives
you a feedback sorry what you are doing
and to lead you a little bit more and
that is actually not directly related to
the software but the software kind of
like knows the direction where you go
it's it's it's kind of like more like
having a feedback in general on the
other side we were we saw that
information in context as I mentioned
also doesn't mean that it has to be like
a linear information and often you are
like in a specific context and in the
specific context specific people matter
places and also like how you get there
and where you are and which time frame
you have so you have like these small
universes even during the day that you
have so like your work in the end is a
different context and at home and even
like meeting different friends circles
is kind of like a different context also
to you so we were looking into how could
we like kind of like to give a look on a
glance of your life and you're a quick
information about what is really matters
for you at the moment so that kind of
like shows just like a visualization of
how something like that could look like
in a 24-hour really fast running through
things so kind of like every dot shows
either a person that is from interest a
place from interest or like an
appointment that will come up and you
can also zoom in
and it shows you how you get to the next
point and it's closer a circle a white
circle gets around you kind of like this
small universe will end soon because
another universe actually gets from
interest for you so for example you get
out of work yeah and you mean the
tangible one I will show that in now so
yeah so the idea is like we were looking
into you if there would be an
alternative to a mobile phone how could
it look like if we want to interpretate
communication different and we wanted to
test around if that and and the reason
why I showed before the tangible
interfaces like even if it's void space
and we don't want that there's always a
screen in front of you the idea is we
are spending so much time in front of
screens they actually already enough and
if there is extra information that you
need if you want your life on a glance
because you need this additional
information you're kind of like can type
in into the screens you can you piggy
back in the end on the environment so
the idea was like either way it's more
easy that you just use your private
screens your private laptop that's
around you but the idea would be also to
kind of like get the screens outdoor
involved into that and the other reason
we kind of like saw it as i mentioned
that the member is more tangible and
sensory we're also looking into your as
I mean the screen surround us but also
places that remind us around us and all
and also messages they're very kind of
like Mona leave something in environment
so what we trade it was also kind of
like the idea of sending not only
messages sending in the end things and
the idea was then to through like
involving company
is into the system we actually get an
easier access to these screens in the
environment so you get to get
notifications already filled all the
people sorry is it a haptic devices is
it is almost like a mobile phone without
the screen what is voice based and
tangible but in the end like how it
works would be different so that you
kind of like leave messages in the
environment or can send things in the
environment or like things to other
people and how things would be displayed
on the screen would be all so different
so it would interpretate information
different and how a mobile phone at the
moment interpretate our information so
that would be an example like the idea
was also to you not only same things as
a not only send messages in environment
it was also that what if we kind of like
have like really the sensory exploration
of messages and the end we were like
really looking into a que how can we
recreate smell how can we recreate
memory but in the end it was really that
the best way was like actually really
sending the thing what reminded you so
the idea really was like collaborating
with the shops collaborating with cafes
collaborating with like places of
interest and then giving the opportunity
to in the end leave an object for you
where there's a notification if the
person is close to it and in the end you
get handed not a message you get handed
a thing oh sorry yeah so in the end here
huh yeah so he would be the case that
let's say this person is at home and
reminded that good friend Julie actually
as birthdays birthday and they are not
at the same city or they're not even
closer don't have
opportunity to directly meet up so in
she knows because when when I said that
we I'm actually talking about close
friends do you kind of like no other
preferences you know and the places
where they go you know a little bit
about the routine so what what she did
in the end was like sending through the
pings and things an object to Julia so
the next time when he passed by the
specific shop he gets a notification
either that there's something left for
him or when he's inside he gets a
notification that there is a present for
him the other one was more in a social
context van in the end and many people
mentioned that they just sometimes would
love to drink a beer with the person
who's far away and what just to just
leave a little thing to kind of like
make them happy like a little present
and many people actually mentioned that
they send each other like really
presents but this is still like out of
context in a way it's like it arrives at
home and in in often in a situation
where you're kind of like don't
appreciate enough so that deal was like
really embedded into the context menu
and venue in a bar you're already in a
mood to drink a beer so you're kind of
like I receive it at the right moment
and appreciate more and kind of like
giving the other person or window to the
other person's life that makes sense
familiarity with your friends routines
and what yeah so that that's I'm sorry I
think I explained it not not enough so
that's why we made in the research and
in in in all these interviews if there
was really this big difference between
how much you actually knew about these
many people and how much you actually
knew about these few people that you
really related about so if you think
about your family you know your
preferences of your family you probably
even know like birdy by their food or
like the little things that is that he
buys sometimes for himself to treat
themselves so it's really based on more
these people that are close to you and
not for everybody
and just to show the last feed and we
also try to do that with messages in in
the environment so like if you're kind
of like have a memory about the moment
but you had a good time but is unrelated
to anything commercial in product so
it's not like that you were actually to
cafe or anything and that you can leave
it in the environment but the thing is
that was what will lead me now to worm
actually ended up like viewing in in the
last few months is it's still like not
really satisfying they are still like so
many technical restrictions and it
doesn't really work there's still not
like this the seamless embedded
information environment that you want to
take the seamless communication that it
really feels as we would wish that it is
so you hear still you still have to have
infrastructure so either you speakin or
you either after all the time your phone
words about GPS and it's not precise
enough it doesn't come at the same right
moment or something is not working so
what I'm fairly excited about an
interest is about looking closer into
the environment so not only interacting
with the environment involving the
environment really working with the
environment during my time at the MIT
Media Lab I got the chance to work with
cells and programming cells so what we
did here is like also in the end the
product is highly contextual we created
a second skin what is a text of what is
a cloth as what cloth was the first
application that we were thinking on and
these bacterias actually react to heat
and humidity so in the end you created a
biological interface what reacts to you
as a human being with the needs that you
have so when you get hot and when you
start sweating it adapts to it and to
make that more clear because it's fairly
abstract I will show the video so the
whole project was really from the
beginning of the explorations of the
cells sealed to how we would fabricate
that in the future and
what it is in the end is really just
like big theories that you can find in
your food so I don't know if anybody
knows not to the Japanese food and these
are the cells out of this food and what
these cells do they connect to each
other and they contract and expand to
heat and humidity so we started like
creating a kind of like coding and also
by your films to like engineer different
structures to say where we could make
usage out of it that is a video real
time and it's actually around this size
to create like really bio actuators and
biosensors and to see how complex we get
for what we can use it and also to say
and which different application has and
all the different substrates so here for
example is on a flexible material
instead of a Richard one so it really
creates like three-dimensional Panthers
and it disappears and what we started
creating how we can control it also not
only completely and natural environment
like the skin or like here for example
as the tea bag we were also looking into
kind of like combining biology live
computation but here you see how it
actually reacts to the skin when you are
hot that is also real time and what we
also looked into in the end here you
really have to consider that the
computational part Indian has to happen
before you create the product so we made
a heat and a and a sweat map of the
human body and then plants the material
based on this data to create like the
first prototypes of suits but also
looked into how we can combine it with
electronic devices like lambs or it's
fairly long the video animated origami
so then you think about that actually so
many toys f still likes me electronics
inside how can you actually create
interactive toys with no electronics or
with less electronics so we created some
different opportunities
also but also we started looking into
artificial nature so I think everybody
knows the mimosa plant so we're trying
to recreate it based on electronics and
this bacteria that you respond to you
and to your finger and to not getting
stuck completely in the conceptual part
of it blend to really look further on
how we can do it we're also looking into
how would that look in the future as a
fabrication process so in the end we
just liked Hector and printer and also
used a CNC mill for using it in a really
precise way and in a big scale to create
really functional products and
applications out of it like the picture
that I showed before it stopped I'm
sorry
like these pictures that this was the
first one where we really printed the
bacteria's on it in a background in the
end is a structure that fakes that the
heat and the sweat map so we can be
projected the heat and respect met on it
and based on what you choose which area
at the moment is more hot based on
different sports it opened and closed
the little flaps by itself and based on
that work I started working now and I
got really interested in how can we
really create like new products through
understanding nature and the environment
so what I'm at doing at the moment i'm
looking into electro signals into plants
because they are still like the most
precise sensors that we have and they
are fairly unsophisticated and in the
end water plant is it's just like a
electro chemical signal with a fairly
interesting hydraulic system how that
creates movement reacts to different
environmental factors same like V do we
react to many different environmental
factors and we want to adapt to it
seemed like the plants so I'm looking
into how we can use and really create
seamless embedded sensory devices
sensors and bio activators and translate
that so the idea in for my final T's is
actually to deconstruct how a plant
works and to deconstruct and extract
only the sensory part to create a
biological interface that is based on
like different applications one
application would be a fairly real-world
problem in into agriculture but I also
want to look into how could be go more
further with that and really maybe
having the chance in the future to use
it maybe even as a communication device
yes
a plan to sensory diversity better than
an electronical yeah so I mean there is
a fair at topic where it's kind of like
sensible and there are many people think
it's it's that plant actually not able
to do that but the studies are going
more and more really that that they're
there now the proof of concept that they
are sending it so that in the end that
the plants really have also
electrochemical signals that's how to
communicate with each other and also
communicate in itself with each other so
like if you think about the tip of a
plant and the root of it they
communicate all the time so in the end
the plant has like also almost like a
magnetometer inside it's kind of like
searching for the right place where to
hold on but were the gravity is and is
sending the signals backwards and
forwards but it also reacts actually to
environmental factors like I mean the
obvious ones that we know is like Sun
wind pollution but they actually also
really react to magnetic fields and they
react to devices that we created so
there are some I'm still like in a
moment that is a quite recent one but
there are a couple of outputs already
and I also met with a couple of
scientists that they are proving that
also at the moment but in the end I can
measure the signals of electronic
devices so and one example is that they
made testings were and there was nothing
else in a room than app LTR plate and a
partir plate has actually a rhythm of
four minutes so it always changed a tiny
bit the frequency every four minutes and
a plant I can sense exactly this 4minute
rhythm but it's fairly interesting if
you would really try to kind of like
search further on to figure out what are
the signals that the plant can sense but
also what are the signals that the plan
sends to aspects what is the electro
signal because it also has a different
frequency and how could we work with
that does it make sense okay
any other questions yeah yeah from that
understanding to developing some sort of
hmm so um vacation warm it's something
that so what I I mean for my mighty
sisters felon at enough time to get to
that point it will take a couple of
years but what I'm doing at the moment
is I'm creating a couple of devices that
it can sense the electro signals and I
will focus on a few factors to at least
like a proof of concept of some of those
and then I will more on the biological
side and i'm working with micro fluidics
and they are quite a lot of proteins
that also react to electro signals so i
will still have a computer in between
well in the end translates the signals
of the plant and then we'll send it to
the digital microfluidic device what has
like proteins that will react and create
a specific function or like a display
that i want but i'm also like a lot in
contact with biologists to see them if
there's a punitive opportunity to delete
the computer in between when we arrived
at the point that we really understood
what is the input and the output we grow
devices in the future or in baltimore
what's there um um the bigger pictures
we are trying to and we go more in this
direction of really sensing everything
tracking everything and there is like
already like this really natural
opportunity of sensing and tracking
everything in a very even more sensible
way and also to getting the opportunity
of like building an interface between in
our environment and i'm not talking
about like replicating a computer in
made out of plants and more talking
about there's a lot of information that
we want from the environment but is for
more like binary interfaces or words
more about a state or indicator that
you're looking at and that's what I'm
fairly interested in
so is this about helping scientists
understand what's happening in the
environment through capturing different
kinds of data no I see it more really as
making everybody understand but it's
happened in environment and if we going
more into like the real-time
applications I mean we are looking into
a nap what is what the weather is we are
looking into a nap what the variable B
we are looking into apps about like so
many environmental factors and nature is
they I think they said I applicat the
opportunity to kind of like go away from
all these electronic devices and really
embedded more in the environment and
read out of it and they are fairly they
fairly know earlier what is happening
also so there's also a different time
span that they are talking about your
the project before this you you used
bacteria to create a new kind of the
human centric applications from the body
saved hmm by harnessing the properties
of things that occur naturally but here
you're not saying that hear you saying
that you want to capture the things that
occur naturally in order to help people
understand what's happening in the
environment that's quite different isn't
it not going in that direction with this
project then um I think I'm the reason
why I'm explained that I can't at the
moment so there's a difference between
what I will do in the next couple of
months but it's fairly like
deconstructed in the end brought into
what we will see now around us and share
the vision would be that it's going back
into the natural environment and back
into something what already has the
information embedded some very
interested in embedded information for
example using a tree to tell you what
the environmental condition
particular location I'm like is it that
kind of thing it should be I still don't
kind of like why I'm not using your
still don't kind like the picture
because it it kind of like looks cheesy
in my head or it's i think it's it's
really just like the first picture i
think if we end up really looking more
in this direction also that picture
should and will evolve so it will be in
the end I don't see it really as a tree
standing and then like there's something
plopping up and screaming at you I think
it will be more complex actually in the
end and at the same wasn't same time
more simple is one of the problems and
examples you're thinking about now
you're thinking of biology and plant
life being like a machine but what about
other kinds of hybrids why why why
should we mechanize nature to be more
like machines why don't we sort of
rethink what machines might be okay it
seems like it came them wrong for it's
like um the vision is actually the other
way around so that's what I meant with
like now first kind of like we have to
distract it and like translate it into
computers that we understand it because
that's the language that we are using at
the moment and that we we are fairly not
very much skilled anymore to understand
what is happening in nature but the
vision is actually then just like food
is understanding and through working
with it and for learning from it that it
actually goes and through the process
that we understood it that we change how
we think about like electronics and
computation and then kind of like get
the curve to go back to more natural
computation and natural systems
thank you are you doing um so I was
looking at your your your prototype so
that with the phone and you had thing
with that with a phone on it and clearly
i guess they are meant to be concepts
because you know you know those things
don't fully work like all the way
there's some technical restriction
that's stopping you from kind of fully
implementing it how do you feel
technical restrictions like these
technical restrictions going to shape
your work like you feel like they kind
of our restrictions that you try to
ignore them so that you can kind of
imagine the future or do you try to or
do you feel that it's more important to
kind of understand what these are and to
design around them so the first one that
you mentioned what was I think the phone
one right I mean that was where I was
completely far away from any involvement
of electronics to like my cause was
really about like concepts and research
and in product design today it was
obviously really conceptual the phone
with the e-ink display yeah I mean I had
always liked it that you work like what
to be involved in Interdisciplinary
teams and in the surrounding so what I
am I always ask the question if it at
least would be possible and if there are
two unit is to go in two directions not
that I'm planning into completely in the
blue the the last one that I showed is
is really recent so there's like I mean
you're looking like step for step for it
so like the first one how we interact
with if if the pattern is actually
working so there is really a physical
object but works and where I'm really
looking into how does it feel how would
it really work I mean it's not highly
sophisticated yet but I think obviously
my background is not technical but I
think it is very important to at least
like understand it to question it
to see if there's also than the
opportunity to realize it no thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
