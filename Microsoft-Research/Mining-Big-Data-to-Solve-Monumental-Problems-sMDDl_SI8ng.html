our times why because we face
unprecedented challenges in terms of
population growth energy climate change
risks to food and water security and
finding solutions to those challenges is
going to be a question for science and
we're focused on trying to understand
and find answers to those key questions
research is very different now than it
was 20 years ago we have data forms that
are collecting every conceivable kind of
data we have huge computers that are
collecting data on the inner functioning
of the human body we are collecting more
data than we know how to deal with
increasingly many different fields and
scientists are being overwhelmed by the
the automated collection of scientific
data so it's undoubtedly true within the
next year or so will collect more
scientific data than has been collected
in the whole history of science what I'm
seeing is the hard sciences and soft
science is coming together on big data
the hard scientists are realizing that
it's not just having a lot of data but
having the right kind of data and the
soft sciences are realizing that a lot
of data really really helps Microsoft
Research have some wonderful
technologies here that we can try and
use with scientists to help them find
the nuggets of discovery in their huge
amounts of data we're not only
developing these algorithms to analyze
this massive amount of data but we also
have the infrastructure to actually
perform those computations we have huge
server farms with thousands and
thousands of compute nodes to do the
computations that would ordinarily take
years in just a few hours we're taking
the algorithms and applying it to data
that we're getting from collaborators so
for example we're looking at the genetic
causes of Lou Gehrig's disease the
genetic causes of asthma the genetic
causes of diabetes and we're also
looking at the genetic influences of
aging there is amazing data out there
but the computer scientists have to work
hand-in-hand with the environmental
scientists with the biologists with the
healthcare economist's to be able to use
that data to move us forward we're
focused on trying to make enable and
accelerate some urgently needed
transformational advances in science in
areas of societal importance in science
and in medicine and health people have
had access to you know modest amounts of
data and relatively straightforward
algorithms for analyzing that data and
now with the the revolution and data
we're seeing an explosion and data
that's outpacing Moore's law it's just
getting bigger and faster and it's going
to continue for a long time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
