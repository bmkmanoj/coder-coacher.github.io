alright so so as you probably saw in the
email Victor recently got the
outstanding contribution award from ACM
sigmod oh this is sort of equivalent to
a Lifetime Achievement Award so this is
a pretty big deal and so this was
awarded to him at ACM mobicom which
happened just a few weeks ago in florida
in miami and it's a very very nice globe
I recommend you all stop by Victor's
office and pick it up and have a look at
it it's it's really it's really
beautiful or get their own yes yes
absolutely here's a list of the past
recipients of the OCA from sig mobile
you will notice a bunch of people that
you know in their very young crowd
indeed as a Stefan points out so Victor
got the award for pioneering
contributions to wireless internet
broadband technologies and for
inspirational leadership of the mobile
computing community there was there was
some discussion about whether that
pioneering work should be impactful or
pioneering I think in the end pioneering
is what what is on his award now you all
know Victor quite well here's his
background he got his PhD from UMass
Amherst and he worked at this company
called deck which apparently most of our
interns don't know what it was hoping
we're hoping most of you do and then and
then of course you know his his history
here in MSR and he's been very active in
the sig mobile community he of course is
the founder of sig mobile as well as a
bunch of conferences that are part of
sig mobile or affiliated with sig mobile
and he's been on a variety of steering
committee positions as well his his main
contributions have been in broadband
wireless in particular in wide space
networking and in wireless LANs and mesh
networking there there are a lot of lot
of details you can find of course on his
webpage here a bunch of highlights on on
some of the work
and of course victor is going to go into
some detail about his contributions here
and how those came about and of course
you know he's collected a large number
of awards over the years and there's
there's a long long list of them here's
here some of the main highlights and and
I think you know quite a lot of these
from from all the press that he's gotten
from them he's also gone lots of
accolades these are you know
descriptions of some of the words of
Victor that people have used to describe
either Victor or his contributions so
I'd like to present to you Victor and he
will give his his talk now thanks sure
okay as I was a you know as you know the
stock was first given at mobicom I was
given on october second and that's
significant as you will see as i go
through this to go through the talk so i
was thinking about what to say to this
audience I was you know I thought about
whether to just to sort of a future talk
or or just do some technical talk and in
the end I decided that in many of my
sort of travels and when I talked to
people they they generally asked me how
do you you know how do you select your
problems and you know how do you move
forward and how do you execute on it so
I thought maybe that's what i'll focus
on today so at the top against me and my
research and I joined Microsoft in June
or 90 97 I was you know newly minted PhD
I had been working in dec four for
several years and both frickin rich
recruited me here to start up the
networking research group and they
promised me a land of flexibility and
openness and the delivered so I when I
look bill MSR it was fairly intimidating
there were people like Gordon belch
octa-core Butler lampson and all his
touring Award winners and they were
collecting these amazing researchers
and so it was a little bit intimidating
it was also very exciting and so I was
as i was thinking through what you know
what to do here I met Don Ovid head and
Turner recently left MSR but he's a
great guy he's actually also sort of god
of graphics and he gave me this article
by Hamming and many of you may have read
the article and the article said you nao
research and I see some chickens people
that have people not read this article
if not ready dancing so great this is
audience if you haven't read it you
should read it this is actually a
transcript of a colloquium he gave at
bell labs in which he was asked or he
thought he talked about why do some
scientists make it big and some don't
and what is what in particular do they
have that causes them to win or do great
things and he lists out very nicely all
the different things but one thing that
struck me when I read the article was
this this thing about courage about
having the courage to go and ask the
questions and and do things which others
may not do may be fearful off so this
stock is then about a young systems
researcher at the time wanting to be
courageous it's about wanting to have
impact and then potentially sharing some
of the things that I've learned over the
course of my career over a certain time
now in order to do this I do have to
leave some modesty aside because I will
be talking about things that had worked
and I ask your forgiveness for that so
let's start with how I started so when I
joined in 97 the state of wireless
networking was not like it is today of
course they were there was no Wi-Fi
there was no standard the I Triple E 802
11 standard was just coming about they
were very few companies there was no
aruba's there were no broadcom selling
anything or simple or well symbol of
selling something
but all the companies that you know
didn't exist at the time and then most
of the wireless networking were done
with these cards in fact if you come to
my office I have some of these still in
my in my file cabinet that I can show
you and the cost of these things were
about $300 piece now in terms of the
community itself there was really no
home and in fact i just started sigma
ball just as I was entering MSR so it
was a very very brand new community and
you know which home just started they
only started so I was this new guy in
town and so the question was I wanted to
obviously create an impression so what
do i do I I thought of welding a lab and
so then I had this idea that why not
turn building 31 which was the place
where MSR existed into a full lab and
pursue research at scale their question
was how do I do that who is going to
give me resources for it so the first
lesson is when you if you have big ideas
you want to do it fine individual who
has who is forward-looking who can
support you and who will be willing to
to help you move your thing and for me
that individual was dandling den Ling is
now you know retired but I give him a
lot of credit for what msrs today in
terms of the successes of MSR okay so
then with that support i settled on
going to this company called internet
wireless and then the question then for
me was okay I'll deploy at the network
but then i needed to program it to and
without programming it would be just
being network but i wanted to do that as
well and it turned out that windows did
not understand wireless at the time
there was no way for me to program any
of the wireless cards so what do you do
you're a researcher you want to do this
well you can go to a device driver and
get the device drivers which I did but
then how do you do this in scale how do
you make sure that everybody is using
your work ok so then
I thought hmm let me write something
that we'd always do we write a paper so
I wrote this paper I wrote a paper
called wireless is not ethernet and I
gave justifications of why that is the
case did I did some lab experiments
showed all that stuff and gave it to the
product groups well the product level
aside and kind of ignore it and if
you're smiling you probably have some
examples of your own in this category so
the lesson is that if you want people to
spend their time on your idea you must
show them the money first there are more
lessons but let's let's go with that for
now so it so I came back and I thought
what can I do what is compelling that
would get these guys to listen to me and
we you know sort of understand that this
is important so at that time if you work
in the location determination field Roy
and and Andy Andy Harper had Oliver Lee
labs and they had done some really good
work on I our batch location location
demolition with this active match badges
thing but there was nothing in the
aerospace which is what I was looking
for now I had done some work before
coming to whom AXA Research I had done
work in the same space and written a
paper which was published in and JSOC
while ago so I looked at that paper and
then after looking at it for a long time
in deciding that I would whether to
implement or not decided was just too
complicated it was so complicated it was
one of the best papers i wrote because
it was very very mathematically
intensive it had all the stuff that i
knew about signal processing and control
theory in it kahneman filtering state
space all good stuff but was difficult
for me to understand after I'd written
it and looking at back at it for a while
so you must think about simple solutions
now so then I thought okay what should I
do next now I had seven eight years of
background in signal processing I had
done pattern recognition work quite a
bit before I got to Microsoft and in
fact in dec I had done a lot of image
processing that's where I was coming
from so now I work with this great
new hire venker at the time that would
we just hired he was the fact it was the
first hire for the networking group and
with him started to think about pattern
recognition contact a pattern
recognition the context of our signals
and naturally from that the answer worse
was there a pattern to the signals that
you saw at any particular location and
so when down that path and then radar
was created and so there's actually this
this demo if you click if you go to the
radar web page and you click on it you
can actually see how the original radar
system worked it was 90 99 now so the
lesson here was that some of the best
work in my mind is done when you
actually have ideas in a particular
field and then you reapply them in a
different field because you this is a
very fresh outlook to to applying the
same ideas and and they win now so so
rado wasn't a more normal success I
don't know if you've gone and seen it is
one of one of the highest side paper i
have if i look at the combination of I
if we go to Google Scholar and look at
it there's more than 66 6200 citations
for that particular paper so it's really
successful but that was in 1999 today's
2013 and where the products today
there's no products right so research
success does not mean commercial success
for commercial success you must think
really hard about the value proposition
so when I went and tried to sell radar
to our product groups they said that
they didn't see the value in terms of
the amount of effort that it had to be
placed to find the location versus what
you would do with it now of course there
were other reasons there are two at that
time did we didn't have smartphones at
that time we only had laptops and things
like that so there were many reasons but
but just to tell you the guys and
product ups are very pragmatic very
practical they know what works and so I
didn't have a really good value
proposition and I didn't have it for
many years so I just abandoned that I
didn't do I actually did not write a
single paper after that even though as
you can see they were 6,000 papers or
more written after that now so one other
lesson was to pursue it I mean if you're
doing research you probably
way ahead and if you're way ahead you're
not going to convince people right away
to take your stuff okay and then the
other thing that I learned was that the
market will always always take the
simple solution so even though i had
done radar and I thought it was much
simpler than the one that I had done the
paper that had done previously it was
not as simple as what skyhook try a
skyhook wireless it if you know what
skyhook wireless did all the dead was
that they looked at the location of the
access point and said that's where your
location is and that was it and they
created the whole table lookup and a
whole class and they sold they made lots
and lots of money the iphone when it
first came out had skyhawk in it and
that was a degenerate case over it out
and I had completely overlooked it right
so so that was sort of an interesting
thing for me now if i want to show you a
little video that i did in nineteen
ninety nine which was shown by rick at
mobicom 1999 and then we showed this one
in turn left conference room number 2130
30 LOL at the time but but this is
sharad this was done about about a year
and a half ago few minutes fingers are
like functionality and this was done in
1999 and register take your things where
there are we can be location-aware
systems and services once your are knows
what your physical location is it can
provide that information to the system
and the system can do interest I rings
for going yeah there's a story there's a
story behind appeared that the thing is
I was kind of pretty young looking and I
was heading signal while and I need to
look old so the beard was there for me
to look over a few shows all right so
anyway so this is this radar for you
know 14 years ago yeah food music oh so
now back to my endless extension story
well I had downed radar and I had now
gone in and understood what the Prada
groups wanted so then I had an intern
Gavin he was one of my first and turns
and we sat down and wrote a spec down we
don't the spec just like you would see a
product groups cap this was not a paper
it was not a speck and when we went
there and represented this back and we
showed them the value
the time and then that virus indeed was
different and you could never do what I
had done with ethernet they got it they
got it and they accepted it so now in
this started to has wireless LAN
extensions and not just that they
actually started a huge program called
native Wi-Fi after that which was to
completely abstract out the wireless
part from windows and take most of it in
its in the stack above and that was
fairly successful as well so that was
all good now this is a memo that I wrote
two wooden MSR and I actually blew it up
a little bit and I thought it was sort
of funny is this the this was about the
building that I talked to you about
creating the trading building 31 into a
wireless network lab and of course you
know send this memo out to all of ms are
saying that we have full wireless access
encouraging them to use wireless which
is something that you don't even like
think about now we just take it for
granted but at that time people were not
like that you sort of had to encourage
them and then I talked about Internet
and the cost of adapter now this took a
momentum of its own so after MSR did
this after we did this in ms are they we
used to have this thing called micro
news I don't know how many who solve you
know about micra news but many of you
don't potentially know but we actually
had a had a paper micronesia will just
show up like every week or so and in
there in there bill gates announced that
we were going to unwire all 45 buildings
of Microsoft in it and then he in here
in there he says sort of is aimed at
spurring other companies to take steps
to use technology to free what gates
calls knowledge workers this was a huge
deal in the wireless community because
this was the first company with that
kind of you know a spread and and and
the pockets that was saying wireless was
going to be the future and if you
remember that company that I talked
about Internet well internet got bought
for eight hundred million dollars right
there and I believe that a lot of what
happened in Wi-Fi the burst that
happened was because of this and then
they made a whole lot of money here so
the point here is that it is very
difficult to actually I could
imagine this would happen and it's
difficult to sort of see when you start
your project what they will way they
will lead so don't worry so much about
about the big things the little things
will get you there so long as your
vision is large enough and big enough
okay so good successes in the enterprise
so why not take it outside well this was
a time when 3g networks were very very
popular and everywhere you went every
place every newspaper article or every
you know magazine looked at 3g networks
were going to solve all the things we
would call impaired discussions with
wireless wars Wi-Fi vs 3g i mean now you
can sort of think about that silly and
stupid but that's the time when the
telcos were very pushing and the telcos
did not want wireless land in the public
spaces because they thought it would eat
into the existing businesses so the
point here is that what you read in
popular media you should take it with a
grain of salt you need to be independent
thinkers they will get it wrong because
they're just listening to a lot of
marketing stuff that is happening and
and we are trained not to do that and
think independently so I didn't and I
built the choice network which was then
the first Wi-Fi network in the world and
Richard members is probably because he
was backing this up quite quite a lot
but there's a poster that is still in my
office and we had this poster and in the
crossroads shopping center that we have
here we had the first Wi-Fi hotspot and
network in the world and in this this
page actually still exists although this
morning when I tried to load it it
wasn't loading properly now there was
lots of great innovation in here by the
way this was not just just the fact that
we put wireless cards in there that we
had to decide what the architecture
would be so one of the big architecture
design decision that I made at that time
was to have smart wireless switches and
dumb access points okay that was there
was a design decision but all the other
good stuff that you hear about in the in
the conferences and stuff was their
location of where services was there all
this other stuff security was there and
in sort of its
sort of articulated in this paper that I
had now once I build this I was out
there evangelizing and the way I would
evangelize this you know logically was
here's a graph from a hot nights
conference the panel that I was sitting
in 2002 where I should share ok let's
look at where I spend my time so in the
horizontal axis is the days of the week
and the number of hours spent and as you
can see it served divides up into hotels
fly its airports offices on the move
home but now if you map this to saying
how much of its indoors and how much of
its outdoor this is what shows up so
you're spending majority of your time
indoors and this to me was a convincing
argument to say that wireless Wi-Fi
access and wireless LANs was the future
and I couldn't see why people wouldn't
see that and why i was actually making
that argument anything but that's how I
did I did this now the the uptake of
course is that hundreds of thousands of
our hearts what exists in fact it is
almost impossible to even determine how
many are there in the world and we just
expect them everywhere but for me it
wasn't a successful thing right it
wasn't successful because when I were
gone to the product groups and he would
ask the question why did Microsoft pick
up and do something with it I did I
actually did try to push it inside they
didn't get it they were very busy in
what they were doing then in fact the
architecture that I had recommended the
fat ap the sort of you know they embrace
an ordinary of architecture where they
put the the most of the logic in the
access points and not in the wireless
switches and as you can see in
retrospect the world is where I was then
which is that the architecture is much
more in their wireless which is done in
the aps and then when i submitted a
paper too mobicom the reviewers came
back with all kinds of small little
things here and there and it rejected it
and i was dejected and i said screw it
i'm not going to not going to spend my
time are trying to move forward with it
so the lesson here again is that if you
really believe in it you need to
persevere and yes you may be wrong but
you may be right too okay I moved on i
look back some of the mistakes this a
little mistakes at it now seven years
after that so one thing we did do
horses we patented all the other good
stuff now you sometimes wonder what
happens to our patterns you've heard all
the other stories in terms of Google and
Motorola but really in this particular
case I did get an email in 2007 which
was about seven years after i had done
this were saying that they had made an
agreement a landmark agreement with
norton and was sort of based on the
patterns that we had done for for that
for those networks and it goes on and
says you know good things about it so
Microsoft did did do get some win out of
it but not as much as I'd hoped and they
would get okay so so this was about some
lessons I was learning but as I was
learning i was actually applying them to
so in 2002 we in tribute interviewed
Revere he's not here but he was there
when I gave this talk recently and he
was a PhD student at Cornell he had come
in for the MSR fellowship and was
talking about networking anyway I liked
his drive I like his enthusiasm and I I
loved him so I took him on as actually
my prodigy at the time and then sew
together with my brother who was in the
product groups we worked on this thing
called multi net and then we built a
real thing no it was all a kernel hack
in the windows it was all built it
worked really well but as usual was
ignored by the business group so in this
particular case did not move on so we
persevered right we persuade and we
shipped it to the world which is we said
we're going to eat so believe in this
we're going to make this all available
and this became one of the fastest
downloaded software from micro research
100,000 of the downloads happen in a
very short period of time and then in
2009 7 years afterwards it finally
shipped as virtual Wi-Fi inside windows
and this was the first was like Windows
virtualization architecture the resale
so the lesson that were applied here we
build a real thing we showed them the
money and we persevered okay now my
third story starts with ah with Chinese
dinner so I was an encouragement craig
mundie the who was the CEO of Microsoft
I got this mail from Pierre diverse and
some of you might
remember him also and the email went
like this Victoria track would like to
get your input on what is feasible Mac
protocol and I'm thinking to myself what
the heck a CTO of Microsoft asking me
about a mac protocol didn't seem very
smart but anyway sort of says well we
can meet in this Chinese restaurant in
Redmond and he wants to meet it come now
basically that's what it said so ok so I
said mine I showed up on that day and
that's the day when I get my first
exposure to some of these topics so I
from Craig I started to understand and
imagine my might sort of mindset at that
time I was this researcher in a research
lab on doing things and now I was
certainly exposed by the CTO of the
company too much much bigger problems in
society one of the problems being that
there was no internet access in rural
areas while we were all we had it
another words that I didn't really know
was there was a duopoly open to access
between cable and DSL and that duopoly
was a serious impediment to to the
progress that we wanted to see I also
learned from him about network
neutrality and then I also learned there
was a very good-looking lobbyists in
that dinner table I didn't know what a
person did but I learned that she was a
lobbyist and then what they do in
Washington DC and I actually started to
get it that was sort of a watershed
moment for me in terms of the work we do
and MSR is not just about products it's
not just about doing papers but it is
about can be about something bit much
bigger so the problem that was placed in
front of me the technical problem that
was faced with and from me is that we
needed to become a threat to the cable
and DSL because the the resolution was
that if the cable and DSL guys knew that
there was an alternative then they would
try to protect the turf and the way they
would protect it is potentially go out
and become even more pervasive so the
idea was how do we become a threat to
them but we can't break the back so
what's the solution wasn't that we just
go and dig fiber and do what Google is
doing today but how do we how do we get
there so in the meantime so you know I
got
bandwagon and I also sort of realized
that this problem was real about ruling
networks and and as you sort of Doug and
I also give a lot of talks in this there
were some famous quotes by Kofi Annan
who was the general secretary of UN and
and Richard Newton who was passed away
dnf UC Berkeley was also a member of our
tab and you know day and I'm me too
we're going out and sort of talking
about this thirst for connection that
needed to bridge this notion of digital
divide and if you remember for those who
were around there there was this whole
digital inclusion digital divide a thing
that we were pushing very hard which was
about bringing more people into the into
the mix so mash never emerged the idea
there was this was going to be an
organic system where remember we didn't
want to spend that much money so we
wanted the people to spend the money and
they what we wanted them to buy the
equipment and then to the magic of
software we were just going to connect
them and then we would bring fibre or
cable or something in some middle place
and then through this multi hub network
connected to that and boom they will
have internet access so that's what he
wanted that was what mesh net was all
about and so the group really really
jumped into this and rich was actually a
core part of that group and we we just
took it by the throat and and jumped on
doing mesh networking now you know you
would expect I mean I expected being
being in the field that there were 20
years of research that had happened in
this area and so this would be easy this
would be just an engineering job because
people had written thousands of paper on
the subject so why would it be difficult
wrong it was wrong so I looked at the
number of routing protocols existed and
I ran out of steam I couldn't fill this
slide but there were so many so the
question in front of you if you were in
engineering our product team is which
one should you pick the interesting
point was that every one of them showed
improvement over the other one that they
had looked at and the only reason was
and you would you will understand that
in research we kind of tend to do that
well maybe not we but you know people
tend to do that which is change change
the Assumption here a little bit or
change something here and then make the
graph go in the right direction and boom
you have a paper and so
do you do well this was very difficult
as researchers were difficult for us let
alone product groups and that's one of
the reasons why when products when you
sort of say have a good solution the
products are so a little confused
because they are hitting 20 different
things and then you don't know what to
trust and you you know why that is there
so I I too lost a bunch of faith in the
academic research community in the
networking community and that is the
time i went from a phase that they were
very smart people to people who are just
writing papers okay without knowing now
and and mobicom which is the home
audience in the the you know big
conference of the time and still is was
becoming too academic and so we needed a
systems conferences where we act we
researches build real systems and there
was a time when I fired mobis in 2003
now so so I think that one thing as
system researchers and I believe this
group is very good at it its world class
and top-notch and role models in it but
i do believe they are not that many
people like this which is that we need
to take our work to the point of with
refutable t we need to take it to the
point where there is no question that it
actually works in all kinds of
environments and that you're aiming at
so we were very successful I thought we
produce these academic kids we wrote a
lot of software we gave the software
away we wrote papers we did docs and you
know there were twelve hundred
universities worldwide who started using
our kid so by all since it formed this
was a success we organized summits and
workshop and they're looking at the
energy that we were putting into this
thing the community also started to sort
of got integrated because multihop Eric
networking has been an intellectually
interesting problem space and then many
many hundreds of papers will be used and
then the VC dollar started to flow as
well so you know just like Internet of
Things is happening now we see dollars
you know they see money and they say
what the heck you know hundred thousand
year or million there for somebody who
has a hundred million dollars it's not
such a big deal and they started to
spend its immediately you started to see
all these nice things about New Orleans
will have free citywide Wi-Fi or
Michigan will have a Philadelphia will
have and there was a whole bunch of
these things
now so we had succeeded we had become a
credible threat to the dsl and cable
monopoly and in the process we had
actually introduced some really really
good concepts which have stood the test
of time and one of them was multi radio
wireless networks we were the first to
write papers on that and sort of explain
how they work well now the reality is
that it was not so successful as you
look back right all the good stuff that
was coming started to become bad San
Francisco formerly n citywide 18t kills
so the point was that the vc's got it
wrong they did not understand the
technology they did not understand that
the limitations and so when you know
people who wanted to make quick money in
startups gave them the ship'll and told
them hey look Microsoft is doing it they
just went with it and spend a whole lot
of money and then realize that we're not
getting any money back for various
technical problems which I can go into
but won't now and so they did they they
didn't do very well and so the lesson
again here is that businesses decisions
that are made on you know not understand
the technologies that are bad decisions
to make and this applies to us as
Microsoft as a company as well which is
that we must be very honest with
ourselves when we build a technology and
we go talk to somebody else how real it
is again this goes back to the point of
it affordability it's a point of that
you are completely satisfied that this
is will work then you put your weight
behind it otherwise this or work to do
they got it wrong they didn't really
understand this ok so my food story is
around license versus unlicensed now and
this also goes back to 2003 when I had
the first exposure to the breadth and
complexity of the issues involved in in
all of this stuff so everyone wanted
more spectrum just like now if you're in
Wireless you go to your favorite search
engine and check you know everybody says
oh spectrum crunch and it's not going to
happen or whatever now the debate is
whether we should give it to the telcos
or should we do it unlicensed and
there's reason to do both right because
the telcos will come and say look at it
look
cell phone industry look how how
amazingly successful it is how many
people use it how much economic value
we've got created because of that and we
can do it right the ANA license guys
will come and say look at Wi-Fi like
look at bluetooth look at zigbee these
are really successful this would not
have happened with our unless and so if
you sort of think about it there's all
these issues now this is the time when I
learned about rule of course he used a
British economist he's passed away he
was also a Nobel laureate and he's
called the father of reform in the
spectrum allocation policies does
anybody know about him so that's okay
because when i asked the movie
commodious does anybody know about it
not anybody knew about it and so it was
sort of sad to me because I think these
are these are history is important
because you sort of learn so what he had
done is he had written as very
screeching article about the FCC what
the FCC had done just so you know is all
this broadcast spectrum was very
political at the time and so they had
these these politicians were also very
rich a long time back and so there was
some sort of deal made where the
spectrum was given away to these
broadcasters which are now broadcasters
for free and one of the reasons was
because these broadcasters would
broadcast political speeches and things
so they would help the political agenda
of the people so that they were there
was this ulterior motive been giving it
to them free and so when he looked at
this problem this was in the 50s I think
he he wrote this you know a huge paper
and sort of saying how wrong this was
and how badly they had sort of looked at
all this stuff anyway I was invited to
do Stanford there was a workshop that
was organized by Larry Lessig and Thomas
hazlet they are they are you know their
lawyers but they are also great thinkers
and and I would recommend if you're
interested to sort of look at their or
become a fan of their tweeting which I
do but they brought in a whole lot of
forward-looking thinkers economist legal
scholars everybody to this this workshop
and I badly wanted to be there I badly
wanted
be there I wanted to learn beyond my
engineering so if you want to be there
you must bring something to the table
okay you so I did I actually wrote a
draft proposal on what a spectrum
etiquette and I worked pretty hard on
this one because I was working with
certain parameters about what etiquette
meant and I went there they gave me a
stage to present my work and I promptly
rejected they're probably rejected
etiquette made no sense in spectrum but
I had but but at least I started a
dialogue anyway so what was happening
there was at that time I you know I
became aware that in 1996 the US
Congress was going to open up all these
TV bands right and at at stake was what
happens to these four to these bands so
the idea of dynamic spectrum access was
in the air but it was us just in the air
these lawyers and these you know policy
thinkers and regulators were not
engineers they could only talk about
things they couldn't do it and they were
making a lot of assumptions so somebody
had to prove that this thing works and
we did so we came back and we worked on
this problem we worked on the dynamic
spectrum access product problem and we
built the first white space network in
the world and so these are some pictures
of the time and once we built it we knew
that we people were going to listen to
us and that's exactly what happened
these are pictures of the chairman of
the SEC who came here on a Saturday and
I gave him a two-and-a-half-hour talk
and answered every question he had and
he came in with his you know his chief
of staff and some engineering and he
asked me very pointed questions but I
think we showed in the demo everything
and at the end he sort of went back and
I believe and there's really no evidence
to back this up except the fact that he
was there a month later they they
announced that that they were going to
open these bands out for unlicensed room
with DSA now this of course led to a lot
of regulators all over the world who
were interested in this as well and so
they came here and we showed it to
everybody we showed it to you know
triple standard bodies folks we showed
it to of course the FCC from India from
Singapore all these regulators game here
now and also the good news was that
beyond doing all this stuff I also got
to be a part of the PhD thesis of at
least two students and I'm sure they
were lot more but these were directly
consequence of the work that we did here
because they got these two thesis at
Harvard and UMD what we had what we had
gone from was this world on the
horizontal axis is the range in meters
vertical axis is the speed and then if
Wi-Fi for example sits here and then
these are the distal of the different
technologies to world that looked like
this so we had literally created a new
world where we could start to think
about what kind of sin are as we could
enable and that's what it looked like so
what I learned there was that again the
work that MSR lets us afford to do
actually goes well beyond what we think
it is right so in order to succeed I had
to think about the society handed to
make the case based on society I had to
understand what the business needs were
right we had to sort of think about of
course research engineering integration
policy and all these things sort of fit
together to solve that particular
problem so research is only one part of
the story and so when we do some work
and if you may have heard Peter talk
about it if you do some work we must
have a sense of humor about what we have
done as opposed to what actually happens
building an idea because we have the
luxury to do it it's just not enough you
really have to think about the whole
thing and you have to if you believe in
it go down and if you don't and if
somebody else is doing that then you
must give him or her the same accolade
and perhaps more for taking the risk to
actually take it to the end which you
couldn't so anyway the point is that
this is a lot more to solving a problem
than just doing your own papers etc so
we've had a you know plenty of impact
beyond Microsoft I want you to read this
this game you know just out of the blue
for us but it was really heartwarming
and i'll just take 10 seconds off for
you to actually read this
so you can imagine what what we sort of
did or what this technology did to this
individual sitting somewhere and I have
to believe that they are a lot more than
just this person who's actually
benefiting from it and so this is great
because we are actually doing something
something amazing so let me show you
this this video just to sort of break
things up a little bit also make up what
if you could better educate children
living in a remote village who lack
access to specialized instruction what
if you could manage traffic so gridlock
doesn't stop your city during rush hour
what if you could provide
state-of-the-art high-tech medical care
to people living in remote communities
what if governments can use technology
to better deploy city services such as
garbage removal and reduce costs in the
process what if a boy who dreams of
playing in the Premier League's but
finally strained his favorite themes
games if you look for the answers you
won't find them and what's out there
but you might buy them in what's not
there it's called white space and it's a
renewable natural resource found in
unused radio frequencies these unused
white space frequencies can be used to
increase available bandwidth improving
the quality of broadband connectivity
and lots of these unused frequencies are
located between TV channels signals set
out on these unused TV frequencies
travel far and penetrate trees walls and
other solid objects inexpensively
extending the reach of Wi-Fi and other
wireless broadband technologies
currently limited to using higher
frequencies what can TV white spaces
enable you can manage traffic in your
city minute to minute adapting the
infrastructure to accommodate conditions
you can more efficiently deliver public
services
you can have medical resources be
available for preventive care by
reducing the cost of broadband
connectivity a school can now become
part of a global village the only thing
stopping this from happening is the lack
of favorable consistent regulations
allowing white space technology to be
deployed on an unlicensed or license
exempt basis people and the devices they
use will finally be better connected by
tapping into the TV white space
available in your country okay so this
is a marketing video of course but I
showed it because there was this last
point that I wanted to sort of help me
transition into what I'm going to say
next which is the last thing so you know
people often ask me okay you know about
a vision talk and I don't know I don't
think I'm a visionary or anything like
that but I always see a lot of problems
that we need to solve and the question
is which one we're going to solve it so
now in this particular case I will tell
you about this thing called the PCAST
report and I don't know how many of you
know it but peak a stands for it's a
Presidential Commission which was put
together by the Obama our government to
look at the future of the United States
in the world and think about what is
going to happen with mobile technologies
and they brought in world's experts from
all over the world and it's a big report
and you know you can read it if you want
but one of the things they did say was
that the way they have to CS or dealt
with spectrum was all messed up and the
norm has to be sharing and the kind of
sore leave it of that that it has to be
sharing now the question for us as
engineers is can we build technology
that allows sharing and so they know
that sort of a challenge so this brings
me to the kinds of things that I am
working on and these are just a subset
of the things that I work on but you
know there's a campus wide spectrum and
and the reason I'm working on some of
these is that last part in the video
which is that you have to build it to
prove to the regulators around the world
that it works and so building at me
is not building it in your lab doesn't
mean building it you know in some sort
of a rural setting you have to build it
mainstream and that's what we're doing
here we're building a DSA Network
mainstream to show that this we have
irrefutable evidence that it works now
are we also going to make this available
to the research community as well as
pushing very hard on different
universities to build it as well and
then I'll talk to you a little bit about
this in the end so this is the
networking you many of you may have seen
the guy this is a sore aboard from M
sorry shear these are some of the
antennas and building 19 there's seven
and tina's here and building 99 right
above this is where the solar box sits
and we've got four buildings equipped
with it this is a joint effort between
MSR Asia and MSR Redmond now looking at
the spectrum crisis thing for really
quickly is there are all these blogs and
it's sort of talk about we are you know
we are headed for a more serious problem
which is things just won't stop working
and so the question is can it be managed
and the technical question here is can
it be managed now we we did some work
and we looked at how the spectrum has
been used so this is what the FCC has
allocated on the band above this is what
we see okay so you can see there's all
this allocation but there is no use then
how can anybody say that there's not
enough spectrum right of course this is
not a conclusive set of data we are we
are we are now taking it upon ourselves
to not again believe the marketing
literature but to get real data science
is based on real data so we can get real
data to determine if there is actually a
spectrum prices or not and we're going
to show after many you know maybe a year
or two years that it whether it exists
or not it tells us that it probably
doesn't so the technology policy group
here in Microsoft has actually build a
spectrum Observatory but it costs
twenty-five thousand dollars in so it's
not scalable what we have been doing in
ms are now is to bring that price down
to less than five thousand dollars and
we've got many universities lined up
that are going to take this and put this
observatory so think of it as a planet
lab but an observatory that has got a
thousand points all over the US and all
over the world and so we what we want is
the call
to a lot of the students and lot of the
universe's there was to help us build
this Observatory around the u.s. so
there is no more debate of whether it
exists or doesn't exist and we have real
data so once and so once we show that
there does exist spectrum then the next
technical question is how do we use it
how do we use that thing that somebody
else has been allocated who you want to
use it so it's sort of like white spaces
white spaces wooden becomes the first
manifestation of it but you have to
build similar systems and it's not easy
you have to actually think about
hardware you have to think about
broadband receivers you have to think
about power you think about rendezvous
strategies a lot of the problems that
people have try to solve actually are
much simpler in the Wi-Fi space and then
the space that I'm talking about now and
and if we say we saw them we would have
gotten radio spectrum prices forever so
that's really what it is so I just have
a few parting thoughts from a lot of
this work that I've done and so the
first one is that we must must always
question the assumptions now when the
assumptions were made they were right so
right now we make some assumptions about
the systems we built and we are right
you know not stupid people but the
generations that come out for us they
would have made a lot of progress since
the question then is that what the
assumptions right or not so we must must
always do that I've also made this point
plenty of times hopefully which is that
research is you only useful if you
really take any system research is
useful if you take it to the point of
fate ability okay then I and this was
sort of a controversial topic that I
made actually because people ask me
where this later on which is I believe
publish when you're done the question is
when are you done but but that's we can
talk about that but really it is a
disservice in my mind to publish in fact
I gave this antidote from my own wife
was technical and she was working in
Amazon she doesn't work in there anymore
but and she was doing all this stuff
with Hadoop and analytics and all the
other good stuff it with big data and
she came to me one day and she said you
know you guys that I totally messed up
because you you published so many papers
and nine
% him a garbage and you wasted my time
you've wasted so much of my time and my
peoples time so a nice is not good
that's just bad for our community for
our service and so again back to ms are
we can't we have to be very very
critical about what we publish I think
Percy where that comes out hopefully has
come out in the the main things I've
said and then the last one is don't be
afraid of failing because you know we're
going to achieve anything any great
anything great if you don't even try the
hard stuff and I have failed many times
for the things that I've shown you I can
talk to you about many cases I've failed
I told you how I didn't do well in the
Wi-Fi the other projects also i can talk
about but of course you don't hear about
them you only hear about the successes
but really that's that is exceedingly
important and then you need to have sort
of a better thing so now in ending i
would code martin lagonda i told you i
gave this talk in october second and so
it turned out it was Matt back on his
birthday and he had said something which
also i very much believe in then be very
slow to have conviction but when you
have the conviction you you you go for
it with that I will end and we're in
time thank you very much for listening
to me so quietly ok so any so we can
stop recording but we can have it I
think what I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
