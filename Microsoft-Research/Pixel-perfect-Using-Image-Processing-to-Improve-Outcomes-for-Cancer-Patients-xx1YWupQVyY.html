hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
so I'd like to now introduce our first
speaker it was some rush gina was
actually a consultant clinical
oncologist from Edinburgh hospital down
the road Russia's worked for us for a
number of years I think almost five
years probably four years with our
machine learning team in the area of
medical imaging and its really applying
machine learning techniques to medical
images to you know do diagnostics for
example medical images is really
fascinating work and you this morning he
will tell us more about what this is
about Thank You Raj thanks scarlet so
it's a it's a real pleasure to be here
today and to meet some of you yesterday
yesterday evening at the dinner and
having a look at the posters I can see
there's a real diverse range of subjects
that you're doing some of you have
posters that are very much related to
some of the things I'm going to talk
about and others are doing very
innovative things but but completely
different in a completely different area
I'm going to talk to the lowest common
denominator and not assume any prior
knowledge and really the purpose of my
talk today is I suppose the scarlet
mentioned I'm a collaborator and a
consumer of some of the technologies
that have been generated by microsoft
research and I think I'm aware that when
you do a PhD you become intensely
focused in your area of interest and
sometimes it's it's not so easy to
actually see where things are going to
go where the end application is going to
be so what I'm going to tell you today
is a story all about the end of the
journey how some of these things can
actually have an impact in terms of
improving outcomes for patients so first
we'll just get over the boring stuff I
have to acknowledge all of the people
that give me money and having done that
just to go through what we're going to
talk about today so I'm talking about
computational imaging and that means
different things to different people so
I'm going to define how I'm going to use
the term for the for the next few
minutes and then talk about glioblastoma
which is the particular condition that
is my main interest clinically and
talking about imaging and how we use
imaging in glioblastoma and then to tell
you a store
Cory a serendipitous story as it happens
about an imaging technique that i came
across about 12 years ago and how we
actually looked at taking that imaging
technique and applying it to something
completely new completely different from
what hadn't been designed and my
experience of actually trying to do that
and then they're going to move slightly
from using that as an exemplar to
thinking about more generally about the
kind of ways in which we might use
imaging in slightly more imaginative
ways to help with patient treatment and
thinking about patient treatment and
then I go to kind of you know look into
my crystal ball and think about what
lies ahead and ways in which the work
that you do might be able to help us in
the clinic so the first thing is what do
I mean by computational imaging well
every time we actually generate any kind
of digital image from you know the
picture that you take on your camera to
an MRI scanner that we have in the
hospital we are of course doing some
level of compute in order to actually
generate the image and display it on
some form of screen but what I mean by
computational imaging is where you take
that original image and you do some kind
of additional processing some additional
mathematics in order to get extra
information out of the out of the image
beyond what we actually see in terms of
the actual pixels on the screen and
often that means that you have some kind
of underlying model for what you think
you're seeing in that image and you you
use the data that's coming from your
imager or scanner to inform that model
and I very strong believer in the fact
that you can use models to encode
understanding of a particular process
that's going on and in biology that's
very helpful so this might look like a
normal MRI scan of a patient that's got
a brain tumor actually it's a model it's
it's a model of our understanding of the
patient's brain tumor because if i said
to you well let's look at this area here
where the edge of the tumor and the way
that it spreads into the normal brain is
rather indistinct that actually forms
the basis of a model I mean what we have
an understanding that we can see this
tumor because when we give an injection
of something to the patient it gets
taken up by the tumor and that's what
causes
signal to appear and we know yes oh yeah
and we know that roughly speaking the
edge of where we can see the tumor there
are about five thousand tumor cells in
every millimeter or every voxel on this
actual image so already we have a kind
of conceptual model of what it is what
biological process actually allows us to
see this image sometimes the models we
use are quite sophisticated and this is
a model where we're looking at blood
flow in different parts of the brain
this one's actually been used in a
patient that you can see there's a big
area here of the brain that's not being
not receiving a blood supply because the
patients actually had rather a large
stroke and again we have an underlying
biomechanical model for understanding
what happens if we inject something into
the patient's bloodstream that shows up
on a scanner and gradually moves all
around your circulation and goes to all
of the different parts of the body and
then eventually your kidneys start
getting rid of it and it gets actually
eliminated from the circulation so we
can build that into a what we call a
vascular arterial model that actually
allows us to interpret an image like
this and turn it into something more
more useful so I suppose my passion is
in this particular disease called
glioblastoma and it's the link between
these very gifted people george gershwin
the famous concert pianist robert moog
so if you're interested if you're into
your electronic music he was the
inventor of the modern electronic
synthesizer Teddy Kennedy who died
recently and Mary Shelley the author of
Frankenstein we believe died of a
glioblastoma it's a terrible disease
because it's responsible for more years
of life loss than any other common adult
cancer what that means is that it
strikes earlier in life where most
cancers tend to occur later in life and
it's almost invariably fatal so that
once you get it your prognosis is not
good and the problem about it is that as
a tumor it's very heterogeneous
different parts of the tumor look very
very different and we can see here this
is a microscope slide looking at the
tumor at fairly low power
and you get the sense that the
architecture of the tumor here is very
different to the architecture of the
tumor here and what that means is that
we can see very different behavior in
different parts of the brain where the
tumor is spreading and the trouble about
glioblastoma is that it uses the
connections between different parts of
the brain to actually travel and this
particular patient had a tumor starting
in this side of the brain and it's used
the cabling that joins the left and
right hemispheres of the brain which are
effectively parallel processing units
it's used that bridge to actually get
over to the other side of the brain and
the consequences for this particular
patient are very severe it results in
loss of personality it robs that patient
from their family of who they actually
are so I spend my time focusing on
trying to treat this to tumor and what
we know is that if we actually look at
the tumor cells and take them out and
put them into a dish and if we give
increasing doses of radiation and look
at how many of the tumor cells survive
if we give either radiation on its own
or radiation in combination with drugs
we can actually kill most of these cells
but if we then look at this curve which
is the survival of real patients and
what we see here is time in days since
they were diagnosed with the illness and
this is the proportion of patients who
remain alive most of the patients
unfortunately half of them are surviving
about a year you can see it's only a
small group of patients around about 8%
that will actually survive out beyond
three to five years and the problem is
is that although we can do this in a
petri dish we just can't give enough
radiation to kill the tumor without
killing the patient the collateral
damage from radiation therapy is just
too high and so that got me thinking
well wouldn't it be nice if we could
tell what type of tumor you had whether
you had a stay-at-home tumor or a
traveling tumor because from experience
we kind of get the feeling that
different patients behave in different
ways
so a stay-at-home tumor is a tumor that
tends to just grow in one place often
stay at home tumors grow very very fast
indeed but they will just grow in one
place where as a traveling tumor like
this starts from one place and spreads
out into different areas of the brain
and if we had a way of knowing whether
you were going to have a stay-at-home
tumor or traveling tumor we might think
about different ways of treating it
because here if the tumor stays in one
place I can up the radiation dose quite
safely to that area whereas here where
the tumor is traveling we might think we
need to use something else something
that's going to go all the way through
the body and the brain and attack the
tumor cells wherever it may go and this
was where as it happens just like last
night I was at a very nice dinner at a
college was actually at christ's college
where i sat next to a consultant
radiologist and we got talking about
what we did and he showed me an image
like this which really changed my life
I'd never seen an image like this before
this image which we now see in color is
what's called a diffusion tensor image
and what it does is to actually use an
MRI scanner to map out the big pathways
the cabling that join different parts of
the brain that's why it doesn't look
like a normal brain scan but actually if
you look compare it with a cross section
of the brain taken at post-mortem you
can see how beautifully the image
reproduces all of the cabling that joins
the different parts of the brain
together the color basically is by
taking the image and encoding the
direction so that we see cables that
tend to run from front to back a blue
the cables that tend to run across a red
and cables that run in and out of the
plane of the imager are in green saree
the green and the blue have got the
wrong way around so the green is running
back to front and the blue is running in
and out and perpendicular to the image
and I thought wow that's amazing to
actually be able to see inside a
patient's brain and image the
connectivity of the different parts of
the brain without having to actually cut
the head open that's pretty pretty
fantastic
ascent we got thinking okay well you
know maybe we could use this for
something else it was originally
developed to look at stroke but we
thought well maybe we could use it to
look at how tumors spread through the
brain and this was our thinking we know
that the image that was created is
produced by imaging how water spreads
through the brain and water spreads
through the brain following channels
that actually exist sir and it's a bit
like the principle of a thatched roof on
a house so a thatched roof keeps the
house warm and dry and you say well why
is that all you've got is a whole set of
reeds of the thatch actually lied lying
on top of each other and the reason is
is that when water falls on top of the
thatch there's a natural direction that
the water is channeled that takes the
water off the roof and to drop down onto
the side and that's exactly the same as
the images that we were seeing on the
diffusion tensor scan what we were
seeing is that we see these fibers this
cabling that joins different parts of
the brain together and water simply
flows along these cables so we said well
maybe if a cable has got a bit of tumor
in it maybe the water doesn't flow in
the right way maybe we can see something
about the way that the water flows and
we imaged one of our first patients here
that had had a tumor removed from this
part of the brain and everything looked
really normal on their initial imaging
you can see everything looks pretty
clear at this point we did the diffusion
tensor image and what we saw basically
was that in this part of the cabling
moving it from one side of the brain to
the other there were little holes in the
cable where the water was not diffusing
in the normal pattern that it did and
sure enough when we imaged the patient
later we saw that the tumor had come
back and it had come back in exactly the
place that had been predicted by the
diffusion tensor image so we thought
right we might be onto something here
the difficulty was that they actually
dealing with the image data was quite
difficult the water diffusion tensor
isn't just a standard gray scale map we
had six vet scalars to deal with for
each voxel so we had a difficulty of how
to get that data into our systems for
planning radiotherapy treat
and so that became my project
effectively was working at how to do
that at the time we work with an
engineer and he said all we're familiar
with this type of problem of dealing
with the tensor image data and he
introduced us to a technique principal
component analysis that allowed us to
try and analyze this data in more subtle
ways to pick up these changes in
patients that didn't have such dramatic
changes and so that what we were able to
do was to then start building areas
around the tumor that we could see that
might represent areas of microscopic
disease that were at risk of a tumor
spreading into them and I looked at that
and I thought now I can use that because
I can use that as a target for radiation
therapy now before we proceeded with
doing this before we actually changed
what do we do to a patient we had to
know that our hypothesis was true and I
worked with the colleagues Stephen
prices at a neurosurgeon who's also
interested in imaging and he did a very
important study what he did was to take
parts of the brain that we could see on
this new image that looked as if they
might be abnormal and actually take a
little needle biopsy and find out what
that area looked like and what we found
basically was that our technique was
extremely good at picking out tumor
beyond that that you could see on a
normal scan and we had very very good
sensitivity and specificity of our
technique so this was our light bulb
moment we knew now that we had something
that we could actually use to change
therapy and this is when i created my
first study where i started using this
information to actually change that
we're way that we treated patients so
when I planned this patient's
radiotherapy normally I'd have treated
the area of the brain where the tumor
was and added a little bit of margin but
now what we're doing is encompassing the
area where the tumor where it looked as
if there was a higher risk that the
tumor may spread in that way and because
in the past we did the radiotherapy
blind we used to take the area where the
tumor SAT and add a generous margin for
the fact that the tumor may spread into
surrounding brain because we had no idea
where it might go so we had to cover all
possible avenues of spread that meant
but we treat
a large area of the brain and if you
remember earlier the problem with
radiation therapy is that the toxicity
of the treatment to the healthy brain
limits how much we can give so what I
was able to do is to say well we don't
need to do that because our imaging is
telling us that this is the area that
we're really worried about the tumor is
unlikely to spread this way so let's
just treat this bit because I was
treating a smaller area of brain I could
up the dose safely and eventually that
moved forward into an actual clinical
trial of using this technique where we
looked at the information from the image
and we used it to increase the dose in
patients where we could safely and now
we were starting to see interesting
things this was the survival curve for
patients treated in the normal way and
this is the survival curve for patients
actually treated using this optimization
so that you can see that in the
long-term patients actually had better
survival by using this information not a
dramatic change as we would have liked
as i would have liked but still moving
in the right direction but what the
technique was really really good at was
actually working out when i when you
first sat down with the patient in front
of you how they might do and if you look
at where the patients had stay at home
tumors medium tumors or very very
spreading tumors you can see that the
survival the shape of the survival was
very different basically depending on
how we categorize their tumor using the
image so whilst we weren't necessarily
able to use the imaging to really change
the patient's treatment as much as we'd
have liked in terms of improving
survival what we were able to do is to
use the image to actually predict how
the patient might do and that's very
helpful in terms of thinking about how
you're going to treat the patient
subsequently after they've had their
radiation therapy
so it used to take ages to do all of
this everything was had to be done by
hand manual it used to take me a week to
actually do all of all of the processing
in order to get one patient scans all
the way through to a radiotherapy
treatment but there's one of the nice
things of working with physics based
technologies is that things accelerate
and by 2007 most hospitals actually had
scanners that could actually do this
type of imaging just by pressing a
button and the workflow got a lot
quicker and it got to the point where it
only took me about an hour to actually
do all of these calculations and then I
thought well it's time to start doing
something interesting with this and if
you remember I said I strongly believe
that you can use models to encode your
knowledge so I thought I should build a
model and that's what I did I started
out building a very very simple
reaction-diffusion based model and what
that did was to actually look at
modeling the flow of water through the
brain and look and see whether if you
could take individual tumor cells and
allow them to spread in a way that
mirrored the way that water might spread
through the brain you could calculate
thousands and thousands of different
trajectories for how the tumor might
spread from where it was and if you put
all of that information together and
some over thousands and thousands of
trajectories you end up with something
like this a heat map or a probabilistic
map to say how likely it is to see
tumors spreading to different parts of
the brain you see and this for me was
fascinating because the substrate for
this model is a real patients can yeah
so we're taking our knowledge about what
we know about how water spreads through
that patient's brain making an inference
about how tumor might spread through the
patient's brain and generating some
simulations of chima spread in a real
patient really really nice stuff but
just took me an awful long time to do
that kind of thing now Henry Ford I
suppose is credited with making the
motorcar commercially viable and at the
time he was supposed to have said this
if I'd asked people what they wanted
they would have said faster horses
people were not ready for the power
I'm shift of understanding what an
internal combustion engine could do and
having a motorized vehicle at the time
and I guess we're kind of sitting on
that precipice really that we have very
sophisticated imaging that we can do we
can image patients in lots of different
ways but effectively at the moment we're
just building faster horses yeah
scanners get faster and faster more and
more precise the spatial resolution of
our imaging is increasing but I'm
interested in building the motor car I
love playing Falls or any of the guys
work here would know I'm complete for
than up and so you know that's what I
want to do is I want to build a motor
car and the problem with this is that we
can make the models we can make our
biological models and understand encode
what we know about biology but we need
to put in an awful lot of initial
conditions into these models if we're
going to deal with we're going to
produce interesting hypotheses and we
need to get image data at lots of
different levels we might leave
microscopy data looking at how the tumor
actually looks like in high power under
the microscope right need to use
additional information from other
techniques where we stained their
material and get extra information we
might need to drill down to the
underlying DNA the gene expression of
the tumor and we need to be able to do
this for lots and lots of patients and
we need to be able to do it fast so that
we can actually take the data and put it
into a model and start making inferences
quickly perhaps whilst the patients
actually SAT with us and we kind of know
this is a big data problem big data as
this trendy phase particularly at the
moment in universities because everyone
things that we should be doing it and I
suppose the real delight for me is being
able to take baby steps along that
process with some of the people that
I've collaborated with here and I'm just
going to show you very briefly some of
the things that that we have done in
terms of accelerating the way in which
we process that the first thing that I
wanted to do was to be able to actually
look at different areas of the tuber in
hundreds of scans and use that
information about how far the tumor had
spread what different characteristics of
the tumor was
because remember I said that it looks
very different from one part of the
brain to the other and if I if I've got
a data set of let's say 350 patients I
wanted to be able to process every
single patient scan every at every point
in time and take all of that data and
the problem with that is actually it
just takes a long time to actually mark
out the areas of the tumor and so with
van Tony acrimony see we first developed
this machine learning algorithm that
could do exactly that and as a result of
developing that algorithm actually we
submitted it to one of the challenges
that Mekhi and because we had such good
data going into it and we work really
hard on annotating the clinical
imitating that we put in we were able to
train our model very well and it
actually won the challenge in that in
that particular year but it means that
we have a tool that can actually do this
kind of segmentation of a brain tumor
which is a difficult thing to do
automatically there are lots of
algorithms that will segment normal
human anatomy in other words structures
that the computer is likely to expect it
knows to look for two kidneys heart to
liver but it doesn't know anything about
a brain tumor sitting in the normal
brain I think you'll have seen a demo
about this yesterday lies tools so for
me that that's amazing also have on a
practical note this is what I have to do
every day for radiotherapy I have to
mark out the areas that we're going to
treat and for a brain tumor patient it
normally takes about an hour and the
first time I got geo's which is the
manual segmentation tool that we use to
develop the machine learning algorithm
and I saw that I could do it in seconds
I nearly wept I mean it was just to see
that kind of work for acceleration it's
just tremendous so moving from this
length scale of the patient of the scan
down to the individual tumor and how it
actually forms I've done worked with
jasmine Fisher and using the her
experience from systems biology in
particularly using the sort of
executable biology type code that she
has an f-sharp to develop this and this
is basically a virtual petry dish it's a
tumor growing out in a petri dish and as
the tumor gets larger we see real
processes happening we see the center of
the tumor dying for lack
of nutrients and and we see the tumor
periphery ting around the edge we're
able to populate this tumor with certain
tumor stem cells these are thought to be
the cells that can actually produce all
of the elements of the tumor and for me
the really interesting thing is having
got them what the model to behave in a
reasonably realistic way is that we can
perturb it we can give doses of
radiation and watch what happens to the
tumors the tumor cells die and then
recover again and die and recover again
and for me this is very very nice
because we have a wealth of information
about this type of thing in what's
called radiation biology going back 40
50 years so to actually be able to tune
our model to that observed data means
that we can then start doing interesting
things and start asking interesting
questions of that model one of the
things that I've been doing recently
with da Kazuki is looking at the
pathology specimens that we get from
patients with brain tumors and we get
hundreds and hundreds of slides we we
have about we see about 500 patients
with glioblastoma every year in our
Center and one of the things that we
want to do because we're always
interested in the fact that the tumor
looks very different from one part to
the other is just to see how fast it's
growing in one part of the tumor
compared to the other and we have these
staining techniques that basically label
a cell that is growing again which is
the brown cells against the blue cells
which are the ones that are just resting
sleeping and we know very clearly that
the more cells that are actually growing
at a point in time the worse the outcome
for the patient and we use that
information clinically for our collared
for our colleagues in neuropathology
they basically sit there in a darkened
room with a considerable number of cups
of coffee I should think with a clicker
and they basically have to go through as
many of these slides as they can and
click each time they see a normal cell
and click each time they see a cell
that's dividing and then we get that
information that's disgusting we had and
they have to do that for every single
patient that we see and we make a plan
for in our in our Museum and the thing
about this is that darker has just
recently implement
and for what was him he described his
rather a simple machine learning
application he said it wasn't hard to do
but actually it was able to annotate
every single cell in this slide in about
two seconds you know and when you think
about it from the pathologist point of
view that's just amazing you know and it
may be perhaps looking forwards for you
in your phd's that you will go on and
develop very nice esoteric concepts as
the outputs of your thesis that get you
get you through but sometimes actually
it's it's kind of the more naughty
simple ends of the application that of
your work that actually had the greatest
impact and that might be an example of
that last summer we were very fortunate
to have Dahlia Daniel Alexander visiting
who's a NIMH a'junk scientist from UCL
is easier and I was talking to him about
my interest in DTI and he said you did
all this amazing stuff about how DT I
can show you how the tumor is actually
spreading when a patient first presents
with a brain tumor you then did all this
radiation therapy and you then didn't do
any more DTI why and I said well I did
try but the problem is is that once i
give the radiotherapy radiotherapy in
any part of the body causes swelling
swelling is just water redeemer too much
water in the tissue that shouldn't be
there and of course because DTI in my
understanding was a water-based signal
it was trying to visualize how water
flows I had basically just disrupted all
of my signal by the radiotherapy and so
the images that I had in my patients
they didn't really make any sense we
couldn't get any useful data out of it
when he introduced me to this technique
which is effectively it's a
computational model of the micro micro
structure of the brain and it tackles
the problem in Reverse by identifying
the underlying micro structure of the
normal brain that you expect and then
taking the information that you get from
the image and then layering it on to
that rather than the other way around
and the nice thing about it is that it
allows you to see structural changes in
the brain that might be the effect of
the actual treatment itself and separate
them from
so it's structural change in the brain
that might be caused by the tumor and
separate them from the swelling and the
changes that we caused from the
treatment so that's a really exciting
possibility that we have a game kind of
coming out of all of this so moving
forwards what do I really want what I
want effectively is like a flight
simulator in the sense that we know that
pilots that are going to take us to our
various destinations after the meeting
us are able to do that safely because
they log up hundreds of hours running
simulation scenarios on equipment that
allows them to suspend their disbelief
and believe they're doing the job for
real and I don't want a flight simulator
I want what's been termed an unco
simulator where I'm able to take
information about the patient's tumor
and anatomy at the microscopic scale and
the macroscopic scale and start to make
simulations of possible treatment
outcomes for that particular patient and
for me that's the driver for doing all
of this quantitative imaging you know in
healthcare we are generating terabytes
of information data at the moment and
it's largely being processed analyzed
annotated and thrown away and I think
that being able to do something like
this would be tremendous and I think for
me this is one of the things that I find
kind of slightly saddening is that image
processing in of itself is potentially a
disruptive technology disruptive I mean
in the sense that it changes the way
that we think about a process or
procedures relating to a process and
some of those applications have quite
significant demands or in on information
governance personal security but if you
look at this you know we've got
different applications fingerprint
scanners iris recognition at the
airports automatic number plate
recognition even in your camera if
you've got a modern camera you have
automatic face detection to help with
focusing of course the Kinect system
which was developed here and even things
like oculus VR which is now being rolled
out into a lot of applications beyond
gaming these all rely basically
on image processing and what's nice is
that we kind of accept that on a society
level that some of these things are
really quite intrusive on our privacy
like a NPR like you know fingerprint and
iris detection but we accept them
because there is a greater good for
personal security if you're traveling on
an aeroplane it's quite reassuring to
have the biometrics to know that the
people on the plane are likely to be the
people that they think are on the plane
and so we accept it but somehow in
healthcare that hasn't happened and the
idea of actually going on and using
image processing from patients cans
hasn't really made that transition and
to me that seems a real shame one of the
things i actually did last year was to
create a database where patients could
actually voluntarily donate their images
so we would go to patients and say
you've had treatment for a cancer and
would you mind donating all of the
images that are actually created as a
result of your treatment and follow-up
and once or twice when i talk to
patients about this they get cross and
they say i didn't sit there on your
scanner being uncomfortable for an hour
for you to then throw away all the data
i thought you were doing this anyway and
when i explained the information
governments as it stands means that I
can't do that I can't take that data and
use it in this way without explicit
permission or without creating a
research study you know they feel very
saddened and I think that a lot of the
very brightest people in image
processing domains across the board tend
to shy away from looking at medical
applications why because they have a
good idea I think I could try this and
they then have to spend six months
getting hold of that all of the
permissions to actually get some data to
actually do some analysis and for many
people they just think you know what I
can't be bothered it's just too much
hard work and for me that's a real shame
because I want the people that have
developed oculus VR and the people that
develop connect to actually come and
help us with the real problems that we
face because at the end of day it's only
people's lives at stake so it's a
slightly glib comment but just something
to leave you with to kind of think about
so I'd like to finish just by
acknowledging all the facts so all of
the people that I've had as
collaborators and what's delightful as
you can see that the list from my own
institution is nearly as long as the
list for microsoft research together
with some other other collaborators that
I've had so I'll stop now thanks for
listening and I'm quite happy to take
any questions that yeah thank you very
much rush I've seen rush talk now
several times and this a similar form
and it's still absolutely fascinated by
it and I'm sure you feel the same so we
have some time for questions now
actually we've made made up some some
good time because we've got quite an
agenda ahead of us but we do have about
10 minutes for questions so any
questions from the audience i preciate
your segmentation you're mentioning some
deeper than just eight percent
sensitivity or so but if you take
offender studios right you take one
biopsy from the brain to do that but
it's hard for me to see how can you say
about this validation because if you're
predicting the edge of the tumor I
assume that you will then really have to
take multiple samples along the edge to
be able to do any calculations of
accuracy so how does that actually work
LOL spot-on so the way that it works
basically is we had to work out a way of
doing the validation without petting the
patient at extra risk and what we did
was that we the patients had to have a
biopsy to find out what their tumor was
that's the underlying reason but the
process meant that a needle had to go
all the way through some normal brain in
order to get to the tumor and find a
biopsy and what we got permission to do
from ethics was instead of just going in
taking that biopsy and coming out was
that once having made that path we then
took multiple biopsies so we move from
what we knew to be tumor to what we knew
to be normal tissue and so for each
patient we had I think was between 12
and 18 biopsies taken along that path so
you're right it's not it's not a single
biopsy that says you know the biopsy
says this the scan says
and doing multiple birthdays for the
patient is love I mean green hair
doesn't have so he doesn't feel pain but
is it off no discomfort no well actually
there are no pain receptors in the brain
the pain receptors are on the lining of
the brain and on the skull yeah and so
actually when you get it when you get a
headache from things happening within
the brain it's actually coming from the
lining of the brain on the brain itself
practice the big multiple web sees in
the diesel engine or you wouldn't
normally unless there was some reason
that you were interested but perhaps two
parts of the tumor looked very different
and I think the key thing that we were
able to say we had to get ethical
clearance to do this basically and the
key thing is that the risk to taking
multiple biopsies on one path is the
same as the risk of taking one biopsy on
one part and that's why they said that
we could do it we were we were lucky
from that point of view other questions
for rice yeah I thanks for the brilliant
talk you were yeah well you're
mentioning sort of all your
collaborations here and a few slides
earlier you mentioned that one of sort
of the most significant contributions
was to sort of speed up the work flow
through what seemed from microsoft
research perspective a really simple
thing so my question is sort of how
difficult it is it to do these types of
collaborations where yeah you might end
up getting sort of vastly improved
workflow but Microsoft that doesn't
really push sort of the frontiers of
computer science research and the same
thing that yeah something that might
sort of push computer science research
might actually not have that big of an
outcome for patients or might never get
past sort of I arbys that if you could
sort of comment on the tension there I I
think that's very perceptive question
that there has to be a quid pro quo in
that there is something interesting from
both sides and what normally happens is
that we have a discussion around or a
particular problem and we look at the
data and there have been times
where you know we we just kind of kicked
something out because we realized well
it's not going to be of sufficient
interest you know to actually develop
but what we've been fortunate on is that
generally in a particular problem there
might be a cardinal goal developing the
new algorithm proving you know
best-in-class type output and there
might be some low-hanging fruit that we
get along the way and generally that's
been the way that we've kind of looked
at this Sadako's code actually was
originally developed for segmenting
breast cancer cells for a particular
global challenge and so when we look to
that together and we were having some
issues you know talking about that
particular thing and then I said well
why don't we try it for a brain tumor
cells and so often that's the way that
things work out and and it's now nice
that we have a sufficiently close
collaboration that we can actually do
that you know that we understand each
other's you know needs and desires to
actually say okay well yeah you know
that's that's a very much an
implementation step but we want an
innovation step to go you know to keep
this project going so I think so yeah I
mean we've you know we've been lucky in
that way i guess but i also know folks
on the researchers here and the machine
learning group who've worked on the on
the glass tool so i've had i've heard
feedback that the application to medical
images actually then improved for
example the work on connect so it's a
really important application domain that
does advance other parts of machine
learning too so there was a one perhaps
easy example that darko had but i think
there were many many studies in the past
were really the medical images advanced
our research greatly any other questions
frosh yeah
in a house two more in this traveling
cool so your wrist and the likelihood
that it will be a traveling tomorrow
does it it does not only depend on how
close it is to the water channels but
also brought in the specifics only two
more itself like which genes were dating
etc so can you give any insight of the
life of these actors which one is the
more important important for the decide
whether it is a Miss traveling to more
not like a suggests its location or
mostly or is it impact the specifics of
the genetics of the two more it is
pretty much a balance of the two it is
the you know I mean you can have a you
can have a traveling tumor by genotype
which phenotypically sits in a poorly
connected part of the brain and it will
behave like a stay-at-home tumor so it's
you really have to understand the two
and that's one of the nice things now is
that you know with with tissue
microarray we we can start building up
profiles of what are the genetic
fingerprints if you like that go with
the traveling type of tumor and then try
and correlate that you know with what we
have on the on the imaging side of
things but you you're right you you need
both bits of that information really to
be able to kind of you know populate a
model if you're going to try and predict
this those are just as important like
the location and the genetical that's
right that's right and I think what's
really fascinating is that we can't
change the structure of the brain or the
connectivity where the tumor arises but
if we can identify a patient where the
connectivity is of a concern and the
expression of the tumor is one that is
going to travel there are now
potentially some drug therapies that
what they do is that they don't stop the
tumor from growing but what they do do
is to stop them from traveling
effectively they kind of rub their shoes
they stop them from expressing the
adhesion molecules that allow them to
spread and move along the white matter
tracks and so it's doing things like
that where we can actually start to be
much more specific in terms of thinking
from what we know from our model of this
patients we can change the way that we
do the therapy so that we might for
example
of them you know an infiltration
inhibitor first treat them with that and
then once we've got all of the coral
doll of the tumor cells in one place
then I come in and do the radiation
therapy it's a it's a biological agent
basically but it's targeting that
specific process right okay posso one
more question if this any otherwise
we'll close this session move on to the
next no let's thank rush again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
