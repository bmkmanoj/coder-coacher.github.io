hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
all right everyone thank you so much for
coming it is my great pleasure to
introduce today charlie jane anders who
was introducing her very first book all
the birds in the sky as part of the
microsoft research visiting speaker
series i've had the great pleasure of
knowing Charlie for I guess over a
decade now as part of her work on a
reading series called writers with
drinks which happens every month in the
Bay Area and brings the best people for
writing and the best people for reading
and Charlie's fantastic narration which
completely twists the fabric reality
every single time I see it this series
your narration is so good everyone
should buy a plane ticket today right
now to go to the make-out room on
februari 13th and if you can't make it
you should hire someone to go to it and
Skype you in haha i have so charlie is
here today to tell us about what she's
learned combining fantasy and fiction
charlie is also the recipient of
numerous awards most notably the 2012
hugo award or her novel at six months
three days which has been optioned as a
possible series by NBC and this is just
a fantastic opportunity here from an
emerging master of this craft i'm so
happy to be here here Charlie thank you
yay thank you thank you so much I'm so
glad that you could make it day if it's
so great to see you and it's so great to
see all of you guys it's so this is such
a great event I'm really so thrilled and
honored to be here and so basically the
title of my talk is how to avoid
creating a genre mashup at all costs
because I just did it on a mash-up
called sick all the birds in the sky and
so I'm like here to tell you why John or
mashups are terrible you should never do
them they're awful just avoid at all
costs um so you know basically why do I
think that ok so backing up a little bit
genre mashups are basically everywhere
in pop culture right now you know you
have adventure time which is
post-apocalyptic fairy tale with aliens
and robots and wizards and you know
candy people and just also
it's of other stuff and it's like every
genre squished together you know then
you have firefly which is like a Western
that takes place in outer space with
like all these western tropes but also
lots of space stuff and you know
spaceship action and stuff and you know
it's very where's the Western thing and
its sleeve with the music and the kind
of you know the way they talk and
everything and you know then there's a
Western in space with like samurai and
wizards and fairy tales and World War
two battles and you know a million other
things all just like smooshed into like
one giant lump and so you know and
actually if you look at it like that
Sean are mashups are everywhere but
sometimes what doesn't work is if you
have a genre mashup that's like you know
to kind of in-your-face about being a
genre mashup and that where that's kind
of the point like case in point here was
something where people just could not
quite wrap their minds around you know
cowboys and aliens it sounded really
goofy it was trying to be a really
serious western with aliens and it you
know it was trying to like really
combine these genres and it really kind
of in-your-face way and it just the
general consensus was that it didn't
quite hold water or hold whatever you
want to hold in a western sand I guess I
don't know and so you know that's that
that can be embarrassing that a genre
mashup doesn't work and i personally
long before all the birds in the sky
came out I started getting kind of
identified or pigeon-holed as someone
who does genre mashups because for
example this story was in the magazine
of fantasy and science fiction it's
called um Oh God it's called palm
strikes last case and it's a story about
a superhero who decides to go help
colonizing other planets he's like a
dark urban grid evil a vigilante
superhero who strikes fear into the
hearts of criminals and then he goes off
to another planet to help them colonize
and they're having issues of food
scarcity and their farming their farms
are failing and he has to like you know
help them out as like a agriculture
experts so it's like you know your
standard superhero agriculture expert
story you know like you do and so that
was sort of a genre shop and he also
fights crime on
the other planet so there's a steep he
keeps being a superhero too and then you
know I did this one which was as good as
new which was basically takes place in a
post-apocalyptic world where the human
race has been pretty much wiped out but
then the main character finds a genie in
a bottle which I thought was just logic
I mean if you think about it you know if
a genie is in a bottle the bottles can
be probably indestructible like nothing
will damage that bottle no matter what
even the apocalypse and if it's hidden
somewhere its hiding place is going to
be reduced to rubble by whatever causes
the apocalypse therefore your chances of
finding a genie in the bottle actually
increased massively after the apocalypse
it's just logic I didn't even think of
it as a genre mashup but it kind of is
and so I was kind of getting people were
describing me as someone who does Jon or
mashups and then I was already doing
this book which is basically um you know
it's about sort of combining science
fiction and fantasy and it's basically
you know it's about a mad scientist and
a witch who made up as children in like
junior high school and they survived the
hell of junior high school together and
kind of get through some really awful
hairy stuff and then it jumps ahead and
they're adults and they're living in San
Francisco and they're having like
adventures as grown-ups and it's very
much about magic meets science and about
like you know some of the kind of basic
stuff of fantasy and science fiction
like them the kind of mystery of magic
and the kind of like you know the
technology and science and discovery of
science and so it's about those two
things coming together but you know
writing that book was what made me think
doing a genre mashup was was not a great
idea so I started out with this idea
that I was just going to take all the
genre tropes and just smush them
together so like there was any dragons I
guess this is Narnia there was gonna be
dragons and elves and spell books and
you know runes like further my which
character there's to be every Matt
fantasy thing I could think of theirs
give me like an evil wizard who's gonna
biscay Voldemort kind of there was going
to be all this stuff there was going to
be gnomes and goblins and just every
fantasy thing
just kind of popping up all over the
place and like kind of playing with all
the expectations of the genre and you
know you have your your science fiction
character you've got giant robots you've
got aliens you've got monsters dinosaurs
you know spaceships everything you can
possibly think of just like every wacky
sci-fi trope all kind of popping up in
all of the kind of sci-fi explanation
expectations all kind of manifesting
themselves but okay so there are a few
problems with with doing that with like
having you know with just putting all
the tropes together one of the problems
you run into is that things start to
kind of blur together like you put an
elfin an alien next to each other unless
you're really careful the elf is kind of
an alien kind of like this is kes from
Star Trek Voyager she's an elf she's an
alien she's both you know kind of um I
don't know so like you and you know
Elvis are kind of aliens dragons are
kind of dinosaurs like a little bit like
unless you're really careful to
differentiate them and explain and
really get into why they're not the same
thing you know functionally they're
often the same thing in genre fiction
they fulfill the same function they have
a lot of the same attributes dragons can
sometimes talk I guess dinosaurs
occasionally can talk to but we won't
get into that but you know so once you
just start blowing things out and just
throwing in all the tropes it just
becomes like it doesn't have lots of
sparkly contrast so it actually becomes
just like mush it just kind of doesn't
differentiate at all plus it turns into
sorry that's kind of blurry this is
hardware wars I should have gotten a
picture of spaceballs because that's
probably there's probably more high res
pictures of space balls but this is
hardware wars which is a star wars spoof
and so the other problem with like just
playing with all the genre tropes and
consciously remix is what I'm really
talking about remix Ingush on wrist off
so that it's all like smushed together
and happening all at the same time and
you're playing with all the different
things that people expect from the two
different genres you end it with
something it's a spoof you end up with
something that's like kind of making fun
of it and like playing to your
expectations but then maybe subverting
them or kind of poking fun at them and
just you know kind of it's it's it's
more of a pastiche I guess it's more of
a self-mocking thing and you know with
my with my novel
originally I had thought of it as being
sort of like mad scientist verses which
and again i apologize i made these
slides late at night and like I suck at
making slides so I apologize for the
ugly slides but mad scientist verses
which and they were gonna be like
enemies or something they were going to
be rivals maybe they both want something
and that only one of them can have and
so they're just like constantly fighting
each other and one-upping each other
like you know the witch casts a spell
and the mad scientist fires a ray gun
and they're like having a duel on like a
flying carpet and like a flying car I
don't know just or like a rocket car I
don't know just like have like them be
like rivals and have it just be like a
zany like that was my original idea was
that they were gonna be rivals and it
was gonna be them kind of at odds kind
of trying to like to feed each other and
it was that was a cute idea and it was
like could be really funny and you could
get in a lot of like zany ideas but you
know I got more interested in the
characters of my mad scientist in my
witch and developing their relationship
and what it is that brings them together
rather than like just having them in
conflict the entire time and meanwhile I
started to think about like you know so
you have this these characters who are
like a science fiction archetype and a
fantasy archetype and they're connected
to huge like massive stuff like
starships and galaxies and you know huge
magic like traditions and like spell
books and dragons and everything but
what's more interesting than like the
huge horizons that you can like connect
to them is actually their limitations in
this picture of Dumbledore because
that's what I thought of when I thought
of limitations cuz there's a lot that
Dumbledore actually cannot do for
various reasons which is why her he
always just like is like Harry go do
everything I can't do anything but um
what's more interesting is almost always
the limitations and like what can't the
witch do what can't the mad scientist do
what are they unable to access what's
not available to them is much more
interesting than just like they can have
everything like that's just boring after
a while and like it's much more
interesting to explore like what what
can the witch not do that the mad
scientist maybe can or vice versa or you
know what can neither of them do or what
can they both do in different ways but
neither of them can quite do it the way
they want to be able to do it it's like
limits
patients are always more interesting
than just like unlimited vistas and the
more you just start being like I'm just
going to explore every genre trope and
remix them and play with them you know I
mean I'm always amazed by adventure time
because they that show has like
everything in it but it still doesn't
ever feel like things are just
ridiculously easy even though they could
just like call up Ice King every week
and be like ice king comes solve this
for us but that would probably screw
things up in some other way so so
basically on the other thing about that
is like when you have characters from
different worlds meeting and here's a
representation of fantasy and science
fiction meeting I guess it's the Star
Trek episode catspaw where Kirk and
Spock meat sandwiches um classic classic
episode I'm sure you've all seen it many
times anyway so when you have characters
meeting from different worlds who
represent like different you know
viewpoints or different ideas you know
what's what's interesting is is seeing
their different ideas about the world
and they're different there are
different opinions and there are
different ways of looking at stuff kind
of coming together and you know having
them actually have a dialogue or you
know seeing how they they see the world
in different ways versus just like you
know either they fight or whatever and
so I get I get interested in like that's
what kind of draw me into the
relationship story originally was like
that it's actually more interesting to
see them kind of like their worldviews
coming together and and like I like a
relationship story about people who come
from different worlds or different
cultures or different backgrounds or
different ideologies where they're kind
of their kind of interaction is is you
know part of the story and this was
actually this while I was working on all
the birds in the sky I did this story
that David mentioned when he introduced
me six months three days is kind of
another thing that got me thinking about
like what's really interesting is
bringing together people from different
viewpoints or different you know ways of
seeing things six months three days is
about a about two different clairvoyants
who see the future that you both see the
future but they see it differently he
sees a fixed unchangeable future
which anything he sees absolutely will
happen and there's no changing it
there's nothing you can do the future is
set in stone for him she sees many
possible different futures and she can
actually try to choose which one she
wants to have like she can be like well
if I go over here I know this will
happen if i go over you know she can
choose different possible futures and so
it's about you know fate versus free
will um and you know predestination and
whether we can actually you know
influence our own future but it's also
it's a relationship story and part of
what was like my kind of the Eureka
moment with me for writing that was that
it was like thinking of it as more a
relationship story and less of a
philosophical conundrum and so you know
I like a relationship story where there
are two radically incompatible
viewpoints and so I wrote this and then
I started thinking of all the birds in
the sky the same way and so it became
much less about like haha can take the
fantasy trips and the sci-fi tropes and
I can like subvert remix and whatever
and much more about like well you know
how are these two different ways of
seeing things in two different ways of
thinking about the world and you know
that which brings me to my next point
which is that no matter how and this is
just like a jiff that they made for me a
tour that's like a quote from the book
um no matter how many different genres
you're drawing from no matter how many
different ideas you're pulling on into
your story it's still one story it's not
like multiple stories you know I mean
unless you're doing something really
fancy and literary where it's like
things don't intersect or whatever but
usually it's one story one world one
central axis that everything has to
revolve around and one sort of emotional
core like and you have to know what that
is like what's the core thing that
you're you're kind of dealing with in
your story and for me it was the
relationship between those two
characters but the world even though you
have like you know mad science that's
like totally out there in its own way
and then magic that like is just
completely you know unreal and doesn't
exist in our world they still have to
feel like they could actually still
exist in the same world together and
have like you know they could coexist in
the same reality and you know the thing
about having an emotional core
the story like is is super key to me
like having the stuff that makes you cry
or the stuff that like actually gets you
you know super emotionally invested and
here's like my you know standard
representation for like things that make
you cry kind of i'm david tennant in the
rain or david tennant dying or whatever
of course now of course people think
david tennant dying and they're like yes
but you know sorry because of Jessica
Jones you know a month ago people would
or like a couple months ago people have
been like oh no David Tennant dying
another like that God david tennant is
dead but you know whatever anyway so the
point is I'm time rattling but so you
know the thing that like makes you get
emotionally invested in the characters
and the thing that pulls you in and
makes you actually care about what's
going on because like you know honestly
there's two kinds of stories stories
where you care about the characters and
what's going to happen to them in
stories where you just don't and the
stories where you don't can be fun if
there's enough explosions and like funny
bits but you ideally you want to care
about the characters and be invested in
their well-being and them finding
happiness together separately you know
working out whatever is that they're
trying to work out and to me the more
you know I got fancy and sort of thought
about things in terms of genres and like
commenting on other stuff the less easy
it was to just kind of home in on that
emotional center with the character
isn't often it was like you know it's
like getting distracted by a shiny thing
it's like ooh shiny thing you know
versus like kind of staying focused on
what you're actually trying to talk
about and um you know oh yeah so you
know you can have a story about a
levitating eggplant and you know it's
awesome it's a levitating eggplant
woohoo the other eggplants don't
understand why this eggplant is
levitating and it has you know it's a
funny story or whatever but you have to
care about the eggplant you have to feel
like in some sense this is real like
even though it's just like this is Amy
weird thing it's real it's real to this
eggplant this a client cares about the
fact that it's levitating this eggplant
has feelings this eggplant has a life
and has expectations and has a history
has friends that maybe you're like
judging it for levitating and you know
this eggplant has has has had a life
that was normal or whatever for it
before it started levitating and so
that's like you know you have to have
that emotional core and you have to have
that sense that this is real this is
real for the people this is really
happening to them they don't know
they're in a story and they don't you
know they're not just funnily commenting
on everything that's happening so you
know when you think about like a genre
mashup um you think about like your
standard image is like the Hollywood
executive person being like oh it's
great it's like X meets why it's like
alien Meets The Smurfs it's eternal
sunshine of the spotless terminator it's
like you know it's just like like
cowboys and aliens is the perfect
example it's like we just take these two
things and smush them together and it's
awesome and we're gonna make it work
somehow and like you know if it can feel
really calculated if you don't if you if
if if you don't find a way to invest in
the reality of what you're dealing with
they can just feel calculated and like
you're just like trying to find two
successful things and just smush them
together and then you've got an even
more successful thing because it's twice
as successful because you anyway and so
you know that's why I'm like don't do it
on our mash up instead and here's
Sherlock Holmes vs dracula which I just
love that that exists don't do is honor
mashup instead find a way to like pull
from different genres and make one story
that pulls from whatever stuff you need
from the genres are pulling from if it
makes sense for the story you're telling
and that's sort of a you know it's sort
of a semantic distinction but to me it's
super meaningful like it's a super
meaningful distinction because it's like
you know you don't start with your
starting point as like I'm just going to
like smoosh these things together that's
going to be like the point the point is
the story and the point is like finding
a story about characters and then you
know what is what's interesting about
like getting things from different
genres because I mean I think we all
like like to pull from different genres
and like Star Wars is like the perfect
example of that and so that sounds easy
but it's it's tricky and practice to
just pull out of genres and then you
know use them in your story for whatever
you want
part of why genres are so successful is
because they come with expectations you
kind of know what to expect if you go
see a spy action movie there's going to
be a fight on a plane like they're going
to possibly on the outside of a plane
cost me on the inside of a plane but
they will fight on a plane in midair at
some point during the movie there are
probably a ticking time bomb at some
point in the movie if you go see a Star
Trek movie the enterprise will crash
into a planet at some point during the
movie you know that's just a guarantee
that's like the Star Trek guarantee we
will crash the enterprise in every movie
but you know so you have to like so you
either have to fulfill those
expectations in a meaningful way or you
have to consciously like not just get
sucked into doing what everybody expects
and you know part of why we want to
break up and remix and combine genres is
to play with expectations and subvert
them and this is a picture of the
Invisibles by this comic by written by
Grant Morrison and drawn by a bunch of
amazing URIs I think that's Brian
Bolland art um and the invisibles is
like this incredible comic that you know
is just like every genre but it's just
it's just unpredictable and completely
all over the place and fascinating and
so you know at this point it's worth
pointing out that like superheroes
basically are like the most successful
example in the universe of just pulling
every genre ever and just smashing them
all together and often turning it into
something that would be unrecognizable
to people who were fans of a particular
genre like you know if you think how
many genres there are in this one
picture there's like Norse mythology
there's Greek mythology there's aliens
there's nuclear mutations there's
westerns there's you know dark gritty
urban vigilantes from like the 1920s
there's like there's every possible
genre you can think of in this one
picture and yet none of these feel like
representatives of any genre other than
superheroes they're just oh it's super
heroes you know so that's kind of the
gold standard in a way for just like
stripping away all of the original stuff
from a genre and just like being like
bloop kind of in a sense and
you know when it works superheroes are
amazing and you know the other thing is
that in addition to the emotional core
and having like a feeling of oh this is
real and I'm connecting to it and I care
about it we need playfulness and I chose
them women's for playfulness just
because i love the moments we need
playfulness we need you know a sense of
like I'm having fun with this i'm doing
i'm creating stuff and it's i'm having a
good time and I'm it's it's like
unpredictable like that's what I'd like
what I said about the Invisibles
unpredictability is like really
important to me and like a feeling of
like you know we're not just following
this path that we've been led down or
whatever so I'm a big fan of
intentionality and here's another gift
that they made of a quote from my book
and there's this one's a sticker too so
if you want stickers I've got stickers
so intentionality like people will tell
you that the author cannot understand
the meaning of their own work and that
authors just should shut up and not even
try to understand their own work and I I
hate those people those people suck
authors absolutely can't understand the
meaning of their own work they can't
necessarily know what it's going to mean
to everybody else but they can know what
it means to them and they can know what
they wanted it to mean and I think that
actually authors have kind of a
responsibility to know what they think
they're saying or to know what their
work means to them before they put it
out in the world and like there's this
whole post modern thing of like oh no no
don't try to understand what you're
writing just whatever and like I think
that it's actually really important to
ask why am I writing this what does this
mean to me and it's even more important
to do that when you are pulling
different genre elements together and
being like I'm just throwing in all this
different stuff why are you using those
elements what do they mean to you what
do they represent in your story and in
your own mind and you know what are they
about what's the point of them and you
know why are you why do you feel the
need to have them and I not sure what
this is Fantasia i'm not sure what this
was supposed to represent i think this
is the part of like what do they mean to
you and so you know instead of adding
every trope think about what you
absolutely have to have for your story
like don't just be like it's I'm having
fantasy stuff so I'm going to throw in
elves and gnomes and Dragons boo-boo you
know this was a pic
from ve Schwab's amazing amazing darker
shade of magic series which I've only
read the first book to say this is the
cover of the second book which I haven't
read yet but I'm here it's also great
and her book is just came to mind as one
that like she's very very careful about
picking just a few magic things that she
absolutely needs to have in her story
and there's like basically a nearly
extinct race of like magical people who
can travel to different alternate
universes and it's just like it's such a
beautiful story because she's so
surgical about picking just the right
elements and you know so think about
what you actually need to have you don't
need an ancient curse you don't need an
evil castle necessarily and then once
you've figured out the stuff that you is
like your must have like my novel had
aliens in it for a while and like
actually until pretty late in the
process and I had to kill my aliens like
I had to take him out back and shoot
them and I'm still sad about it they
were great but it was just one thing too
many so once you figure out what you
absolutely need to have from different
genres or from the genres you're playing
with then you have to kind of backfill
and this here's a map of fillory from
The Magicians which is a great example
of a fantasy series that lev grossman
the magicians where he has such a great
sense of history in such a great sense
of everything having like a lot of
backstory and weight to it so okay
you've got magicians um or you've got
you know witches who can use magic what
do you absolutely have to have you don't
have to have like spell books or wands
or whatever you do have to have a world
where people have known about magic for
a certain amount of time and how has
that affected the world you have to have
some sense of how they use magic how
they have used magic in the past what
the rules are maybe what the history of
magic is um you know what are the things
that everything has to be connected to
something and then ideally it's at the
end it's all connected to the real world
so if there's a gap between your thing
in the real world or if there's just
like a painted backdrop and people are
standing around talking in front of it
then you've got to fill that in and you
know it has to feel lived in it has to
feel like this is a place where people
could actually live and so in fact in
case in point my
in my novel my which goes to off to
magical high school and I was like okay
it can't just be freaking Hogwarts right
can't just like take Hogwarts and like
paint over it with like pig feet or
whatever I don't know all right you know
um you know so I had to spend i spent
hours and hours and hours thinking about
like okay what's my magical high school
like how you know not just how is it
different from hogwarts because that's
kind of a dead end too but like what
what makes sense for it to be like you
know and how does the the way that this
school is organized connect to all the
other stuff i'm coming up with about how
magic has worked in my world and like
giving it a history that actually was
logical in the world and that you know
felt built out from reality was
something that I basically sweated
bullets over and you know fingers
crossed but at least I can say with
confidence that it's not Hogwarts or
brakebills or whatever it's not it's not
any of those things it's it's it's own
thing um and you know the more the more
real all this stuff feels the more
connected to something you know with a
history and with like real world stuff
this feels then the more your characters
feel real and the more the less they
feel like ciphers and I one thing I
wrote my notes here is world-building
equals character building like if you
have a convincing world your characters
will automatically be much more
convincing as a result um so and then
you know I was talking about my which
character for my mad scientist character
you know originally I was like oh he's a
mad scientist you know goggles giant
white lab coat you know Reagan blah blah
blah he can have a layer with like
things that go or whatever unlike you
know al giant lever and all that
whatever and like you know I was like no
I mean okay you're a super genius
science geek in 2016 or actually it's by
the time he's a grown-up it's like some
years into the future it's the 2020s
you're going to be in a loft in soma
with a pinball machine you know wearing
jeans hanging out with other super geeks
like and you know if you're not going to
be in a layer you're going to be in
aloft and so just actually like four
a lot of what I do with the mad
scientist character I just completely
tossed out all of the all of the sort of
mad scientist tropes completely because
it just didn't feel real at all and the
more grounded the more kind of
conventional that was the more I could
go nuts in other ways um and and you
know he goes to MIT and you know and so
and so forth and that's that leads me to
the next point which is that so you get
a certain bang for your buck from
combining two genres or from playing
with two for two different genres
because it's like it throws you off
balance it's unexpected but you get even
maybe even more of a bang for your buck
when genre elements are in the
recognizable real world and this is a
border town i think the anthology series
that terry win dling and some other
folks did of urban fantasy like if you
have magicians and like a lot of my
novel takes place in San Francisco and
it's very much the real San Francisco
because I live there and so I know all
this stuff and it's as recognizable and
like you know down to earth and real as
I could possibly make it and so you know
you get a certain bang for your buck
from having just genre elements in a
recognizable setting in the real world
and that's just as powerful as like oh
you know blah blah blah wizards and
aliens or whatever and okay and it's
about you know it's about the friction
between the fantastical and the real
versus like the friction between two
different kinds of the fantastical and
so you know the part of part of the
process is finding as you're writing the
book or as you're creating the world or
whatever where do you get the friction
where where do things like actually
generate sparks when you put them
together as opposed to just being like
oh they're sitting next to each other
and nothing's happening and like you
know I'm basically Rae dawn Chong um
sort of in when I'm writing a stunning
I'm looking I'm looking for fire i'm
looking for whatever create sparks and
whatever makes things kind of burst into
flames and you know sometimes it's it's
surprising sometimes the things that you
expect to cause you know a lot of
excitement and like ooh i'm gonna put
these two things together and it can be
really cool and like oh that's going to
like
there's just going to automatically be
lots of excitement and then you put them
together and it's like you know at other
things that you didn't think we're going
to cause a lot of excitement putting
them together suddenly it's like oh
they're having this really interesting
just dialogue and there's like there's
like an argument or there's something
interesting going on and you know and it
just kind of you just never know you
have to kind of experiment with it and
play with it and see where things come
together in an interesting way and um
you know so the thing about
world-building I want to come back to
world building really fast is you know
the real question is what's real to your
characters and to some extent what's the
thing that they can't just like ignore
like if there's a giant freakin wall
that they can't just like oh I'm just
going to go around it or i'm just going
to like tunnel under it or whatever or
you know there's a giant frickin wall
and they have to find a way to either go
over the wall or go through the wall and
it's like you know probably know what
while this is there's a giant freakin
wall and they can't just ignore it then
that's real to them and it's important
stuff that they can ignore is stuff that
isn't important in your story basically
and so you know I by the time I got to
like my 10th like completed draft of all
the birds in the sky I was really
obsessing about like what I call sort of
connective tissue and this is like a
randomly I made while I was reading the
novel i was in longhand I've made an
emotional map of it that I don't have no
idea what this means now but it meant
signs me at the time and you know
connective tissue which is something
that I almost made this whole talk about
but I feel like I can sum it up in a
couple minutes it's just the thing of
like you know making sure that the big
emotional moments are supported by lots
and lots of little moments that lead up
to each one of them and that every
single you know step feels like it's
coming from someplace and so you know if
you're going from you know don't just
jump from A to C to D or whatever you
have to go every single if it's
something that your characters are going
through that's important you have to see
every single bit of it from their
respect perspective that's important to
them and you have to like I found that
the more I put in like little tiny
moments that you don't even notice in
between the big moments where they're
just kind of having like little
emotional connections and
little moments of kind of feeling or
noticing or talking to each other about
stuff the more the big moments felt
supported and that was something that
you know coming back to the whole genre
mashup idea I felt like um when I
started pulling out like when I started
pulling out some of this stuff where I
was like we'll have funny humorous stuff
happening and all this like ooh now
there's an alien and all this other
stuff when I cut all that stuff out
there were like holes in the book and
those holes were where I was like short
changing the characters and cheating and
not really showing how they get from
here to there and like so a lot of what
really makes it work for me is just
making sure that you are really showing
them like showing every step of their
journey so finally like genres or
toolkits and actually ever since I wrote
this talk I wrote this talk a few weeks
ago I've kind of stopped thinking of
John roses toolkits a little bit so much
but it still is a metaphor that works
for me genres our toolkits you pull out
the tools you need if you're dealing
with if you're trying to put in a screw
you don't need a hammer right genres of
toolkits you use whatever you need from
them you don't use whatever you don't
need um you know genres work for you you
don't work for them they're not your
boss they don't get to tell you what to
do they don't have any say in how
they're used at all they you can't you
can't get their feelings hurt you can
like beat them up horribly and they'll
still be your friend tomorrow I've been
incredibly sadistic you know mean
horrible relationship with several
genres for years and they're still
completely nice to me so you know just
abuse the heck out of them is what I'm
saying but as long as you are good to
your characters you can be incredibly
horrible to genres and cool thank you so
much so how are we doing for time I
could read for a bit i could do QA i
could I don't know you guys have
questions do you want to hi Karis you
know Gerald gerald Metro not do you
think to actually help a story or I kind
of restrict how the story being told
um I'm not sure I understand the
question like um you mean just like
combining genres like cause more
restrictions or you know you have a
certain genre thank you say you expects
there anything to happen right yeah you
think that actually helped the story
actually kind of restrict the story I
mean it can do both I think it really
depends on first of all how much you get
sucked into trying to fulfill or subvert
those expectations which takes up a lot
of time either way and also just like um
how much you really interrogated what
those genres are about for you like if
you are like okay I know exactly how I
want to use this and you can just use it
really surgically then I think it's
actually gives you a lot of freedom
because you've got this element that you
can just play with but if you have this
thing of like okay there's all this
stuff attached and I have to use all of
it somehow then it's much more
restrictive and that's kind of what I'm
getting out of like I guess is that you
have to be surgical about it and not get
you know sucked into just using stuff
that you don't actually want because it
comes with the package or whatever sorry
hi just cares about your writing
prostitute routine you mentioned ten
drafts that typical was so just okay the
10 drops was kind of an extreme case cuz
like basic I just kept like I i think i
would try first tried to sell it after
like the seventh or eighth draft and
then they came back you know and then i
went back and realized it again and then
i finally got an agent but then I you
want me to revise it and then the
publisher wanted me to revise it and so
there was like there was a lot of that
but I I do try to like do a ton of like
incremental drafts where I'm just like
tossing out a lot of stuff and reworking
and rethinking as I go I actually like
you you saw the like the thing I
scribbled in the notebook I write
longhand like the fur novels especially
i will write the novel in longhand first
and then come back and type it into the
computer which is like you're revising a
little bit when you do that and then
once I've done that then I just kind of
you know tear it up and put it guy
together like a whole bunch of times
just to see what I can make work kind of
believe so are you possess it over your
work hearing I haven't read six months
three days or this one but you know
hearing that there's gonna be a show
around it how how are you feeling I feel
nervous that thing changes her mind set
oh man I mean what with the six or three
days TV show and I don't even know how
much of a lot to say about that at that
point at this point but with the TV show
I mean it was a thing where I they were
really awesome smart people and like
Krysten Ritter who like just starting
jessica jones was one of the producers
and was like you know going into
meetings with these Hollywood people
like acting out the female main
character for my story and like the
pitch meetings which I wish I could see
but I just heard about it afterwards
anyway so you know that was super
exciting and but I had a lot of like I
had a lot of conversations on the phone
with Eric who was like writing the pilot
where I was like okay you know here's
what I think is going on in this story
here's how I think it should work and
then my feeling was once like he and I
had had a bunch of those conversations
and I was like okay let's do it then
after that um I was just basically done
and I was like you can call me and ask
me a question anytime you want I'm never
gonna bug you again because a it's my
sanity is super important to me and like
trying to micromanage what people are
doing hundreds of miles away when like
they know their job better than I do you
know it my turn I grade it might not
turn out great but either way me trying
to micromanage it from San Francisco is
just that's automatically not going to
turn out great for my sanity and also be
you know you have to kind of at some
point let go and just recognize that
it's not your it's not the thing that
you wrote it's somebody making something
out of the thing you wrote and that can
be really awesome like you know if I was
if I was a musician and I wrote a song
and someone covered it I would just be
so excited that someone was covering my
song like I just be like wow someone is
making something out of a thing that I
made and that's super cool and so I you
know I'm not possessive in that sense i
mean and i think you know supposedly
Elmore Leonard had this thing of like he
talked about Hollywood is like a wall
that you just like you walk up to it you
throw your book over it and they throw
money back and then you walk away and
that's how it works which I think it
really good way of looking at it but
yeah the only thing I would say is like
the one rule that
I kind of came up with his never try to
micro either have total control over
what you're doing which I can if I'm
writing a book or have zero control
don't have like half control because
then it's just gonna make you crazy like
that was my thought hi Amy there was an
online comment which is um she wanted to
say that she reads io9 everything decays
all your team does for the sci-fi
fantasy yay thanks yeah thank you so
much hey uh Milwaukee good it actually
probably that iodine just brought up
because the kind of factors into this
question so you obviously you help Ron I
or nod you do tons of basically media
analysis of other people's right work
and so you're talking especially in this
case where you kind of started with this
kind of all in the kitchen sink all this
type on all this fancy as you go through
it yo as you consume media especially as
you analyze it how difficult is it to
keep yourself from going oh wow that's
really cool i want to so put them into
my book and you obviously part of that
is just what writing is writing as you
could argue everything you do right but
how do you kind of build up that filter
where you start to understand you i
guess but i guess my question is
especially when you're writing genre
fiction how do you keep yourself
grounded instead just saying I want to
do think acts that were quiet even
though you by definition you can't do
thing x then widens you're not running
work why yeah I mean that's a really
interesting question I mean the question
is about like how whether you know
watching consuming so much science
fiction and fantasy for io9 and just
constantly obsessing about it and
analyzing it and you know writing
ill-informed rants about it and stuff
you know means that I'm just like kind
of tempted to just suck it all you know
kind of devour it all and then
regurgitate it all and I guess you know
I mean part of that is that you know we
are we one of the things that people
talk about it a lot is that the idea is
is not the ideas are easy and execution
is hard and you know it's easy to come
up with ideas that are like oh that's a
really fun idea and I really love that
idea and then you try to write it and
it's just like it's dead and like you
know I felt like I you know you have
stuff that you write that where you try
to write that is derivative or whatever
and that's often the stuff that you just
it it's do a kind of
and in fact I was blogging about this
recently like you know right before I
finished all the birds in the sky I had
another novel that I was shopping around
that was like an urban fantasy book that
was like very much in the wheelhouse of
like Sandman slim and you know the gym
butcher kind of books and I really loved
that book but I you know in the end it
was getting kind of like some people
were interested in it but I ended up
feeling like it wasn't as much mine as
well as all the birds in the sky it
wasn't like something that only i could
have written maybe and this felt like
saying only only i could have written
for better or worse like you know maybe
I'd better off with something that
someone else could have written because
that might have been better but I don't
know so that was something that I
actually thought a lot about but I think
it's partly just that you know it's not
just the writing it's the revision and
the revision is where you just have to
look at this thing that you threw
together and be like okay what the hell
is this and that's kind of the part
where you have to add mix them ask
yourself some really tough choices
questions and stuff hey hi you mentioned
during your talk that your view of
genres as being toolbox has changed
since you're starting to deliver the
talk two weeks ago yeah how how is your
thinking how has your thinking on that
evolved okay cool i actually blogged
about this on my tumblr or the other day
i have a tumblr now for all the birds in
the sky and basically I you know I've
been doing a ton of interviews for all
the birds in the sky the last couple
weeks and you know I was kind of nervous
about like whether I was going to like
you know just I mean I have been
blathering a lot but I actually in doing
those interviews I've been finding that
I have some really interesting
conversations and end up with different
ways of thinking about stuff than I had
before and one of those things was that
I was like I did stopped thinking of
genres as toolboxes your started
thinking of them more as like skin and
like the story is like the bones and the
muscles and the the blood vessels and
the skin is just like what's on the
surface to some extent because like you
know you have you could have a western
where someone is best friends with
somebody and then they betray their best
friend and then they get captured by
some group of Native Americans or
cowboys or whoever and then escape and
then they end up having to team with the
best friend that they betrayed that
could be a western that could
just as easily be a space epic it could
just as easily be medieval fantasy like
that story doesn't change radically in a
lot of ways if you change the setting
and what they're wearing and all the
outer stuff and you know sometimes you
do have things where like well do they
have guns if they have guns they can
just shoot everybody if they're in a
meaningful epic they can't unless it's
like King Arthur's Court or whatever
like you know unless it's someone's come
back in time but then it's not anyway
blah blah point is so jean rhys do
influence the shape of the story
sometimes in terms of what's available
to you but often the bones of the story
are not actually coming out of the genre
they're coming out of what's the actual
story that you're trying to tell about
like you know well in real life I had a
best friend and they were a jerk and
like so writing about that in a medieval
epic nobody'll ever know anyway so um
but uh you know so yeah that's so I
started thinking about it less as tool
kit because I don't actually think that
you approach writing a story that way
and go like oh well I have a story but I
okay I need a lug wrench and I need a
blue boy I started thinking like no it's
more like you have the story that you're
trying to tell which is like the
skeleton and then you know the outer
layer is kind of the thing that shapes
how it looks and how it feels but it's
not the bones kind of yeah hi Amy again
hi stutters and your bio about being the
basis of a couple of characters
armistice oh oh man Star Trek I would
love to oh yeah i mean i feel i don't
know if i'm not getting anybody into
trouble by bringing by putting that my
bio but um yeah i mean armistead maupin
came in red at writers with drinks my
series in San Francisco and you know I
guess he really liked it or something
because a year or two later he will put
out one of his tales the city books and
he was like and then you know one of his
characters was like well I wanted to go
see Anna Madrigal but I had to rush over
to see my friend Charlie's writers with
drinks show and is like wow so now I'm
officially friends with the characters
in this book and like what you know
that's kind of cool and then one of the
super amazingly nice Star Trek authors
David Mack did a thing a few years ago
where lieutenant lieutenant Anders and
Lieutenant nuits were help
anson syriac Lamar who was ready for i 0
ni the time to analyze some
spectrographic whatever's and so I was
like so I'm now I'm a lieutenant on a
starship as well so I was like hey
achievement unlocked okay yeah he's so
much fun thank you for having me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
