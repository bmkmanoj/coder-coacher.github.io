you
duh welcome to the second lecture well
for me personally the first time I
understood the allure and the challenge
of mixing times for spin systems was in
a fabulous Nellie's lectures in st.
Fleur back in 97 and I'm happy that he's
going to tell us something about one
aspect of this topic so mixing time for
constrained spin models please father
thanks you well and thanks for the
invitation to the Pacific Northwest
probability seminar and I was here for
three months and I really would like to
thanks the microsoft research and theory
group because they were really three
fantastic man from any point of view so
i will talk about mixing time for some
you know simple-looking markov chain
that arise from some statistical physics
problem i became a aware of those chain
actually maybe more than 10 years ago
when i visit berkeley david all those
who did some work with persi diaconis
actually the only rigorous work at that
time on this model he wrote to me before
i got to berkeley asking whether I had
any idea how to prove you know some
rigorous problem I didn't and I side in
four I mean few years later and then
suddenly with some people in Rome and in
Paris we start to understand this mobile
and but so they're interesting in but
also difficult with still many open
problem that i will mention at the end
okay so this is a simple example that is
due to all those and oconus in their
original paper in two thousand day
good with this asking what's happened in
this situation so we have a graph that
is the binary root 3 with L levels and
attached to each vertex there is a spin
with namely a variable that is 0 1 then
pi is a product Bernoulli p so the
probability that you see one at one
given vertex SP and just a product iid
variables on the vertex set of this
final three so the oldest icon is chain
is the following so for any vertex a we
are in continuous time so with rate one
any vertex does the following toss is an
independent coins for every vertex of
course so a pic owns a probability of 1
is P and sample accordingly a value in
01 and then the vertex check the state
of its children to two children so if
they are both zeros at that moment then
the vertex updates the current variable
Omega X to the sample value okay so I
guess that means I'm here okay yeah so
without the constraint that both
children should be 0 then the chain
would be really a product chain
completely trivial chain okay and so the
question of all the send icon is was
what what's the effect and for example
mixing time and other property of the
chain given by produced by the
constraint so of course I mean the mean
once once you have this constraint you
should check for irreducibility of the
chain so one has to put boundary
condition that ensure that the chain is
able to reach any state and
conventionally so usually this is done
by saying that say the leaves of the
trees are
frozen equal to zero so that any vertex
with the two children and the leaves is
always unconstrained okay so okay so let
us examine the main feature of the chain
so first of all I mean a key feature is
the following is that the chain is
reversible with the with respect to the
product measure and the reason is that
the constraint at the given vertex
doesn't look at the state of the
vertical itself but just look at the at
the state of the neighboring vertices so
in particularly the two children okay
then is so if if I move is legal namely
the two children are 0 then we can
always undo the move by reverting the
coin and the for the chain is clearly
reversible with respect to the
stationary measure the far at the level
of the stationary measure this chain
this chain in particular they don't show
any you know phase transition are you
know change of behavior okay they are
always trivial ok now the Chinese are
gothic because the leaves are always 0
ok now there is some bad news that
actually the chain is not attractive or
monotone because in a sense you would
imagine you could imagine that if you
inject more zeros into the system then
you could sort of speed up the chain
however more zero in the system they
allow more moves now more moves they can
produce either more ones but also kill
other 0 so is not clear the total
outcome ok now the fact that the chain
is not monotonic tractive means that I
mean a number of powerful powerful tools
like FK genie qualities monotone
coupling
Paris winkler censoring that has been so
you know really powerful for many other
model like the easy model or monotone
surfaces or other relevant model they
are no longer available okay so in a
sense there are very very few tools that
are available for a rigorous analysis of
the chain okay so in spite of the fact
that the reversible measure is trivial
sighs just product measure so the
following the following happen start the
chain from all ones okay and they find
the hidden towel to be the time that it
takes to put a zero at the root so of
course the zero at their if you are able
to bring a zero at the root the zero
mass starts somewhere at the leaves ok
and then serta find its way you know
climb the tree up to the root ok ok so
sorry
today one all sorry sorry about that sir
that's the result of a midnight revision
ok so the TV man and I will I will
literally caught them in the proper
authors ok come so the result can be
summarized like that that if p is less
than a half then the expected hitting
time grows like linearly in the height
of the tree if P is bigger than a half
then it grows exponentially fast and if
P is a half then it grows at most
polynomially and at least you know like
L cube and at most like L cube plus an
extra power okay an extra constant okay
so so there is a if a phase transition
in the behavior at least of this hitting
time according to the value of P so and
and one half is the critical is the
critical value so so before going to you
no more technical result let me explain
why this this critical behavior well
imagine that you work the chain and is
well defined on the infinite binary tree
okay then on the infinite binary tree
look you can look at standard
percolation okay and if P is a is bigger
than half then the chances that the root
percolates to infinity with the infinite
part of one is positive okay now an
infinite part of one can never be
unblocked because every every part every
every vertex on that path as always it a
child that is not zero and the far is
blocked forever so in the system there
are infinite block configuration okay at
least if we sample the
initial configuration from the
stationary distribution pie okay so it
is clearly is this should should be
clear that this that is that this
property having or not you know an
infinite classic should play a role in
the dynamical behavior of the chain okay
and and the role is expressed by by this
law okay so with with an I just we have
some samba yeah so of course I mean you
I mean this is an amusing model so but
why why why trees okay so that looks
very special now actually the above
chain is just one example of a general
class of Markov processes that are known
at least in the physical literature
kinetically constraint spin model now
this this work in ethically constrained
this kinetically refers to the fact that
the constraint is inside the dynamics
okay so that's that's that the
explanation of this world so the main
motivation comes from dynamics of real
glasses namely just few words about that
so one characteristic of a real glass is
that a real glass is a liquid that is
cool very very rapidly so that that when
you cross when you cross the
crystallization temperature the this the
system does not become the crystal but
continues to be like a liquid ok and a
characteristic is that if you look at
the distribution if you do the
experiment like measuring correlation in
the system you don't see anything
particular when you are at low
temperature but actually the dynamics of
the glass becomes slower and slower when
the temperature is lower and there is
some experimental temperature where
essentially the dynamics of the system
occurs on a time scale that is like a
day ok so is a time scale character
seven of an experiment so so physicist
they try to understand are there models
that sort of mimic some of this at least
some of the features of the dynamics of
this classes and these are this
constraints mean model so there are many
so a large class but maybe the three
main models could be so the East model
so in this case the graph is just the
line ok and they constrained it look at
your East neighbor and if it is zero
then toss a coin and reset the value
according to the coin okay then there is
a northeast northeast model so the graph
for example is z2 ok now the constraint
is more demanding because you asked that
the north end is neighbors at the same
time are zero so this is looks more like
the oldest deco nice chain on the binary
tree because you ask that both children
are doing something ok be 0 in that case
ok and then there are fredriksen under
sin and to physicists to facilitated
model so the graph is z2 and the
constraint is that at least two out of
the four neighbors are zero ok and then
the application p is related to the
inverse temperature by this formula ok
so they can't they constrain tries tries
to mimic what physics is called the cage
effect namely the fact that a mesoscopic
part of the glass is not able to move
and unless the surrounding mesoscopic
region ever certain property okay and
the common feature of all the above
model is the following either there is
an Ergo dct break down at some critical
point and this is for example the oldest
deccan is chained at one-half x exactly
this behavior ok so the chain say on the
infinite graph is no longer a gothic and
or the process on the instant graph is
always a gaudy and but the relaxation
time becomes huge when P goes to one so
the relaxation time here is is the
inverse spectral gap of the generator of
the process okay then so example of the
first class let me when there is an Ergo
dct breakdown is for example the
northeast model in this case the
critical value is the critical values
for oriented percolation in two
dimension so if P is above the oriented
perkele critical point for oriented
percolation then with positive
probability that are infinite oriented
part in the two and of one and this path
are always blocked okay example instead
of where the process is always a gothic
but the relaxation times becomes huge
when p is close to 1 is this model and
this to facilitated model so in this
case the relaxation time as a is is
essentially as this form this asymptotic
sign here means that we don't control
exactly the constant C okay so there
will be a upper and lower bound with
different constant but apart from that
the expression is this and n is log base
2 of 1 over 1 minus P surprising that is
possible to have such a an explicit
formula that this is actually related to
some deep factor of the East model that
maybe I will be able to mention at the
end so instead for them for the two
facilitated model the relaxation
diverges exponentially fast in 1 over 1
minus P with a specific constant okay
and maybe I'll explain why why why do I
this constant arise okay okay so there
are so the general result that we will
ball that where do with collaboration
can cleaning Roberto in Paris and
Christina Tony Nellie not to bring you
know mix with the brother Fabio
Christina's in Paris is that so under a
very general condition the critical
point where the ergo DISA tea break
breakdown occurs coincide with a
critical point of the corresponding
bootstrap percolation so consider for
example the the model here where you
require at least two neighbors okay so
and do boots a percolation with this
constraint namely generate iid Bernoulli
variable on the lattice according to PI
and then whenever a vertex as at least
two neighbors that are zero put that
versus equal to 0 and continue the
operation okay this is called
bootstrapper collision and the question
that you asked is whether after
instantly many step of this map what is
the chance that they say the origin is
still one okay so it was proof long ago
and hold right here as a beautiful work
about that is that this probability is
zero but actually it was also shown that
if P is close to 1 then in order to see
that this probability really becomes 0
ft infinitely many step of the bootstrap
map you need to observe the system on a
scale that is exponentially large in 1
over 1 minus P with the precise constant
that is exactly this pi square of a
rating that I mentioned before and for
that reason in when people were doing
simulation they were doing simulation on
a two smaller set and they were actually
claiming that there was a phase
transition is that the fascination was
absent okay so so this is the bootstrap
map so what we proved is that
the Ergo dcd threshold always coincide
with the threshold for the bootstrap map
and that if P is below this threshold
the process is on the infinite graph is
always a gothic with a finite relaxation
time so a positive spectral gap okay now
out of equilibrium which means for
example start from a iid distribution
with a different density of the of Pi
and ask whether the distribution of say
the density at the origin or in some
given vertex converge with time to pee
okay so this is very you know the basic
question sector and has been actually
answered only in fewer in few model and
so in this model inside a model on trees
okay and mixing times so not relaxation
time mixing time are much harder because
really you have to look at what the
dynamics does there is no monotone
coupling all this no monotonicity
argument and missing so coupling is very
hard and also the critical behavior
namely what happens exactly when you are
at the critical point is particularly
higher then the oldest icon is chain on
the binary tree is so far is the only is
the only model for which recent answer
was provided okay so main result okay so
I recall you that the mixing time is the
minimum time such that for any starting
point you have variation this time from
PI of the you know time distribution
less than say quarter and so with
Christina Tony Nellie we proved that so
the mixing time grows like L so the
depth of the three times the relaxation
time so that's general and then that if
so below criticality the relaxation time
is order 1 above criticality the
relaxation the relaxation time is
exponential in l and therefore below
criticality the mixing time is
here okay and above is exponential and
then with these other people at
criticality we prove that the relaxation
times inside grows at least like L
Square and L square plus you know
between l square and n square plus a bit
alpha still the mixing time grows like L
the high times the relaxation time so
there will be a cube factor and we also
proved that if you are right below
criticality so peace is is a little bit
below pc on the infinite binary tree
than the relaxation that is finite
that's a general result but actually
diverges when p grows to pc like inverse
of a polynomial of the difference
between pc NP okay so so let me describe
may be the easy part ok now the
constraint looks at the at the children
and the forest is oriented okay so
because of that if you look if you
project the chain and say the two
branches that originate from the root
then you still get that each projection
chain is still Markov instill a Markov
process and so it is easy to deduce that
if they to project a chain at certain
time a distance L to distance from from
PI that is say one then after an extra
time that is constant time the
relaxation verse of the gap then also
the big chain as the same property
yes so the faculty makes is l times T
web so that's true even when I guess in
the previous case when it was one more
site back when you had exponential
relaxation time so even there it's yin
and then who's another factor of s it's
very different from any case we
knowingly easing where when you have
exponential relaxation you don't lose
the air until you still lose the end
even in the bottoms of the critical case
say so but okay so okay i have f really
to check what but I ok think that this
was okay sorry I have to go forward okay
so in any case out the mix the l2 mixing
time namely they you know first time
that you reach as a distance one from PI
in l2 this dissatisfied the following
relation that on on depth l is less than
the one on Deb L minus 1 plus constant
relaxation time and so t2 grows like L
times the relaxation time at most and
the mixing time which is the mixing time
in l1 is less than the mixing time in l2
and so you have this this bound now the
lower bound so this is a user similar
result that doing lubetkin paris
obtained for easy model on trees and the
key ingredient is that the mixing time
of a product chain is related at least
if n is large to the number of factor in
the chain so log n half log N and then
they mean than the minimum of the
inverse gap of the individual chain ok
so in our case if you for example cut
the 3 into 2 and you look at all the
branches of Deb L over 2 down below they
are all independent each a ninja they're
just identical and the fart we get
immediately that
the mixing time is well the number of of
this L over 2 trees is exponentially
Nelda for this law gives you an L and
then you have with a relaxation time on
L over 2 on L over 2 chain ok so lower
14 at criticality ok so this typically
this strategy here is to is to use test
function in the variational
characterization of the of the spectral
gap so a good test function at least
that work was the cardinality of the
cluster of one's attached to the to the
root ok so it's a computation using you
know the fact that we are at one-half
with P shows that the variance goes like
L cube and instead they directly form of
this test function grows like L and the
first a ratio grows at least like L
square so for P bigger and a half for
example the indicator that the root is
connected to the to the leaves by a part
of one is a good cut set and the reason
is that this cut set this path is
connected with many other path to the
leaves so it's very hard to to detach
the route from the leaves so in order to
detach the route from the leaves you
need that the root is connected to the
lid just by a single path which is a
very unlikely event okay so you do this
computation and you get an exponential
cut set okay and therefore the mixing
them the relaxation time is at least
exponential now the hard part is is
instead to get the upper bound on the
relaxation time and so here we use
martingale decomposition of the variance
that actually was inspired by work at it
10 years ago with Sinclair advisor for
easing model on the trees
and then comparison with an auxiliary
chain in which the constraint is not you
know just one level below checking the
state of the two children but you check
you know little l levels below so you
have a long-range constraint and the
constraint is is the following a vertex
is free to fleet if within in in little
else type of the bootstrap map it can be
make zero so roughly this means that if
you go on the little little l levels
below X you find some part of zero that
are able to climb up and make the level
free ok so if p is less than a half it
is it is enough to choose this free
parameter to be like a large constant
depending on p together the relaxation
time of the chain of this auxiliary
chain is less than say two then you do a
little comparison between the chain at
criticality this situation is much more
complicated because one has to choose
this free parameter as a function of the
total length of the chain and one is
forced to do a multiscale analysis that
was certain inspired again by this work
by doing Lubezki paris for the critical
easy model on on on trees so here is an
open problem that we we have been
struggling for a while and didn't come
up with a real even a ristic you know
solution in either direction so do a you
know is something like the oldest daikon
chain but on a ternary tree so now you
have each vertex has three children and
the constraint is now that at least two
children out of 3 are 0 okay so it's
possible to compute the critical point
just by computing the bootstrap map and
the critical point is eight over nine
however there is a
this looks may be similar to the
previous chain but there is a key
difference is that at the critical point
the probability that the root is as an
infinite cluster that is blocked which
is must necessarily be a binary tree so
the probability that the root is
connected to infinity and on the
infinite eternal III by a binary tree
this probability is positive 3 over 4
okay so instead for you know standard
percolation on a tree the probability
that you have an infinite cluster at you
know the critical point 1 over the
number of children this is zero okay and
that was heavily using the proof okay so
the phase transition fizzy so people
would say that this is the first order
phase transition because suddenly at
criticality and in philly cluster
appears now the question is when when p
is equal to this eight of eight nine is
mixing time still polynomial in l like
the oldest echinus chain we tried you
know various cut set to prove that is
not and we fail always always you get a
polynomial we did some simulation and it
seems that indicate polynomial size is a
deny sighs very hard again this is very
hard this is a very interesting yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeahs below and above is
the same critical it is and this is
related to some property of this
infinite classic that physics is called
fragility so they say is the cluster is
fragile maybe it's possible to break
this infant cluster in a polynomial
number of steps okay simulation indicate
that's true okay but we are not really
able to to say anything more than that
okay so cut off for them for the mixing
time on the binary tree so of course is
pretty reasonable to us whether the
chain shows cut off okay so so I recall
you that tea mix of a parameter epsilon
where between 0 &amp;amp; 1 okay
this is the mixing time to reach total
variation not not 14 but say epsilon
okay so if I epsilon is small yah you
need more time because you want to be
closer to the station to stationarity if
epsilon is close to 1 you allow you know
more relaxed variation distance okay so
I recall you the definition of cut off
so if you have a collection of markov
chain so shows total variation cut off
around Sam you know cut off point P sub
N and windows WN okay if for Rowland and
epsilon okay between 0 &amp;amp; 1 then the mix
in time for the end chain is is this PN
plus a window aboard their WN and this
Oh epsilon means that the you have to
put the constant in front of this w-end
that depends on epsilon ok ok so here is
the result that proved with yellow base
qian xi shanab ganguly a graduate
student here at u-dub so suppose that
you are non critical then for most case
ok most small scale means not not for
all L but for many L namely there are
many sequences of the many divergent
sequences of L for which what I'm so
there is a cut off ok maybe I'll see
more what means this most ok and so we
have all those so the oldest chain all
those deccan is change as cut off and
then so the center of the cutoff is is
this expectation of the heating time of
the root and the cutoff window is of
order 1 so it's very concentrated ok so
mixing is really achieved you know with
a with in order one from this time
and at criticality so p1 half then again
you know for at least a divergent
sequence of scale okay there is a cut
off with again the same center and now
the window is the relaxation time which
at criticality diverges with L
polynomially okay so let me just give a
sketch of the proof for the non-critical
case so starting from all one when the
system is rich I mean has been able to
put a zero at the root this means that
every point has been visited as updated
it state okay so it's not possible to
reach the root without updating at some
point all day all the vertices because
the constraint requires that both
children are 0 okay so now if you do
just basic coupling namely choose the
same point to update and flip the same
coin to update a point then whenever you
you you are visited you forget about
your previous you're starting
configuration you become a completely
new Bernoulli variable and therefore at
this time all starting configuration f
couple okay and there is the basic
coupling okay now if if starting from
all one's the chain didn't didn't make
it you know close to the root so didn't
bring a 0 close to the root then close
to the root the configuration is still
all ones okay and that's very unlikely
for pi so the Intendant variation this
sam from pine still large okay and
therefore so there is some little
argument but it's enough to prove order
one concentration for this heating time
okay
now here comes this most scale now using
the l2 mixing that is linear in L is
possible to prove that the average of
towel grows linearly in L okay and
therefore for some scale the increment
between l and l plus 1 must be bounded
by a constant okay can cannot be more
than a certain constant for all scales
okay so for any you know n and a little
bit more than n 1 plus del time there
exists a scale such that this increment
is is bounded by a constant that will
depends on this Delta okay and so you
can construct a good sequence by
choosing for each and you know that
corresponding L okay now because of the
constrain the heat in time for a 3 of l
plus 1 levels is at least the maximum
between the heating time of the left and
right branch because because you need to
to clean up the left hand and right
branch in order to update the root ok
and therefore there is some
distributional inequality ok so this
top-ranked I'll double primer to
independence copy of the same variable
and so if L is a good scale namely this
average is different between averages is
of order 1 then is simple to to Amina
this is a simple analysis using this
distribution and inequality to prove
that actually the average of tau L minus
its mean in absolute value ok so the
first moment is bounded by the average
of the difference up in absolute value
of this two copies ok and this is this
is bounded by twice using this
inequalities is commissioned to be
bounded by twice this different which is
of order one the further than Markov
inequality shows that the concentration
is about their one okay
is actually similar to a proof proof for
tightness of the maximum of branching
random walking is rather simple argument
so then we went also to consider cut off
for another model that is in some sense
is more complex ok another scent is
another respect less complex and this is
this model ok so consider these models I
remember that this model is ok you look
at the East neighbor if it is zero you
update your the vertex is free to update
ok actually in order not to look from
right to left we prefer to listen I used
to look at this model from right to left
but then I got convinced that it was
better to look at from left to right so
we decided to change to West constrain
ok but you cannot change of course the
name of a model ok and and and ok ok
yeah the process is going to twist yeah
ok so you can see doc this finance our
finite interval and say that in order to
get reducibility the first vertex is
always unconstrained ok and then of
course again the mixing time is related
to the heating time of the right
boundary of the interval starting from
all one ok and so the same group prove
that so there exists a positive number
is called a velocity now can be such
that the is model has cut off at l / v
ok and a window that is big-oh of rutile
so at most root L so so why why is why
is that well say said that you start the
chain from all ones ok and look at the
process from left to right so when when
the process of all you
we'll start create first 0 then this 0
maybe may create another one may die and
so on and so forth so at any later time
you will see a rightmost 0 in the system
that you would like to call the front so
there is like a wave okay and so call xt
the location of the front of course is
random okay so so recently or young
blonde ale in Paris as she's a student
of Christina Tony Nellie she proved the
result that so there is an asymptotic
velocity for this model on the half line
namely so there is a there is a positive
V okay such that if XT of XT converge to
be in probability in particular as T
goes to infinity okay and then she also
proved that if you look at the law of
the process behind the front so you sit
on the front and you look behind you and
you ask which is the law that you see it
so she proved that as T goes to infinity
the law converge to a a unique invariant
measure sake call it new ok so actually
she first proof that and then using that
she was able to prove a lot of large
numbers ok so here we I mean in order to
prove cut off we had to prove a more
quantitative statement ok so what we
proved is the following that uniform in
the initial configuration if you look at
time T the law of the process behind the
front call it mutti ok then the
variation distant from the invariant
measure in total variation so this is a
exponential stretch exponential
exponential minus T to some power alpha
less than 1 ok this this we do you know
VI coupling a method that involves also
maximal couplings are not Markovian ok
and now once you have a result like that
then is rather simple than
to deduce the the cutoff result because
what you do is that you break the the
front in two increments okay so you call
cyan the increments you know you fix um
you know with peanut and so so the
increments now they they tend to behave
like a stationary sequence of a weakly
dependent variable because as soon as
two increments are far away you can
apply this result and and get that I
mean the the biggest one as as forgotten
where it when it came from okay and
therefore once once we have that you
have low law of large number and CLT and
the for the front as a big old root T
concentration around its mean the
velocity velocity times T and as a
consequence that you get a concentration
for the hitting time of the right
boundary stack of the interval starting
from old ones okay so yeah so I would
like to conclude with the with with
three open problems so they're not in
the open problem session but maybe okay
anyway so so first problem is on the
three proof you know order one
concentration say below criticality for
all scales not just for some subsequence
okay that I mean is easily non-trivial
okay so so we try but with the cider
that can be quoted as an open problem
okay now yeah the next two problem they
concern the North East model and they're
really really interesting i think that
there is some very interesting
probability behind those and so so the
first problem is concerned mixing time
for the northeast model
so maybe I can just do a picture here
okay so so the northeast model you
require the north and an East neighbor
to be zero in order to update a vertex X
of course in order to to have ergo dct
you need in a boundary condition that
are a bunch of 0 here otherwise
something will not move okay and now you
ask what is the mixing time in this box
if the site is l okay so if you so below
criticality we know that the spectral
gap is order ones independent of L or as
bounce independent of L okay and so if
you apply you know the trivial bounds
they relate relaxation time to mix in
time then you get L square okay but
instead we have all the reason to
believe that the mixing time is linear
in El with pork Lebanon was a postdoc in
Rome now is in work we prove el with
some poly log okay but in a sense our
argument is really misses that they did
some key feature of them of the
Northeast okay and so I think that this
would be really very interesting step
forward the third problem is even more
ambitious okay and so is a shape theorem
and that actually was suggested by steep
valley okay so consider the northeast
model in the in the third quadrant okay
and puts a all the
here and start from old ones okay then
what you expect is that well the first
guy to update will be this guy here okay
once this may be 0 then you can update
also this one and so on and so forth so
what you expect is that there is a some
random set okay at time T of vertices
that have been reset once at least once
okay so cold cold ESET VT which is here
ok and then so if you run simulation is
very clear that this set actually as a
very as a very clear shape ok asymptotic
shape namely if you divide it if you
divide the set by T and then sent it to
infinity this convert to a a nice curve
ok that looks like this okay and which
looks very very much similar to the same
curve that you would get by running
simple it's a symmetric simple exclusion
in the for the corner problem ok you
slo-mo slowly over there yeah
yeah well here on this line is just east
on this line is is so you go so you know
that in time T you reach this density
okay on the next line your you already
need some help from the previous line in
order to move and more help is needed
when you go inside okay so it will be
like it will be like like that okay so
this is a this is a really very very
challenging and but again because of the
absence of this monotonicity property
and son also a lot of you know a useful
tool are are no longer there and that's
open okay thank you
related question to this third one is to
understand and to combine this with from
this result the stand stationary
measures for a front with the given
slope so that would be one who any slope
and yeah yeah in fact I think that the
way to attack that would be really to
prove you know a generalization of
blundell name me two were to assume that
there is something that bring it back to
the origin and prove that exactly what
you said that the reason you know inning
bargain measure behind as in touch yeah
yeah but so there is a key tool that is
missing here that you have in East and
is the fun in that form the Northeast we
we don't know that if you have some some
part of zeros we are not able to use
that a close part of zero to a given
point implies that at this point you
reach you know p say very fast this is
missing okay in East we have this result
and that's very important but
essentially the key okay and here is in
studies mr. Sutton you know there are
several preliminaries result that Tyra
that they need the proof</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
