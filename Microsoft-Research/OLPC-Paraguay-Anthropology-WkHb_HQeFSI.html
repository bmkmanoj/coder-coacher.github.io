which is Morgan aims not Morgan games
but there is a G in her Morgan G aims
but Morgan we met actually when we were
both researching at no key in the Bay
Area and I had been admiring Morgan's
work from afar for a long time because
she's one of those amazing people who
learned a new language just to do
research so she learned how to speak
Spanish in order to uncover what was
happening in with one laptop per child
deployment which all of us know has been
sold as this mythical story of magic of
getting children to program and this one
piece of device is when a rescue
children who don't have access to the
resources of the first world and we're
going to really wanted to uncover this
because a very important part of
Morgan's research is understanding them
pathologies that programmers and
engineers and founders aya use or you
know build into and how that's built
into the actual devices like the idea
that a belief such as a mythology can
end up in the device and end up in the
deployment and affect millions of
children's lives and that's what Morgan
is going to talk to us about today and
you should also if you are a competitive
dancer you should ask Morgan about her
secret life as a ballroom dancer but in
the meantime we're going to learn about
how she came back from six months of
fieldwork traveled all over South
America and snuck in to into the LPC
system and came out and they may not
want to hear what she has to say but I
think it's really important so I'm
really glad we're really glad that you
know you're gonna that MSR wants to hear
this thank you very much for having me i
think i think oil pc actually probably
knows a lot of what i'm going to say but
but anyway i have two short vignettes
that I want to share today and they both
actually Parliament eyes the value of
first impressions of field sites
and especially in the way that field
field sites might be mobilizing to
perform a certain version of success to
visitors I'm going to be talking about
performing success for a particular
high-profile visitor from one laptop per
child are not going to use names I don't
have the clearance for that from the IRB
but but I'm going to talk about his
visit and how the entire the entire
deployment in Paraguay that I was I've
been researching the last several months
mobilized to perform for him so this
fellow visited for five days it was a
late October 2010 so we was there for
five days his entire schedule was
completely booked up with meetings with
high officials of state they wanted to
convince the the paranoia government to
start funding this project so far they
have gotten money from a lot of other
people but not the government they also
wanted to take him out to eat Thai food
am which is a huge hydroelectric project
in Paraguay shared by Paraguay and
Brazil that was a big funder of the one
laptop per child deployment in Paraguay
so they had a whole day for that it's a
long trek out there but they did set
aside a morning for him to actually
visit the school and I was really
fascinated to find out what would happen
in this visit because I have been
spending the last several months in
these schools and I saw there were
definitely good things about the project
there were a lot of huge challenges
about the project and I was really
curious how he would respond to this so
the day started out like many school
days did it was late October so this is
late spring in Paraguay the temperatures
were already in the upper 80s we rolled
up about 8am lots of kids in their
school uniforms running around the
courtyard playing soccer the principal
comes through rings of big brass bell
they don't have the intercom system so
she just comes through rings of big bell
everyone congregates mostly in the shade
you can kind of see here hot day and
they all sing a song together and then
she launches into a speech and I want to
make sure I get some of these bits of
the speech so uh
she said to all of these students a few
of you are going to have the privilege
of meeting with this person who came all
the way from the United States just to
tell you what to just to tell you some
very important things about the laptops
you have so I want you to listen to
everything he has to say this is a
wonderful opportunity for a small group
of you and so if you are in this club
and you want to learn from him please
come up here and a bunch of students
came out from the from the group these
students are going to participate in
everyone clapped and there was a lot of
photos taken a lot of great opportunity
and I noticed very quickly that the
students that congregated a number of
them worked see if my clicker works
there ago a number of them weren't in
school uniforms of this school and I
realized that I recognize some of them
from other schools around the area they
had brought students in from other
schools around the area for this event
so there were I think for students from
this from the particular school we were
at and then the rest were from elsewhere
so we all congregated in a spare
classroom right next to the principal's
office and this fellow set up his laptop
he set up a projector and he started
giving a talk he gave a talk about the
program that he developed and that this
club was oriented around they they were
all enthusiasts of this program and
there were no fewer than seven support
staff helping so this fellow actually
doesn't speak any Spanish he was giving
a talk in English and the two people
right on the side are both employees of
Paraguay adjucha the NGO in charge of
this deployment in Paraguay and they're
they're helping translate and explain
what he's talking about then there are
three student or three teachers sorry
circulating among the 15 students in the
classroom and to teacher trainers
employees of Paraguay echuca also
circulating helping the students
understand what's going on so there's a
tremendous amount of support and I was
somewhat disappointed here I'm in the
back of the classroom watching all of
this and thinking this isn't a normal
classroom experience he's it up at the
front he's giving this talk there's so
much support in the room and he's you
know it's I think it reflects very well
on how enthusiastic these particular
students are about this program but it
is
general reflection of what's going on in
the schools so after an hour he finishes
up he wraps up his talk and then we pack
up and leave there is no other there is
no other visit to the school there's no
visit to a normal classroom and I
realized that he probably came away
feeling like this was a typical
experience this was a typical day in
this in this life of this school rather
than a huge mobilization to perform
success to him and I just wanted to very
briefly contrast this with a visit by a
another person a few months earlier this
is when I had been in the field about a
month and a half and this fellow had
come in from Europe he had actually
spent a year in South America as a high
school senior those who spoke Spanish
very well and he said I want to see
what's actually going on can I just
shadow you for the day and I said sure
that's great all of the teachers had
already met me and I must say during my
first two weeks there everyone was
performing to me as well it took about
two weeks for people to get used to me
and just let me sit in the back of the
classrooms rather than trying to show me
both show me off and show off to me but
this fellow came in with me because he
was with me the teacher was like oh yeah
just just go ahead and sit there and so
we sit in the back of the classroom
which is a great place to be by the way
you can kind of see everything that's
going on if you've ever been in the back
of an undergrad classroom you see the
sea of facebook and and they start the
program there are two teachers in the
room this day so there's the teacher and
there's the teacher trainer that
specializes in the one laptop per child
laptops and so she had pre-charged all
the laptop so that that got one of the
often big hurdles out of the way right
away a bunch of laptops are charged but
as we were watching me notice that you
know here's this this kid right in front
he isn't in the program that we were
using they were using the paint program
to to draw pictures that day he has
started up a windows emulator in his
starting a video game so from the back
of the classroom we could very easily
see this and so I just want to present
these two vignettes as a way of
different approaches to visiting
field site and the relative performance
that goes on with if both of those and I
think we're out of time but we can talk
a little bit more in in questions thank
you thank you more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
