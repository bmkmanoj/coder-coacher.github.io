you
alright so we're gonna get started
welcome I'm pleased to welcome Lisa you
today as she did her doctorate as
Stevens Institute of Technology where
she worked on using genetic algorithms
to understand creativity and support
distributed cognition with the crowd
since then she went to work with Nikki
Couture and Bob crowd at CMU she did it
to your postdoc they're looking at again
at sort of creativity and distributed
cognition across groups of people
looking at using analog an allat analogy
and divergent thinking to help people
innovate and do new things things that
you maybe think you couldn't do on your
own and so we're very happy to have you
Lisa thank you okay thank you Jimmy
hello um hello whatever is out there and
so my name is Lisa so actually I want to
start a little bit of my own history I
did my PhD in the management information
system but I did a lot of projects in
psychology and cognitive science in
particular so back then we were
interested in the role of Technology in
the individual creativity that is like
how can we study the what's happening
here and how can we develop technology
to support people to some problem
problem creatively ought to task better
but then when we did this all the
projects trying to like you know design
technology we find that in most cases
actually win technology like computers
mobile phones involved it's no longer
confined in the single manned that is
just distributed okay can sit here
across like a smoker people a larger
group of people so this idea is called
this stupid the combination actually has
been around for well orange olay soh was
coined in the
late 20s and so the basic idea is that
so combination a cognitive process no
longer happened in a single manned or
confined by whatever you have here it
actually can distribute it to a lot with
people especially nowadays we have
internet we have to all these web
technologies so it is possible to
involve as many people as you want
through technology so one example we all
familiar with is open source software
development so in the past you might
have group people within company and to
develop build something to get together
but now in the new environment you can
involve all these strangers all these
programs they can divide divide a
project into pieces and work and the
people build on each other's code and
another report examples of Wikipedia so
people start to accumulate knowledge in
a shared space so we a lot of
researchers start to study in these
areas and we have some answers in like
how can we distribute this kind of task
too many people how can we allow them to
build on each other's who each other's
work so we know something in this area
but there's a third area we have no
lives and there's less study in this
area it's called craft design so website
like innocentive a threadless I'll
quirky own and and designs so in this
website what people do are slightly
different meaning they are here to do
some kind of design a logo design or
design a t-shirt or in unison tell
people actually try to solve some
scientific problem that cannot be solved
in a company and in quirky which is the
new companies even more interested in to
push it to you further to the crowd like
people can find whatever ideas they
think you taste interest understand made
their ideas to the website and all these
people help them to select the ideas
developed into product then they sell
the products on the website so
everything
is conducted by these people but on one
hand oh this task there they are harder
i divide something novels do this kind
of a creative a task it is very hard we
kind of need all these minds to together
to do something great but on the other
hand this task involves a very high
answer today even in the traditional
psychology we are not sure like what's
really happening the mind if you try to
solve problems it's not something you
can like article you can break into
paragraphs mention this is then people
just work out these small things it's
like how can you really break it into
design process how can you control
certain parameter to make it a creative
suddenly you have this great idea you
design computer these kind of things is
very uncertainty so that's why it's hard
that's why I'm personally super
interesting and this this area so from
practical point of view I'm interesting
how can we help people to do more
innovative and complex work then they
can do on their own so this kind of work
children from small innovative products
consumer products can be can be used
everyday to very high-tech devices or
even two more fancier complex design
like buildings so by studying the this
phenomena happy needless word now I
fundamentally theoretically and trying
to answer these questions how can the
cognitive process we normally associate
with the individual manda can be
implanted in a large group of people
mediated by technology ok so in the rest
of the talk I'm droid trend I'm going to
talk about two projects I've been
working on the train to answer these
grand question and then at any rate i'm
going to talk about some exciting future
research ok so i started to from asking
the question is like what's going on in
a single Single Man like
when people trying to solve problems
trying to design something what's the
process of this creative thinking and
there are a lot of literature in
psychology and people trying to study
what the creative sparks from and one of
the explanation is called a
combinatorial creativity so it argues
that actually is seldom that ideas come
come from nowhere most of them they are
building the previous areas so it is
like if you have all these previous
ideas actually new ideas are based on a
combination of the creative element of
the existing ideas or you put the
previous elements of the ideas in a
critical way so this is what's going on
in the individual and then what's
happening if you push it to further do
you distribute it to a lot of people
like as a human we have built this
counter for thousands of years right how
did that happen so there's a allow were
scored in memetics so people studying
them so they treated you need a culture
like ideas or certain kind of a
technology you need a culture like they
being there passed around generation by
generation or two different people and
so the central a process of force in the
counter propagation in selection you had
other people have ideas and then the
third person the second person might
pick on these ideas and use it in a
different way so people might have
different ideas in this land working but
the basic idea is selection plays a very
big role in counter transform each
transfer so their combination s election
so we try to build a process can you
incorporate these two forces which I
recall the evolution or process so this
is how it works suppose you have a
design problems then you said about
trying to solve coming with ideas
yourself you can post up there to get
access to assemble assemble and many
people as you want as a
generation they can have solutions for
you and then you evaluate them select
the good ones and match them together
into pairs you present a pair to a
second person and ask this person to
general new ideas by combining them so
and then so you have this seed EDS you
give us a second group people build on
these ideas have new ideas you run this
process again and again so this
essentially evolution process like two
people get married to have kids and
hopefully kids can taken the best genes
from parents if they become more nicer
or smother intelligent so we are hoping
through this evolution process driven by
combination selection designs can
involve towards a better higher-quality
so then we need people we need people to
actually carry out this process and
luckily we got Amazon Mechanical Turk so
we can access as many people as we want
so that's how we get participants these
people have no design background at all
they have their like some of them a stay
home mom some of them work in
construction or they like distributing
around the world they work in different
disciplines and we directly to people to
this design interface where they can tap
to write their ideas so they can also
draw to realize their ideas so this is
what really happened in the you know in
the process so all these ideas were the
ones produced by by this crowd workers
and so this particular design task was
designing a chair for children so that's
why you can see all these electrocute
features so then you to consider the
materia the attraction to the kids all
these things and so that you have first
generation which shares they get being
passed on a combined into the second
generation and a third generation so the
first question we want answers to two
designs the involve better or later so
we compare
the resins in the last generation with
the ones in the first generation and we
also want to see whether this process
produce better ideas than alternative
process so this ordinary process was
independent idea generation we basically
mimic what happened in real world like
people generated ideas on their own so
then we need to figure out a way to
measure our results and so in psychology
for the people who study creativity and
the designs they basically argue there
so we need to consider two dimensions
when we judge the quality of ideas the
ideas needs to be novel and needs to be
practical if we decide advice there's
two dimensions then you can read it in
some way and like and convert this like
a text and images into numerical values
and then compared the quality of ideas
so that's what we did and that's how we
judge the quality of ideas reliability
was there on previous things that
they've done before or oh they said this
this slide show how we actually rated
the ideas so the statistical method is
yeah yeah yes and you're in the design
for the multiple generations your
example versus the one before that if
people at those sites per second so here
you show something skipping from the
first to the third generation mm-hmm and
the previous one I thought you'd limit
them so how do you limit the type of
combination that happen in this process
oh you mean how rice first in the third
generation oh yeah how are people
actually constrained in there in what is
their starting design know how they can
evolve it because in previous slide you
show just limited where each player can
only depend on a previous layer so I'm
trying to understand how complex the
process is over so we've actually
implement the process we adapted genetic
algorithms so in that agree them so it
has different ways to do this one is
called a mutation and it's like you have
this ideas you change in some way and
then moved on
the next generation and they ought they
have this made a particular process
called elitism like you would keep some
ideas which are really a very high
higher quality like they are very good
you move them on to the next generation
automatically and just the third process
is combination so you would randomly
pair two ideas but it's more complex
than that you lucky you would find the
two ideas pair them together find the
ones of better ones and now you find
another two pairs you'll find a better
ones then you match the map the give
give it to a person ask women to join a
new ideas so this process is kind of a
fever the ideas with a higher quality so
this process basically it has
combination but it tries to use a
agreeance to favor the ideas with a
higher quality by either increasing
their chances of being selected or just
moving them directly to the next
generation and that's why like this idea
never a first visit example and even
though it didn't get combined hear it
there's a lot more data it got combined
with other ideas so Kendra is some ideas
it's moved because is it is considered
very good they are moved directly to the
next generation the problem about
generic algorithm is we need to break
your design into several of the genes
and how do you actually break up
designing new jeans because it kind of
to me as a whole package really
difficult to freaking just several
elements and select from them yeah this
why we we think it's a great about this
research they likely in traditional
genetic algorithms they can solve the
problems which can be broken into jeans
right but design problems is very hard
as designers we don't really know what
kind of features they should i pick and
how can we divide this dylan task into
motor ones so basically rely on the
craft to pick the features to decide
which since they should they should pick
they should use it to how they can
I generating new jeans so what we did I
just did a nice plan to form this this
process and whatever happens is in the
control of the participants so we later
we had a paper analyzing like how the
crowd workers pick the jeans the
features and how they actually do the
combination and so the the basic fund is
they favor the the parts of the ideas
which is a practical and a normal so you
you probably mentioned this how is the
evaluation of each generation happens is
it by some-some designer always buy the
frog yeah we did two different ways of I
evaluated them versus we find it to
designers in our architecture design
school ask them to read the read to the
ideas based on two dimensions and that
we also post all the ideas after meet
Anaka mchenry turki to get thinks 2000
talkers to read all these ideas and that
calculated weather like they the
ordinary people the crowd workers think
and consistently with the designers and
we got very hair consistency meaning
like that as because the didn't ask we
used is is some kind of product
everybody understands like a chairs for
children and so we can try to two ways
that we're writing reading the ideas in
terminating each kind of user or its own
or homogeneous wait wait right is a do
you wait some some users higher oh no we
just treat them home it in yes we did
yeah okay so let's look at the results
so first we want we want to know whether
we get better ideas through this
evolution process and so we try the
motorways to to measure the results 1
waves is that I count to count the the
idea so like if I ideas and the is the
two dimensions are hair above average
scores of our ideas then
classified as with creative ideas and so
there's a binary classification and we
want to know whether the number of the
good idea see increased through this
process and that's what this figure
shows like in the last generation we got
much more creative ideas than the first
generation we also used them other ways
to count the average quality to see
whether on average the ideas improved
and we also got a significant difference
across generations so this figure shows
see more detail about how ideas involved
so that the red dots represent ideas in
the last generation the blue circles
represent ideas in the first generation
and so the two accesses represent the
orange energy of practicality two
dimensions and you can see the ideas
collectively shifted to that corner
meaning they have they've improved on
both dimensions so we also compared the
ideas from this process to the ideas
generated by corn fields as a mini
independent idea generation to say to
see whether it produce the better ideas
and so it shows like a through this kind
of a process people are much more likely
to generate variety as then they just do
on their own how does the Greenfield
system work are just like independent
like I same design problems and ask the
same amount same number of people to
generate ideas on their own for that
condition the number of people in the
first layer plus the number people oh um
yeah that's good constituents of our
heads yeah yes so we ran for three
generations assume i don't remember
exact number we got to assume we got 500
participants so in the control condition
we got 500 participants as well actually
we also can told that Ted timing because
the generations happens over time so we
actually divided as 500 people into like
at the su 300 so the first generation we
run 100 same time the second independent
another 100 try to control they the
timing that and so everything trying to
happen
Todd was so one of the total number of
laborers that are in each condition the
other isn't it think your friend is also
has the time on task yeah in the case
that you know the given design that
makes it to the third layer has had you
know and units plus I'm units plus n
units of time whereas you know a single
pass by by even a larger number might
only have the Holy ganyan it's a work
spent on it and so you encourage you're
saying in the Greenfield system you
encourage people to work three times as
long on the task then reserves are the
tiny hmm first in the evolution process
we r n8 so there's ten lakh right we
went needs so supposedly ran first
generation the first day second
generation second day or second error
then we went in see me tenias lai lai
get a same number of people to do
independent edit at January and same
time but in terms of how long they spend
the task we don't have control over that
because even in the evolution process
some people they spend like a whole
never trying to make it perfect we
actually pay them five cents back in
2011 so we cannot likely cut it off like
you have to stop at this time so yeah to
see whether people spend a longer time
there I'm the results in great quality
compared to the road total time spent on
the task yeah when we do the analysis I
can tote a lot about variables including
education design backgrounds and now it
happened like a 2010 I don't even
remember maybe I think we can told about
and you double check yeah yeah because
it it might not actually matter i mean
the second fresh set of eyes might make
a huge amount more difference than the
same person spending more time so
interesting
it's great comment earlier but then
you're presenting graphs on creativity
hmm what measure of creativity is the
riser yes here we basically call quality
with the creativity so so because we
study create creatively we care more we
cannot really put this an idea see in to
manufacture and sell later I so we focus
on the prototyping step like Eddie ation
and so when we talk about quality we
actually mean creativity and source
means it needs to be novel and need to
be prep practical hi independent really
yeah uh-huh so there's some question as
to whether or not they can identify
creativity or what creativity means
sorry that's dope so like often you know
you can go to somebody who for example
doesn't know that related work fella ya
novel and they say yes no novel and you
just show it to 30 other people may oh
no of course that's not know this is not
done here air so I'm trying to
understand you you know what what in how
you're measuring it was just young
people can two people identify
creativity has anybody actually look at
this concept what it means to identify
creativity yeah so that's the question I
got most and that's the question bothers
the creativity researchers all art is
how you get your results how you measure
creativity and that's also why people
never ask look at how creative this idea
is they trying to break it into the
motor dimensions and make it easier for
them to judge it and that's also why we
used both designers and the crowd we
think there's a very good task fold for
that crowded to judge it because is it
is something consumer product people see
a lot with chairs the tears for for
children if 100 people agree on that is
no more than it probably means it is
normal so create creativity is judged by
how novel the idea is how is it
different from the originality oh and so
basically being nervous
being original people like it has to be
both original or novel and a practical
actually there are other dimensions
people consider sometimes it sounds like
to arsenal of dimensions that you are
evaluating this this particular design
yeah it has to like a idea could be a
very novel or in general but it could be
ridiculously normal righty it's
impossible for us to manufacture or it
had always genders so you have to
consider the second dimension actually
in the later study we also add more
dimensions just depends on what is their
problem to be used we have to consider
the complex and who are reading them and
what the best way to get a get a overall
score to judge the quality ok so this
figure it shows how what people did this
is a design a clocks so that's the two
original ideas and the third person
trying to incorporate the features from
and two ideas idea and you o'clock so to
sum up you in this process we are trying
to incorporate the force of what
happened in the individual meant and
what's happening from a collective
perspective like as a population how we
build culture and do we design a
distributed process which can promote it
attributed combination and and with the
aspect that and personal bit interesting
is so people don't actually talk to each
other in person there's you have
thousand people once you use images and
a text of the ideas at the
representation for them to build on each
other's work that it can really scale up
so but then there's problems so here you
have the first generation at a seed EDS
then you move it to the following
generation it's basically it's
converging process it's trying to
integrate it towards to make it a better
and better but they actually before that
state you have to that very good seed
ideas right if the city is on very low
base it basically will constrain the
following ideas
then also there in design theories
before we converge to something you have
to explore you trying to find what might
be the author ways to to to go what
ambassador action to design your ideas
so the next project we focused on the
exploration phase so you if you in the
context like you just want to generate
ideas how can I help you to do that so
will this time we focus on exploration
as reusing exceedance so using the
previous designs again ideas never
seldom happened a firm scratch they need
to build on the existing distances are
also widely stupid calculation so
interesting stew because we have
accumulated that all these designs ideas
knowledge in the past and how can we put
people like in figure out a way to move
the forward to the future so there are a
lot of examples but using examples in
design process actually is not a no idea
it happens a lot when people trying to
generate new ideas a problem they would
go out there find some cement operations
so but using example even though it
gives you some inspiration so it has a
lot of it will produce a lot of negative
effect one of the typical is called a
conformity meaning that your new ideas
most time a very similar to other ideas
you say you made some variations so
somehow it incorporated the previous
features it can never reduce the
indistinct and indistinct ideas reduce
the diversity so the other usual with
the example is especially in the now the
sharing culture right everybody can
share their ideas and there are so many
online idea repositories then if we can
figure out a way to use the example that
will be great but then all these
examples which one do you choose I
cannot give you a 1000 ideas and say
okay general new ideas so that is posted
a huge problems with like you how can we
select it and how can we process in this
information
again we can go back to the creativity
later to use psychology actually they
say there is a pattern between ideas
meaning like even though we have all
these thousands ideas actually a lot of
them are similar to each other meaning
it's not like the even though you are
different field you don't look like it's
similar together they actually shared
the deep structure which is called
analogy so I'll give you example this is
a typical problem use de psychology is
that a general try to conquer this
castle but then the there's some rose
there's am i under the bump if you have
a lot of people walk through 80 soldiers
to walk the rate it's going to trigger a
to them you the people will die now how
can you come conquer this castle so the
strategy here is the the general divided
in army into multiple forces and they
convert into the castle from multiple
directions then then conquer this castle
a different problems in a medical domain
is that you have this tumor somewhere
and there's Lizard King cue the tumor
but it's too strong if you just hold it
if you just kill it with the big strong
force of a laser it's going to kill the
skin surrounding you too so then
straight do you see you can divide the
laser into different the small amount
and our project the tumor from multiple
direction so these two problems are
called analogy so then you would think
how about we just present people
analytical examples right so again it
has the problems of Conformity people
would their ideas would affect their
that examples directing the semitic
features in some some way the other
issue is you'd be surprised how
difficult for people to recognize an
analogy even you'll tell them you show
them this two problems the fifty percent
of people cannot recognize the deep
structure similarity so are you example
to show you what i mean by the surface
feature
so this is my nephew and he just turned
a one year old he's super cute he's so
smart and he can make noisy he cannot
wait to know all about its world and he
spent some time with my mom and so they
really like each other my mom tried very
hard to let her to let him to see the
world at the word grandpa grandma so
after a month and he say recognize this
person I should call grandma and then he
starts to recognize some others the
things so what we would ask him what is
and he said a beer so we sodium another
and he said grandma so what is it
grandma not a beer you've noticed both
am aware necklace both of the mcafee so
as a baby they start to pick up language
it kind of confunde is you cannot
recognize the deepest image similarity
between fears but a surface feature
between this two completely different
against object so this example show you
like i even i douse we are educated
intelligent but we have a huge problems
with recognizing the deep structure we
focus on the surface feature so but then
research I found that once people
recognize the analogy they actually have
the form some kind of a structure
thinking they called a schema it's like
on a schematic thinking they know that
you need to the structure it doesn't
matter what the objects are buddies
share the structure that you are trying
to convert and conquer we divide
something convert it to the center and
the concord of the target so the
question we are trying to solve in this
project is that how to apply the scheme
of thinking to the crowd and well how
can we apply to the example to design
distribute the process so we have this
product which is from quirky they're too
crowded design website so is a Rick the
design there is a special slider on top
of it if we after you collect asleep so
that leaves sometimes duck on the rig
and you push it down you can get the
leaves off the rig automatically
this is another product is also from
quirky invented by two different
inventors so when you do barbecue you
can have these sliders pre-installed in
the skewer and after it's done you can
push it and get rid of all these things
i ask y so this ideas are very different
they have all these different features
inert in different domains but they
actually share deep structure so then
this project we are trying to solve is
we have this or this example some of
them share this deep structures and how
can we help the crowd to general back at
better ideas from them so the process we
the first redesign is the first step we
need to create schema schema describe
the destructor so we show this idea so
we ask people where the comments came
out to this to this ideas share so for
this tool they trying to detach two
objects by using a mobile slider so this
how we operationalize the schema and
then we ask people like just close your
eyes trying to think you would other
situations maybe you need to detach two
updates from each other so this set of
designers or novice designers crowd
workers whenever we are focusing they
don't they don't say they aren't in
ideas they just we give them this schema
so we ask them to think in what other
situations they might have the such
problems and then except can you solve
this problem by using a mobile slider
and there is another ideas from quirky
is when you chop chop things and all
this small thing stuck to your neph the
blade of your knife then you can design
clip to attach to your knife then get
rid of it so there's a complete new
ideas but it shares the structure of the
previous two ideas so this process I use
it to illustrate how we did and how the
process should look like now we need to
test the list first we need to test the
idea that giving people schemas would
provoke better idea then
examples so we again we get turkeys we
show them either examples as gamers and
ask them to generate a new idea so again
we have this problems how to Madrid so
this time we don't give them we didn't
give them the same problems so they
figure they generally complete new ideas
they need to figure out their own
problems in what domain and salvage what
the ideas should look like so we added
13 sorry the second dimension took into
the usefulness because sometimes ideas
are normal and practical but it's trying
to solve a very achievable problem it's
not good ideas so we added these three
dimensions to judge the overall quality
of the idea so I'm going to walk you
through how we run the experiment so
first we design a control condition to
ask people to generate new ideas they
saw three ideas but they didn't ask them
explicitly to use it because this we're
trying to recreate a real-life situation
when people generate ideas they just get
inspiration so they don't necessarily
use them like in a very explicit way so
but then we also want to control that
the timing the constraints we put on the
experiments this is all the details of
experiment design so we actually ask
people to general new idea they using
example and the last to add conditions
with fokin schemas we ask them to
generate the idea by using the tendril
so this time we didn't use a schema
because we don't don't what didn't want
to introduce a new terms to the Turkish
they don't understand so we use it at
design room so they actually have this
schema and they trying to generate new
ideas by seeing both the example and the
structure so in the last one we only
showed them this design you so we are
interesting you what kind of
manipulation might have people to
generate by the ideas so in the first
two examples based conditions on average
the the quality of the ideas 2.5 and
during the schemas involved conditions
you can see there are we improve the
quality of ideas by around
one point I guess and so from the
regression analysis we found that
showing people schemers can
significantly improve the quality of
their ideas but then the next questions
are how can we general schemas in that
condition in story in the previous
experiment we as designed experimenters
we design schemas but we also want to
add to make everything can be conducted
at the crowd so we're trying to figure
out a way for people to generate the
schemas and there there was a lot there
were a lot of studies in the past that
people trying to make them to summarize
the problems or write down the
underlying principle or generated their
visual representation of the problems
and all of them are filled it is very
hard for them to recognize deep
structure of ideas so but there's some
the inner path later there are some
proteins worked one is you show people
multiple examples they are analogous to
each other they share the same deep
structure then it can help people to
realize the commonality in the structure
and the other one worked in suing people
constructing example which is different
which doesn't share the structural
similarity so sets are already known
like yeah okay yeah I'm going to get to
that question later yeah so they said
already know we picked we want to say we
what situations people are more likely
to generate to this schema so we can tow
to the examples we selected they have to
be analogous to each other so this is
this idea so it's used to keep your ear
best stable when you walk or run the
second idea is to be this all real ideas
from quirky is a product about we the
dishwasher the Colossus sometimes get
broken they'd be done tether to to
attach the glasses to the dishwasher
thing so it can be stable the third ways
your head will move around the wii u
sleep on the plane our bass is like a
strap thing to attach your
head to the back of the seat so it's
very cute products the very popular and
quirky they actually make a lot money
from these products so they are
different products right but they share
this structure we call the schema so we
also add a different products this one
is like you you you make the power strip
which can change shapes so it's
completely different from the vs. the
first of three so we will either show
people one of them or tune of them or
three of them the the first two for
three or which we replace one of them
were the last one to add a contrasting
this example to see how can people
generate the better schemas and this
time we found as you increase the number
of analogous examples people more likely
to recognize the deep structure
similarity they can generate a very good
schemas but when you add a contrast
examples and they are kind of distracted
them from recognizing the schema no we
didn't tell them we just should have
said
okay then now we want to close the loop
remember my central research goal is to
to assign task to mod people to design
distributed structure so we're trying to
close the loop that to take the schema
standard better craft and use at gimpo
to ask another group of people to
generate a new ideas to say whether
maybe the effect we got in the previous
experiment it because that's something
we produce that we want to make
everything natural to be conducted by
the crowd so we selected a good and bad
schemers from the previous experiment
and we are asking people to generate
ideas by either again observing the
examples or using better schema and
examples or using consequence scheme and
examples we want to see whether the
quality of schema matters and whether
people can generate a better idea is by
using their court colleagues out to put
so and again this time we found there
there was no significant difference
observed between the examples or bad
schema and examples between usual people
good schema produced by their co-workers
an example they can produce much better
ideas so this three experiments together
composed a distributed process it
suggests that we can break this process
starting from examples a set of people
can identify analogous examples a
different set people can generate
schemas for these examples and third
group people can generate new domains
from this examples and the last group
can generate new ideas in this new
domains we didn't real it has to every
step of it it but we actually run a
three-step experiment but it's just that
we can break it into model steps to
elicit as as as many ideas as possible
and promote look the quality then now
I'm getting back to your first questions
we as experimenter we we selected the
set of the examples then your question
how to be like how can people you may
identify such examples right so that's
the idea we are working on currently so
we use
we use the crowd to the first approach
we try this how can we get the crowd out
there to find an allergist example so we
show them a idea show them a schema tell
them go up there fund idea share this
structure so they go to worky they have
thousands I'd years and they trying to
find an analogous examples and it works
very well the accuracy was much much
higher than the just to go out there
find examples the analogous examples but
the constant ugh is like even though we
have this crowd workers we have
thousands of them still takes a long
time for them to go through a database
with like an unlimited number of ideas
right so we're trying to combine the
natural language processing techniques
with the crowd how to efficiently
identify the initial set of analogies
examples as ongoing work okay so to sum
up in this project we are trying to
figure out new representation of
creative content and among the existing
examples to make it as a better source
for people to generate to generate new
ideas also I just suggest a GTP design
process it we can go from concrete
content to abstract and then go down to
the concrete ideas again so future
research so my all my research has been
based on the idea that these stupid
combination and so in this view
carnation people actually think about
Mandy in two ways one is you can look
for the men like property from a large
group like how can you treat each person
as a nurse your mind and you make them
to actually work you some way to to do
something great but the other like the
metaphor can be Ryan you know the other
way around the meaning we can treat
demand as a society of a person's like
each knows that can function as a
person's and they kind of like handlers
emotions and the connected in specific
ways and in that way we can borrow what
the rest of it is
my interpretation is that if you think
about it from these two ways then we can
learn to from whatever we learned from
the money society the group's the larger
group of people and apply back to demand
to to make an individual to be more
creative to solve problem better so
along the first to land there are a lot
of a direction I would like to pursue
one is continue the current working
search for creative content as I said
like how can we use the crowd the humans
cognition and emotion learning to find
the creative ideas so currently if
you're trying to design that last ideas
i showed you how to detach the garlic's
of your blade of your knife currently if
you search whatever relate to that edit
feature like a knife cooking garlic
everything i tried you would have all
these ideas they're not really helpful
for you to solve that problem but if you
search it with that structure like a
detached two projects by using sliding
object these are the results i find i
did at rest the middle is very
interesting lisa like a guy trying to
ask a girl to pay for everything he
produced excess of what that's a bad for
way to detach something you get your
hanoi a girl but it's not really helpful
so then the cove this project is how can
we actually put in something cert in
some way and get this ideas as a return
so the second ideas i think can you go
back sorry is how can we so now it's
still when your motivation we need all
this crowd inventors even though in
quirky InnoCentive the guards at least
like a 340,000 g mentors of working
there and how can we make designs
automatically when people trying to
comment on product so especially for the
unsatisfied consumers they would say
what's wrong with this product then how
can we integrate this creating count on
content from customer reviews and
automatically reinvent the perez product
i think that
it's another direction I'll be
interesting work out so for the second
day remember we can't think of of the
mandolin terms like it a lot of
different emotions there that you can
treat it as a society than what doesn't
mean by producing future research so we
are so that's the Assumption we can
think in the video cognition that way
but it is good if we I can actually find
some things because once you make it
like a study in a more structured way
you can get internal agency's internal I
mean the interneurons internal
organizations into coordination with
external structure that's why I think
might be interesting to study toward
that direction so I'm using example to
illustrate what I me when we say like
internal necessary the Society of a mind
so this is the the work I showed you I
used like a each design was generated by
a crowd member and the design ideas in
parallel and the later it integrated
into a viewer and the better ideas this
work was down around 2010 and in either
exact same time Stephen down from
Carnegie Mellon University he did he was
in Stanford back then he did this work
is about on the topic of a parallel
prototyping it says and so basically the
funding network is that if you ask
people to generate multiple ideas at the
same time and the later trying to trying
to narrowed it down to a particular
prototype and you've refined the people
would take the features amount of
features from the previous model
variants and generate a finally done be
compared to a eternity process people
just have one single idea then they keep
working and get feedback and the
generator by a new design and the the
parallel prototyping way too much better
ideas than the iterative process so this
at this point you may notice the
remarkable atif similarity between these
two were dried with data separately we
never like a coordinate on the just the
is trying to study a single mind we are
trying to study at it should be
determined but they follow the same
thought like how it works like the
parallel thinking that I've early
thinking I guess my point by using the
example is if we don't know this work we
only have my previous work we can
actually try to use that perspective to
understand and get and figured something
like this and if I haven't done that and
after reading this work and we can
borrow whatever funding there to apply
to the crowd so that's my future
research is like we can use this kind of
thinking to study individuals mint and
all this the random thinking exciting
future research i'm not going to go
through each of them future research
always exciting i'm going to a lasting a
few of them one is the analogical
thinking it should be happy you the
crowd like give them a structure asking
them to generate new ideas then how can
we apply to the single mind you know
people sometimes they are most of time
to get stuck to the ideas they have they
cannot think in an inorder way how can
we put them in different contexts and
mimic them as a multiple person working
the same times to think of multiple
analogies to be able to use the same
ideas in a lot of normal ways the the
the other idea is so people have trying
to figure out like in Wikipedia or other
kind of communities peer production
communities how can we get people to
contribute to certain content looking
Wikipedia a lot of a popular topic is
like a thousand people trying to improve
it but some other areas nobody ever work
on it but it seemed thing to individuals
right sometimes we have task we just
don't want to work at it takes forever
for us to get to it or when we try to
solve all problems we just stuck into
the particular direction we cannot think
of any other out and other ways so you
know in the pure community production
community there's work at down by
minnesota university they actually
designed these things called suggest
about they're trying to reduce the
contribution costs like i suggest to you
this area's already fool you should work
on this area so it's detected like you
some algorithms to to detect the area
that needs
working on and suggested to suggested
that and like what you should working on
so maybe when we think about the
individuals so we can help them to find
the thought a blend of spot so by doing
that we figure out what's going on
demand what's going on after there so we
can like get them both in better
coordination so we can have the view
this through Batum and can be
contributed by individuals and it can be
built on by others anytime anywhere any
way we want thanks very interesting talk
thank you uh so one of the questions I
have about some very last few slides is
that so you work closely with the design
school and in the discipline of design
one of the things that that people are
taught is that so before they go to a
crib a design crib that they have to
come up with you know three independent
ways to present the same idea exhilarate
standard kinda procedure like in a
larger firm to my split amongst three
teams but god like the design student
will be trained to be able to come up
with three independent ideas and I
wonder because that gets a little bit at
some of these questions you're asking is
how do we get people to be better at
that kind of independent ideation their
own you know if anybody has kind of
looked at you know because they go
through some training for this but in
the end our designers then better at
doing do they get less stuff in their
own ideas than people who do not have
that training do you have any ones
looked at that or but this sounds
exactly like what Stephen down has done
right the parallel prototyping so that's
work they swiftly focus focus on at
advertisement design like when and base
now designer 30 design students with
novices how can you make them to come
with multiple ideas then later on
converted single ideas
hey it is really work yeah hey Andrew so
it's not good example a show our focus
on design which is a really proper way
of using some of these techniques and so
I was wondering if you could speculate
on how this might apply to things that
are not as practical as design things
like objects like are useful but more
things that are artistic for example or
like it that a certain kind of aesthetic
or even jokes like could you you know do
these kind of processes for producing
funny jokes or beautiful thing things
and so on I'm just curious like if
people think about like this how am I
you apply or whether you think some of
these specifically for things that are
practical or leading extends beyond that
yeah so there's is continuum right if
there's too many dimensions one is
original novelty like a lot of creative
stuff plays a big role like a pending
artistic and stuff the other directors
practical you can go either way right it
like the art thing will be in this
extreme and like copy editing will be on
this extreme right I know it has so we
have been working the consumer product
it worked and also I i know it working
complex problem like social problems
like an opening ideal people trying to
get the crowd to solve social problems
like how can we get people to be more
healthy I can be people to engage in
community more so in that community and
they actually try the analogies and it
worked over well so you'll notice when
people generate a new strategies they
actually trying to borrow metaphors from
the other domains and so these are the
two fields works I'm not sure it's going
to work I think as the random factors
the creativity increases it will work
less and less effectively because
there's hair and certainty right like is
that is in particular painting we don't
even know how to judge it like his I
don't event as to why Mona Lisa's smile
that's particular pinions good I still
don't understand I went to the parents
that museum people say is good and maybe
it's good
so I don't think it's going to work in
that area but I just think like a in
between it depends on how we design a
task you know there are lots of studies
the artificial intelligence and the in
psychology how can we turn convert the
uncertainty into certainty how can we
tree get a random thinking create
everything king and by by by conducting
a more structured way and so I do think
it we're working that way so like even
in quirky some products of our practical
there's like a staff product but some
other products is kind of a very
creative you think about it is very
interesting so it doesn't matter who we
involve you this process how it is and
the task until like we have to figure
out of what really was what who didn't
really need to happen if we design
something yeah great though the fact of
designers go to school and they learn
their practice name they get better over
time and thinking about the kinds of the
Sun the kind of improvement that happens
in an individual as they go from not
being able to design very well to being
able design very well and even better
you know as they get you know more and
more experience in what do you think
would be the process or what do you
think would happen in the crowd sourcing
example you have these mechanical turk
errs that are designing things today
yeah and now you keep giving them
designs what's going to happen in a few
years or decades now will they be doing
better designs in a decade or because
there's this churn people maybe aren't
getting feedback will they be doing the
same quality of designs in 10 years that
they're doing things even it's a
baseline to baseline me you know this
they seem to be starting up better what
will happen
yes we are talking about the two
communities one communities like a cork
in you know center there really they're
stable workforce they are inventors the
image even though there are novices but
they constantly participant in the
design process and they act to the
website their organization actually
trying to help people to build this
different ways of thinking I do think
egg from the organization perspective if
they can figure something to help people
to develop the webos abuse which can
scale up like design students learn from
design school they can become better
over time but the community I guess are
helping focusing on I think it's most
interested is how can we use this
transient workers like one time workers
they they don't really care about making
design or achieving complex work as a
lifelong a professional rate they are
just interesting at that moment I I want
to participate this kind of job that is
the matters less about how can we
educate our tree the videos are more
about how can we design system like
whatever who never coming in we can plug
them temporarily in to conduct this
process as the job our researchers to
design this system can incorporate
transit workers another question later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
