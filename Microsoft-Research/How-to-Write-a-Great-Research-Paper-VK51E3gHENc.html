shot quite finish it off without further
ado I'll pass over to Simon because of
course I don't have to introduce you
yeah okay that's good right okay so uh
let's see have you had a good week yeah
if any of food anyway so may be food for
the brain as well I hope so the ability
to write good research papers is
absolutely central not only to your
career prospect but also to doing good
research so what I want to do in this
talk is just to make seven very concrete
immediately actionable suggestions that
I think will make your papers better but
the ground rules are the same as in the
talk about giving a talk this is
slightly less recursive which is this is
not a subject on which there are any
right answers right so there's no in I
have no monopoly on truth here so please
ask questions or indeed make comments
from your own experience as we go along
that would be more fun for me we will
still finish at twelve as mentioned at
the end of the last talk okay yes
definitely
although any answers that are definitely
wrong probably not actually you know to
everything there is a counter example
but I'm just going to err on the side of
being highly opinionated and saying
things that I believe to be true and
then you can be free to disagree with
them and fight with your supervisor
about them okay so here's the first
thing just start writing right so here
is a typical plan for doing research
first of all you have some idea and then
you spend some months or even a year or
two developing the idea and then you
write the paper that sounds logical
right that's just good scholarship isn't
it
utterly wrong here's what you should do
right you have an idea you start to
write the paper and in writing the paper
you think oh I didn't really understand
that idea very well that sort of forces
you to refine the idea and you you
should the act of writing the paper sort
of forces out the research as it were
what can happen with with this plan is
you have the idea you start like you
start you do the research and after you
you start
to like the paper and you think darn six
months of that year were completely
wasted and there's another six months
left to do on bits that I didn't realize
that I didn't understand right so I'm a
functional program I like lazy
evaluation so this is like lazy
evaluation right you've got a you start
writing the paper use that as a forcing
function for doing the research an order
Oh drat not only is it a good forcing
function but it also it's a good way of
trying to make yourself articulate what
it is that you're doing so I can't tell
you how often I've started to write a
paper and I've realized that something I
thought I understood I don't understand
after all but when you write it down it
all seems you know by the time you
actually get it in letters on paper it
seems more complicated than you thought
it was right so it kind of crystallizes
your ideas in a very concrete way and
that can make it much clearer where you
don't understand and also another really
good thing about writing a paper is it
something you can share with other
people while you got all this stuff
swirling about in your head it's very
difficult for anybody else to comment on
it or indeed engage in any dialogue with
you you can sometimes do that one-to-one
with somebody else but often that's a
bit disorganized you know you start
conversation with the whiteboard it's
all very good but actually you know it's
not something you can do in five minutes
so the at your act of setting out to
your idea in in written form can be a
very helpful way to have a do to open a
dialogue with somebody there's having
sense yeah for you personally astray
first oh I'm going to say lots about
content in a second I'm just talking at
the moment so the question was do you
write the abstract first or last
actually last but um but I'm going to
but here I'm just concentrating on get
started with my ting early but almost
nobody does yes
related to this would you recommend
meeting your papers before you do the
research oh no one actually going all
the way to submitting it to a major
conference their workshops are work in
progress yes officer
for graduate students graduate
consortiums absolutely so yes for sort
of workshop II things do submit stuff
that is in progress say that
in progress like if you liked it you
think actually this makes no sense at
all then you probably don't want to
submit it but absolutely one of the nice
things about computer science is that it
it's just like a fractal it expands like
a snowflake in ahead of you so everybody
turns out is working in a different part
of the snowflake unlike say biochemistry
where everybody is converging on a
particular the boundary of science is
very well-defined so people are kind of
in competition in computer science
you're much less in competition with
other people and so it's much easier to
share so yes share half-baked ideas just
advertise them a soft baked yes what
about majors
what about positioning papers yes well
you mean I'm trying to work in this kind
of area right yeah I have a greater year
yeah I just didn't the algorithm but I
want to get my ID out there sure so
provided the the venue is you know open
to that and you're upfront about what
you're doing absolutely like just about
communication you're trying to say is
anybody else interested this idea yeah
yeah so you beat be open speak early but
I'm I'm almost my main point here is
really to do with almost communication
with yourself right about starting
writing but also the dialogue with
others is important okay so but one
thing just about having having ideas is
I think I've sort of put that pipe way
more or less said this that for me
writing writing is not an output medium
like this this is this is sort of where
the paper's like the printer at the end
of the algorithm right for me writing is
the way that you develop the ideas in
the first place it's the it's the it's
the machinery of research not the output
not the printer for research does that
make sense that that's what works for me
let's see and so if you're going to do
this number two is you need to know what
your idea is and that is often not
terribly clear in advance but it must be
clear
when it's finished but I'd like to just
articulate what what is this business
about an idea so I think of a paper as
rather like a talk that I was making
about on Tuesday as a kind of vehicle
for conveying an idea from your head
into what's your name Fraser okay so my
paper is a vehicle for conveying my idea
from my head into phrases head right so
it's it's like a virus I put
the paper for me goes into his brain and
if it's successful it sort of tape
smooth there and you know he becomes a
carrier and he you know infects other
people so it's a and it it's so it's a
the paper is not a sort of you know way
of getting research brownie points it's
an idea conveying mechanism right and
with a middle of phrase it's not I put
it in a rather what's the word done
dystopian view but but I hope you'll
might hope the Fraser is sort of excited
about the idea and think that's cool and
interesting and maybe I could build on
it and do new things that and I put
Mozart up here because I think of you
know Mozart wrote pieces of music that
we are still let's think of them as his
papers right and we are still reading
his papers in concert halls right we
just of course the the interpretation is
you know huge huge part of musicianship
but the fact is that the ideas that he
wrote down was so persuasive and catchy
and interesting that people are still
looking at 100 years later or hundreds
of years later I'll be astonished if
anybody's looking at any of my papers in
hundred years time but it will be VOC
sightings they were so one yeah so so
and and the ideas are more durable than
anything else you know you may implement
stuff you may give talks you may you may
do a number of other things in the
research but I think in a way that your
papers are the most durable part of your
output they are the things that future
generations of students may read and
think you know phrases paper really
changed my life you know and I can point
of some papers that did change my life
so and that's a in a way that
implementations sometimes do but not so
much so we often focus on tools and
implementations actually let's the
papers that are the durable piece oh and
a bit about communication if you have a
great idea because you're brilliant
which I'm sure you are and you sit in
your cell having the idea and you do not
communicate with anybody then what are
you a heat generator right not so cool
right there however good your idea is if
you don't succeed in communicating them
they are not benefiting humanity and
that's what we're here to do so it's not
sort of command communicating ideas it
to is a way of discovering whether there
good you showed them to people they said
that note they sometimes they catch fire
and spread and sometimes they don't
that's a good winnowing mechanism so and
so but but if you don't attempt to
communicate in as articulate away as you
can and persuasive ways you can then
you're you know you're you're hiding
your light under a bushel don't worry
people will filter them out if they're
bad ideas right but if you don't tell
them they don't have that chance okay
all right so um then we have to wonder
about this idea so the the the the worry
is if you look at other people's papers
you go to any conference or look at any
conference between your journal you look
at um people that's a really good paper
that's a good paper they they have great
ideas all these people they must be very
intelligent I oh I'm a mere worm my
ideas are pitiful and weedy and nobody
would be interested in them like this is
what everybody feels right we all feel
that this stuff that we're doing is not
very significant unless you're
remarkably strong minded or possibly a
good person but I promise you that most
computer scientists feel this sense of
insignificance by compared to the you
know the glorious reality of research in
your field but I think the the bottom is
is important that even if your idea
seems a bit weedy ins and insignificant
just write a paper about it anyway but
you're not committing in to publishing
it at a you know top-tier conference
you're just committing to writing it
when you write it it may turn out indeed
that it was a weedy and insignificant
idea and then not much is lost right
you've just articulated it clearly but
um maybe and very often this happens to
me I start writing a paper about
something I think is not so cool and
then I find it actually takes me 12
pages of double-column
eight point font just to explain enough
about what it is for to be
comprehensible to other people in other
words it's turned out to be bigger and
more interesting than I expected that's
very common right occasionally you
discover no it isn't but often you will
so that the this is another get started
thing don't wait until you have a good
idea to write something write stuff
about any idea that you've got they got
the message there
I don't wait to have a good idea because
nobody does
we only discover that they're good ideas
later right there's really important
because everybody has this problem and
it's very disabling if you wait to you
have an idea that you think is cool it
cool enough ok let's see last little
piece of about ideas is that when you
write a paper by the time you are
finished at least you must be clear
about what the idea is you may not be
very clear right at the beginning this
goes back to the question about
abstracts right so that um you but by
the time you finished you really ought
to be able to articulate what your idea
is um more to say about that later but
the the bottom point is the important
thing sometimes you find you read a
paper and I think oh well that's got
several ideas and they've got so shush
together they've been sort of squeezed
into there you know the compass of a 10
page paper and you haven't done justice
to any of them right so if you have lots
of ideas you know praise be right lots
of papers this is not salami slicing
that is writing many papers about one
idea that's writing many papers about
many ideas ok so resist the temptation
to just you know escape lightly over
many ideas just try to try to focus and
be clear what the idea is sometimes
there's a very closely related family
this is a kind of you know there's no
nothing is completely true but this is a
good baseline to start from ok yeah and
so this is some Joe touch I gave a nice
talk how I was acting what you said he
remembered The Hunt for Red October and
where captain whoever it is says just
one ping they send out a sort of some
bounce to another submarine only one
light so that's a and the ping is the
idea so a good so here's a good exercise
when you read somebody else's paper
close the paper once and try to say what
is the idea that I learned from that
paper what is the key thought in that
paper used to be surprised how how hard
it can be indeed I have found myself as
a reviewer writing in my review I
believe that a key idea in this paper is
de dum de dum de dum but I'm not really
sure because you also didn't really tell
me
and so I like that in my review because
I want the author to think well well
that wasn't my key idea at all so you
know who have you a completely
misunderstood they might then reshape it
and I think yes that was the key idea I
should make it more explicit so you know
I would encourage you to be totally
explicit and to one to write something
that says here is the key idea I
sometimes write a section that says you
know the main idea that's a section
heading right so leave your reader in no
doubt when they get to the bit that you
matters because papers have a lot of
stuff they have some background material
some setup that's actually you know it's
it's not that's not the new part but
it's essential to understand the new
part you got a signpost clearly to say
oh I we've reached the end of setup
right now we're going to tell you the
new piece don't leave them in any doubt
okay okay so that's so much for the sort
of wider white papers and what the main
payload is your idea I just want to say
a little bit about structure so far so
good
any other observations or questions yes
I mean in general the soup is talking
about how to write a good paper there
let's not argue about it I mean just as
as as a tool to bring your ideas into
paper or do something you can present
and share with other people do you
really think a paper construction of you
know up drop them and well some
background and then formulation is this
really the way to go or yeah and I'll
say what I'm like yeah you said so a
blog post might be another way to
communicate yes but I would think that a
blog post often has rather similar
structure let's get there let's get
there I don't any while Jenny the
question what about the painful
literature programming like than you
just like you know when you're combining
code with actually the artists
oh listen programming when you're
writing a document that sort of somehow
interweaves code and exposition right so
um so sometimes I have seen papers that
are literate programs they will they say
you know here's a
the source code of the paper and you can
run it there can be great and for some
you know for some kinds of papers that's
perfect if you're doing bioinformatics
it might not be so so easy to do that
but yeah and the other the other concern
there is that if you have to present all
the code because you want to execute it
then that may overwhelm that the idea in
the paper so it's it's a choice but
certainly if you if you're presenting
code having actually run all that code
to make sure there's no bugs in it that
would be good thing to do yeah okay
let's say a little bit about structure
so here's some here's a story so so
going back to your question about medium
like so my my mental model for a paper
or for a blog post all for a personal
conversation is I kind of imagined that
I'm standing at a whiteboard with a
friend and I want to convey my idea so
what am I going to do I'm going to say
here's the problem I'm trying to solve
I'm going to say you know here it's an
interesting problem and here's why
moreover it's an unsolved problem that
is you know there is something to do
it's not already been done and now I'm
going to tell you about my idea this is
that this is how I'm going to do it and
then I'm going to give you some evidence
to make you believe that the idea
actually works in practice you're going
to explore some of the detail then I
might tell you something about how my
idea compares to other people's
approaches right this is a kind of
storyline if you had you know if you
were with somebody for now you might
like tell them and I think this is
something you might do in a blog post as
well like that that narrative story it
might also be might all be briefer than
in a paper but the storyline might be
similar does that does that make sense
and it might and it makes sense in a
personal conversation as well so how
does this turn into into papers well
once we're talking about the medium of a
paper so I'm now thinking mainly about
sort of conference format you know 10 or
12 pages of fairly dense font but hidup
like this applies equally well to a
journal paper or even to a short form
paper but the or even to a thesis
actually but so here in the sort of size
of a paper is what you what you get
title you know abstract introduction
introduction trying to fit the
introduction on in the first page at
least if you're in a format that has a
decent amount of text on the first page
and then then you say something about
what the problem is something about what
your idea is so
about evidence about why it's good idea
something about related work and then
we're and then you're finished okay
but the look at the visit the write the
readership drops off pretty sharply of
course I this is not data and just guess
these numbers but some people are going
to scan the content contents pages and
maybe abstracts some people will read
the introduction and by the time they
finish the first page they're making
this mental decision shall I just move
on to the next paper in this proceedings
you've got to think of those readers
right there there you've got to you know
that you lose a factor of ten I reckon
after page one that's an important part
of your strategy for writing a paper is
what to do with page one okay so it's my
sort of general story I wanted a little
bit about each of these parts so I want
to start with the beginning introduction
the introduction part what are we going
to say in the introduction well and this
is about contribution so here's my to
what I think introductions are good to
be like to introduce the problem and to
state what your contributions are and
that's all you can fit in the
introduction I taught early Mumbai
introduced the problem so I always try
to introduce the problem with an example
right so this particular paper this is
one of my papers from some time ago and
right there after four lines of text
I've got some typewriter font with an
actual program right there and some and
my hope is that somebody reads that and
think ah I get I get an idea of what
this paper is about now because it's not
phrased in vague abstract terms it's
raising some executable code so using an
example it's very good and it's and it's
right up front right very very near the
beginning I'm right there saying here is
the problem I'm trying to solve okay and
then there isn't at this point enough
enough space to say here's how other
people have solved it and you wonder
need might need to say something about
wife and interesting and important
problem but it can't be to harder
problem so I call this mountain's versus
mole hills so here's an example of what
you see at the beginning of some papers
you know computer programs have bugs and
bugs are very bad and you know cite
reams of papers that say you know have
software engineering statistics about
the cost of fixing bugs right now when
you read a paper like that does your
blood begin to race do you begin to
think wow I didn't know that bugs were
bad I didn't know the lots of
programs had bugs or that they were
expensive ah this is a paper I
absolutely must read is that what you
think of course not you think oh yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah let's get to the
payload see what I mean it seems worthy
it seems you know like good scholarship
but it's completely demotivating for
your reader instead you want to cut very
quickly to something such what I call
describing a mountain you know you're
describing Mount Everest and it's plain
that your paper is not going to conquer
Mount Everest because that's like a you
know a thousand careers are going to you
know still only be in the foothills you
want to describe a little hill right a
little Foothill that you're going to
conquer or at least make a decent
assault on so here's a you know consider
this program this is actually a bit like
this one right I gave a particular
program here's a little program it has a
particular kind of bug in it you know
look you can see the bug here so I'm
going to tell you how to find this class
of bugs right and I'm going to here and
I'm going to give you some guarantees
about that or at least I'm going to get
interview good stat you see what I mean
so you've you've made the problem small
enough that it's believable that you
might solve it and also that a reader
thinks oh actually that's kind of
interesting bug if you could really do
that that would be pretty cool good name
because they know you're not going to do
the thing at the top they don't waste
their time this is page one right this
is the moment to which you have lots of
readers and they're all you know falling
off the bus okay so that's your sort of
motivation part and then so there's
motivation what are you trying to solve
and then there's contributions now quite
a lot of papers do have an explicitly
explicitly say the contributions of this
paper of this so this is a but a
surprisingly large number don't I would
say probably about 5050 and so when
you're I think of it like this the
contributions of your paper are like the
specification of a program and the body
of the paper is like the implementation
so when you read the contributions
that's like the spec what you want the
reader to do is to think wow if you know
that the author could deliver on those
promises that would be amazing
yeah I want to find out how they can do
that what I mean
so and so you need to be a bit specific
so here's an example from another paper
I wrote so blah blah but this is
a sort of tail end of some motivational
piece and then I say in this paper we
put the choice in the firmer basis and
then there's a sequence of bullets that
describe the specific contributions of
the paper I personally I would urge you
to use that style to literally say the
contributions are these and then give a
list of bullets because they're like
claims write that in a proof engine
they're like the films that you're going
to prove so you want to say claim one
claim to claim foo you probably don't
like that but that's what you're
thinking right each one is a claim that
you are going to substantiate later and
that the reader thinks oh and more of it
must be a refutable claim let's see so
there are some in irrefutable claims you
sometimes see this kind of thing in
introductions right we study the
properties of this formal system you
know we describe the Wiswall system and
you know and we've used wizz was in
practice and you think we're going to
tell you about that and again does that
make you think this sounds fantastic
they're going to study the properties of
a formal system well no it's an
irrefutable hypothesis of course you are
going to study the properties of your
formal system if that's what your papers
introducing right you are not telling me
we do anything new but if you say
instead you know this is a sad this is a
type system we are going to prove you
know we're going to prove that it's you
know type-checking is the tax system is
sound
you know they's you know progress and
preservation and that type checking is
decidable
well now you said something right and
put presumably in an earlier bullet
you've said something about that it's a
type system with some somewhat ambitious
aims do you see the difference right so
it must be you must state in your
contribution something which could be
false you know state in the
contributions things that could be false
got it I think that's really important
and it's surprising how often people
don't do that even when they do have
contribution sections are you with it
any other any observations
I want to notice one other thing here is
that I've um I brought forward
references in this language of these
bullets I've got these forward
references to sections in the paper so
and I did that here do you see here
who's been precisely Section four Bravo
discussing section five and six in
contrasting section seven and what that
says is what you should not do is have a
often you seen introductions motivation
contributions and then the rest of this
paper is structured as follows in
Section two we do this at section three
we do that how many of you read that
read that paragraph yes well you know
about 50% of papers do this and when you
read it are you thinking wow section two
is going to be about this I'm so filled
right do read that section you read that
paragraph very carefully you skip it
don't you everybody skips it and it's on
page one which is your most precious
page so don't waste those precious bytes
on the front page with stuff that nobody
is going to read instead instead of this
stuff you see putting it in the
narrative like I was doing here here and
here
now these have a much different status
but now you're making claims and for
every claim you're giving a forward
reference to we're in the paper you're
going to substantiate that claim and
that is genuinely helpful to reviewers
because they can look at the claims and
if you don't have the forward reference
they say well I wonder where in the
paper I would find substance for this so
they leave through it and they miss it
right you want to say it's precisely as
you can where the evidence is and that
then that's actually useful and it comes
so naturally into the flow of something
like this it's really good strongly
recommend this yes this is what's on
page one yeah we're still on page one
so these contributions can't spread too
long either you've got to sort of
compress them to say what what yeah
we're still on page one yeah right
version of these like saying we have a
thing that you have to cut down when you
are
I mean shrinking the paper because most
of these things also
safe I mean don't ask to down for
it ring the people
oh you hunk of this to show you the
paper this is page one happening in ordi
yeah it's tough it's you have eight
pages you've got ten pages of text this
is the page you cannot shrink one page
which is mostly a third of which is
title and authors is what you've got to
state your contributions and the problem
don't shrink that don't try to put your
payload on on page one I think because
this is the bit that people will read
right and so you have to have enough
content here that they know whether to
carry on you know it's tough for the
rest I know but then you have only got
seven pages left
but it's your specification it's the
driving force for the whole paper
actually you can use it for garbage
collection as well right so if you find
that well what do we have right each
claim in the introduction is pointed to
and then you find section four is not
referred to at all from the list of
contributions
so maybe section four is dead code it
could be a good way to shrink your paper
right all you think are now section four
is really important because I make a
contribution in it in which case you
might add to your contribution list
should I mean this is the universal rule
I have papers in which I don't have
sections that are playing an important
role that I don't refer to from the
intro but it's a good first step is to
say is every section referred to and if
not why not
yeah extended abstracts and notes and we
only have four or five pages oh yes so
if you've only got four or five pages
now you're into territory where you know
whole pages like 20% of your paper you
have to uh it but probably a somewhat
different medium you may have to
compress it somehow so I suppose I'm
thinking maybe I really mean ten percent
of your paper rather than exactly one
page yeah and I mean the big thing I'm
trying to say here is think about that
page one think of it is that as a
driving force for your paper and think
about your readers and the fact that
that's the time you've got to get them
and that applies to any any media blog
post to actually people scan the
beginning of a blog post wanna know
whether to carry on okay no all right so
we talked about this
oh and just when I talked about evidence
like the body of the paper is the
evidence by evidence I don't necessarily
mean data right it might be data might
be performance measurements it might be
theorems that you've proved but it might
also just be argumentation right a
substantial argument that explains why
your claim is holds you know so it's all
sorts of things might be a case study
might be illustrative examples might be
lots of examples that so I don't mean
any I don't mean anything toby crisp by
evidence i just mean it's the
substantiating part okay all right
so that's so much so we're still on page
one right where to where it's eleven
thirty three and we've only got to page
one and what comes next on many people's
contents list is related work all right
it seems that good scholarship what are
you going to do you're going to start
try to solve a problem the first thing
you to do is a scholarly understanding
of the state of the art in your in the
problem before you began that makes
sense doesn't it it's terrible just
terrible but this is what happens oh I
think you should put I'm going to
explain why I think you should put it at
the end and you may have to fight with
your advisor or supervisor about this
but there Hugo so here's why I think
it's difficult right remember the goal
is to convey your key idea right this
related work section is like a sand bar
or barrier between your reader and your
key idea your goal is to get you know my
idea from for my head to focus head as
fast as possible and if I put a say
before I can tell you about my idea for
I first of all have to tell you about
you know the notion of transactions from
brown and modified for distributing
systems and and you know dealing with
differential privacy and so forth and
you're thinking I have no clear what any
of this is about so am I really going to
pay attention to Simon so there are
several difficulties with this so the
first is that it makes them makes your
readers
think feel stupid all right let's see so
let me see how can I put this yeah so
you're faced with the compromise you got
you're you're writing the paper you're
writing this related work section and it
keeps getting longer because to do a
good job of describing related work it
takes a little while all right and then
you think but now that you know it's
going to be three or four pages before
we get to my idea so I'll shrink it so
you remove every alternate sentence
right and now you sort of squished it
now it becomes much harder to understand
all right and it's because after you
finished your paper your reader will
have a lot more intellectual scaffolding
they'll have more vocabulary they'll
have more examples they'll just have
more stuff in their head that will make
the the state of the art comprehensible
to them moreover by the time you get to
the end you also will have explained
your idea so that you're it's easy to
make a smooth comparison between what
you've done and what they've done why
was in related work at the beginning
you're sort of forced into an uneasy
compromise about about saying well this
is the state of the art and we're going
to improve in the following way but I
haven't got to haven't told you yet what
we're going to do it all your no clue
what I'm going to do so it's very very
uneasy and and so so and then your
reader is reading this stuff and they
feel stupid because they don't
understand it why don't they understand
it but it's not their territory
primarily and because you've compressed
it to make it short and they feel tired
because they tried to wade through this
stuff they thought maybe I need to know
this to understand the paper which is
probably false so if you're tired so by
the time they get to the idea they're a
bit worn out they're not their tails are
not wagging coming sense yeah so so I
just think it's much what works much
better to put it at the end right so if
you put it back here then you have all
the scaffolding you can make smooth
comparisons and and you're good to go
that is not to say that on this earlier
part you should ignore related work
right so imagine that you're explaining
something just to somebody on the
whiteboard right you're going to say
well you know here's the problem
and here is the first way that you might
think to approach it and you know you're
probably going to describe you know a
pathway to your idea and that pathway is
bound to be using ideas that you've you
know from the Giants on whose shoulders
you are standing and even on the
whiteboard you might say this is an idea
that you know Mike burrows divert when
he you know and he developed B zip but
certainly in a talk you could have a
little you know square brackets
Burroughs 93 just on the side it need an
inform part of your soundtrack it just
reassures your audience certainly your
knowledgeable part of your audience that
you do actually know that this is
standard work you could say it standard
work right but the the goal is for this
initial part describe the problem
describe your idea
it's an exposition in which you're
taking the reader to your idea by the
most direct path right and the most
direct path will involve some mention of
related work and you should absolutely
mention that describe it in as much
detail as is necessary to get to idea
and incidentally giving credit where
credit is due
but your focus is leading your own
reader by the hand to the to your idea
it is not at that stage on giving credit
to the the related work does that make
sense so it's where your focus lies now
when you get to write the related work
section which you absolutely must I mean
so in talks that there may not be time
in a paper that you you know it really
is essential scholarship to have related
work to your paper is so here is
something which you often find in
related work sections that the you know
the you you read it and it sounds a bit
as if the author is saying well you know
brown and white to this but it turned
out to be really hopeless and you know
green and and blue did this and that was
pretty hopeless to it now but my idea is
fantastic but so so they're sort of not
exactly denigrating but somehow you know
the opposition wasn't really very good
but life isn't like that so but it is if
I have um you know 20 pounds in my
pocket here we are
well I'm money in my wallet so if I give
this to Fraser right there you can take
a temporary Fraser
so I'm now ten pounds poorer and Fraser
is 10 pounds richer what a transaction
is taking place it's a sort of zero-sum
game
but only a hand if I um you know Fraser
is friend of mine and I give him love
right and friendship am I the poor for
it
do I have less love to give to other
people no love is a sort of infinitely
divisible commodity isn't that amazing
it's one of the wonderful things about
human beings is that we can you know you
give love and you get more it's kind of
like the exact reverse of money and
credit is like that right so if you give
credit to other people and you explain
how clever they were and how inspiring
their work was to you then that doesn't
make you look bad at all
so obviously don't be sick of Fanta Q no
don't say you know you're probably my
reviewer so I'm going to say really nice
things about you but just just you know
express your heart right if you if you
feel good about a paper because it
really was inspiring to you just take a
moment to say it was an inspiring paper
you know it was it was seminal it really
led to a lot for you say that and and
that you know that of course makes them
feel good but it makes it it brings
credit to the whole field I think okay
the other thing of course is when you're
talking about related work and
comparisons is that computer science is
a very multi-dimensional subject right
you know up even you're just thinking
about programs they may run faster they
may be they may be they may run in less
space they may be simpler to understand
or more complicated to understand they
may be written in you know some suitable
language or run in certain environments
so it's very very multi-dimensional it's
very rare to find that your work is sort
of better in every dimension than
somebody else's right so what you don't
want to do is to say is to just focus on
the areas where you're better you say
well that'll an X and I'm better and why
and what Palio that I'm actually not so
good on that right so because what you
want to avoid is your viewers saying the
authors appear to be unaware that their
system is completely hopeless when
applied to Zed right that's that's
that's a bad thing for a reviewer to be
able to say it's quite disarming if you
say
of course our system really doesn't work
in situations ed well at all you better
use some other system for that it's very
difficult to make something that's
brilliant at everything okay
so it's not just honesty and good
scholarship it's actually disarming and
and you know it helpful for readers if
you explain where your not so good as
well as where you're great because how I
sense so it's actually it's easy you
just gotta tell the way it is I mean
yeah when you tear that weaknesses at
the end of the related work so in your
later work section you're saying here
are these other things and you can do a
sort of comparative evaluation I mean
either as you go along or maybe at the
end you could say weaknesses of our
approach or something but somewhere
towards the end yeah yes and try to
avoid the kind of related work section
that says brown and white did X green
and blue did this and sort of one
sentence about each that more or less is
no more than a list of citations but
doesn't give any value judgment you
might not even have read the paper right
you try to provide some evidence that
you actually know what's in that paper
and that you value it yes what about the
threats to validity session where do you
go down connects to validity tell me a
bit about what you mean you have an
approach but your approach is not sound
it works in particular situations it's
not it is not because you're comparing
with somebody in yeah but it's better
it's just your solution doesn't define
jigglers right so you've got an ax which
is good for cutting down trees but not
very good for chopping vegetables yeah
so say this yeah that's sort of weird oh
so I would my instinct is always to
you're leading to the idea right you
might want to say on your path you might
like to say you know we're going to
focus on building on cutting down trees
and we vegetables are important as we
discuss in related work right so as you
go on your path your forward referencing
to your related work section or your
evaluation section to say yeah I know I
know we don't do everything and I'm
going to discuss more there but I don't
want to get derailed right here so for
referencing all this and then you would
have a sort of a slightly because it's
easier to do that big picture sort of
you know were we in the vast firmament
of computer science when you have all
the scaffolding that make sense
what else okay so related work well so
now that was them let's see so we still
haven't done the payload of the paper
we've done introduction and related work
we have done much of the paper but in
some ways the the body of the paper kind
of writes itself that's not the stuff
that's so so hard to write so the only
thing I really wanted to say about this
middle chunk is think about your readers
and this is a bit similar to what
they're saying about giving a good talk
try not to recapitulate your journey you
were wandering in a maze filled with
blind alleys and Dragons and you know
rotating knives which you wandered into
right and it's rather tempting to lead
your reader into the you know the
alleyway with the rotating knives just
to see how they get chopped up as well
and I've read papers in which I have
plowed through a page and a half of
technical material thinking this is
essential and then at the end they say
does that turned out to be a really bad
idea we have a much simpler approach
it's really annoying when you do that
right really annoying
see that's what the paper is for is to
avoid the heavy lunch at so don't we
capitulated journey just lead them
straight to the goodness there is an
exception to that if you're wandering
through you know you're taking your Vita
by the hand and you're leading them
through the maze and you go past this
door and through the door you see this
vista of gardens and flowers and honey
bees and lions and lambs lying down
together and you just these imposters if
you had been noticed and the reader is
thinking have you read a paper like that
you think why didn't you do the obvious
thing like why are you doing this
complicated thing so there is sometimes
when you really have to stop and say you
know you might think that this pathway
would be a good one but actually doesn't
work at all for the following reason or
you know that's elaborated somewhere
else again you don't to get to do world
we're just acknowledging when there is a
very obvious Avenue that you're not
taking why you're not taking it is a
good thing or you could say somebody
else took it and it's described very
well in this excellent paper that I'll
discuss a bit more but in related work
but it turns out that doesn't work very
well in the setting that I'm interested
in which is this and on you go does that
make sense
yeah
I think that it's also kind of I mean
there should be like a trade-off between
reproducibility of your paper make your
idea I mean like some other people
things that is possible to reproduce
your work yes because for example if
there are like I mean sometimes I agree
with you on these that you have to show
your idea but maybe it's okay also to
put like a paragraph not someone can
escape like thank implementation tickets
oh I mean they read are kind of sleepy
but are you filming but if it's another
student like me I mean the student maybe
need details in order to continue
working oh yes so so when I say you know
you want to present your idea I do mean
you want to present it it's a paper
right you want to present it in enough
detail that somebody could actually
deploy it and use them use it themselves
and that means you know you need a bit
of detail right that's what the body of
the paper is for so it might be you
might say here some implementation
details you might say look there's a
whole section about implementation you
know a little bit later in the paper
that gives more detail so I think of it
as being somebody might read the papers
there might be the introduction they
might get to the idea I think that's an
interesting idea but actually I'm not
interesting up in the details to plow
through this so then they jump to the
next paper so you're almost wherever
they get off the bus they've taken
something valuable away with them yeah
but don't leave out the meat that's
right so I'm not talking about just a
high level general idea stuff you want
to get to the meat it's a paper
it's got content yeah just fine you
about just getting all of these details
that most of the readers won't be
interested in and just sending all of
that to the supplementary material
because that's someone I've seen several
papers doing that yeah yeah so usually
you're constrained by length one way and
another right so you end up putting as
much material in as will fit in the
length constraints you're given and the
rest in supplementary material and so I
mean a classic example as you state a
theorem you may give a brief proof
sketch and you say you know the full
proof is worked out in detail the
supplementary material who can see the
code
in the supplementary material all days
you know much yeah so it's a trade-off I
would but it's pretty much always
constrained by length right what you can
fit you probably want anything that's
why all papers always end up hard
against the length limit do you keep
stuffing stuff in but it's good to have
a an appendix and reference the appendix
even if it doesn't get published you can
cite it with a link yeah simplifying
something so shouldn't I shoulder either
how difficult it was so they can
appreciate how oh yes yes yes this is so
the the best ideas are the simple ones
and sometimes a paper seems so simple
right that the reader thinks well that
wasn't very hard water but a silly paper
of hey that's your that's always your
worry right so you might want to show
them the awful chopped up limbs of the
previous people who wandered into the
the alley so it's that's actually quite
difficult right because it's um because
because it falls straight into this trap
of saying well I'm going to show you
something simple but he reversed
complicated things that I tried so it's
probably more convincing if you say he
reversed complicated ways that other
people tried but you can go and read
their paper but I'm going to give you a
much simpler way of tackling maybe not
exactly the same problem but I found a
way to recast the problem so that it
does have a simple solution but I I
would urge you probably not as a first
approximation not to drag them through
the complications or maybe illustrate a
complication or something say you know
this is just a show how bad it could be
if we didn't do that something like that
yeah ok let's see yes
so intuition and examples all right and
and the even if you skip the details you
take away something valuable this is a
good lesson to take from a paper it's
also a good lesson to think about when
you read somebody else's paper if I you
know I've left this paper I've only read
half of it have I taken anything away or
was it an investment that is essentially
yielded me nothing because I didn't
actually have enough stamina to get to
the real payload doesn't mean you want
to do this sort of gradual thing of
always offering something
conveying intuition is primary I keep
talking about examples so instead of
starting with let's see what was this
yes instead of starting with some
general statement that you then
specialize and give examples well just
like with a talk start with an example
so that you get the kind of intuitive
idea of what's going on and then you
could say here's one example here's
another example and now I've managed to
extract a general case so even if
somebody only gets to the examples and
does not even understand the notation in
which you've written the general case
they've still got some intuitive feel
about the problem you're trying to solve
and how you're chopping it alright for
examples examples examples at examples
first same thing in the papers for a
talk so here's a here's an example of me
doing this in my paper this was some
another paper about some while ago this
is section 2 at which I'm doing the
setup of explaining the problem and
again four lines into the setup right
I'm off with an example that I then use
as an illustration for the whole of that
background section to say what problem
is that I'm trying to solve and why it's
an interesting one yes we talked about
recapitulation the journey good right
aim is to go and last point okay this is
about your readership now of course
we've been concentrating on you as an
author but trying to think about the
audience and but it's good to one kind
of use your audience particularly to get
help with guinea pigs so a guinea pig is
a person who reads your paper and gives
you feedback like now of course the
ideal guinea pig is already an expert in
your field and has been following your
work and is really keen to read your
next paper these these are hard to find
but you have quite a lot of friends
probably you know just colleagues other
research students in your department
other colleagues that you work with in
some form or some way or another and so
you can ask them to just read your paper
and say what they thought of it now so
two things about that one is it's like
performing an experiment on a you know
in a lab on a guinea pig you know you
have a guinea pig you would sort of
inject the drug and you see if the
guinea pig sort of falls over dead or
whether it sort of leaps about
right but if you have and then you go to
refine the drug based on you're going to
rewrite the paper in the light of that
feedback if you use all your guinea pigs
on day one you don't get them all they
all fall over dead right then you'll
know how many left but when you've done
the new version now you might think well
I could just ask my friend to read it
again but nobody can read your paper for
the first time twice stands the reason
right and that first time is really
important so by the time they read it
another time they read it completely
differently when you're reading a you
know a new draft of the same paper you
sort of skip and you you say I think
I've read that before it's totally
different experience to reading for the
first time so just use your guinea pig
sparingly you kind of use them one at a
time and that also is another thing
about writing early right if you started
early and you have drafts early you can
use your guinea pigs if you haven't
started until a week before the deadline
well you know you can barely use guinea
pigs at all okay so an even non-expert
guinea pigs are quite helpful like
people who are you know not even expert
in your particular field these should be
able to make sense of the first few
sections right if they're go too
motivated because you're they're your
friend all right they might not
understand all the technical details but
it's really important with your guinea
pigs is to explain what you want because
I tell you it's an invariable quantum
property of guinea pigs that they will
tell you about spelling and grammar
first that's what they will do they'll
say you will give you back Babel lots of
markup about you know I would have put a
comma here you're not interested in that
at this stage you are interested in when
they ceased understanding right but they
will not tell you that unless you look
them in the eye Johnny and Anita and
Anita right gonna look you in the eye
and e2 and say I really want you to tell
me when you get lost in this paper you
know because it's my fault not yours if
you get lost at least in the first few
pages right and I've got to make Annie
to believe that so that she will tell me
because once you know that and then the
dialogue then you start a dialogue like
so I got lost you know halfway down page
two I thought I was I was okay and then
I got completely lost and then you have
a dialogue you start watching the
whiteboard you do diagrams you say what
I really meant was this and then he says
Oh
that was what you meant and you think ah
done I just got to write that down
it's amazing all you have to do is to
literally write down the things that you
end up saying to your friend but you
will find you explain it much better
interactively than you do on paper so
it's a it's very important I think not
to just give it to somebody and get
written feedback but to give it to
somebody and say just put it 1 mark
where you get lost and then we'll talk
about it that's my advice okay
of course you know the better qualify
they are the more they know the field
the better because they can get further
through your paper so that's that's all
good yeah but the key thing is to get
this sort of initial initial feedback
you can try and get feedback from people
further away who really do know what
they're talking about what one wonder
you can do is to send people even people
you don't know maybe you just met them
once or twice at a conference or
something you've bowled up and said that
was interesting so here's my paper and
you know you featuring related work like
I just want to would you you know could
you have a quick look just check if I um
you know if I presented your work fairly
people send me a paper like that I think
well at least I take a look like after
all they they're mentioning me so um
it's it's variable how well this works
but another nothing you can do is a it's
when you're at a conference you are you
know there's some important person who's
giving a talk that you really think was
a good talk you enjoyed and you learnt
something from then you know introduce
yourself afterwards and say I thought
that was a really you know enjoyable
talk I learned a lot from it maybe ask
them a question you just form a little
relationship with them it doesn't
necessarily need to lead to anything but
um but you know then another nice thing
about computer science is that almost
everybody is open to conversations with
absolutely anybody provided they've got
something to talk about
and there's something to talk about is
the easiest place to start with is
something that they've said if you walk
up and say can I tell you about my
research there then they think well how
long is this going to take like if you
say you can ask a question about your
talk that's that yeah this is all more
bounded thing so it's a it's all part of
this interaction okay let's see the
other thing is that when you get
reviews and this is this is sort of more
at the end of the pipeline you submitted
your paper and it's rejected right and
your reviews you know make totally
unjustified criticisms and you you're
sort of bleeding
alright that's really hard or even when
you know Anita's criticized my paper
right do it do I do I say Anita you're
really stupid you know so somehow you
have to be to be grateful for critique
now why should you be grateful well one
is you might be able to use it to
improve your paper but another is this
remember about love that was infinitely
divisible what about time not infinitely
divisible in fact absolutely unfun jabal
as we were talking about three days ago
so if somebody be it a reviewer or you
know one of your guinea pigs has given
you the gift of an hour of their time to
read your paper and in the case of a
referee to sit down and write a review
that is a free gift that they are giving
you that they will never have again that
hour for them is gone they're just an
hour closer to being dead so they are
giving you a gift and you should rejoice
in that gift and say thank you right so
sometimes you know reviewers are really
young you know sometimes reviewers are
stupid right sometimes who hears
genuinely ill-informed and simply you
know are just not qualified to write
about it and just say wrong things but
that's pretty rare mostly reviewers kind
of misunderstand something and so when
you finish bleeding from your reviews
look at them again and instead of saying
stupid reviewer you know you shouldn't
have been allowed to review this paper
instead say how could I write the paper
so that not even this idiot could make
that mistake okay that's a constructive
approach is not easy this is very not
easy but it's important yeah well how do
you handle adversarial reviews I mean
they they they come back to you though
in written you don't know who they're
from
and well suppose you'll handle them like
this you say you know is this criticism
justified could I change the paper so
that it would be you know is it a
misunderstanding or is it
simply you know sometimes you get review
that just says I just don't agree with
this idea it's a it's an it's not a good
approach right and you know what can I
do about that
right so sometimes you just have to
ignore it nothing you can do right but
um but it's rare that they're actually
aggressive usually they're come together
with them you know with things that they
didn't like or they can make better it's
not not invariably yeah oh what did you
suspect a review hasn't read your paper
well I think that's vanishingly we're
actually or maybe maybe not in your
experience but I don't think I've ever
read a review that I felt was from
somebody who had not read the paper by
and large in this thing computer science
I think people are pretty conscientious
about reviewing and yeah I don't know
said that have you has that happened to
you know is that ever happened to
anybody
okay so let's not debug that problem it
really is where I mean they might've
misunderstood they might be informed
they almost certainly will read it so
thanking that is important right so at
the end of your paper it's worth taking
those two lines at the end just to say
thank you anonymous reviewers if you had
guinea pigs who you know who they are
mention them my name right it's it's
very cheap and it's what that's the
spreading the love thing the anonymous
reviewers it's just that it's kind of
like just polite but then they're not
actually gonna pin it on their wall okay
oh so that's so that's it here's here's
my um summary 1201 very good seven
things you can do that will help you
write better papers there we go any
other questions two observations because
yes I'm all that stands between you and
lunch really on time but do do do have a
go at you know for following some of
these I've sort of tried to make them
actionable things you can actually do
rather than just aspire to it most be in
it and know whether you're doing them or
not
you may have to fight with your advisor
