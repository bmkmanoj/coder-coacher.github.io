and yet we feel that we are not making the best use
of that technology and that data. 
We saw a real possibility to use all of the expertise
that we have in the building around machine learning, computer
vision, to assess and diagnose the progression of multiple sclerosis.
Multiple Sclerosis is currently assessed by a Neurologist using
a clinical standardized rating scale and this is where
technology has a real strength.
The role of machine learning is to find an automated way
to classify the patient's condition, given a certain set of movements.
We're not trying to replace the Neurologist or the Nurse
what we're trying to do instead is to provide some data that
is going to make the expert make a better assessment. 
We worked with a team at Novartis Pharma AG
who helped us understand what kinds of things are needed
in clinical trials and how it is that we go about
partnering with clinics.
What we've been able to do in this collaboration
is work with university hospitals, Microsoft Research
as well as our own Novartis research teams
to bring together the best talent needed to 
completely change the paradigm.
Assess MS System provides a consistent quantified 
measure of motor ability over time. 
It's there to really help the doctor to help the patient to make
the best decisions they can about their treatment.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
