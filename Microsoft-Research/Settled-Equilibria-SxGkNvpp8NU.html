introduce rajan-virus if you are not
from economics larger is the one of the
most influential economist generation
let me give you a few ideas of what he's
done ah so job market is Jana was about
the game played on a graph and many
people here today know a lot about the
such a gay a social network games and I
can take you and show you how it grew
out from Rogers paper to Jackson and
others and now it's a huge literature
algorithmic game theory other areas
before I did that hippie analysis of
lexicographic fixed point theory which
later led into the concept of popular
equilibrium which was the most powerful
refinement of non-equilibrium now you're
not doing this but the lecture today
will be a continuation in the literature
of the most of Rogers well-known
contributions and for which he won the
Nobel Prize the 2007 of empires in
economics our for the work you did on
bayesian games and applications which
led to the theory of mechanism design
options and many things applications to
regulations things of that type which
almost every paper and half of the paper
not go in the game theory today start by
citing some of the papers
since then Roger have done tremendous
amount of American political science
both putting it on theoretical formal
foundations using game theory economic
concept but also real great work in
political science so it's a real treat
and a pleasure to interview thank you
tomorrow I stand up and present a
critique of the Declaration of
Independence but that's another story I
know this is this I'm this work with
with Jurgen Vale where we're working on
a problem of refinement of Nash
equilibrium of a problem that goes back
to work on the paper we're most building
on is a hood coal eyes paper with dove
salmon on persistent equilibrium let me
advertise that I think we take that idea
and I think we are generating something
that's more powerful a more powerful
refinement in certain senses that than
that but that I'm not convinced we've
gone all the way we've gone as far as I
can see but but I for example if
somebody really understands index index
the theory of index numbers of regular
fixed points better than I do and I
really don't understand it this is
that's the mathematics I always thought
was going to be relevant for this and
I'll say that now and the maybe at the
end but people who do understand it
better than I do seem to think no our
papers about something else but that's
okay and so there's more to do okay so
so every we want we won't get very far
away from the battle of sexes game
that's that's that's that kind of
refinement lecture I just it's very nice
to this it's it's what is it it's 2013
and we're talking about the fibers of
Nash equilibrium glad to have that going
on and and and i'm i'm not sure why
microsoft should want me to come and
talk about it if i but i but but but
it's not
my father at the hoods fault they they
hired a hood as the stuff and I had to
come and talk to her about it so here I
am and I think it is important and and
there might be I cannot say that there
isn't something some idea here that
might not be extremely valuable in a
Microsoft product and if there is it's
all Microsoft I give it a give i waive
all rights to all profitable
applications of these ideas okay so the
battle of sexes game had three
equilibria the pure equilibria and the
mixed equilibrium I'll it may take a
little while but I'll give you an
example where we can have an analog
where all the equilibria will be an
analog of battle of sexes in some sense
in which all the equilibria mix so this
is not a question of pure versus mixed
it's something else my intuition this
paper is that if this game is played
only once at the mixed equilibrium court
is is one where each player's sixty
percent of the time playing the the pure
strategy he or she like for the for the
corner he or she likes better and forty
percent of the time playing the other
one arm and there's a certain symmetry
that might lead you to the randomized
strategy equilibrium but the but but i
believe that and this is just this is my
intuition I'm not I'm telling you where
we're where I'm starting and I can't
disagree we would just disagree but but
I think in in societies where this game
has played a lot well if you repeat a
game if you and I repeat again that's a
repeated game but I mean a culturally
familiar game is one where you and I are
playing this skate this is our
interaction but lots of other people who
are like you and me have done it
similarly we know the tradition we know
what's been going on and after a while I
think they are likely to converge to
either the a or the be possibly
context-dependent of shellings focal
point and effect tell you know but I'd
say all kinds of environmental variables
might be it but we'd learn how to
converge to those equilibria and in
particular this is just played
generically then we will you learn to
play the AAA delivering the BB
equilibrium in our society that's my
axiom so I'm looking for refinements
that will rule out this equilibrium but
keep these two that's that's what I'm
looking for uh it's not to me it's not
about Pareto optimality some sort of
learning stability now the totally mixed
equilibrium is perfect in the sense of
Zeldin proper in the sense of my paper
and it's stable and sense of kohlberg
burnt ends hood was asking me did I know
Wilson and Govind ins latest stable and
by the way that's a good question you
can just say to people anytime because
they're my image they've been working
very productively for a long time and
there's probably a new cysts you know
what any given day there's probably a
new one but I believe they're working in
this they've been generally work in this
tradition and so I believe that they
would not rule out this equilibrium if
that if they're staying in that
tradition there is a tradition that
ruled out and that's coli and Salmonella
librium was really the was has been for
many years the one major solution
concept in the literature of him as I
surveyed it in my 1991 book they kalaya
and sama was the only concept I knew of
that for this game would say the mixed
equilibrium know the pure equilibria yes
for this okay but persistent a related
idea by my co-author your convey bowl
laws with Kaushik Basu is the idea of
curb sets now I'll give those
definitions but minimal curb sets and
persistent equilibria for other four
games that are very similar going to
show you an example to that that's just
sort of an elaboration of the Battle of
sexes game and I believe salmon Cole I
knew way back when that it was easy to
take a game where they did something and
change it in an e relevant way what
seems like it should be a minor way and
suddenly persistence doesn't doesn't
exclude anything anymore so my goal is
to exclude the uncoordinated equilibria
for more games than persistence does
while maintaining general existence of a
refined equilibrium that's also proper
my proper equilibria was shown by by
eric van damme to correspond to a
sequential equilibrium of any extensive
game that could map down to this normal
form game and so consistency with
sequential rationality is guaranteed if
you can satisfy properness in it so so
we want to have a general gist
of a proper equilibrium that satisfies
our refinement as klein samet did but we
want to succeed in eliminating more
things than coli and salmon today or
eliminating something and games that
they couldn't okay um I cannot claim
that my are settled equilibria will be a
subset of persistent Tinkler I just
don't know but but so the claim is it
gets rid of bad equilibria or what we
gets rid of some equilibria in more
games it's in that sense is more
powerful not necess I don't I don't have
the theorem I don't have a counter
example right off have there always
exists a property and the solution call
solution concept for which I will start
the fully settled equilibria they will
be a subset of proper equilibrium eight
and or interest and interesting generic
class of strategic form games that there
will be they will be there will be I'm
sorry though a non vacuous asset that
open set of strategic forum games for
which they are a proper subset of proper
libera that they refine proper and
subsystems they actually eliminate them
okay so let's get the formalities and
get serious I start with a strategic
forum game all I'm talking about is
finite strategic forum games finitely
many players each player is a non-empty
finite set of strategies called SI and
that's it's important to keep that
straight because we s will always mean
the set of all strategies for a player
or the Cartesian product just asks is
the set of all pure strategies for all
players there's utility every player's
utility function specifies is pay off as
a function of what everybody does is
expect utility payoff Delta is the set
of probability distributions Delta vesa
is the private institutions over si and
will let em kind of looks like the kind
of two triangles there the the set of
mixed strategy profiles / / / / the
products that which is the Cartesian
product of the individual and so and so
of course we can easily extend our
utility functions for 22 mixed strategy
profiles in the in the obvious way
everybody's randomizing independently
and this notation is your payoff when
your player I and you do si while
everybody else is
sig out my by the way I I don't know my
co-author sure should have made me take
these out but in my game theory book I
invented a notation where brackets
something meant square bracket meant the
probability distribution puts
probability of 1 so this formally is a
mixed strategy so that's really a mixed
strategy profile although mr or ms I is
coming at the end anyway um that's okay
so Nash equilibrium of course is any
mixed strategy profile where any one
player could not gain by deviating 20
pure strategy and therefore couldn't
gain to any mixed strategy either a
little above em means the set of totally
mixed strategy profiles okay let's see
so the definition of proper equilibrium
is right here it's a mouthful but let's
see what it says a mixed strategy
profile is epsilon proper in G if first
of all it's a totally mixed strategy
profile everything has positive
probability and you give me any player
and any two strategies of that player if
s is worse than our against what the
other players behaving according to
Sigma strictly worse then player I
should be putting everything has
positive probability you make mistakes
so some stress this is clearly a mistake
relative to our s is a mistake relative
to our for player I but SI the
probability of s I was going to be less
than epsilon times the probability of RI
and that's the definition of an epsilon
proper mixed strategy profile and a
proper equilibrium as i define it in the
70s was a limit of any of epsilon proper
strategy profiles as epsilon goes to
zero and vandam as i said proved in the
80s the proper equilibrium of g
corresponds to a sequel sequential
equilibrium in everything any extensive
game that has G as its normal form I
should say my definition of proper
equilibrium preceded the definition of
sequential equilibrium and when I saw
sequentially cooler I thought you know
that that's kind of what I was thinking
about and I you know that I had an
intuition but I this this theorem was
sort of what i was thinking of and some
obviously in completely inarticulate and
incoherent way
the hard part of course is in most of
economic mathematical economic theory is
figuring out how to make precise
something you kind of have a vague
intuition about and vandam figured out
the you know put these ideas together
and it oh yeah i kind of obviously I
didn't know that but I this for me this
theorem motivated this definition this
definition just as even though I didn't
know the definition of sequential
equilibrium before I kind of had some
idea that was incoherent that somebody
the stomach like crepes and Wilson ought
to define something I have that property
probably see I published 1977 i was
working around 74 75 and i was thinking
about extensive games i would say you
know what should sort of do the right
thing in extensive games then and then
eventually figured crepes and wilson
defined what what's doing the right
thing in extensive games and then van
damme proved that this idea that Myerson
had you know kind of does the right
things consistent doing everything the
sense of games yeah there's a lot of
work there i'm not saying i was i that
that that's been damned stare it's not
my theorem but it's a theorem that
justifies proper equilibrium and i just
as a historical aside since which 2013
and and you introduced me as an old
geezer i should tell you that back in
the other previous millennium this is an
example of somebody who did something
that you know was motivated by something
that came later and it was I mean that's
it anyway okay so blocks okay now what's
new so what's up and I thought I got
this term block from from Horace on
ian's Elton but now I can't find where
they used it or maybe so maybe I made it
up but but uh but will but my co-author
Jurgen was willing to go along with it
and so he and I call a block any
Cartesian product of non-empty subsets
of people's pure strategies and any
block is associated with a block game G
is the given game in G sub T if T is a
block is the game where you're sort of
where you're restricted to stay within
your ti subset of strategies we're going
to
the mixed strategies of the block game
formerly we can just embed them back mt
is i mean is not the cart is not the
cartesian product of probably solutions
over the t is it's it's the set of mixed
strategies for the whole game that
happened to get probability zero to
anything outside of outside of the t is
that's so mt is a subset of ms the
epsilon neighborhood of course is just
the ones where everything has positive
probability and the support of a
distribution of course is a support of a
mixed strategy profile adjust the set of
strategies that have positive
probability we say the support is anna
block if fun all the probability all the
positive privately strategies are in the
block okay so I so envy able to find a
curb set which stood for closed under
rational behavior if something where if
everybody stays within it um every
player as long as everyone is staying
within the block t every player find
this is the best he can do over s is a
subset of teak and all of his best
responses every all player eyes best
responses in the whole strategy space
are within team when as long as we all
behave within the block all of us all of
our best responses are within the block
kalai and salmon week and then straight
they hit their work was earlier and they
had a concept that's pretty damn close
and actually we kind of follow their
idea a little more closely than the
fables curb set idea on the one hand
they're only asking that that there's
that within T player I should be able to
find a best response so that's weaker
than this condition saying all best
responses within to just some best
responses within t but we want that to
be true for every strategy every stigma
in an epsilon neighborhood of empty
those you're allowed to make epsilon
probability of doing any one thing
outside of the neighbor outside of tea
but so that that's a stronger condition
we want so it's it's that they're not
strictly comparable oh baby they are L
say any curb set is absorbing I'm wrong
they are clear they're comparable a curb
set is absorbing okay so absorbing block
and an equilibrium is persistent if it's
contained in a minimal absorbing
tracked a writ of absorbing blog they
use the word retrack but and fact at any
absorbing block contains a proper
equilibrium of the original game and
therefore there exists at least one
equilibrium that's both proper and
persistent that's collide Sam its result
so as advertised a persistence for the
battle sexist game it limit Lee let's
look a little take a quick second look
at the pack at the BET battle of sexes
game if we're both playing our bees then
or theirs with all probability almost
one then but then both of us for sure
have a best response to play his or her
be and therefore it's it's it's an
absorbing set and you can't get any
smaller than one by one so it's a
minimal absorbing set so of course oh
and of course so of course that the
totally mixed strategy profile which has
support on the whole whole whole game is
not contained within in any minimal
absorbing set and therefore it's it's
not persistent but the pure strategies
are so here's here's an example which is
probably that you I think you had some
simply maybe we've reconstructed one of
your examples exactly but maybe its
spirit but I forget we take one of the
zero zeros and we unfolded in to say oh
that if they play a and B if player 1
plays a and player 2 plays be they don't
actually get 0 what they do is they go
off and have a sub game where they it's
a two-person zero-sum game sub game that
happens to have a unique solution the
equilibrium where the payoffs are the
value is 0 for both players and this
two-person zero-sum sub game that
shouldn't make any difference but it
does it makes a huge difference of the
Houthi so the equilibrium sort of unfold
this Oh what is it the a the AAA equal
the AAA a1 a2 equilibrium now player one
could randomized between the of taking
that game and I'm putting it back into
into normal forme and basically if
you're going to do B then does you know
you're not going to get into the sub
game so it doesn't matter if your player
one if your player player one you do a
you have to plan if I get into the
sub-game do I play it the X way or the Y
way well the answer is as long as I
don't go more than
three three quarters two or one quarter
more than three-quarters to hear more
than three-quarters probability here any
randomization in the middle of this will
leave player to thinking that she can't
profit by going for one of the one of
these two fours she wants to one of
those two fours if she knew where I was
going she would but as long as I
randomized doesn't have to be half half
but near half half then she doesn't want
to go there she wants to go the a and
it's an equilibrium but uh so there's
our two pure strategy equilibria have
become kind of their other they're mixed
of course but they're no longer so I
should say our proper equal this is
important the proper equilibrium
requires the proper equilibrium going to
have the property that if you that
you're going to do the right that even
in this game that has even if it has
zero probability you do the right thing
in the sub game because it's sequential
equilibrium we found ourselves the sub
game we should play sub game perfect
equilibrium sequential implies sub game
perfect so of course they happy playing
5050 and so the mechanics of the
definition I gave a proper equilibrium
takes a while to see how it works but
with that definition in fact it
discovers and it says up for proper
equilibrium have to randomize 50-50 why
is that because if player 1 didn't look
at equilibrium or player 1 randomizes
between these 2 and player 2 does that
that's one of these equilibria it's an
equilibrium as long as we're anywhere
between the probability of the top one
being between one quarter and three
quarters but if it were not 5050 then
whichever one has more probability let's
say this one had more than fifty percent
probability then between these two then
but it's just a little more than fifty
percent it'll be a mistake not for
player 2 not to do a two but this would
be a better mistake and this would be a
worse mistake will be mistake why was it
a mistake because you might get the four
you might get the minus four but if
player one is using this one more
frequently going here more figure there
then getting four more frequently than
minus four is better than getting minus
four more frequently than four with a
greater probability in for so of course
this is the better mistake than that and
therefore it should have infinitely more
probability but the distinction between
these two doesn't make any mustn't
matter unless player two is making a
mistake and if she's making this mistake
much more like
this mistake then player 1 strictly
prefers to get that for which means he
goes down and put it goes away so that
I've just told you the story of why
proper equilibrium says if player 1 were
not uh choosing exactly with equal
probability these two actions then
player two's would put much more pro for
the small probably should put our
mistakes would be much love would be
much smaller for the worst mistake than
for the the nuts of bad mistake and and
and that would make player one want to
reverse his priority and and and
therefore it can't be any proper
equilibrium so proper equilibrium
narrows things down but the only curb
set or absorbing block is the whole
strategy space just a cert because the
two the two pure strategy equilibria
that used to be if I'm if I'm if I were
only in this set this is what we're
hoping to stay in know then within this
sub-game with it within this block game
there's a there too pure strategy
equilibria but those are not equilibria
the original game if I want to peer
player two would prefer to go but you
know we'll go would want to go get the
four so it doesn't work so here's what
are we going to do let me just try to
summarize what worked what I think we're
trying to do at this stage where I've
shown you there's a problem and i'm
taking my initial intuition and all
needs to be formalized in the next few
slides okay i want to say in familiar
games our approaches then familiar games
what's going to really happen is some
players are going to think of some
strategies as being conventional or
normal and then they only think if it's
a culturally familiar game a game the
situation that people play a lot then
what's going to happen I think we
conjecture we suggest is the people
going to simplify the problem think of
some strategies as conventional or
normal and others then they just don't
even think about the others most of the
time conformity with such norms
simplifies people's decision-making and
life is complicated so I need things
simplified it we say lil whore which
suggests that any institution in life
you know is really a sustained in a
larger game by viewing some
unconventional action
as illegal and her which is end of life
I say this was his Nobel lecture that
that was based on the idea that a theory
of how do we sustain institutions is
really a theory of there's a larger game
we don't have to behave according to our
institutional rules in behaving within
the institution we agree not to if we're
playing the institution of chess we
agree only to make the chess moves in
fact it's physically possible for either
played any time to just knock off all
the pieces and that's and and we have
this meta game words that you know if I
do that you met in the real game of life
you'll treat me as you'll you know how i
will i'll be treated much worse by you
for the rest of our lives the mad and
knock the game over so we only move the
brook the way you're allowed to move a
rook and but it has to be you know that
so we assume thats a social conventions
a developer chord with the following
principles one is the rationality
restriction when people are generally
expected to act rationally within the
conventional norms unconventional
alternatives should not be advantageous
to them so once we and the other is a
simplification imperative that
conventional norms will tend to simplify
the game by excluding as many strategies
as possible subject to the rationality
restriction we're going to try to get
simpler and simpler views that was those
are our axioms not i'm just i have some
intuition behind them but i'm not
driving them from anything and but I've
added a word the word rationally here is
is the word that I've added that goes
it's going to enable us to go beyond a
cola and salmon we can relax the
definition of curbs and absorbing sets
by applying their best response
conditions only at Nash equilibria of
the blocking that's that's it that's the
idea though so I should it's two-thirty
I should've gotten this 25 minutes then
I should've said this in the first
minute we we're going to relax the
definitions of these curb sets from Vasu
able and and collide samet absorbing
sets by applying their best response
conditions only at Nash equilibria the
block game because we're saying when
people are generally expect that a curb
said are absorbing set was when people
generally expected to act within the
conventional norms unconventional dorm
should not be advantageous but I just
had no rationally with them it so
rationally means they're maximizing
given what others are doing relaxing the
rat that's the rationality restriction
by adding this word rationally in there
allows us to admit more blocks as
conventional norms and then the
simplification imperative is going to
say that when we go to a minimal
admissible blocks we're going to get a
stronger equilibrium because explore
things that's that's the whole road map
now let's go do it and by the way I
forgot to say my notes are now these
notes i just posted them exactly as they
are online and my webpage and they have
evolved as i just posted a revised
version of them a few minutes ago um
they're ahead of the paper the paper on
Jurgen and my web pages has different
concept there are a lot of different
ways you can do what we just said here
there's a lot of way to formalize and we
have torn our hair out trying to figure
what is the one two three or you know a
small number I'll give you three
definitions what's the what are right
ways to do it when and you don't want to
hear all of them but but on the other
hand I can't tell you I know exactly but
I think we're getting so I now think
today I'm going to tell you something
it's the version of this that's worth
most worth talking about but there are
other versions and we've explored them
in print okay the paper when we
reconsider the paper that exists has
random consideration set games in it now
we're I think I want to elevate it to
the main theme for this so that so the
main thing we're really elevate um so we
want to consider we want to assume that
players are very likely to consider only
the strategies in some conventional
block block as a block that's being
thought of as conventional but they
might see more or less of the game so a
random consideration set game in general
is defined by a vector of profile of
probability distributions one for each
player where each mu i is a probability
distribution over with CSI is the set of
all knock
empty subsets of player I your strategy
for consider C stands for consideration
set what you're in the game physically
you have a certain set of things that
you can do but maybe you don't think
about all of them you only consider some
of them you just ignore the rest and
which ones are you considering well mew
is a probability distribution and so so
considerations so the interpretations
each player is only going to consider
strategies and some independent random
consideration set that's a subset of his
pure so not if you subset of his pure
strategies where the probability that
what he considers is a subset RI is mu
I've are so now you have a game which
says you know what you're considering
and a mixed strategy profile is it is a
probability distribution that defines
given what you're considering what are
you going to do so it's a probably
distribution over RI and then we can say
and I'll say of course things that are
outside our I get probability 0 and yeah
exactly so it's defining a derived game
game game structure given the real game
G but we're going to analyze it as if
it's common knowledge but then we're
gonna look at sequences of these things
so so yeah I'm defining a game and when
you think about about that game itself
you're gonna think about it as if it's
common knowledge that's right which is
ridiculous because here you're only
thing about the substance strategies but
suddenly you know well you know
everything you need to know about
everything else in an equilibrium that
means you have you know the distribution
of other people's behavior but i'm going
to i'm not going to disallow you from
knowing everything about the
distribution but of course all you care
about is their actual behavior which
witch is which the equilibrium object
will summarize but yeah so we're going
to analyze it as if it's common
knowledge although that's a ridiculous
assumption but it isn't it's more than
is necessary
I said that better than I think I should
have I don't know anywhere else is going
okay almond must have said that anyway
so but give it any any in this in this
dumb random consideration set game you
could obviously reduce if tau is an
equilibrium init is a strategy profile
at tao super mu is the projection back
onto the original game where you say all
I really care about is what's the
privately player J that should be
subscript J fix that the probably player
J uses strategy S sub J is well you sum
over all the considerations that's
what's the probability considers that
what's the probability does SJ when he
considers this and of course if SJ isn't
an RJ than the RJ's for which SJ isn't
in it those are this is that product is
0 so this is the marginal probability of
and that's all that anybody cares about
so tau is an equilibrium of a random
consideration set game if and only if in
the original game this is kind of bolt
this is awful looking notation but this
dot is saying that's you're randomizing
you recognized RI and you're considering
RI and this is the behavior you have
over the options in RI you understand in
the original game that everyone else is
behaving according to their marginal
distribution and you're going to choose
you're going to put probability your
expected payoff is going to maximize
over RI the best you can do within are
the things you're considering and that's
got to be true for all our eyes that
have positive probability I guess
they've 0 probability I won't worry
about what you do there because nobody
else cares about it so fact for any
sequence of random consideration set
games and and towels that their
equilibria such that if the probability
of my considering tau goes to 1 and tau
is an equilibrium of the random
consideration set game any limit of
these of the marginal distributions is
going to be the equilibrium of the block
game yeah of course so so any block game
of course can be expressed as a limit of
such things with a with a constant
sequence I guess that you always just do
yeah so these guys are
no no no you know if you have a sequence
of blocking a random consideration set
games with if the probability of the
block t is is approaching 10 this is the
definition so this I could write it a
variety of ways the way I've written it
is the when you when you are recognizing
our the way you behave gives you an
expected payoff against what everyone
else does which can be defined in the
original game because it depends only on
the marginal distribution of what
everybody else does doesn't matter what
they're considering it doesn't what they
do and that's derived in the obvious way
from what how they how would their
behavior depend on what they consider
that should achieve the maximum against
the same behavior over all the things
you have available in RI yeah yeah
that's it that says wherever you're
considering your you're only putting
probability positive probability and the
things that this this this could imply
because them this is an expected value
which is linear and how you put the
probabilities on the different things so
this is saying you're only putting
positive probability on your
alternatives in your consideration set
that that our Meg are optimal within the
consideration set again sir they're not
necessarily optimal in the whole set
because you're not considering the other
stuff and then if you take a limit of
these equilibria where the we're over a
sequence of random consideration set
games where the probability of flock T
is going to 1 then of course ultimately
everyone's just you know doing something
that's optimal again in in Teague and
again they're not doing anything outside
of tea in the limit because the they're
never considering any outside tea and
within T they're behaving optimally
against what the others are doing so
it's an equilibrium of the of the block
game it's not necessarily equal to the
original game the result is that limit
is an equal is also an equilibrium the
original game then we then it's a good
block that's that's so that's let's say
that idea a block is coarsely tenable if
there's a positive epsilon so such that
for every random consideration set game
that puts at least 1 minus epsilon
probability for every player on the T
block everyone is probably with an
epsilon
shoot thinking about tea and we have and
for any such game and for any
equilibrium of that game of such a game
we must have that the what they're
getting here which is optimal within tea
is also optimal with an SI where
remember SI is the name of the full
strategy set of the original game which
means that when players are likely to
act rationally within the tea block a
probability of anybody behave thinking
of anything else then the tea block is
less than epsilon anything other than
the tea block is less than epsilon then
nobody can do better by choosing the
strategy outside of it ok that's likely
they have rational that's that's the
definition and this is we're going to
call coarsely tenable it's called
coarsely because we're gonna have
another finally letting a little bit and
the block of pure strategies pepper
another side just check out cuz I I just
wrote this in and I think this is my
first time using the slide since we
rewrote it at night and I think this
belongs in here I wrote something last
night and it was wrong and York and
corrected me so we'll just pause run i'm
pretty sure this is right but i just
this is one thing i just added it should
be obvious that if you take take any
strategic form game Oh for each player
eliminate anything that's weakly
dominated by another mixed strategy now
that you know what we call that the
weekly undated residue that's a block
it's a non-empty subset of every
player's pure strategy set and that
block is coarsely tenable what's I think
I think it's obvious because you know
for any random consideration set game
when you when you maximize over when
you're responding the other players and
your maximum optimally within the weekly
I'm dominated then you can't do better
by going to a weakly dominated because
whatever you think of its it's uh is
something that must be weakly dominated
by something and it must be dominated
something that's it constructed out of
the weekly undated ones I think that's
what you always have a best response and
the weekly undated strategies and and
that's it for at least for finite game
these are finite strategies they say so
this this is true I think um
if t is coarsely tenable then the Nash
equilibrium it's block game are all Nash
equilibria the original game that is to
say that's that and the proof of that is
pretty easy if something we're not the
sequence that just always puts tea with
probability 1 and you play that that
equilibrium would fail to satisfy this
equation because you could do better
outside now if t is coarsely tenable
there exists a proper equilibrium of G
that has supported few that's not that
not so hard to prove but but the proof
of that will actually be embedded in the
next solution concept so of course
lieutenant now I'm going to say a
coarsely settled equilibrium I would
like the word settled is any Nash
equilibrium of G that has support in
some minimal coarsely tenable block tea
with no course that minimally means that
there are no coarsely tenable some
subsets so that's there how do I know
there well there exists a coarsely
tenable block and they're only finitely
many blocks there must be at least one
that has no hoarsely tenable subsets and
by the way you can always find one this
that's that doesn't include any weakly
dominated strategy so yeah no no no
because it could be empty and in fact
it's even if it's not empty I don't I
can't guarantee a direct I in in fact it
certainly is not no fine a minimally I
don't know but by mineral so minimal
these are partially ordered by include
by set inclusion so it should not have
any proper subset any included subset
that it is that's course ago finally
many and it's a partially ordered set by
by conclusion that's lots of lots of
blocks are not comparable and it
certainly is not true that the
intersection of two corsa tenable is
corsica that's the here's so here here's
go back to example to work which was
carefully chosen that so that
persistence first of all didn't work and
still wanted something more coarsely
tenable does work but
barely works and that's and you guys
built so how does it work um it's what
you'd like to say is could I please have
this set be coarsely tenable but it's
not because one way to see easily that
the set we're player you know we're
because we had an equilibrium players
are random weird equilibrium players are
randomizing here equilibria players are
randomizing here and then there's a
total of mixed equilibrium there then
there's I didn't listen before about its
hope that V totally mixed equilibrium
we'd really like to get rid of the
totally mixed equilibrium and have and
just look inside here for example are up
here it doesn't work this is this let's
let me look Becca so suddenly it was
obvious if t is coarsely tenable that
then all of its Nash equilibrium of the
block game that in the net all in all of
its core it's the National rivets block
game our Nash equilibria of the original
game well if I work if this set here
player to doing 82 and play one doing
one of his to a strategies if that block
what we just let's just play the a stuff
and forget everything else if that was a
coarsely tenable block then all of its
Nash equilibria would have to be nasty
glue the original game but of course
there's two pure strategy equilibria at
the ends which are not Nash equally the
original game you have to randomize and
keep the probability of either corner
less than three quarters because if I
were going this way for sure I'm player
one uu player to wood fer go to hear but
if you were going to be x2 but then of
course I prefer to go be the x 10 x 1
and and we wouldn't be it's not an
equilibrium the original game so it
doesn't work but if this set here is a
coarsely tenable block and so is this
their intersection of course is this set
which is not coarsely tenable it has
unique equilibrium which is not in
equilibrium the original game and so
that that's that's so you see it works
but these are kind of a little awkward
um so we need something else but do we
need something else maybe maybe just
working no it doesn't because if I go
both sides but if I if I unfold the
zero it all falls you know it all falls
apart because now in order to keep
player one here randomizing not going
too far in 1q if this this this is not a
coarsely tenable block because I need I
need to keep player one from going one
side of the other side too far so I need
to add these strategies in but then I
also need to add these strategies into
key player to randomizing in the
appropriate way ah what are the
equilibria I guess the Q go between 18
and seven-eighths because there's a 3-2
and it is if the two is different from
the three but anyway I claim this is
what the you know d as long as you stay
away from the corners randomizations
here are but and you need to add in
these you have to be aware of these
other strategies to to get to stay away
from to get the word that we have to
stay away from the corners so somehow
the way we analyze the block does have
to take into account something outside
of it um let me remind you sub sub game
perfection requires 5050 randomization
and these two these two off diagonal
things represent sub games where we
missed if we don't choose either both
A's or both fees then we go into this
two-person zero-sum game sub game and in
that has unique 5050 equilibrium
randomization so the proper equilibria
in here are 5050 and that comes from
looking outside here in recognizing that
those that when you're in what I'm only
considering a xray why that the AXA why
are coming from they only had matter in
a sub game that's outside the block but
I have to worry about it anyway so
something has to be brought in from
about rationality outside the block we
just course tenability leads us no way
to exclude the extreme pure strategies
in the a1 a2 block without adding in all
the strategies that's the problem one
and then of course we're back in the
original problem but imposing some
rationality on the out of block
deviations could narrow the scope to
proper equilibria without large in the
block and that's so what our solution is
to impose some rationality on out of
block conjectured behavior yeah
yeah your current definition you know
yep yep oh yeah um brilliant idea but
I've just comes about could we talk
about instead of people thinking of
focusing on randomized strategy i'm
thinking about what people going to do
in this game is like I was just say I
don't I don't even think about a x-ray I
just think that a and 50 50 X Y I don't
know that's that's a good paper I hope
you'll write it I refer to our paper
it'll be but it might be a better paper
um but we'll have prepared the way for
it somebody somebody has to write an
ugly paper to let foot that you write
the beautiful paper that then makes
smell simpler but anyway so here's what
we're going to do um the random
consideration set structure I hope
you'll like this it we have a definition
that we've written in a variety of
different ways and sometimes not
necessarily equivalently as I told you
how exactly to formulate it is hard to
there because there are a lot of options
and we're just telling you you'll be
relieved to know I'll only tell you
about a subset of the ideas we've
thought about because but as anybody in
any research has to do leave then figure
out what to leave out but uh I think the
random consideration set perspective
gives a good way to make this way seem
natural and if it seems natural it
probably is I'm going to talk about an
epsilon proper random consideration set
game so it's really the distribution
that makes a random consideration set
game and with the probability is proper
this is this is related to my idea of
proper equilibrium but it's it's on a
different object the random
consideration set game is epsilon proper
on T if first of all for every player I
the ti part of the block is getting that
the player is is considering his block t
his part of block T has probability at
least 1 minus epsilon that's one thing
and for every pair of two possible
consideration sets that he might be
considering such that cute they're both
non-empty subsets of Si and Qi is
smaller if Qi is not TI and it's not all
right this is a proper subset then first
of all everything has positive strictly
positive probability that's one of
things we're putting in proper every
possible set must have strictly positive
probability of being the set that I'm
considering but when I'm not considering
two and I'm probably considering ti but
if I'm not for any two sets the larger
one is much more likely than the smaller
one well TI is smaller than some sets
and it is very likely so in that case so
the idea is the normal thing for us to
do is to consider TI but if i don't
consider TI and if I'm behaving in an
abnormal way I probably see everything
I'm not behaving conventionally let's I
look around I wake up and I stop
behaving like a you know one of these
these these conforming rope quasi robots
and I look around and I probably see
everything but I might miss something
but it's epsilon for any set that I
could that I could see any subset of it
is probably less than epsilon times that
except for TI which of course is what
the the slavish lee conventional people
see when player players I consideration
says very likely to be TI but he might
consider others donna p subsets any non
empty subset with positive probability
but if it's any set less other than TI
then it is much more likely to be a
larger set so then i'll say it's finally
tenable the same thing that I'm only
going to consider these proper so if
they did the block T is finally tenable
if there's some positive epsilon such
that for every equilibrium tao of every
random consideration set new that is
epsilon proper aunty so it's putting
almost you know within epsilon of one
probability one on aunty for every
player and when it isn't t any player
was considering something else is
probably within this epsilon ratio since
probably considering larger set
smaller sets and then it's an inky if
when we help when we consider those
equilibria of those random consideration
get games when when when they're with an
epsilon when it went for any new that's
epsilon proper and by the way for if
it's epsilon proper for it's got it its
it's also a epsilon prime proper for any
strictly larger epsilon prime because
epsilon only appears on that way I'm
inequalities making up some large old
and just strictly increase the set of
epsilon proper consideration set games
on T then we must have that as long as
we're with an epsilon epsilon proper
random considerations may be game all of
its equilibria satisfy that property
that when you're within t you can't do
better than go by going out to SI where
it's important for me to remind you SI
is the set of all strategies in the
original game that's what that says fact
any coarsely tenable block is also
finally tenable because of course the
Templars considering all sequences of
random considerations at games that
probability one in the limit on T and
here I'm only considering the ones that
also satisfy this additional restriction
so finally they're more finally to a
masking less things finally tenable and
therefore I get more finally tenable
blocks but then the minimal one is going
to be a finer set and then I'm gonna say
any limit as epsilon goes to zero of
equilibria of random consideration set
games that are epsilon proper on a
finally tenable block is a proper
equilibrium of the original name it's an
equilibrium original game in fact the
proper equilibrium the original game
because we made sure when I make a
mistake it's because I'm not considering
everything in T in the NT I obviously
because once I'm consider everything in
T I thought but what if I'm not I'm much
more likely to you know the two mistakes
it's because I'm not considering
everything in TI but I'm much more
likely to be considering both those
those possible mistakes then then neat
then only one of them and and then of
course I do I would only do the one
that's better among the two if I do
either them so it's just I'm not it's
not going to be it's much
more likely that in the limit that I do
do they do the less bad mistake and so
we get so that's the basic definition of
and it was always a proper equilibrium
and now we've proven by the way since
any coarsely tenable set is finally
tenable also and these limits of these
equilibria are proper equilibria we have
the theorem I gave you before that any
coarsely tenable one has a proper
equilibrium but but of course the book
we're now looking am now advocating look
at the finally settle I'm gonna say
finally settled equilibrium is any
proper equilibrium that has support on
some minimal finally tenable block and
then I'll say a fully set but but of
course you could always go first to a
coarsely there's that there exists a
finally settle there exists to finally
settle equilibrium that's also coarsely
tenable you just have to go to a minimal
coarsely tenable block and then inside
of it looked for a minimal finally
tenable block that's included inside
that and so we call that fully set
tenable hopefully fully settled a fully
settled equilibrium is any proper equal
ER in G that I support in some minimal
finally tenable block that is itself
contained in a minimal course the
tenable block and these things exist for
any finite game ok so I've given the
definitions is more to say but but that
but you now know everything in principle
it's just a matter of exploring the
implications question seems like like
feel almost epsilon the whole game I
have to get life to give probability
everything I do need to rank all
mistakes including so certainly the way
we initially were constructing it was
was rather more specific by saying
something like an obvious construction
of saying with there's some probability
that you'll recognize each strategy and
will make those probabilities close to
one which means you're almost really
going to see everything but you might
miss things it there's a bit of a
difficulty at my consideration since i'm
not going to we're not going to allow me
to consider nothing you're going
totally missed this and yurgin just said
what do you taught you what what's the
word independent going on in there I
can't independently consider my
strategies independently because I I
can't consider nothing I have to have
something that I'm aware yeah yeah the
problem is I that this definition is a
bit of a subtle one because there's one
thing that we're saying that if you if
what you could think is the following
armed with probability 1 minus epsilon i
choose i observe TI and then if I don't
that epsilon probability there's a in
that epsilon probability event now I go
into another process where with
probability 1 minus epsilon each action
Issy is observed is considered is taken
into consideration with probability 1
minus conditional in the event that I'm
not just considering ti there's a 1
minus epsilon probability that I'm
considering each action t it each action
independently and epsilon probably I'm
ignoring it except that the epsilon to
the number of strategies prevent where I
don't consider thing then I go back and
I became conventionally I don't know I
don't know so it's not I can't quite
talk that's a bit of a mouthful but
that's sort of that's what something
like that was in our paper before that's
that's a good example of one of these
things maybe it's the only examples we
should talk about I don't know yes yes
yes that's right yes that's right yep
absolutely every strategy has paws bro
if you for every every singleton set has
a positive probability and when you do
it when that's all you're considering
you to it that's right so we're
guaranteeing that everything is possible
that was in the original proper
equilibrium definition this here that
this is a funny way of extending my old
terminology because i'm applying it to a
a very different object but as you see
one of the things that does right away
is that make sure that every pure
strategy has a positive probability
because certainly when that's the only
one the player is considering that's
what the player must do yeah but it's a
very small probability because it's
stacked under its epsilon less than
probability than so much so many others
to prove that it's appropriate queries
oh yeah absolutely no of course this
definition was was set up so that it
would would do that that's right yeah
yeah and you know in some sense maybe
that's what I was thinking about you
know and I went when I can I don't know
there are a lot of things you could
think of tomato but I could claim I was
I kind of had that intuition but I was
inarticulate about in the survey so
that's a pretty good thing too that's a
geek I like that that's rather
self-serving game isn't it i should i
should i should not be proud of doing
that oh yeah yeah I kind of thought that
but no but I'm trying to be nice about
saying these future people are really
figuring out what what I meant to say
but was obviously unable to say and not
if you can't say it you don't deserve
credit for first that's I'm sorry that's
okay so this this does all but this does
the trick um it has no you know we saw
this as know this is the game example 3
i showed you before it has no coarsely
tenable blocks of them the whole
strategy space but we the right things
this is a minimal is a finely tenable
block and it is a minimal finally
tenable block as is this one over here
and you add well and we get and their
solutions that the tube finally and
fully settled equilibria are the random
out the sub game perfect randomized
strategy delivered the proper equilibria
in those two belongs and let me remind
you if when we're living in this block
if player 1 thought the player to was
was a player one was expected to put
more probability here than there then
then when player 2 doesn't have these
but is only considering these two which
is the only way she'd ever consider
either they're very close to fifty
percent probably but not exactly a
little more privately up here then she
would prefer this so she goes she
preferred me why to but then that would
say that player 1 would realize that she
tends to make a mistake in some way that
it hurts me more often when she makes a
mistake these don't matter but when she
when she makes a mistake I do well with
this one and badly with that so
therefore I should not be doing this I
should go this way and so you can't have
such an so so putting the epsilon rattly
putting rationality on the on the
trembles gets us and saying that when
she makes a mistake she has both of
these available obviously if I if I just
allowed any random considerations that
game I could obviously force her to put
have 50 50 probability in those two and
then then then player you know um and
she's just gonna be hate when she
doesn't see this she does these she is
equal probability in these two
considerations that came into no
probability anything else and then of
course all she does is when she goes he
or she randomizes 5050 and then he can
put more probability here you know but
but the properness kicks in okay so um
here's an example that's kind of
important this is the Ford induction
literature and this this is that's odd
we're late in a way that we don't really
understand to the forward induction
literature i noted the course i would
say so what's this game this is this is
another version of the battle of sexes
again we've changed some numbers but
player player one has the choice to an
outside option to get to or he could if
he doesn't you can go this to choose it
if you choose the others then he goes
into a kind of another kind of battle of
sexes game and as a Nash equilibrium up
here which they which the forward
induction people like it and this this
gets me the idea that that I think we
would focus on the b1 b2 equilibrium and
therefore i choose C that exists but but
normally the Nash equilibria that
correspond to that say you have to have
at least have at most two thirds
probability on a if you have at least
one-third probability on b2 in order to
make player but obviously if go all the
way to people 0 then this is saying
that's this corner here so what's so so
the unique minimal coarsely tenable
block is the a1 a2 corner um but c 1 b 2
is finally tenable um
so this is an example where I don't know
how I feel you know I have to tell you I
you know a lot of people really like
Kohlberg pretends to Bill stable
equilibria and related ideas I think I'm
not one of them um so I but I recognize
that smart people do like it and you
know it's this is just you know what do
you think this is so I don't know uh so
I kind of like the fact that finally
tenable the fine finally settled
equilibrium clued both of these but if
you like stable equilibrium and many
smart people the audience might well
feel that way and I gotta respect that
you might think if the settled miss is
doing any good somehow the cool the
fully settled is cat is picking it up
and that's so okay that's not and a lot
of the stuff in the talk in in kohlberg
r attend stability is about elimination
of week domination and coarsely settled
is kind of grabbing at that in it kind
of way but I'm being incoherent because
i don't have really have any theorems
and i've tried to find some theorems and
i don't and i couldn't get them but i
didn't try that hard so you've try i
know this this example is i don't how
interesting this one is here i just
instead of the 44 is I this is you know
I changed some of the one-minus-one so
the player is not tempted the players
getting the plus or minus one is not
tempted to deviate and now for you know
uh so this block here the course this
block here now Court is coarsely tenable
because just staying in here no matter
any equilibrium in here you know they
can randomize any way you like over
these 40 and this to over this
two-by-two block game and nobody's going
to ever want to deviate to get plus or
minus one but up here it's not coarsely
tenable because if you just randomize
any which way you could end up well for
example going to a corner in which case
somebody's going to want to go grab the
for either you know both of them going
to want to grab before actually so so in
this in this one um there are two
finally tenable there to finally settled
equilibria
the 50 the right 50 50 equilibrium up
here in the right one down there but
fully settled only grabs let's see where
does the status so this is the only
minimal courses so so this equilibrium
here the a the a equilibrium is the
unique fully settled equilibrium I don't
know I'm sorry I said rights it's a big
it's the b1 b1 that's the unique focus
anyways it was it players no player one
doesn't want to get these yeah it's this
one here I should've said that wave it
its course let's see where does it say
that last time only only the be
equilibrium is fully satellizer okay so
that's so that's I don't know is that
brilliant or is that a solution concept
gone wild I don't know here's the
example that's where all of them in
these by the way you know are not these
are not generic examples in it's really
important that I have equal equal pay
offs that of course the properness was
grabbing on to the fact that there was a
sub game in there and it's recognizing
that there might be a sub game that has
to the force is a kind of behavior in it
and that's because the fact that there
was a sub-game ahead to do with the fact
that when you're when the other players
not putting us in the sub game that my
strategic behavior in the sub game
doesn't matter the XY is what do I do in
a sub game and it doesn't matter when
when we're both choosing a s so those
were not generic games that you could
change break those equality's and i
don't i really don't i even thought
about what would happen but this is a
fully generic game this is yes what's
going player let's see player one is
best response is 1111 okay um what
player 2 i've done from left to right
what you know the greater probability of
a player to wants to choose a but if
it's because we slowly reduce the
probability oh here's the picture
youtube as you increase the probability
of b 1 from 0 to 1 first the a option is
best and then the the b2 option for
player 2 because of this is player two's
you to expect utility so so she's and
then seat that then three fourth when at
a half she's indifferent between b2 and
c2 one beat one is a little
more likely than she prefers c21 when b
2 is a lot more likely than she prefers
d 2 so she's only willing to randomize
depending what one is doing between
either A to B 2 or b2 c2 or C to D to
this and in fact for each of those
supports there is an equilibrium there's
an equilibrium where they minimize this
way here if she's always randomizing
5050 to make him indifferent make she
player two is always willing to ritas
randomizing 5050 in all of them to make
player one indifferent between 10 but
it's this 10 the matters here it's this
one here so the the only curb or
absorbing block is the whole game is
curb sets absorb except gets the whole
game you could take any of those numbers
and change it a little bit take all the
numbers and change them a little bit men
and that's still going to be true but
and it's still going to be true that
you're going to get three equilibria but
then it with it you know that look
pretty much like this but the the middle
block the hut cb2 this one here one with
a group green and yellow green and gold
I guess uh is not and one way to see it
is if it we're coarsely tenable um it
has all of its Nash equilibria would
have to equal to read the original game
and they're not it has within if we only
thought about b2 c2 then within that
that looks like a ballot kind of like a
battle of sexes game it's a coordination
game and it also is too pure strategy
equilibria the 8 a 1 B 2 it within this
block is it is an equilibrium yeah one
is bigger than 0 4 SB 13 but it's not an
equilibrium of the original game to be
intended deviate so as its blocked game
has two pure strategy equilibria court
everything coarsely and findable are the
same thing the the minimal course lead
finally tenable blocks in this game are
the two outer ones and so I get we get
to two settled equilibria in all senses
and and and then we exclude the middle
one um let me back up and say this paper
this came from an old paper of mine
which was just me saying I think there's
something out there and you know trying
to guess what the hell is it
and we talk so we talk about algebraic
topology I don't really understand so
I'm hoping somebody that at least one
person knows a lot more about algebraic
topology of index of fits point indexes
index numbers than I do in which case
maybe you can write the good paper what
I thought was going on was I understand
that for generic games and you look at
national Nash equilibria there's a way
of assigning plus 1 and minus 1 indexes
to these regular equilibria and there's
a theorem that says that the sum of the
indexes has to be plus 1 and so they
that's that's an existence theorem for
Nash equilibria they can be because you
can't have zero and so you're going to
hit but but if there are three
equilibria that then you have to have
cancelling out plus ones and minus ones
and so you have to have an odd that
generically an odd number of equilibria
well I don't understand that stuff but I
understand that the outer two equilibria
have a certain symmetry so they must be
both the +1 equilibria and the middle
because they have the same index and and
therefore the middle one and and and
that was true in the in the battle of
sexes gay i said i think this is a lab
eration of a version of battle of sexes
although it isn't exactly and uragan had
a variant of it was it was more more
transparently related to the battle of
sexes game but anyway us and the plus
one and maybe it's the plus one index
that's the good idea i should say I've
had at least one conversation with
somebody who listened to a version of
this talk who does understand index
number theory pretty well and he said
cheerfully no of course your idea has
enough of settled equilibria has nothing
whatsoever to do with with index number
theory but um but it's a good idea I
mean but you know we probably seemed to
think was a you know he liked the paper
he didn't think so all the examples I
know of our examples were my settled
equilibria I like and they seem to be
doing the same thing as an index theory
would do but there's nothing intrinsic
you know about it so probably and maybe
there's still a better paper to be
written that uses index numbers problems
those are only defined for regular / but
let me say generic property so the final
thing I want to say and I should shut up
and that is so we give it here's a
formal definition
a hyper obviously it's a hyper a game is
hyper regular if for every block game
all the Nash equilibria the block game
are regular in the sense of Van Damme
and I forget what the sense of Van Dam
is and I and whenever I'm giving the
talk i'm on the road and I and I don't
have n dads book with me so I can't even
remind myself when we wrote this I
looked up and am I really should write
something that's that I can put on the
slide I think Van Dam's regularity
implies among other things that a Nash
equilibrium has that all best responses
have positive probability and maybe that
is enough that all but that if all the
Nash equilibria of the game that's if
that's a weaker property if I'm right
that I could say that you know
generically we know that for almost all
what given the strategy even the number
of given the set of players and give
this out of pure strategies finite set
of pure strategy for each player almost
all games are regular in the sense of
Van Damme when you ramp if you randomly
generate the utility numbers say bye
uniform over some positive interval
independent or multivariate normal or
some non-atomic anyway that with
probability one you will generate a game
that is regular and sense of Van Damme
that has other properties such as that
all of its Nash equilibria are best
responsive but you can also say oh I
want that every block within the thing
also has that property and that's just
an intersection of a bunch of
probability one events and so its
probability one so it's you know it's
almost all games it's a no content set
true and Ropin dense I believe that's
true give it a fact for given a set of
players and give it a finite set of
satyrs the finest that's not a finite
sets of strategies for each player the
set of utility functions but such the
dennis is not hyper regulars contained
in a closed set of lebesgue measure zero
that's that's the formal statement so in
this sense almost all finite strategic
games are hyper regular and if it's
hyper regular than any block is coarsely
settled if and only if it's finitely
finally settled on the size hoarsely
tenable if anoles finally tenable so any
equilibrium is coarsely settle
differently if it's also finally and
fully settled
so all of our concepts of settled nests
are completely equivalent for a generic
class of games we're just nitpicking nfe
and lots of other things that we talked
about are the same Jurgen and I talked
about that we're sparing you are the
same we've wasted a lot of time between
I wasted a lot of time talk about the
different thing coarsely and finally
because well they're those non generic
games are often interesting games when
you come from an extensive form game so
it's important but in some sense this
and a whole bunch of other things don't
matter okay so see I'm prepared to be an
excited referee for papers that pick up
more but but I'd say I'd be a more
reserved referee if I could get this in
and if all you did was come up with a
variant on this that's that's equivalent
for all hyper regular games I mean you
know if you could if you could say but
Meyerson avaible for this reason shows
the wrong thing then you know then
that's that's a good of course and the
first paper no matter what I'm going to
say if an editor sends it to me i'm
going to say publish it if it refers to
my paper but after that i might get
fussy ok so that's it so so settled
settled pneus like persistence but
unlike perfectness improper pneus is not
generically equivalent to nash
equilibrium on a final class I should
emphasize my hood introduced the set was
trying to say nice things about me and
said I had a paper and proper equilibria
in that and that was a great idea but
one should say for for a generic class
of strategic Street finite strategic
games all equilibria are proper it does
nothing perfectness and properness have
that part but the collage sama
persistence was not equivalent to nash
equilibria there's a an open set of
these utility functions for which it
properly gets it gets rid of some some
real equilibria and this unlike
persistence we also did and and an open
set of utility functions around the exam
the last example I showed you will yield
games with three equilibria all of which
are persistent but one of which is not
settled in any sense here and therefore
we are going a little farther also
generic sense that's all i have to say
thank you for ya
you know right okay yeah behavior the
stage game and the definition of subtle
definitely what is the dynamic process
right good question um let me say my
co-authors written a lot about dynamic
evolution two games and I was hoping he
was gonna come up with an answer that
question he didn't um it's you know I I
it's a weak point I I don't have I have
often said I want to let me say it
please let me say again um to me one of
the most one of the reasons I am most
interested in literature about tatton
mom theories of convergence to
equilibrium a sensible theory about how
a process of something would kind of
lead you to an equilibrium is because if
we had a process for which you could
guarantee that for like a large set of
initial conditions or whatever it all it
always converges to an equilibrium then
maybe we'd find that some equilibria
don't have a large set of initial
conditions that lead to it and in the
dynamic and they would then be refined
away and I think that's part of the
intuition we have here uh we don't have
an you know so heart and Moscow lay for
example keep writing papers where they
show that you know you can't do it but
that they write another paper that says
that the conditions that they had any
previous paper aren't really all the
things you know don't don't salud
everything so I yeah so it's a hard
problem and and but I there aren't the
answer the whole whole whole literate
I'm saying the whole literature on
dynamic convergence to two equilibria is
is missing something and and we don't
have it either now but we're talking as
if we think it might be possible and but
you're right we don't we don't have we
don't know
reminded me a little bit on there that
they rationalize ability and I was
wondering why really a lot of times we
use correlated there or interim
correlated rational fresh yep and you
are not allowing for a kind of sort of
correlation so when I think that I know
the game I'm also think that you're
aware of the game couple that axle so
certainly I we have there's something
about domination that was in the
relationship between our settlements and
domination something that we wanted to
nail down better this for a variety of
solute solution concepts that we've
written down we could prove the theorem
that I wrote that I just added to the
slides of the last minute I showed you
which was didn't that a block that that
the weekly uncommon ated block that
which is what people often called the
rationalize able set bernheim and
Winston Pierce had a different idea in
the be a bit the furniture said that
good news it had somewhat differently in
the beginning
a very naughty we sure aimed at within
that's in kohlberg were Tenzin's paper
was if you have a if you have a tenable
be nicely if you have a nice nice block
of color tenable a nice block one just
called nice because I don't have a
theorem okay have a nice block of a game
and then you go to the original the game
and you knock out a weakly dominated
strategy in the game that remains
there's another nice block which is a
subset of this one we sure would like to
have a concept of niceness that were the
word we're using was tenable in which we
could prove a theorem like that I we
haven't succeeded I don't know that it's
not possible some we woke up a few days
every now and then thinking we had it
and and then we didn't but they say one
other thing I think you said
independence uh in my paper on what's it
called Elementary dual reduction in
elementary games I talked about with
about correlated trembles and and if you
start introducing correlation the battle
of sexes game was an elementary game
which meant that you could make all of
those you could you could approximate
the randomized strategy clear by
something which were by a strict
equilibrium by putting in some
correlated information and when you do
that by having a mediator who correlates
them with small probability r message
and when you do that so one thing I
understood is we couldn't get we weren't
going to get any cut theory that was
going to refine away the randomized
equilibrium if we thought about
correlation okay that is by and by
correlation I want to met and say
approximate a strategic form game by
saying there's a small probability that
a mediator might show up and send them a
message but the meteor might send an
empty message to you which case you
can't tell with me there even exist or
not so if you have even a perturbation
like that I think that was enough I
might be wrong but I think that was
enough to create a game in which the
randomized strategy Qin was a strict
equilibrium of the battle of sexes game
in these
well then it's for sure going to be a
good you know it's going to be settled
in our sense in that extended game so
this are our concept I expect would be
discontinuous with respect to change in
a game by adding a mediation to it and
pay off your relevant cheap talk
mediation and then look reducing it back
to a game of the anyway a strategic for
me but in some of those papers a little
bit flavor if you do it erated deletion
instead of looking at the sets of action
I don't know dissipate I don't sure
which papers your toe biter the junk
food I don't think you're talking about
a paper of mine but no I should wasn't
them sorry but I do know that the
government ban and Wilson is exploring
interesting I index yes and um
it's obviously that I mean I'd say I
know that for the Bell the battle of
sexes game must be one where the the the
the the pure strategy equilibria plus
ones and the the mixed strategies of
minus one actually I we've lost
jean-francois bear tens he's gone there
was a memorial service in injured in
Jerusalem earlier this year and I saw
Street Hari there I can't recall
everything but one question we discussed
was was jean-francois interested in this
kind of idea of eliminate and and and
the answer was sometimes he wasn't and
sometimes he was so in generalizing did
his later I'd like ideas on this area
which were also algebraic topological um
I think of him by the way as being a
brilliant mathematician and therefore I
assume that as a mathematician he
studied a lot of math but the truth is
he learned the algebraic topology did
after writing the paper with with with
with a lon Kohlberg he wasn't born
knowing it he wasn't even knowing it
before he learned it because he knew it
was important for this stuff but the
index number part of that as I say I
some part of what he did and what they
so are they now looking at an extension
which for the Battle of sexes game would
I met that's that's that's the first
question oh I'm gonna sit down with
somebody who's writing papers I haven't
read yet and they don't even read my
paper and God it's hard to communicate
the first question I'd ask Sri Hari now
that I guess I haven't is have you and
Bob Wilson written anything which for
the Battle of sexes rain gets rid of
this in which case you're you're now
talking in my thing and I better go
study what you're doing and I just don't
know the answer that question I didn't
ask him that when I saw him in Jerusalem
I should have but I didn't yeah that's
right but it but it doesn't have a
general assistance if that's why I've
been prejudiced I didn't
