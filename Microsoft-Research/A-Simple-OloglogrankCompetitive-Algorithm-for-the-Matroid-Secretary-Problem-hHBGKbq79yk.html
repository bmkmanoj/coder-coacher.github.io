you
okay I think you can start no ok it's
good to have hola hola swenson from epfl
back here and today he's going to tell
us about the Mater a security problem
minded some algorithms for it Thanks uh
I don't you so my talk I'm Sasha mighta
missed it sure so its joint work with a
mobile fat is also dip FL the leak was
inclusion who's at ETH in Zurich so it's
a the sister Institute of epfl so it
will be about to make the Secretary
promises a generalization of a classical
problems the classic secretary poem so
let me start by introducing that and
then I will argue why we're interested
in the generalization on what the
generalization is so to make it a little
bit more interesting so let's say
instead of secretary say jobs you know
everybody applies for jobs once in a
while under we want to get the best
strategy to get the best job offer okay
so you have applied for and jobs and the
goal is to somehow device the best
strategy to select the best job offer
you get so you know how many jobs you
have applied for normally okay so you
know and in advance and now you want to
select a strategy that they give it so
that you select the best offer yeah so
what's the rules of the game you assume
that the office will arrive in a random
order okay so you ask you that makes
sense you don't think that the employers
really unite against you to make your
life miserable and then your sassoon
that you can when you see an offer you
disagree maybe I have good experiences
you might have bad experiences and then
you also assume that when you get enough
you can actually assign a value to it
okay some some value and and you can
compare to what you already saw what
makes it you know of course optimal
strategies to wait for lovers take the
best one but what makes it interesting
is that you have to somehow make your
decision immediately okay so why not
offer arrives you have to mediate this
side we
to accept it or not your decision stays
there so when you accept one offer the
game ends okay so here's an example
monnalisa plasmid job random order so
first off for my to you is that
everything if I want to record is so
first off is to you believe maybe you
know value sevens I've been lies but you
know first of you can expect something
better so you reject reject and then
maybe you get princeton 8.1 will also
reject them walmart you're surprised to
reject so actually well I gave the
presentation some people were surprised
that i didn't like one would I don't
know in Europe it is okay anyway and
then I'm nice you know Microsoft
Research 8.2 yeah maybe except so what's
the best strategy you know no no you
wait till II prefer but the you note off
Indiana what's an optimal strategy are
not an optimal just say yes a reasonable
strategy you solid yeah okay okay yeah
so so you basically there's menu
actually there are many of two
strategies but but the one that makes
intuitive sense is you have two faces a
sample face see what you can expect
right you don't know what to expect in
the beginning so you sample a fraction
of the input to see where you are in the
market and then based on what you've
seen in the sample face you make a
selection so in the singer secretary
problem what you will do is to you know
just look in a sample face you reject
everything irrespective of the value but
you remember in particularly remember
the best solution in a sample okay so
optimal selection in a sample will be
seven and now remember that you're
interested in the selecting the best
possible offer so the only thing that it
makes sense to accept is something that
is great to run cell phone
right so what we will do is to accept
the first thing that is greater than
seven so if it's less than 7 6.5 we
reject to reject if it's eight great we
accept okay and and it's easy to see
that this is a constant okay so suppose
we observe instead of observing i can
write here so instead of observing 1
over e we observe one over to fraction
ok so now i claim that the probability
of selecting the best office at least
one fourth why because we are guaranteed
to select the best off with the second
best in a sample face that happens we
pulled the one half and the best is in
the in the second half which app asleep
or do enough okay so that's probably one
for few mood okay they are not
completely almost independent and
whenever he comes from you know you can
all it's a little bit more complicated
but you can see like even if we take the
third best here there is some
probability to select the best one if
that comes before the second best and so
on but anyway one away it's not too
complicated what is more surprising is
maybe that it's also the best okay so
this was proved in the 60s by Duncan
sees free so it's a quite long history
and is studying the penalty in the west
and the east so that okay maybe you this
guy maybe you can explain to me after
talk this guy always pops up a different
place of my slides when I use the bell
since you're here maybe you know this
out of my slides yes so we are
interested in a more generalized version
likely we're not the only once and we
are not the words that proposed more
general versions so this is because of
one line mechanism assign and the
Kleinberg I think was the first one to
look at more general problem and then it
was by by off at all in 2007 that define
the metro sexting problem so why are
they interested in the secretary problem
well there is an immediate connection if
you think not of secretaries is that you
think of bidders arriving online okay so
you have customers arriving online and
you are somehow you
selling goods but you have a limited
amount of goods you can sell to the
bidders and you have to me that they
decide if you're going to sell it to the
customer or not okay so think of this
single secretary problem there you have
one good you want to sell okay I have a
car and now people contact me online in
some random order telling me their bids
and if i sell the car i sold it but they
can also reject offer but then the guy
might buy some other car from some other
provider okay so that's the single
secretary program now you can imagine
generalizations where you have many
cores or so on and that's the immediate
generalization that the client we're
considering 2005's instead of only
having one good you want so you have k
out of k goods and you have an guys
coming around them order making bids
case okay okk identical good some here
in this generalization the goal is to
select the k secretary of the maximum
total weight so each value so you're not
so interested in only selecting the best
but you want the total weight okay so if
I have one out of n I can do one ovary
in expectation of the total of the
optimal offline wait that's the best I
can do what do you think it k out of
them you think is easier or harder
intuitively you think yeah it's an
easier problem with k out of them than
one out of them to get a good weight
compared two of them optimum offline
okay but the when k grows it's a case
hundred it should be easier why but yeah
intuitive it should be easy because you
know one decision is not so important so
you're allowed to do some mistakes and
that's the case so so his results us
that in this case we can do something
like 1 minus sum of 1 over square root
of k ok so when k goes being you can
actually go over to the clothes or when
k goes to infinity you will get over to
close to our plane optimal
another so this is one generation maybe
a unit session that is a little bit more
interesting that actually captured my
interest in this problem is the
following so suppose you have your
provider okay so you have some server
maybe Netflix whatever and you have a
network then of your network cables and
they have certain capacity so the
capacities the blue numbers and edges
and now you have some some clients that
will arrive in a random order and will
bid to be guaranteed a unit connection
to the server yeah so suppose this blue
guy cam I'm saying I'm willing to pay
for to get the guaranteed unit bandwidth
to the server so i said okay i will
provide that you and you pay me four
units okay so this would be one way of
guaranteeing but it's not a unique path
right I could also give him that path to
the server and it's not important which
path I give him I can change it later on
as I always guarantee them to ID one
unit of bandwidth to soap yeah now the
second guy can arrive I beat seven I say
okay great they take you as well so look
now to accept him I have to change the
path the red guy but they can still
accept him if because you know here
somehow there is no way to connect the
blue guy without changing the path of
the right way now this guy comes six
well I have I already used quite a lot
of my capacity so let's reject him if I
reject line except okay and now I'm
somehow I this is the total amount of
customers i can accept because my
network supports the most free customers
so term even though it's more than nine
i have to reject the question is how
well can you do here compared to the
optimum offline so often more offline is
easy to solve in polynomial time okay
that's just a great i'll win and that's
a key an open problem we don't know so
the is a nice open problem is if there's
a constant competitive arguing for this
problem so constant cough competitive
means that the online arguing should at
least do a constant fraction compared to
optimum offline okay so and I'm online
I'm you see competitive if it gets a
see fraction of the optimum offline yeah
I mean greedy it's a micro it's you so
you will take them then I don't know if
you can take nine or not but you take
the next one that you can take their
offers are bounded between two cars no
no actually we will not assume that if
you assume that maybe you can do better
okay so then yeah if you assume that
then you can do something that is if
they're integral between some numbers
then you can do log of the Ranger
separated by just the rounding I
dominates the sum of everyone exactly
you have no idea and that's why you
cannot do better on one ovary for the
one out of em in the white version yes
so yeah like I guess that's all an
illusion baby yeah yes tell you whether
I better get in the order be like
learned out yeah I think our audience
would work for that case I think so I'm
not 100 they are easier to explain when
your weights but yes you can also assume
that you can only compare the items
that's a wee that somehow a harder
version what but I don't know if it's
really hard about it it's definitely not
easy yes this is a make this actually so
both the case I told you we're special
case of matrix this is called like
gammaroid Sosa special kind of Metroid
and that's what's so these two examples
are nice and that's what's nice we'll
make a sex tape or so so somehow it
captures many nice applications and what
is to make your secretary problem well
it's the secretary problem where we have
a major constraint or elements to be
selected okay so one matric constraint
would be that you can select a out of an
secretaries another major constraint is
that they can select the clients that I
can provide unit bandwidth to the server
let's call it gah would I ok if you
don't know what the matron is your
having problem no kidding I will I will
define it to the next slides but also if
you don't understand so it takes a
couple of presentations I'm still you
real
the maitre d so I will do all my
examples on graphs so the only thing we
will worry about this to select edges
that are a cyclic okay so that I hope
everybody have seen and then then yes o
to understand what I'm going to say
afterwards you only need to know what
than a cyclic graph is so why study MSP
so yes as I kept as many natural
settings and then basic matrix are
defined so as the naive greedy algorithm
works so that the definition of matrices
the crew skills are going to work okay
guarantees that desire so they have a
very nice structure so the hope is that
you somehow found the best problem that
captures many settings but the same time
you're very good online algorithms so
here we are pretty confident the problem
is in the second part we don't really
know if the structure is enough to get
very good albums and that's what we are
trying to solve and try to understand so
let me before then explaining what we
know about the aliens for these cases
let me define a little bit what the
matrix are and as I said so matrix for
my spanking sold by greedy kruskal's
algorithm so if we are looking at graphs
okay so here we are a graph and now we
are looking at the graphic met to do
this graph that this the graph
correspond to to think about the graph
correspond to forests ok so what the
elements of this mate will be the set of
edges of the graph ok now all possible
feasible solutions will be all forests
ok so that's the independent sets in the
maitre d ok so all the subset of edges
that are are cyclic ok so that is a
graphic metroid so what kind of
constraints do we use when we prove that
the great works I think it's exactly
what you need to make it work is a well
first yeah so we have a ground set
that's the edges in the graph graphic
and then we have a subset of all the
sets of this ground set that are
our independent sets so what are the
constraints so first constraint is kind
of simple that says that if we have a if
we have an enough we have an ax cyclic
graph so this is if we are a set of
edges that are cyclic in the graph
waited then if i drop manage it should
be a cyclic again ok so its downward
monotone the second thing says that if
you have two are cyclic graphs set of
edges I and J and I is of a bigger car
now student a then it must be an edge in
I that they can add to J and is still a
cyclic then they exist on edge in I that
is not in j that i can add to Jane it's
still a cycle why is this think about
this you if you have I many edges that
are cyclic then you have few components
of the graph right so there must be more
components in J so this means that there
must be one else in I that connects two
of the components in j and this graph me
I mean adding that that you will be a
psychic ok so that's that's that's what
the maitre d's not so intuitive if you
see the first time I dipped a while it
gets intuitive when you get used to
definitely get into it another another
very natural example of Madrid is yeah
right ok 1 1 question 1 has one more
cyst is how can you have this this looks
like a horrid encoding ok so you have a
maybe independence st like exponentially
money how can you encode them a hood and
what people assume is that they have an
oracle that the returns if i set is
independent or not ok think of the graph
case your exponentially many sub set of
edges but you can efficiently check
whether one set is a cyclic or not ok so
another another example is a linear
metroid here you have some dimension M
and you set is a subset of vectors ok
find that the universe is finite set of
vectors and all the independent sets are
those sub set of vectors of the linearly
independent ok let's now check that the
the the axioms are satisfied so in the
first case suppose I have like free
independent vectors if I drop one
the two guys that remain are in the
payment and the second of strain suppose
I have free independent vectors in I and
two in j well then I can add one of them
20 to I to make it bigger okay yeah I
don't know yes yeah so the bouncer
factor approximation is not known for no
of course actually fact yeah if you can
get the constant linear I will be
surprised if you okay i don't know maybe
there are some but probably there are
some weird properties known for Linea
mattress not know for johan wedges but i
don't know about them yeah okay that's
it yeah your work all right let's look
at what is known so as we have told
there's a lot of no special cases so
actually for the graphic micro there is
a competitive edge of TUI so you only
lose a factor of two compared to a
single secretary something called
transverse mate would eight co graph my
don't ask me what all this matches all
because i don't know but case force this
is case parsley new micro okay so what
is a case parsley animated well i would
guess that it's a linear metroid where
the vectors have only que non zeros ok
so here you see that this is not really
care a constant well may you have a
higher dimension okay so so this is
still open for Linea Metro test lebanon
metroid is a good regular method you see
what we're getting at you can look at
all your mattress favorite matters or
almost exactly in urine gamo it I don't
know if you know any other where we
don't have a constant and and this done
I think it makes so they made a kind of
a Balkan the I mean this bye-bye off at
all that the finder prom they made a
pretty bold conjecture probably in 2007
but now it looks like it's I believe in
it so what they produce that exists a
competitive album for the problem in its
generality I ok so for right
just so the graphic is special case of
the case for us yes yeah yes it's a two
sports right right so this generalizes
that good how many of these results are
such a satisfactory and the sense that
they assume what you'll need for vessel
mmhmm yeah okay okay okay so so okay so
this kind of detail so there is
different versions of the Metro
secretary problem where you assume if
you actually know your universe in
advance and that you can query it in a
pennis Oracle of the whole universe
before seeing the elements or if you
only get to know where the elements are
in the mate when they arrive yeah
because yeah so that that's kind of a
detail yeah I think if you can solve the
metro sector problem even if you know
the whole matron in advance but not the
value of the elements that will be great
so we don't know that yeah so they're
open collector is if there is a constant
and actually what is consistent with our
knowledge today is that there could be
an e competitive allium the same as to
seeing a secretary so that would be nice
and not completely out of I mean
completely crazy to say that so there is
another problem that is related called
profit inequalities and they are they
there was all resulting statistics with
probabilities that gave a two okay and
it was shown a 2 is also the right as
for anime troid so somehow the nice
thing with matrices that yeah they can
capture many settings but things don't
get Messier well they get Monsieur but
because we don't song but hopefully they
don't get too messy no I for fixed K is
a constant so we haven't sold this yet
yeah so it's true so this this so I own
numerator and so that they were
constants maybe this is an outsider yes
so we yeah that's true so what do we
know about the general case so there is
a very simple low ground
competitive i will that i will explain
today actually so it's bye bye bye fat
all from 2007 and then then there is a
more complex squared la gran coupe atiba
shaker barton la Hache 2012 and then
it's a log blog recently log rank for da
hey ok so what one can say here is that
it's been like very non-trivial to
improve log-rank ok so they're very
complex algorithms and you can offer so
one indication that the last time is
fairly complex is it's a hidden constant
in in the Big O notation is at least 225
to 25 32 ok so why why is the hidden
constant so large that because the
arguments also followed is that your
first sample and then you select so you
you want to have a large constant
because you want to get a lot of
information out of your sample and you
want this information to be reliable so
you want to have concentration and to
get concentration well some it's good of
many elements so what we will do is to
get the similar Rachel but we will use
less information from south below we
have a modest constant so a simple 3,000
log log rank I got there and it's quite
simple so it's very simple relatively to
the previous offerings but you know it's
not so simple so i give you the ids but
i think maybe you will not understand
the whole hopefully we'll have an update
yeah maybe not oh yeah yeah sorry sorry
so good question what is the rank that's
the maximum number of elements you can
select the largest set of an independent
set so in a in a yeah so in the linear
matrix corresponds to normal rank and
for graph for graphic material usually
it's n minus 1 if the graph is connected
I mean it's a spanning tree
yeah so basically general technique here
is that you software complex problem and
basically we will use the sample and so
on to reduce to a set of very simple
problems where we run the naive
algorithm okay and we will see why this
works so one thing we could notice when
i introduced the the singer sector
promised that the only place where we
really used at least for the one fourth
augment the only place where we used to
run on us was to get the sample after we
got the sample the order could be
adversarial in the selection phase not
to get one away but to get 1 over 4 it
doesn't matter if as long as i can get
fifty percent of the elements at random
the adversity can give me the remaining
as he wants and this is the case same
case in this album okay so the only
place where we use to randomness is to
be able to access fifty percent of the
elements at random then that verse we
can give the elements as he wants i
don't know if it has i think it has some
applications in wicked but i don't know
ok so let's look at our way as I as I
promise we will look at it as a in the
graphic matrix ok so let's first so i
will give a free algorithms so the first
one is the naive approach which is like
the first thing you would try if you
look at sing a secretary album how would
it work here and then i will give you
the log-rank and then then we will see
the log log so what about the naive
approach so what did we do in a single
sector we sample fifty percent we
remember the best solution we took
anything that improved on that solution
okay now we do the same thing so we
sample set by including each element we
probably 0.5 that's not that's almost
the same thing as taking the first fifty
percent okay so suppose this is the
optimum solution in the sample remember
we remembered seven the best secretary
in the sample now we remember the best
forest in the sample the maximum weight
for example okay and now when an element
arrives we should only take it if it was
part of the best solution with respect
sample yeah so too would not be part of
an optimal forest right with respect to
the sample because it's spanned by
heavier weight elements okay it will
create a cycle where all the other
elements of heavier weight so it will
not be part of a maximum oh wait for us
so we don't take it okay so improving if
not spam by heavy edges yeah I haven't
defined spam spam means that they create
a cycle with you for we take four is
better than free it will be part of the
optimum offline solution okay seven we
should take right because it's not spam
by heavier loads too should we take it
yes because it's better than one okay 11
we would like really to take but now we
cannot take it okay so that's why online
is not too good here okay why we lose so
we will this will be our solution will
be 4 plus 7 plus 2 which is 30 okay so
why is this not good so what we we call
it the hat for some reason it looks like
a hat so you have some really expensive
adhere that you really want to take then
you have tons of virtuous okay up here
of very light that just so basically
optimal solution is equal to the weight
of the heavy edge right let's now run
this algodón that so you get some
sample well let's assume that the heavy
edge is not part of the sample because
if it part of a sample you will not be
able to gather anything it in any case
so now we are extremely likely to see
many of these edges right before this
guy comes remember that they arrive in a
random order okay because there are so
many of these edges let's see mommy so
oops so maybe this one arrives well it's
definitely looks like it should be part
of the optimum offline solution because
it's not even spammed by NHS in the
sample so let's take it then this guy
cons same thing looks like it should be
part then this guy comes again we should
take it right and we extremely likely to
see some situation where two of these
arrives before this guy arrives so this
will prevent us from taking the fat that
when it comes and we are out of the blue
okay did I make sense okay so so you can
you now you can argue of course that
this is a special case there's only one
element this is important so let's run
the single secretary argument which
would work for the hat but we have this
generalized hat we have first a very
heavy element then you have medium heavy
elements and then on these you have
another hat and so on and here you can
actually see that you have log you you
get the log relationship basically okay
and that's why we will see where you
have a log there is a simple log album
so basically here you have the heaviest
guy then you have some factor lighter
elements then some fact of that lighter
elements and solar so that's their album
so we say weight class outing so that's
why I have this you just group you are
not going to wait you take one weight
class and run it on that okay so let me
see so so this is it look yes we
classify the elements according to wait
so here I make some assumptions that you
can believe or not to believe but it's
easy so we we know well approximately
but assume for presentation as we know
exact it number of elements the rank of
a micro do this you can get from a
sample easy okay so we know the number
of elements of poo take and we also know
the highest weight of an element this
looks dangerous right because in a hat
example you would like to take the
hairiest weight but to the reader the
solution to this is with some constant
probability run the single secretary
problem and then otherwise run your
complicated i'll go okay so if we know
this now i claim that we can change it
into log-rank many weight classes yeah
why well first of all we also assume
let's say that the way by scaling the
heaviest weight is equal to the rank
okay we're scaling now now you just
round each weight to a nearest multiple
of two this will this will cost your
factor of two how many multiples factor
between one and the rank good order
there is low gore and that's what they
do so we wait this is CI is one with the
ways between 2 i minus 1 2 I case you
have wait just one is between 12 to 4 40
and then you have yeah the last weight
class contains all the elements with
weight between are over to an hour of
course why don't I have to care about
the elements with weight over here ok
but remember that that the the maximum
number of elements we can take is our
and there exists one of weight or so
this means that even if I take all of
the elements down here they are not very
important for optimal value so that's
why I can forget about light really
lightweight elements so i only have log
or many different after doing this
rounding you should think of it elements
can only have log or distinct weights so
we have only log or distinct weights ok
log are many weight classes yeah by
losing effect of two we can assume all
of us in have the same weight so how is
now a log or log or rank competitive
algorithm how would you do so now ok one
thing when so now it doesn't matter all
elements are in a class is
indistinguishable with respect to wait
right they have exactly the same weight
so now you know if you want to select
the maximum set of linearly independent
vectors you can just add them greedily
right it doesn't matter in which order
you add things you will always get full
dimensional so that's the same thing
here just select one weight class at
random and now you just gridley add
things from that way to us and that's
what we're going to do
yeah okay so what is there are in sample
s by 2 each element with 10.5 then they
used is sample to calculate the rank and
a max weight ok so that's the only thing
they use from the other sample only to
calculate the rank on the max weight and
then they form the weight classes then
they select one of the log-rank waitress
at random letting the greedy select
elements from this weight class okay so
here they use to make your property that
it doesn t not important in which order
you select elements of a weight class
you would always get the maximum set of
independent elements of that weightless
yeah so in an example here if we if we
selected a blue weight class we would we
would take all the blue guys when they
arrive but we would not take anything
else okay and this is exactly 1 over log
of the after optimum yeah yes so it's a
it's a log-rank competitor well consider
off the random weightless contributes
october log-rank to the optimum we
select the data ok we lose a factor of 2
because of the sample that way yeah I
don't know if I confused to think about
it Alyssa what what we're using is it
like inspiring 3 case suppose you are
looking for connecting the graph right
now if i get if you get edges coming to
you then you can just take get this as
long as they don't form a cycle it
doesn't matter you know you should
always take an edge that decrease the
number of connected components in a
micro do so yeah so okay even if you
didn't understand it's not the whole
deal maybe so but what you should
understand is that we use extremely
little information from the sample
basically we use it to calculate the
rank and the maximum weight class and
now but on the other hand if we looked
at the example of the generalized hat it
really told us that we wanted to protect
heavy elements from light elements the
problem was that we had one really
valuable guy right and then these light
guys came and messed up our life and
that's what our arguing will do so we
will have two steps that I will explain
later on and the first step is really
this it's just that it will try to
protect a heavy elements from being
messed up from light elements so first
we sample fifty percent this might be
our sample and yeah the first step is to
protect heavy ions from life that once
and this second step is a little bit
technical condition I it is actually to
decompose a Pompeian parents up rolls
let's not worry about that at the moment
okay so let me explain for example
suppose we have this sample so the
Greenert you saw the heaviest ones that
we saw in a sample so the blue ones are
didn't second heaviest the red is the
third heaviest and these violet guys
here they are they are the lightest okay
now suppose a blue guy arrives the first
check here the first check is that we
should check that he should not be span
of heavy elements okay what do I mean by
that we should check that the green guys
do not create a cycle of him because the
blue the only guys that the heavier than
here mr. green guys we should check that
the green guys do not contain him in the
spam because if he is contained by the
green guys in the span then for sure the
optimum will never take him right
because they would first like the green
guys so that's that's a sanity check now
the second case second coalition is
because we want to be able to decompose
upon two independent matrix but what we
check to do that is that actually this
edge is contained in in a cycle if I
look at
the slightly lighter element have done
himself and all other elements ok so i
will look at the rebbe elements plus the
blue elements plus the green elements
and i will check to do all these
elements create a site to win myself and
they do in this case ok so so that's the
second condition so it's bambor elements
and f as of your small or high weight ok
and in this case it is span right
because this creates a cycle so we pick
it so that's the two conditions the
first one is natural the second one is a
little bit the weird and it is yes
because we want the promise to be
independent so the Hat example how would
it work out this guy he spammed by he's
not he's not done by heavier elements
right because right now I only saw the
blue guys they have all the same white
so he's fine with the condition one is
he fine we conditioned to yes he spammed
by the actually the same weight I didn't
even have to use lighter elements ok so
i take him then this guy arrives he's
fine we condition one he doesn't spin by
heavier elements but definitely he's not
fine we conditioned to because he's
there is no cycle even if i look at all
that chest containing him so i should
not take him ok and this is good news
because if this was excited a dangerous
problem right that that they had two
edges like that that they took but now i
will never be able to take to it just
like that because i need one of them to
have it in a cycle ok like i had over
here here i had two edges so this one
would port my cycle and if I could pick
that one because they create a cycle so
I will never pick that one and therefore
I will never create a site at the case
when I took two guys so I at this one is
part I can always take actually so it's
a constant competitive ratio for the
young West hat with with good news as
far as I explained as Polly so the
slightly smaller means that they look at
one weight class before me
or so how much have you seen may twist
before nobody else in matrix before
except Mohit yeah okay okay so okay so
one can i form like this this arguing
formula tomato notation is the following
so we do we define one matrix which
weight class okay so how is the magter
defined so let's look at mated and one
well and one is not so interesting so
let's look at em free well am free okay
Sam free so what does this mean well we
contract all elements that are heavier
than the third weight class that's the
blue big set and then we induce and it
should be in the span of the light
slightly lighter elements okay so this
is this red edges here they are span of
slightly smaller oils and this is the
Metroid and the reason basically the
reason that these independent sub
problems is because you contract what is
in the span of the previous one and they
will it be nicely form like an onion
okay so so that we that was just a side
remark for those at north meadows okay
but let's now analyze this algorithm and
to analyze it it's really intuitive to
think about it that's in the first case
that we have these two cases that we
take an element if it's not spam
behavior but it's spanned by slightly
smaller okay so basically by by
definition you will get the following
players they're arguing pick sonality
we'd probably at least the probability
of being span of elements we just small
away it and higher minus the probability
of being spammed by the same or higher
weight this basic by definition because
we take an element it is not spanned by
heavier guys include my own weight class
the guys at took of my own weight class
and it should be spammed by smaller
weight okay they might be dependent
that's why I don't have a preserved
universe I just small away and higher-
same or higher weight this probability
has to be large alright it contains more
elements it just smaller weight so the
probability is over the sample okay Oh
the tongue sometimes you don't pick it
because it forms a cycle with what were
you yeah yeah so that's why I have the
same same or higher the same so I will
only do it for every second which I was
lying a little bit I will only do pick
every second weight class and that
weight class I was check that it's not
spam by the same elements at I took
otherwise it would be only hi you're
here say probably this is probably a
sample okay good well elements in the
sample of smaller weight and the higher
minus probability of being spammed by
elements in a sample of higher weight
and those that you picked up the same
weight but notice that we took fifty
percent of the elements and in the worst
case we will take all the remaining
fifty percent of the same weight before
I arrived and this is the same
distribution so that's why we took fifty
percent so it's just the process you can
think of it as a probability of the
sample to be span of the smaller weight
and higher minus the same or highway
okay and let's now understand we want
this to be high right we want an honor
to be picked with high probability so
let's assume a stand why why this is
good for the Hat example so let's look
an element as opposed it's part of
weight class I ok so here the graph says
this is the probability that this span
if I only look at things that are of the
same weight or higher and here is if i
look at slightly lighter elements on
higher so what happens in the in the in
the Hat example when I look at my same
weight and higher weight it's very
unlikely to be spanned but then I look
at one weight class that's the half
behind then I'm extremely likely to be
spanned so basically it looks like
follows and that's why we get very
likely to pick elements in hurt because
they're extremely likely to be spanned
once they go for one lighter or set of
a-rod's okay
unfortunately this is the general
situation that there is no such big
that's why we don't get the constant
there is not this nice jumps okay and
now we have log and weight class here
and we now we you're stuck so now we
don't know how much information we can
get a sample so now the last party
diagram is actually to randomly group
these weight classes and now you have
log log many classes and we will do
geometric grouping again okay so here
it's a little bit Horton somebody so
again we will geometrically we will say
we will group this together in a random
way and first we will decide how many
weight class will be grouped together
and we do this geomatics Z that we group
one weight class together but to keep
the original weight classes or we take
two together or four together away
together so will be log log rank many
choices and then you also have to take a
random shift based on the size of your
weight group okay so this is a pictorial
view so now we select the size of our
bucketing and then I will do a random
shift okay and now the probability of
picking my element will exactly be this
the probability of being spammed here
minus the probability of being span
there okay see speed 0 to x 71 if I was
luckier it would be C open 3 minus 0.1
and 0.8 minus 0.1 okay and and what we
can show is that this this matter will
give you a log log rank seriously the
intuition is that nowadays log log rank
many choices because we did first we had
log-rank many waitresses now we had log
of that many different packages
so yeah so I think the main message was
that the I think the Lord grant
compatible can only use rank of my droid
so we use the micro structure well the
protection of higher weight elements and
this allows us to currently get the log
or grin competitive algorithm so let me
say what is the difference between us
arion standard the difference between
mahesh and our approach is that he we
did this geometric grouping right and
actually this random choice is
independent of the sample but he will do
is take the sample I think he will learn
engineer the best possible decomposition
and for that you need a certain T to
argue that the best possible
decomposition for the sample is also
good for the remaining part so that that
gets here it I think so but he has so
that gets very hairy with very big
hidden concerns but he has advantage
that he claims that the his album
selects log log rank with high
probability our arguing selects log log
rank fraction in expectation so what is
my belief actually I believe that there
is a clear composition that guarantees a
constant fraction so we yeah we have
some if we could so we don't really know
what kind of information of the sample
we get out so we have some some
sufficient conditions to actually write
down a decomposition but we don't know
if the sample actually gives us enough
confidence for these properties that we
need you can ask me later on okay so
thank you
cushions so do you have an example where
the median of what you select is much
smaller than 1 over low blow the ram yes
yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean one trivial
example in our case i think is to have
the Hat example the Hat example i think
yeah because there you have two weight
classes but our arguing will never look
at that you only have two weight classes
and now with huge probability we group
them together and then you take nothing
you don't take the heaviest guys in that
case yes so when you have this case then
you yet and I think what he will try to
understand what case you are in use more
randomness ah ah like you're not notice
yeah yeah so so over expert a yeah yeah
the other one who said doesn't use that
or also I don't know but I know that he
is engineering how the layers the
conversation will look the next question
would be yes silly gooses probably not
but I don't know I mean yeah it sounds
weird that you need to use your nose
yeah that was her don't reload so there
is some there is some losing constant to
reduce that you know the maximum weight
than the rank because you have to run to
assume that you know the maximum weight
you have to run the single secretary
arguing with sound constant then you
know I don't know 3,000 is a
conservative estimate is not what is
impact within the paper there is some
plus so I thought it would be easier
with writing 3,000</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
