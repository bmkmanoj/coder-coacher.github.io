hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
thank you for coming I wanted to let you
know the authors are happy to have you
come closer for the talk that works for
what they're going to do so I want to
let you know that my name is Monique
Shira and I'm pleased to welcome both
Donna Markova and Angie MacArthur to the
Microsoft Research visiting speaker
series Donna and Angie are here to
introduce their new book collaborative
intelligence in which they introduced
the concept of CQ where mind share and
influence is more important than power
where success relies on collaboration
and the ability to inspire Donna is the
CEO emeritus of professional thinking
partners
she has co-authored the book random acts
of kindness and is internationally known
for her research in the fields of
learning and perception Angie is the CEO
of professional thinking partners and
co-founder of the youth organizations
smart wired and the smart parenting
revolution she's an expert in
communication and learning styles and
spearheaded the worldwide women's web a
research initiative designed to support
developing and retaining women in
corporate leadership roles please join
me in giving them a very warm welcome
hi it's great to be here today and
really fun to be on the Microsoft campus
I had no idea it was this huge so it's
an immense honor to be here with you all
as she said where we are here to talk
about collaboration and before we get
started I just wanted to ask you all cuz
there's an immense amount of knowledge
in this room and I just want you to
recall for a moment a time when you were
collaborating with others that it was
highly effective it was a phenomenal
experience for you and you assumed for
them and just bring that to mind right
now think of some adjectives that you
might use to describe that moment or
that interaction people want to call out
some of the things that they notice
about a time like that that they can
think of high energy okay productive fun
rewarding dynamic dynamic open
satisfying selfless that's an
interesting one can you say more about
that in sort of the first day of a
residential for my MBA class and I was
paired with a bunch of students and we
had a assignment to go out and go do an
assignment well we all did were put into
groups so we didn't choose or put into
groups and the first thing we did was to
figure out who we were and forget how we
wanted to work and one things we
realized was that we had a really wide
divergence of skills to reach you guys
for engineers very detailed focus one
guy who is a project manager of KPMG
it's a very process focused
my background is marketing so more big
picture focus the other guy was in sales
who also more big picture focus with the
customer event and the thing we realized
was that we all had different styles and
that we shouldn't really waste our time
doing all the do they try to each do the
assignments
separately instead we should defer to
those who have the most intelligence
about doing certain things we'll let
them show us how they did things and so
again we would learn from their process
of learning but they were obviously
about quite about ten times faster than
the rest of us weren't we did our
assignment about 10:00 p.m. one sleep
around 11:00 then we find out found out
that a lot of the other groups have been
up until 5:00 in the morning arguing
about how to do things in right we're
just lucky for me I had a two week old
child and so for the rest of that term I
was ice skated to everybody it was not
difficult not that that's I think I feel
like I placed you in the audience to say
the answer you did because so much of
what you just spoke to is what we go
into in the book and that's a phenomenal
answer so thank you and I'm glad that
you had that one experience great so now
think of a time recently where you're
trying to collaborate with someone
specifically and it's not going well
bring that person to mind and think of
some of the conditions that you think
are getting in the way of collaborating
well with this specific person and you
don't need to name them they may be in
the room
I'm gonna put up a visual chart here
just to sort of stoke the fire a little
bit and consider some other ways in
which may make it difficult in order to
collaborate with this specific person
perhaps you can't get a word in edgewise
perhaps they feel really stressed out or
often this is one that we see a lot they
need to be right
perhaps they appear like they ask a lot
of questions that are scattered
unrelated and indecisive perhaps you
find their thinking unrealistic or
they're always looking to fix you so I
don't know how many of these
characteristics may ring true but this
is what Donna and I my partner dr.
Markova exploit heavily explored heavily
for the past 17 years and how we started
this journey
well Donna's been working on
collaborative intelligence for her whole
career for basically 50 years the moment
for me when I became really fascinated
by this issue happened about 17 years
ago we were at Sundance resort working
with an international global team and
there were CEOs and CFOs and CMOS from
all over we calculated that it costs
them on average about five thousand
dollars an hour to think with one
another and I grew up internationally
myself I grew up overseas and so I
really understood diversity from the
angle of race culture sex but what I
found a parent in that room was thinking
diversity and they were not using it
instead they were using it to argue with
one another to argue who is right just
talk over one another
there was this long pine table in the
center of the room and I swear that was
the only thing separating one person
from another from coming over the table
and I'm sure you've all experienced
meetings like that and then Donna did a
remarkable thing she stood up and she
went to the back of the room as if to
leave and she paused in the doorframe
and she asked this group it was about 13
people I think is this the high
best use of your time you have an
incredible amount of intellectual
capital in this room are you using it
and she went to leave and they all
turned towards each other and stunned
just in that one question realized no in
fact they weren't so I became fascinated
exploring this question with Donna how
do we collaborate and how do we really
can create the conditions that enable
collaboration to take place so I loved
your answer because a lot of it is
recognizing what thinking do we have in
the room and what we have in the book
and we have looked at four different
strategies that help us look at the four
different types of thinking that we can
become awareness because when we think
of collaboration when it's not working
usually it's the things many of these
things that we don't have control over
we don't have control over the other
person's attitude we don't have control
over how they think but the more with
which we can understand the thinking
diversity or the different gifts and
talents that people are bringing into
the room the wider bandwidth we have and
the reason I believe this is so
important it is our right now we were
changing jobs almost every three years
and the challenges that we all face are
so complex that unless we really
understand how to harness the thinking
diversity in the room we're just not
going to be able to solve the issues
that we have to have to solve and so
what we consider being able to think
with a wide range of people is really a
type of currency the more diversity that
you can think with the greater capacity
you have and I've just spent the last
five nights with almost a hundred
Millennials at each of these events that
we've been hosting for each night and
they are so hungry to learn this because
they realize that they may never meet
that business partner that they're
working with because they're in
Afghanistan or they're in India and so
to really understand what type of
thinking you need and what type of
thinking others bring to the table
is really a new critical currency the
reason this is so important right now is
that we were trained oh I just wanted to
show you this one cartoon by mark O'Hare
he's great and he actually gave us
permission to use this in a book
unfortunately most people are not like
dogs and we don't love them enough to
appreciate their thinking when it shows
up differently in the room but this
cartoon sort of speaks to it all
most of us were trained Oh
so the and then this is our definition
of how we define collaborative
intelligence after exploring this issue
deeply for the last two-and-a-half years
writing this book Don and I came up with
the definition of collaborative
intelligence is the measure of our
ability to think with others on behalf
of what matters to us all and to access
that intelligence we must learn to
dignify one another's differences in how
we think and use them to face complex
challenges so why this is so important
now is because we've all been trained
and educated for what we call a market
share economy this is where things have
value where we're all trying to be the
smartest person in the room because that
means we're going to get promoted and
what we're shifting to is this mindshare
economy this is where I value is based
on ideas in a market share economy if I
have one thing and I give it to Donna
then she has two things and I've lost
that one thing and that creates a whole
mental set around that in a mindshare
economy if I have one idea and Donna has
one idea and we collaborate then we
actually both walk away with two new
ideas a financial model that exemplifies
this is Airbnb currently they are
outselling every other major hotel chain
per night per hotel room yet they do not
own one hotel room so we're starting to
see
these new models that are using a mind
share mindset in order to create a whole
economy based on it but it takes a shift
and in fact we actually need both but
what we don't know how to do is create
this mind share mindset which is based
on fully collaborating another awareness
that Donna and I had as we started to
dive into this material is that most
people are using collaboration as a
buzzword but they don't really
understand what it means and what it's
not
so in our definition collaboration is
not teamwork it's not getting along and
it's often mistaken for that
collaboration is really a verb meaning
it's an action meaning you find it and
then you lose it and then you find it
again and then you lose it and so what
we've tried to provide in the book are
tools and awarenesses to help you
constantly get on back on track when you
find you've lost collaboration because
you never achieve it and then hold on to
it forever so I don't know with your
experience that you mentioned but we
constantly have to have ways of
reminding ourselves because we don't
know how to use one another or when
there is a breakdown instead we said oh
there's just that guy who just doesn't
know what he's talking about or there
she goes again she's just talking over
me we don't have a lot of tools when the
thinking breaks down and it will because
no collaboration can happen when
differences really show up on the table
so in order to illustrate this on a
cellular level
I'd like you to just sort of fold your
hands in a comfortable way
now think of one hand as yourself and
think of the other hand
as a person with whom you're trying to
collaborate who's very very different
than you
now notice is your right thumb on top or
your left we're all probably a little
bit different some people have their
right some people have your left now
does that feel comfortable to you now
unfold your hands
and refold them in the opposite way so
if your right thumb was on top now put
your left on top this is thinking with
someone who thinks differently than you
it feels strange it feels a little non
habitual now go back and forth between
habitual and non habitual which way do
your hands feel more secure which way do
they feel more safe which way do they
feel more alive like you feel your skin
and your and the space between your
fingers no an habitual so this is a
really and that's what thinking with
someone who thinks very differently than
you it's non habitual and the reason I
love this exercise is because we don't
have enough space when we go from here
habitual way of thinking which means
it's understood they think just like you
do so you're gonna expect the same
answers when you go to non habitual
there's a space in between that's
awkward
it's where the mind is going in to
wonder and we don't know how to be
awkward with one another but it's in
that awkwardness and in that state of
wonder when our minds are actually
lighting up and we can if we hold that
awkwardness and that wonder long enough
we can actually move into insight with
one another and so habitual to non
habitual and I'm going to invite dr.
Donna Markova to come up and talk now in
the book we have four strategies with
which we help one another
identify the ways in which we think we
have mind patterns which is how you
think learn and communicate and this is
the life's work of Donna so that's a
real honor to have her here with us
today and she's going to go deeper into
that in one second we have thinking
talents which is the innate ways in
which light you up and understanding
your thinking talents also helps you
understand what's going to burn you out
and what gives you energy and the brain
is the biggest energy socket uses about
30% of your caloric intake per day
you've got to know what gets you excited
and gets you out of bed in the morning
inquiry which is your natural way in
which you approach challenges and we all
have blind spots so all of these
different models also help us know what
kind of thinking we need what we're
missing and the last is mind share which
is really understanding how mindsets are
different and what we need in order to
aim our collective capacity so I'm
really excited to bring up Donna who's
going to go a little further into the
strategy of mind patterns thank you I'm
going to make you a little uncomfortable
now some of you where I live which is in
Hawaii there is a word called Ohana and
Ohana is your community it could also be
your family as your Ohana it could also
be a little cottage on the property
where your house is when you die you
want to have your Ohana around you
because one person or hopefully they all
will lean forward and the last exhale
you take they will inhale and they carry
around you're hot you're hot is your
life force and so oh ha na means those
who will carry your life force and it's
such a beautiful concept of connection
you are way too separated for me to feel
like you're my Ohana and we've been on
the road for two weeks and I've been
meeting a lot of I'm gonna say strange
but public distant people who sit back
like this this is the last event we're
doing before I go back to Hawaii I need
you closer so can you come fill in the
space and come a little closer if you do
I'll tell you a story okay that'll be my
gift for you're making yourself
uncomfortable Oh feels better ready
that feels so much better thank you
thank you yes there now my breath went
deeper I love thinking with people the
word conspire means con the Latin width
spire means breath so I love conspiring
with people I don't like being the
public expert up in front of the room
that's not really comfortable for me so
now I feel more comfortable I'm gonna
tell you a story I promised I would you
know that
diagram that that cartoon that angie
from o'hara so Angie the way that she
thinks is the one that was going in a
straight line guess which way I think so
we have learned in writing a book
together separated by thousands of miles
literally I'm in Hawaiian she's in Park
City Utah
and having one of us who thinks very
rationally and as we call it and one of
us who thinks very relationally we have
had even though I've been saying this
for 50 some-odd years we have had many
moments like this now I'm going to name
this moment in turn I was trained as a
cognitive neuroscientist so my
fascination was with how does a human
mind work when we think because we are
Homo sapiens sapiens which means we are
beings who think think
and the second sapiens which I always
wondered why it was there really means
wisdom when you think well what is
produced is wisdom however to get to
wisdom this is the process you have to
go through you go through this and this
state to the human brain is called
confusion so what has been familiar and
comfortable to you you let it go and
then your brain goes I'm not so sure and
you reach the state of confusion now if
you're ever
and you want some attention just stand
on the street corner and say I'm
confused and people will come from
everywhere to help give you the answer
so you can go back and be comfortable
but in terms of mental metabolism when
your brain goes through confusion if
nobody comes in makes you go back to
habitual and you don't make yourself go
back to habitual the next day stage
after confusion is curiosity and if you
can still hold not knowing the next
stage after curiosity is wonder I wonder
and if you can stay in the mental state
of wonder where your brain is actually
producing mostly theta waves the next
state after that is called discovery we
know very little about discovery in this
country because our education system has
taken it out of us but it is being
reclaimed there's a whole discovery
Learning Center in at MIT and want
another one at Harvard but discovery
means this and then this so I'm going to
go back now because I promised you a
story to why I got into this I'm going
to tell you a story so I'll just start
with that and that will take us into
mind patterns my father the secret that
no one told anyone my father was
first-generation American and he could
not read he quit school in eighth grade
to take care of us he had eight brothers
and sisters and a mother and a father
and at the time that's what people
didn't is born in 1901 and so he quit
school in eighth grade and he was very
very we would call it charismatic so the
secret in my family was that my father
could not read and no one else knew that
and the reason he got away with it he
worked his way up to be the CEO of Hiram
Walker you all know what hand Walker is
no it's a major company that print makes
liquor Canadian Club
it's one of the top I think they're
still there anyway so it's a big deal
and he was very used a fabulous salesman
and he was amazing relationally he would
go up to somebody and somehow scope out
ascertain what their gifts were and
bring out their gifts but you could ask
how does somebody get to be CEO of this
huge company if they can't read well he
had a daughter a younger daughter and
every day after school from the time I
was tiny and I think I was born reading
I don't know I could always read I would
go into his office close the door and he
had a big old reel-to-reel tape recorder
some of you in this room have seen big
old tape recorders it's like a like a
phone only bigger okay and next to the
tape recorder there was a pile of papers
The Wall Street Journal correspondence
blah blah blah and I would sit there and
read the microphone this big
each of the letters The Wall Street
Journal etc from the time as probably
four up until the time I was fourteen
into the tape recorder and he could
memorize he was brilliant
auditorily so he could memorize what he
heard and after everybody left the
office after but he cleaned the office
he would turn on the light on his desk
and he would listen to his daughter's
voice reading these papers and memorize
them and the next morning in the
meetings he would put glasses on the end
of his nose because people that read
seem to do that so he thought he didn't
need the glasses
and then he would move his head back and
forth holding the papers because people
who could read move their head back and
forth it's hard to imagine now what that
was like in that time what a huge secret
that was I learned a from him what it
meant to find the gift in somebody and
bring it out that's what I thought a
leader was that's why
leaders were supposed to do and I my
sister didn't but I had this capacity to
recognize people's gifts and draw them
forth my sister didn't and my mother
didn't but my father and I did the sad
part of the story that's actually really
not a sad part but the lesson he taught
me I I said things to him like at eight
years old as a daddy there's a stack I
read about it in Wall Street Journal has
three letters i B M he didn't know what
those letters were I said buy it and IBM
had just started and he did and that put
me through college and lasted alone the
one thing about my father is he would
not say I love you and he would I say
daddy do you love me do you love me I
just want to hear it and he would look
at me and he'd say here's a quarter
don't tell your mother daddy do you love
me do you love me and he later when I
was older here's 50 cents don't tell
your mother I went to college and at the
time that I went to college we were
going through this crazy thing those
people in psychology of any sort when we
were pounding on pillows and screaming
supposedly get it out so I would pound
on a pillow screaming I hate you daddy I
hate you daddy
because I stopped asking do you love me
so we'll go ahead decades
my father had Alzheimer's he was living
in Florida he was trapped behind
invisible walls and there were walls he
could not climb his fierce blue eyes
were watery and he was lost in some
space so I went down to Florida to see
him and everything had changed by that
time and what I wanted was him to know
that I loved him because I was very
aware it was the last time I was ever
going to see him
and so I took his face he's a little
prickly beard it wasn't in style then it
was just he couldn't shave and I held
his face and said daddy I love you I
love you nothing so I realized well
that's the best that I could do and I
put my purse on my shoulder and I stood
up and then an idea came to me and in
that idea was the last lesson my father
ever taught me which is the basis of all
this work I took a $5 bill out of my
wallet I took his hand and put it like
this
I put the $5 bill in his hand and I said
I love you daddy
and he blinked he looked straight at me
and said I love you too sweetheart
that's the last thing he ever said to me
but I realized later it was not just the
completion of our lives because we had
this you know he used to beat me he
called it spanking me because that's
what fathers did was for my own good it
would toughen me up he would look at me
and say you'd make such a great leader
because I had this capacity to recognize
people's gifts and talents shame you're
a girl so he drilled that into me at
least once a day making it clear that I
would never be a leader so it was a very
mixed may launch of a relationship but
the lesson that he taught me was that if
I was going to work with people I needed
to be able to enter their model of the
world and to me that is what
collaboration means I had to enter his
model of the world to remember to open
his hand and put the $5 bill in there so
the way that I'd like to explain this to
you that's what my heart and guts say to
you I'll explain it from the
neuroscientist viewpoint very quickly
it's in the book Andrea understands it
the the brain is neuroplastic
meaning your brain will grow until the
day you die that's the good news
that's an amazing news what we're
exploring now is what actually makes the
brain grow and we know there are some
things like physical exercise makes the
brain the brain grow new experiences
make the brain grow that's why discovery
is so important but discovery is really
tricky because we are most of us in
maybe not here but in most places we go
most of us are paid rewarded promoted
for seeming as if we know everything not
for going duh I don't know let me
discover this that's not how you get
promoted you get promoted for appearing
to know everything that prevents your
brain from growing so this capacity of
the brain this is called a home rep
cobraman sphere and usually we use a big
one but this one is beautiful and it was
developed by a man named Chuck Hoberman
the capacity of your brain to open bless
you
this is another metaphor for it is
caused by shifting states of attention
attention is this amazing thing that we
pay no attention to it's water to fish
attention is what causes the brain to
grow so they've done lots of research
where they expose them one to a great
deal of music and the part of the brain
that processes autom auditory
information grows where your attention
goes that's where your brain will grow
and the tension in fact has three
different states it's like liquid
attention is you can't really chop a
river up in two places but when you're
really paying attention like we're told
your brain is producing mostly beta
waves you're very organized
you're very here here you can talk in
details I'm gonna pick on Donald Trump
this is Donald Trump when he's talking
okay we're to its words Beta Beta Beta
this state of
where your brain starts producing more
alpha waves is kind of an either/or it's
like when food gets in your stomach and
your brains churning new information
with what you already know this is also
where confusion happens for Donald Trump
that's what triggers that for him is
kinesthetic moving he's very different
when he stands up and talks and when he
sits down and talks I should be using
Bill Gates but doesn't matter down the
Trump's more fun so when your brain
finally goes into this state of wonder
and discovers your brain is producing
mostly theta waves and there's big
spaces between the waves there's a
thought there's a space there's a
thought there's a space and what your
brain is doing is the same thing when
food is in your intestines your brain is
exploring possibilities it's taking one
thing and going well what if I put a
zipper together with piece of material
hmm
that would be interesting if I closed it
but velcro so that's really simple the
my research was that different things in
different people trigger these different
states of attention so in George Bush's
mind I can't resist I'm sorry it's the
last thing I gotta do George Bush's mind
auditory information remember Donald
Trump it makes his mind like this George
Bush auditory information is like this
so every time Donald Trump comes at him
with words and he's supposed to come
back with quick little he can't this
he's brain is in this state it's like
duh state so if they knew what you're
all going to know when you finished
reading our book they do much better
collaborating with each other but of
course that's not what they want to do
and when somebody pretends like George
Bush has nothing to do with politics but
George Bush is trying to talk like
Donald Trump what Jeb book I'm sorry
well George it's the same but
and it's the same auditory just both of
them that's why George Bush was famous
for all the things he said but so Jeb is
being trained to mean trained to be
auditorally assertive it's not natural
to him so it doesn't come across as
being natural to him
so these form these different states of
attention and the different triggers of
attention which is visual auditory that
means words and sounds and kinesthetic
which means movement experience taste
and smell in different ones of us
trigger different states of attention
it's really not so complex we create
musical instruments they all play music
but you play each one differently you
don't blow in a violin and expecting to
get music out but the assumption we make
about the human brain and I've been
trying to get this message across for 50
years the assumption that we make is
that all brains are violins and process
information in the same way and you know
the story you told it's such a gorgeous
story about one of the other strategies
which has to do with thinking talents
this that's like the software of the
brain this is like the hardware of the
brain it gets wired in by the time you
go through puberty we don't know why
some children are born I have a adopted
granddaughter she was born with
kinesthetic moving and doing things with
her hands makes her very alert next for
her comes visual information so she can
see visual details and also see the
visual hole and last comes auditory
information so when you ask her she's
shy shy is here so it's a really good
joke of nature that the place you are
the most shy is also the place that
creates ideas and discovers new things
so I could obviously go on for a very
long time about this Angie do you want
to do questions or yeah I think we
should move into questions because I'm
sure there there's already some so this
moment of sort of disruption or
curiosity but can that not all also
often lead to a seated
spare or hopeless nuts if you're sort of
confused know what's going on it's such
a gorgeous question so this is the
natural state it's a state of wonder
what happens in despair is this it's
kind of we haven't been taught um and uh
I Aminta to honor this so what we've
been taught is I know teacher I know I
have the answer or a parent saying I
want to know you tell me right now so
it's those conditions and the ways we've
been trained when we're in this state
this is a very vulnerable state because
it's much easier for things to get in
here you can't with your with Donald you
can't get a word in edgewise but if you
go up to him and make direct eye contact
you're in and we all feel a little
exposed because we don't have a way
defending ourselves here so it's a
really good question and I hope that at
least hold your question it doesn't
answer it but I hope it holds your
question yeah the other thing that I
would add to your question is is one of
the girls and in this millennial group
came up and she said I'm just in a state
of despair because I don't feel like I
can find my life's past like she wanted
to be able to find it tomorrow
and so she's attributing confusion to
despair because we're all supposed to
have as Donna said these answers very
quickly and so one of the things that I
think is really useful is to come up
with the question that you really can
live with for a while we call these open
questions that no one could possibly
know the answer to but you so for her
the open question would be what is my
gift that I need to give to the world
and holding that question instead of
holding on to the confusion or that she
should have answers it's sort of like
finding a path towards something bigger
it these big open questions help us hold
instead of go into a state of despair so
the way that I would ripple off of what
Angie just said is we are a culture that
is addicted to mastery and we know
nothing about mystery
and mystery lives here so being able to
hold the unknown and just go I have no
idea I just don't know I wonder wonder
what's gonna happen next it is how we
move into mystery it's a great question
thing yeah I love that question
so I've meditated for a long time I've
studied meditation for a long time the
fascinating thing to me is the way the
teacher whoever the teacher is teaches
meditation has to do with the way that
teacher processes information so tic not
hun processes information the same way
that my granddaughter did first
kinesthetic then visual he sees details
and see the whole last auditory if
you're ever studying with him he does
walking meditation that's moving first
so we'll do tic not hun spring because
we would like it to get healthy so first
you walk and you look around and then
you look at one place and you don't say
a word and you listen to your breathing
and then you stop and then when you stop
you look around
so that's tic not Hans way to meditate
it follows his pattern exactly if he's
teaching you don't ask him questions
that's the most sacred part of his brain
you write it on a piece of paper and put
it in a bell or we used to and put it in
a bell and he would read it an answer to
it so he had that visual in the middle
so every meditation teacher every
therapist follows and develops this
whole process and way of teaching that
follows their mind patterns because they
assume that everybody else works the
same way they do and you talked about
people think your clowing people are
very different you kept emphasizing
every time said very different so what
it how does it compare is it easier
collaborating so it is very different or
a little different both in awarenesses
and how they show up for you so when
collaborating well I mean it and it also
and what you're trying to do so the end
result so to use your example of when
you had a lot of people who were diverse
you describe people from marketing you
describe people who are very
process-oriented
in in that situation because of the
diversity you'll probably end up with a
better holistic view because you have
many different perspectives however if
the task is to come up with a plan to
execute on something then you want
people who are all very highly
procedural because that will make it
more efficient it's harder to hold the
diversity and there's different ways of
recognizing diversity and what makes it
difficult is just our onion ability to
recognize when someone's thinking is
different than ours and we attribute it
to personality or even attribute it to
attitude or things that again are out of
our control so or they may remind us of
mother we didn't like or a teacher we
didn't like and so when we get stuck
with someone we tend to leave you know
fight flight or freeze those are the
three ways and so that's where the
holding the space for the and and that's
when moving into inquiry for me it's
it's when I when I experience those
moments where you know that it's not
clot you're not collaborating whatever
the opposite is and we haven't found the
word that means the opposite of
collaboration difficult yeah when some
when you when different when when you
start to see differences is difficult is
I start moving into asking a lot of
different questions especially questions
that aren't natural to me because if
they may be natural to the person that
I'm trying to achieve connection with
and therefore I can so is that answer
your question yeah there's one
interesting thing as a ripple off your
question there are a hundred and twenty
I think eight books on Amazon calling
how to deal with difficult people I
could find no other title other than the
Bible where there are so many books with
the same title written by different
authors every one of those strategies
works for the author and every one of
the difficult people with somebody who
thinks differently
the hard one that's going to be and that
is coming out now is the difference in
the way that women's brains are designed
for men's brains of design and Angie and
I our publisher wanted us to take this
out of the book but I'm not going to
take it out of the book so the when I
was in graduate school and up until
about 10 years of 15 years ago
all research done on brains was done on
male brains because the Heather research
team said women's hormones get in the
way so two women at Stanford said this
is weird so they started doing and and
what the first 50 years of research said
that human beings when they're
challenged goes into fight flight or
freeze and you've all heard of that and
you just mentioned it so these two women
started doing experiments and doing
surgery on women's brains and they found
lo and behold women's brains are
physically different now we've accepted
that women's hearts are different so
when women have a heart attack they have
different symptoms so here's two of in
the book we have a whole lot of
differences but here's two differences
one difference is the amygdala which is
what triggers fight-or-flight is much
smaller in women the corpus callosum
which is like the middle it's like the
bridge between the right and less left
half is much bigger so that women easily
can go back and forth on that bridge
from rational to relational from
rational to relational what happens that
I worked with a lot of CEOs and a lot of
senior leadership teams is that for
instance royal dutch/shell the senior
leadership team was all men and one
woman and every time they would be
making a fifty thousand dollar five
hundred thousand five fifty million
dollar decision the woman would raise
her hand and say but what about the
people if you put a pipeline all across
Europe from China what about the people
in the homes that are going to be
affected and Walter van de vie but the
CEO would roll his eyes so in the same
way that men's bodies
have stronger shoulders women's brains
have a stronger capacity to go back and
forth from rational thinking to
relational thinking and there the
research is gorgeous and clean the data
is gorgeous that teams that have at
least one woman on the team are much
more successful than teams that have no
women on the teams I know this is you
know like challenging but men can learn
to think relationally some men naturally
think relationally I would imagine if we
could dissect the brains of some man who
naturally thinks relationally we'd find
a larger corpus callosum in the same way
as some women can develop their upper
body strength and all women can learn to
think rationally - but we are different
and because collaboration has to be and
will become something we all need to
learn or else we're going to destroy the
ourselves probably not the planet but
ourselves we need to be drawing more on
all of us both the men and the women my
father was a man who thought brilliantly
relationally we need to draw on that
kind of intelligence if we're going to
survive a couple there kind of related
one was just of the three types of
learning our people ever evenly split
like they don't have a preference okay
so no and then are the percentages of
people that we observe with those types
of learning is it evenly split within
populations is it changing over time we
have no idea okay all we know is that
and we meaning me so that's because
nobody wants to accept this kind of
diversity teachers say how can I deal
with so many different children in a
classroom that learn differently you
know and I go how does an orchestra
conductor deal with so many different
instruments but we have to change the
structure that we think about education
it the only thing that I have observed
in 53 years of studying this is that
some children come in with a very clear
mozart came in visual first kinesthetic
next auditory next and he came in that
way and continued that way his own
polling other kids change and change and
change when they get to puberty
if the system has marijuana in it it's
very difficult to tell how the brain is
processing information because the left
brain stops being recorded whatever
information comes first is no longer
recorded so in my brain it's visual
information and the years and years that
I and I have a photographic memory the
years and years that I was stoned I
can't tell you one thing I read it's a
waste of a long time you know
and my you couldn't tell my learning
pattern because my brain only did alpha
theta and every day beta long-winded
there was somebody over here that's what
I love that's the mental state of this
it's a great question when people fall
in love they go through this state like
I used to observe people in restaurants
and cafes they go as they're falling in
love they go through this state instead
of I'm so terrific in your soldier I've
got really no can you tell me about that
oh that's fascinating they get more and
more curious about each other so because
this is water and you haven't noticed it
you need to be able to ask wonderful
questions you just asked really a juicy
question I call it so you have to ask
someone so when you how do you organize
yourself and one person will say well I
make a list somebody else will say well
I just have to talk about it to somebody
somebody else says I make piles and you
go wow isn't that interesting your
curiosity will draw it out of them so
that's one way another way Angie is
brilliant at inquiry and our book has a
whole section on inquiry another way is
to ask about past so when you were one
time in your life when you're really
organized what did you do how did you
organize back then I know now you feel
like you're a disorganized mess but back
then give me one day because we are
brains
door the history of success the third
way is there are two apps that are
written down ones for parents with
children they're for free on another
Apple I guess I can sit on the iTunes
Store and one is for one strategy which
is called smart spark and that helps
parents learn about themselves and their
kids and the other one is called
thinking talents which is a the software
that we were talking about with your
Kylie analytic or if you're good at
telling stories or so forth
so that's the best we've done so far
you'll walk out of here and you'll start
spreading this and talking to other
people and we'll all start being in
wonder with each other and that's not
such a bad place to be and I'll just add
onto a done' so because i think
especially in meetings what you start to
notice is first more self-awareness or
with this for your own thinking so when
you find yourself slightly checking out
or you're going into a wider state if
you're trying to generate ideas and
meetings that's good you know because
this is where insight happens but if
you're trying to come up with a very
specific marketing plan or you you need
this more focused alert state of
attention you may start fidgeting and it
may be actually better for you to get up
and wander around the room cuz that'll
help you remain alert and focused for
another person actually writing or
actually being up on a flip chart really
helps them stay focused but what happens
as we meet around these long tables and
we think talking back and forth taking
individual notes instead of one big
collective visual not allowing the space
in order to move that that's the best
way to pay attention when in fact the
more diversity that we can have in any
meeting room and often best decisions
are made on a walk and talk with someone
because you'll actually get them in a
different state and so it's it's there's
specific things you start to notice
about someone else but the most
important thing is just to shift the
different state of attention or input if
it's not working so if you notice that
you keep telling someone that and
they're not doing or responding to you
verbally send them an email send them a
tag these are very simple
things or ask them to go for a walk
because by shifting that one state of
attention or that mode of communication
you are gonna get a different result
influence you're not running the meeting
how can you best change well I'm really
curious to see what Donna says but I
mean for me I think it's you know we all
have to start being more courageous
because then when we interview people
talk to people all over the world the
number one complaint people have is the
boring unproductive useless meetings
whether they're on the phone or alive
and so even naming okay nothing personal
against anyone here but I don't think
we're all using our full capacity what
do people need in order to think better
just even inviting that question into
the middle and start taking care of
yourself and it does require being brave
and saying you know it really helps me
to think on my feet we worked with Ted
Turner he doesn't have a desk in his
office he wanders around in a
hierarchical company we may have thought
he was you know hyperactive hyperactive
so we need to you know start breaking
some rules be a little braver because
the essence of this is when you are
using in your mind as Donna said it's
like water we know it we call it the
flow state when your mind is going from
here to here to here and you're having
insights and then you're really
productive you're in the flow state and
the more that we each understand what
creates that for ourselves and then
mimic those conditions as often as
possible we're going to be the guy that
or the gal at the top anyway but it does
require sort of bringing this awareness
to to others and so and you know as I
said the Millennials that I just work
with this is how they want to walk there
you know every coffee shop is now full
of people interacting working with one
enough
in different ways so they are anxious
they're dying you know what did they
call it death by cubicle I mean all
these different you know ways and so the
the thing I want to add about that is we
I worked one time with the CEO of
Chrysler and his senior leadership team
and we were talking about this
information and during the break and
only during the break this woman came up
to me and said you know what you said
about kinesthetic and some people need
to move that's me I can't pay attention
unless I'm moving I said great but how
come this whole meeting you've sat in
the chair and she said well everybody
else did I couldn't I just couldn't get
out of the chair even knowing I need to
do it I just couldn't get out of the
chair we have been taught to think about
ourselves in terms of you got 12 wrong
on the spelling test not you got eight
right so we as a culture have very
little compassion for our own
differences and when your system when
your system does I need to move I can't
moving the boss in the room number two
is it moving then you keep pushing it
down and pushing it down and we call
that despair we call that depression
because we are literally pressing down
our needs to be productive to be engaged
to connect 85 percent of your brain 86
87 nobody knows exactly is devoted to
connecting with other people that's a
huge amount of but a brain capacity that
we have so to be able it does take
courage as in presence of heart to say
you know I really want to pay attention
right now
and I'm spacing out I'd like to be here
but I just I'm spacing out so can't so I
just want to tell you all that that
takes a lot of courage to say that but
that also takes a lot of self compassion
or caring about what you have to bring
my grandmother used to kiss my
fingertips because she'd say these marks
at the ends of your fingerprints never
before has there been
another such as you that has marks like
this and never again will there be
another you're one of a kind so I grew
up believing and recognizing that there
was something unique that I had to offer
I didn't know what it was and there's
something unique that every person in
this room has to offer and so the word
respect means to see again as if for the
first time to respect your needs to move
or walk or have quiet just too many
words I need to think can there be just
a minute of quiet in the room to talk
about yourself not other people you all
are doing it no just I need right now to
be heard so yes you're a wonderful Ohana
