users get a better experience using
applications that are hosted in data
centers let's retrieve regardless of
what kind of application it is whether
it's web search whether it's
collaborative application social network
applications or things like hosted
office or exchange where people are
using applications running from our data
centers from wherever computer they
happen to be sitting in front of
we're the cloud faster development team
i'm peruvian patel i'm albert greenberg
IMG thuppaki I'm Moody's children and
I'm Dave malts we'll be doing is showing
you a demo of how applications can be
much faster using the technologies we've
developed what i have on screen here is
a number those two web pages imagine
you're going to a social networking site
each of these photos are photos coming
from my friends in order to assemble
this page a huge amount of computation
has to go on inside the data center to
get all the computation accomplished
quickly the work is spread out over many
many machines and that makes the network
inside the data center very important so
for example but i have on screen right
here our to web pages might come from a
social networking site to decide what
picture should be shown to me i'm going
to send a request in to the data center
that's going to be farmed out to lots of
computers which are going to decide
what's the most relevant information to
send to me all that information is going
to pour back into the one computer that
has to figure out which pictures to show
to me and information can be lost in the
process so for example on the left kind
of performance you get using the
protocols that operate inside the data
center today effectively what happens is
that some of the information is being
lost and that actually shows up and how
long it takes to put together the page
that we say user is going to see where
by replacing some of the software and
the network stack inside the data center
with what we call data center tcp we can
get much much better performance now
this is what that social network site
would look like if we were sitting right
next to the data center here's what the
web might look like to someone who's
coming over a cable modem not only does
the data center have to pick which
pictures are going to be shown to the
user but then the pictures actually have
to make it from the data center down to
the users computer we've been working on
improvements that go inside the white
area that'll take the time down to what
you're seeing here basically we're
finding ways to use the internet more
efficiently get more information more
effectively to the users in a shorter
period of time and we can take the page
load times down from in this case ten
seconds down to five seconds and that
really is going to make an improvement
and how you people experience the
applications that they use over the
Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
