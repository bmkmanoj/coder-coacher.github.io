Microsoft's chief research and strategy
officer talked with students about how
new approaches in computing will help
solve complex issues from environmental
change to growing the global economy to
improving health care and education
today the world is coupled together both
electronically and environmentally at a
level that it really wasn't in the past
and I think these have presented a new
set of challenges and so science and
engineering are going to have to step up
again in this case I think with the aid
of computing you don't ever think about
a computer being able to solve you know
global warming or health problems around
the world or education everything that
Craig was talking about so it's pretty
amazing that they've been able to build
these models and and you know develop
this new software and new technology
that's going to address those types of
things through demonstrations monday
illustrated how technology is changing
how people interact with the world and
what it might be like to be a research
scientist in the future I personally
would like to have the displays just
because they're cool but I think the
most useful part was actually the
scientific work station I think that's a
really important piece that we're
missing as we're moving from the
graphical user interface into the
natural user interface it made me feel
that the technology we're having right
now and it's more of a fossil technology
or going to become a fossil technology
within a couple of 23 years since I'm
pursuing zero-carbon research you know I
can start to write that and it says okay
you know that's probably what you're
doing in a keynote address Monday spoke
about how future computers will help
fundamentally change how we live play
work and solve problems it's sort of
doing for scientists in a large scale
what Excel did for business people you
know 20 years ago which was give you a
way of expressing problems that it's
more natural to you and without having
to go learn about writing programs in a
traditional sense I think was very
interested in the idea of eye tracking
is an actual capability
so it's been movie stuff for a while and
it would be fun to actually see in a
real office today's discussions and
demos at Harvard will be followed by
additional college visits this week at
the University of Illinois at
urbana-champaign and the University of
Washington in Seattle
