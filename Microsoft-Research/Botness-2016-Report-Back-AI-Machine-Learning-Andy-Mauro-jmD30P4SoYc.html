and Lu exedra session there was 20
people there ballpark basically the
first question we started actually we
did we did a little bit of stats to so
actually must have been 23 so there was
10 b2b companies there and 13 b2c
companies and then there was robbed from
slack and lily and Lars from Microsoft
so it's more like 25 and really the
first question we started with was do we
even need a i right i mean that's a huge
question that comes up with everybody we
i will leave the punchline to the end we
actually asked everyone to vote on that
after but some of the things that came
up were definitely not for all use cases
so you don't always need AI this
definitely isn't all about text back and
forth seems pretty obvious but so for
some use cases most people did think
that some version of AI although the
definition AI is all things to all
people right so we spent a lot of time
talking about different types of AI a
lot of folks are saying hey I'm trying
to do natural language understanding i'm
trying to do this stuff what tools
because most of the tools aren't working
for them the way they would want and
this actually led to i think one of the
more exciting parts of it is there is a
really huge vertical opportunity for
startups to be starting to solve not
just the business problem but also this
sort of using AI in a really vertical
eyes dwai so really starting to you know
the big companies are not going to have
internal enterprise data for example
there's other you know given consumer
problems they're not seeing through
through the platforms they have Pete
said it was memorable messaging BOTS
need to be or the AI and messaging BOTS
need to be sloppy and forgiving so that
should stick with you and then one thing
Lily had brought up which I thought was
awesome was you know this idea of the
chit chat bot kind of aspect you know
the Tay or shall I suspect opening that
up to all of us to provide that
background ability along with the
vertical eyes capability that we all
want to solve for would be really useful
so you know Qi Liu from Microsoft has
data that shows that you know with Joe
ice you can actually convert if you can
have more natural conversations as
opposed to all of us just trying to like
drive everyone through this conversion
funnel without any sort of chitchat back
and forth so we would love to see that
for Microsoft and others and then at the
end we asked everybody it was actually a
pretty like anti AI conversation you
know it's kind of like
yeah i don't know i don't think you know
then we asked her one at the end and we
had need a i was 17 and no we don't was
three so that's where we ended up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
