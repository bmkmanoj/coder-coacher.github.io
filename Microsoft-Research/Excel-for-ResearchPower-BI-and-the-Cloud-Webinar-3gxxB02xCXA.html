Excel for research power bi and the
cloud Kenji you now have the floor hello
everyone and thank you for joining us
for one of our windows as your for
research webinars we're really delighted
to have jeff zhang here to talk about
excel and particularly some of the new
features in power bi which is really the
great tool for dealing with data and
visualizing an understanding your data
so we're really really happy that Jeff
is joining us to take you through that
our windows agile for research program
is a global program where we're working
with the research community to help help
them understand get on board and really
make use of cloud computing for their
work so we have a website actual for
research calm and you can follow us on
Twitter on at actual for research and
also for the power bi
team at Microsoft bi is the Twitter
account for that so with that I'd like
to hand over to Jeff who's going to talk
a bit about xlm power bi and then do
some great live demos and then I shall
catch up with everyone at the end so
thanks very much and over to you Jeff
okay thank you Kenji hello everyone this
is jeff john I'm a program manager from
Microsoft Excel team today I'm going to
show you the power of Excel power bi
walk you through a couple scenarios of
using Excel power bi to process and
visualize the research data and get
quicker data insights in a more
intuitive manner hopefully after this 40
minutes demo you can help you to see the
potential of the ECL power bi and
probably help you start making use of it
in your daily research work so I'm not a
researcher I'm just engineer but here is
a diagram that one researcher from
microsoft research environment here told
me that doing research because a lot of
intellectual false power to get insights
from complex market source data or
through different or combined
perspectives the more data you have the
better you can develop ideas or insights
collaborate in real world there's a
dilemma that the more volume or complex
data you got the more time it takes you
to process it and make it even usable so
the majority of your time from what I
heard it's about eighty percent or
consumed by working on the tedious
they'd have discovery in cleaning or
formatting job you can help me in that
is case in your daily work what we
really want is to use the tool that you
are probably already familiar with you
greatly shorten the time of data
pre-processing and quickly generate
meaningful in the interactive visuals
help you can quicker data insights about
massive data you got and what you really
want is to save your time on shaping the
data on
your empower and put it on the real
research work we think the power bi
tools that we produce from Microsoft can
help you out so P I will not give the
presentation to some of the conference
in the research people they don't quite
know what is P I actually bi stands for
business intelligence Microsoft have
class develop I solutions for over a
decade for enterprises to digest the
sheer volume of data that's increasing
each day power bi is a reason offering
from Microsoft based on office 365 that
empowers individual users to
interactively process and the
visualizing the data in the data
processing tool that already familiar
with which is Excel so actually power bi
is composed by subtle features and there
are power pivot which is a highly
efficient in memory engine compressing
and the indexing data in Excel and
allows Excel to handle millions rows of
data and then its power Curie which is a
tool help you define connect you and
compile data from various resources and
and there is power view essentially
Power View is not active dashboard help
you to gather data insights from
combined perspectives in the last one is
power map which allows you to put a
special time series in 21 view to
generate geo base active diagrams
okay that's enough talking let's put our
hands on some real data see how to make
use of these powerful tools so here on
this slide is a set of streamflow data
from what Rogue River where is the rib
which is the river resizing the texas
united states so i got this data from a
professor from university of washington
who is doing the environmental study so
i believe he got his data from some
public website which recalls the
streamflow on different spots along side
the quadra believer in Texas as on this
line you see that these different tables
shows the raw data from the devices and
I'm not sure whether you see similar
data that your daily work probably is
even better format it than the ones that
you got so I'm just take a closer look
at these data I want you to take a
moment you think so with the tools of
doing data processing that you are using
today probably also excel how would you
process this data and the answers to
questions like what's what was happening
on the guadalupe river in terms of
stream flow during a period of time says
that from june to october includes a 30
so i'll just give you the seconds to
think about it
so I see I'm not sure what kind of
solutions that you have mine already but
I see that a few challenges here first
you see that this on this sheet you see
that the name of the sensor the latitude
longitude which is the position
information and the stream flow is
putting the same color so if we want to
produce any visuals we probably won't
you move the latitude longitude into to
the column is that is instead of the row
and also the name of the sensor as well
that's the first thing that we need to
do and the second thing take a closer to
the day time you see the data here is
the raw data from the device I'm sure
that you promised see the similar data
which is something like data that's kind
of program in this way with the device
was installed however this kind of data
format which is a few attacks doesn't
mean anything the charging to Lakeisha
this is not normal or understandable
date time format that can be easily
instead by Excel needed user process on
that at the last day that I can see is
that these time intervals which is like
every 15 minutes it's something that we
can have but the non-naturally that we
need to have this grand energy so we may
need to do some recreational data so
those are things that are coming to my
mind when I first touch this data so I'm
not sure how would you realize that that
we process today how you utilize that
the data should be presented maybe it's
a like two dimensional line chart that
represents the stream flow of one sensor
or average stream flow across different
spots on the river on different time as
the access so that could be a
possibility but another possibility
which is something that I produced using
our power bi is something like this
so not sure whether you notice that but
here is a video that is essentially
putting a charge on our map so this
different spot represents different your
position of the sensors alongside the
guadalupe river and the height of each
column actually means the stream flow of
that moment when you place so i'll play
it again you can take a look again to
see what it is
so I'll see that when I play it the time
actually is standing over here indicates
which day that is the data we present at
at the moment so you see the animation
and probably a ucs bike sometime in the
middle which is actually happening in
October so this actually tells not only
that how the streamflow holiday looks
like on a different part of the river
map very directly but also I'd act at
the x axis tells you that the different
time across the year how the stream flow
changes the spike that you see in
October is actually something happening
only on this response but not on up the
strips so there must be something
happening this area I'll play that again
notice when it comes to october there's
a spike
so once we see this kind of animation we
started thinking further are beyond the
data we got like the spark I just
mentioned you ask yourself a question
why is this happening what happened over
in this area during that time frame
actually represent the same thing to
some of the researchers in the
conference ecology you say they told me
some of them actually from that area
Texas they told me that during October
there was a heavy rain last year October
happening just in this part of the of
the state that's why the stream flow has
spiked only in these two spots but not
in upstream just the downstream so tell
me what if you're interested I feel is
always very very fascinating grab the
data insights so this kind of visual way
so to generate something like like that
video we need to put everything as I
mentioned early that we need to put
everything into one table for example we
need to put the the name of the sensor
in one column and then the latitude
longitude and daytime and stream flow in
different columns Sims is very easy
right but from the raw data that we just
look at second ago it's actually not
that easy just to handle that so maybe
you think you can sink a lot of ways to
do that but it's not just easy you know
next time so how can we do that so let
me show you something live demo how to
use the power cure it
go back no raw data so basically in this
book contest several spreadsheet in each
special essentially is the data that we
got from the sensor and this is a
original data that I didn't process at
all so those represents the different
sensors allow that the river so to
handle that well we are used to call
power Curie you make use of that I just
make a table first you see that even
just for this one sensor this form of
data is like more than 12,000 ropes it's
a lot of data
and then when i switch power theory
which is something that you will get
when you have power bi offerings
together with your office 365
subscription then you will have this
power Curie tab so on Mercury tab you
can see that you can CAD data from
different places you can get data from
the existing book book and also some
other data operations now what we want
to do is just you put this data into
power Curie to kill the pre-processing
crease pattern to import data from take
a table first and then go back to park
theory input is data in power Curie and
then you see there's a separate window
coming up so this is separate window
from excel but looks similar in terms of
the layout of the you one so these
parties the covers shows the three data
with the data you just imported and this
part is the ribbon shows all the
functions that you can use to operate
the data and on the right hand side
cutter it shows the properties of the
data set as well as the steps that you
can you can see that we prefer the
operations will shows the different
steps over here so what I want to do
here is that so I want to do several
things remember I want you to put these
in two columns I want to do some data
processing for this day time column data
and I also wanted to do some aggregation
first of all I I don't need these
several rows of data because I want you
Oh gasps the data into a calm manner
let's say that out you just remove them
for a moment so it's very easy I can
just choose to remove pablos and remove
the first six rows because this is six
rows over here and then just through two
clicks I have this pure data of the data
and Chris pounding streamflow data that
I got here so I just double click to
change the title to be
a time and stream flow that's the first
step and you see it as a step over here
it shows that what I did and I can
navigate through the steps to repro what
I was doing see this is the original
data and do the first remove first
columns and then rename the column title
so next what I want to do is to
and then what I want to do is to process
this data column so as I mentioned
before you see this day time it runs the
date and then with the tea and then time
and then some members at the hotel
probably represents how much time it
takes to record the data so how can we
handle that first I think I need to
extract page from this text so what I
want to do is to slap this color and
supply the column a some delimiter so
mercury allows you to split column by
different two characters like column
call my equal sign and in this case I
want to speak common color use the
character because you see T is
essentially the separator between the
date and time so I'll type T here split
from the left and then on magnetic
generates two column for me why is the
column represents the date and the other
is the column represents the time but a
time itself doesn't really dry just
looks right because if you like go back
to the previous lab so it says that
power Curie intelligently change the
column part for me after I speed column
however the changing of the second
column is incorrect because this
represents the like 12am is now 10
instead of 2pm so i think is because of
this messy stream format here what i
need to do is to river back and don't
let it change the time formula battery
and if i want you further process to
extract the time without without what I
can do here tell me from what I did just
now yeah probably already see that I can
speed the column again by using the
character of dot right you see the dot
here which separates the time and the
time station are cracked in the data
so I can use the start but here i just
want to show you show you another power
or another way of doing it which is
using the level of characters because
you see the time always use the eight
characters here i can say that i used
the eight number of characters to
separate the color from left that is
gone it by eight
and you see this timing is right because
now it can crack it understand this is
12 a.m. and this is the time so this is
something I've been uh need to do the
reputation because it's all the same all
right so i can just delete it and here
you see the data time so uh i mentioned
earlier that we want to do some
aggregation for example when I represent
these four months data which is like
more than 12,000 rows of data I may not
need that grand narrative so I just need
a data average by day so what I can do
here is that i can say that group the
data by my daytime point one which is
the first color and i want to make a new
column called flow average and do the
operation of average out the streamflow
column so once i click ok you will see
that there's only two column left why is
the original daytime column which is
sorted by date and the other is the
stream flow calm which is a new column
that I creates the data by date see that
it's very convenient right before when I
want to do that ebony try some like
algorithms in the using vba or use
complicated formulas easy excel to do
that but now you see that to achieve
this is very easy i just need a cup of
clicks and then progress is achieved so
let me reword back say that um I also
represent this to some of the graduate
students they asked me why she says that
hey sometimes I don't want to see the
data by date because i was only see like
in one day was the average stream flow
across different hours so what I can do
here is to instead of goodbye day I can
also buy buy time instead of by the
first column a column by the second
column says that taken by the time that
a cracker the data
and also aggregate the second column and
then you achieve the same go so I'll
just save that step here I'll just save
that step here because you know
essentially we're gonna use these data
okay so the next thing that I want to do
is to add back columns that I mentioned
earlier that we want you added the
latitude data and a longitude data how
can i do that i can just simply insert a
column and i put of the value as let's
say name the name these set of data is
Votto at comfort click OK
plus I I user the street here I need to
add the string indicator
and that's done you see that all the
rows of this new column or specify was
the value we just I just looked so I can
change the title you name and I if I
want you just reorder it I can reorder
it and remember i still have the
original latitude and longitude data
over here i can say that i only insert
another column and put the latitude data
which is 29 and then hey and then add it
at latitude the same way i minus
longitude
so the data looks much better now AM do
is to click a prior close and this data
will be saving back to excel you knew
what and you remember that we
used to have more than 12,000 goals now
we only have like 10 39 rose is because
we've already aggregated data by date so
when you slap the data that you just put
in here you see the right hand side has
been coming up since that this is the
table that you just produced if you want
to do further editing say that i only do
aggregation or I want you to data
processing a combined data and time I
always go back and see the data over
here as well as the steps and they can
freely click back to replay the steps
that you just did okay that's that's the
step that I showed using power Curie to
form a twank a roll data and I can do
the same to the rest of the columns so
what I'm going to soon show you next is
that with this data what do you need to
do is to combine the tables that you
made from white sheet up another right
so for example these are the first table
that we just made and then this is the
second one and essentially what we need
is to put all the data in one table so
that we can use this one table to
produce some of the graphics that we
think would make sense so what you do
here you see when I select the data here
on the right hand side has been the
power Curie selection will be shown here
and then you can just continue to add a
that double click on continue at it and
to open one table after another I can
just simply click is a pet button and
the slacked append the first table have
made to the current
which is the second table click OK and
it's down any don't see the data change
here because I would have it only shows
one hundred rolls but if we click apply
and close go back to the original
spreadsheet and you will see that you
will see that we have the like two
different sensors data you one table
ready and you can ask you the same to
the rest of the sensors data and just
like 20 minutes you get your data down
so after we got a data how can we
produce that fancy visual and video so
here's the data so I just shorten the
stabs due to the time constraint but you
can see this is the final data after I
combine these seven different sensors
data into one table so another tool that
I'm going to use is called power map
which is also part of the offerings with
Microsoft power bi so happy you have
that offer installed with your office
365 then in the Excel the insert tab you
won't see a map button over here so who
is the data that you have a new
spreadsheet you just need to simply
click the disc back button and then in
will bring up our map and this is the
tool is called the 20 which is the
visual the interactive issue that I just
show you you sulo video so that's the
existing one but i just want to show you
how to how easy it is to create a new
one I just click this new cube so once I
click on that particularly instantly
understand the data that i have in my
excel spreadsheet you see this is the
separate window from excel in the also
similar layout the operations and
properties that you can see down the
right-hand side that mean sighs see the
different tools and here in the middle
you see a map so this map is actually a
power data backed by the beam maps the
maps engine and
power map was it digest the data from my
spreadsheet it smartly tells that oh
there's latitude longitude that you can
use represents the position on the map I
can use either one because this other
thing in terms of counting the graph
visual position on a map so what I need
to do next is to specify what I want to
put on the on this map put the first
thing I want to add of course is the
streamflow the average swim through all
data I just click check the button you
see because all my members that this is
kind of imagined and data it will be the
height of the column chart I can I can
change from these four different chance
the bubble chart keep map chart a
non-region chart because we don't have a
region in this data sauce so I just
check it back to the column chart and
you see the stream flow has been
aggregated what I want to do is that
because i have already done aggregation
power Curie so i will just sleep that
stem there's no aggregation and then the
second they only do you remember that we
already have a time-space final table I
just want to check this time in mercury
power maps market attack this is the
date time format that they can't stand
it kind of stands in the power map and
add another axis on bottom which is a
time axis also here you can see the
tenth day tom has been a specified here
the last thing I wanna do is to put the
sensor name on top and then it
represents a different color on the map
you can see the different color
represents a different place and
different sensors and here we go we have
we have active and it made it map that
we just saw before very easy right less
than three minutes you get expensive
video and if you don't like this kind of
map you can also change from even themes
of maps example what that I use
think it's this one so this is what we
use and you can navigate it soon to mean
zoom out while you play time series and
another fastest in that you can do is to
not only capture a screenshot but also
you can create a video from this place
or to you by just click this button you
can pray different quality of videos
just you same time I'm not going to
reproduce this video but is very easy
just choose the ecology of the video
that you want and click create an power
map or study create videos and they are
with the video which is in that packed
full format you had a share that too
many place like a cute way any other
place that you want to share also even
okay so this is power map so um the next
thing I want to talk about also back to
power Curie's that you see that when i
get a data from power Curie's actually I
just make a table in the Excel
spreadsheet and the receiver data from
that table into power Curie to do the
data processing however Parkers ability
is much more than that the Nollan can
retrieve data from web from lucky so
different files from different type of
data sources or databases or even from
like facebook fees all data fees or like
as your marketplace just to show the
power of the cloud connection or just to
show you that you can make use of the
Windows Azure blob storage for example I
already have a blob storage called a
show data click OK and then power Curie
will bring up the category and the
container from my actual storage block
and from the different block you can
load the data into power query directory
you see this is a binary that it's
loaded from the Asha blah
this is essentially the same data I just
processed and you can start over from
there in process the data empower curing
so just to show this is the table is the
same one okay so that is our first demo
today so I'll give a few minutes to you
to ask crashes
Jeff so far I don't have any questions
for you to answer so if you'd like to go
ahead and get in go ahead okay so um
okay so we'll just go ahead on to the
second demo so the next one I'm going to
show you
yes I actually I actually do have one
question for you I'm going to go ahead
and send that to you now
ok the question that I've got is that
just wondering whether this is an
additional charge for power bi offerings
or this is part of office justified by
asha so this is a new product that's
just newly released by microsoft and the
current offer is something based upon
officers fine but it's a separate offer
so I'll take our series of resources
I've subscription you need to pay some
amount of actual money to get these
offerings that's not offering for now
but I think for the edu users for the
education sector users what I know is
that probably that will be a separate
prayer but just ate you and I believe
that only that will be something coming
out okay so shall we go back to our demo
yep and you have a few compliments to
it's a great demo so far
so the next time i'm going to show you
is the power of view so power view as i
mentioned early is that you active
dashpot i remembered i mentioned that a
lot of times well battered data insights
come from combining the different
perspectives of data so per view
although is served as like the caning
quick business inside and making
business in decisions but to me from
what i see it also helpful for the
researchers to doing the research by
seeing the data from different
perspectives so here's an example this
is another kind of like environmental
study data which is the war in data
that's gathered around Fujisan which is
the area around seattle see LOL pics the
other area so on the left hand side is a
map also based on beam map shows the
different marine data and you can
navigate a map actually this is active
and you can navigate to mean zoom out
and see the different positions of the
marines or sensors plus at the Puget
Sound area and see well the data is
actually gathered on the right hand side
this is the data actually from also
similar with the demo that we show just
now is the raw data of the discharge
data or the streamflow data that we
gathered from the Marines so I got his
data from a website from environmental
company that shows the like different
eyes if changes or the waves changes
along different rivers around Puget
Sound area the cool thing of that is
that you see the two or three different
prospect is not one map for example that
you break a 20 positions of the
different Marines and you see the
discharge data the each sensors as well
as the streamflow data in another cool
part is that the data between the charts
on this dashboard is actually associated
what I'm embarrassed that for example if
I click on this peak
spot over here means that you are
slacking the story on the right hand
side it only shows this marine I which
is more in this gadget and this is a sad
that you have seen kind of geo down gioi
view of the data in a for this marine
sensor so if I want you only see for
example this chick you see is charged
data is too prominent I want to see the
details of this stream flow data what I
only do is very simple it's just you
like I'll select the disk age has laid
the front moment and now can see the
stream flow data so actually that pack
up our in the shape of the line chart of
these two different bashment you can see
essentially the same it's just that the
attachment is different right and I can
also i'll select this specific marine
from the map and you can see the
overview okay so it's kind of very fancy
some other fantasy that you can do here
is to you like for example I can change
if I don't like the background of the I
can change to the wrong man and if I
only see the name of the ring directly
on the map i can also do that here if I
don't like the line chart I can also
change the chart I'm to be column chart
just by couple clicks it's very common
so um some of the power that we can do
here is that for example that go back to
magenta
lattice so for example that I only want
to see these three Maurice data in green
on this quarry and pick up so what I
want to do is like this shot and the
filter the charge by only choose these
three aureus and I'm a compile this the
discharge data of these three different
Marines or if I only want you as I
mentioned earlier only wanna see the
stream flow data I can also see that
here so just by purely seen this shape
of the line you probably can ask
yourself crushing it looks like the
stream flow of these three different
Marines looks similar in terms of the
pattern right they must share a similar
pattern especially between East agree
and his party and then in terms of
people up you know the pattern similar
is just have a larger volume there must
be something happened behind that so why
is that when asked myself they're
crushing I I go back to the map come
back to this view as I said that down
you just want to take a closer look at
the data please keep three different
Maurice and figured that there is she on
a similar pattern and I just asked
myself across why'd I have to sing the
pattern I go to the pap I check the
position of these three different
worries the green is here your love is
here and his body is here so I see
there's a big snow mountain over here
which is about the right here I did meet
this area and know that so probably the
reason that they shared a similar
pattern is not only in that you Joe
position of history or in or the river
is all like the data sauce or the water
source is mostly from the mountain
I also but also is that you know as some
of the researchers who study the story
data in Tucson area they told me that
actually the water comes from the snow
mountain and these two rivers go go go
through green and a nice quality and
they will just go back concentrate in
this point at piola that's why you know
the order comes from these two rivers
and the merge cute beauty sums through
puyallup that's why we see this pattern
so isn't that interesting i feels very
tasty just by these through creeks so
are you may wondering this fancy chart
on dashboard how can i create that it's
actually very easy i'm going to show you
that so also with the power with the
power bi offering together with
obviously is five and once you have that
you will see a batter here in the insert
tab in excel say its power of you yeah
i'm just going to click on power view
and create a new one in the specified
name first
so 100 question later just put the neck
first and then what I want to do is I
want to add the orange data onto a map
so you see the data over here you can
all these table 1 for a moment this is
just experimentation data that i put
early but essentially the data
throughout the previous Power View
coming from these two tables why is the
facts table which is this table which is
the similar data that we got from the
previous devil original data aggregated
data by day the name and the second
table that you use is the metadata which
Maureen which represents the latitude
and longitude and probably the name
which represents is simple table okay so
go back to the power of you are going to
create first I want to create that map
so what I need to do is to use the green
beta data put everything on to the map
and you see here it's a raw table being
pulled on the dashboard so that's I want
to make it back just click on map button
and then change to your map on the right
hand side you see we need to specify the
longitude and latitude so it's so easy I
can just do that by dragon job and then
you see the particle maps shown here but
we may not need that park maps so what
we need to do it's simply change the
location name to rename and then I don't
need these political marbles so here you
see the map and through the layout
button I can adjust the data legend
maybe I don't need the title for this
one and here we go we got a map that we
saw earlier the original devil ok that's
the map and that's what I got on your
galleries instead of chats the line
chance so before I do that you see that
probably all of those dots doesn't
really mean anything right because the
the dots here the color of the dots
represents a different type of Marines
but the size of the Dodge we still need
to have some specification for it so you
see the data them using here are the
data that i got from once a same table
but i actually i can use the data from
two different tables and show that into
one chant what i want to do is that here
you see the census use the latitude data
which is wrong I just remove this sphere
for a moment and then and select for
example just use the discharge data for
the size of the circle so you see that's
represent on the map you may have a
question how can i connect these two
tables together you know just from the
Excel these are just two simple tables
the facts table and the main idea how
can i connect them two together actually
powerview you can do that directly by
clicking this relationship button
obviously our creativity from
relationship here but what what I want
to do is actually create a new
relationship between the two tables says
that in the facts table here i'm just
using the name and make sure the name is
that that accomplishing the two men two
tables and choose the beta table and
then use the name they are concrete but
per views is smart enough to tell that
this relationship has created before
hand so I don't need to recreate that
again but if you are starting from
scratch you'll have to recreate this
table man
let's quickly proceed to the second one
now what I need to do is to use the data
in the facts table again I put
everything on a dashboard and then i'll
change the type of the chart can be a
line chart yeah i will use the value
value discharge and quality state is
right and access actually I don't need
to use name as a society they'd probably
right and the legend is value is right
in the vertical multiples which is the
vertical like different tire of the chat
I don't use date I want use today then
here we go so see how easy it is to
create is part of you altogether it only
takes like three minutes five minutes
and then you can get the videos you want
in a static jury and your data to gather
the data users that really want help for
your research so that's that's all the
demo for today so well leave two minutes
for Q&amp;amp;A and then I'll hand over to kenji
ok I got a question of is there a way to
save power Curie and apply it to your
different data set with the same
structure and a format so I think the
question here is that whether can likely
we pros using the same steps actually
you can
show that
so we may not have enough time to do
that but essentially the power Curie
data is a set up scripts that you can
program by yourself so we throw em in
the face that you do so you can just
reproduce all the steps and do the patch
at it against the different data sources
and not another cool thing that I miss
to mention is that empower Curie not
only that you can not only that you can
process the data but also you can share
the data to other people for example for
this day that I just produced because I
log into a power Curie with my corporate
microsoft credentials so I can just show
this data directly to my co-workers
in this enterprise or too many people
that want to specify here which I share
that the other people can discover that
by search the data from this place for
example I can just quickly search data
from this online search since that I
won't you search data the population by
country actually this is the data brief
has been mined and also formatted by
some of my colleague ours like you can
explore data attribute data in this way
I can also let the data into my current
work sheet by just these few clicks so
yeah that's the way that you can share
and reuse the data power Curie
okay I we don't see other question come
in yet so okay I think that's all the
demos for today to quickly sum up we
went through the usage of power Curie
power map at the power of you by walking
through a cup of research scenarios
using the real weapon no study data hope
through these demos you get a stay pic
of the power of Excel power bi all the
tools that we demo today was billed
under the philosophy of self-service now
business intelligence and data
processing so which we believe that only
buying power individual users which is
you he said data analysis tools that you
right now which is Excel then you can do
more and normal and become more powerful
by yourself so that's all I have for
today here I'm going to pass it to you
Kenji Oh Excel and I think you know a
lot of people maybe have not seen you
know the full power of XL and what it
can do and so you know it's great to see
how you can quickly just pull in data
you know it'll bad data science and data
wrangling and that term you know implies
a lot of pain and I think you know
you've managed to show how Excel and can
make that really really easy and
particularly around you know mapping of
the data so I'd really like to thank
Jeff Jeff for that great presentation if
you want to find out more the best thing
is just to do it do a web search on
power bi and that comes right up and
you'll see a lot more in terms of not
just how to get hold of power bi but
also some other demos of it one of the
ones I love on there is actually some
open government data being pulled from
the UK open government portal pulled
into power bi
and then visualized and then also again
mapped to show actually some sort of
traffic incident data and it really
shows how we can use sort of new
features in Excel to really unlock some
of that some of that data so this
webinar is part of a series in our agile
for research program and the reason we
included the Excel power bi was you know
as Jeff showed how you can hook to data
in Azure and that could be created from
something like Hadoop it could be from
the marketplace could be from something
like storm or calf go for streaming
real-time GPS data and being able to
show that sorrel for research program
you know has many facets including our
awards training which is taking place
around the world and also coming online
these webinars some technical papers and
also research community engagements that
were at events and running our own own
events really the best way to keep in
touch is on linkedin we have a Windows
agile for research group and of course
on Twitter as well and the website
actual for research com you can go to so
with that is really like to thank
everybody for joining sickly thanking
Jeff you know for a great run through on
all the new features on excel and power
bi so thank you very much and I hope to
see all of you online or live at one of
our events or one of the community
events thank you everyone for joining us
