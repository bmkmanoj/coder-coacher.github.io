digital data and the reason we're doing
that is because DNA is very dense you
can put a lot of data in a small volume
to give you an idea the whole accessible
Internet is estimated to be about 700
exabytes and that would fit in the size
of a shoebox so last year we stored
hundreds of kilobytes of data in DNA and
fully recovered that this year we're
working with hundreds of megabytes of
data which means a thousand times more
DNA in building the world record we've
worked with twist bioscience to
synthesize 200 megabytes of data which
is well beyond anything that's been
synthesized today along with the
collaboration with University of
Washington we were demonstrated that
we're able to recover data built out of
1.5 billion nucleotides the growth that
we're experiencing in our global data
centers is truly astounding it's a
challenge not only in creating new
technologies to deal with it but in
actually inventing the new science to
form a foundation for the future DNA
storage gives us that new foundation and
this is exactly the kind of problem that
Microsoft Research was built to solve</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
