hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
okay time to get started thanks everyone
for joining the lab tutorial this
afternoon we have a very very special
speaker today I don't know if there's
anyone in the room who doesn't know
Andrew Herbert but ll quickly introduce
his his past life to Hugh so and
received his bachelor of science from
Leeds University in 1975 and a PhD from
Cambridge in 1978 and the topic was a
microprogrammed operating system kernel
nice generic title he then joined the
computer lab as as an assistant lecturer
in 1985 I'm jumping over a lot of years
here now he money submitted he founded a
company APM and which was driving a
project called a NSA the advanced
network system architecture and in 1996
he found it another company digiti and
then citrix bought both those companies
a couple of years later and andrew
became the director of advanced
technology there and then in 2001 we
were lucky enough for Andrew to join
microsoft research here as an assistant
director and he he became a managing
director in 2003 and and retired in 2011
so obviously he hasn't fully retired
because he is now on to another project
which is recreating the famous at second
Peter over to you Andrew Thank You
Torrance great pleasure to be here in
the building I helped raise the money
for what run away from doing the design
off so you can't blame me for the
internals if you don't like them so what
on do is tell you about the exact
replica project this is a computer built
at Cambridge University that
the project started in 1947 it ran its
first program on the 6th of May nineteen
forty nine so that's rather older than
me i noticed tony is in the room so he
can probably help me cover some of the
history of that period because i know he
was also active in the food industry
from the earliest days so our plan is to
build a working reconstruction of eight
sack the university of cambridge ease
first computer as it was in the day when
it ran its first program we've been
quite particular about the date because
the machine actually lasted for about
ten years and given that computing was
being invented at that time they changed
it almost month by month and the machine
at the end of its life was significantly
different to machine at the beginning am
and for our point of view the historical
significance is really the day in which
it started running its first programs
properly and on which some of the early
work was done so why would you want to
do that their number of reasons the the
project is sponsored by the computer
Conservation Society which is part of
the british computer society and the
national museum of computing which is at
Bletchley Park and certainly the mission
of the Bletchley Park Museum is to
celebrate british computer technology
and UK was very active in the early days
in included hardware in teams and
leadership position throughout the 1950s
certainly something you wouldn't know if
you look at modern computing and the the
computer Conservation Society
essentially shares that that a more
broadly importantly would like to
understand how is that was built and how
it worked the early pioneers were so
keen to get on to the next systems and
that when Ed sack was finished with they
were well into the design of its
replacement which was magically called
ed sack to there was actually Ned sack
one and a half and you can ask me about
that in the reception afterwards they
just scrapped the machine and as far as
we know ed sack is at the bottom of
Milton Road tip because they opened that
tip at that point and that's where
everything went very few pieces were
kept there are a few things in a couple
of museums but very very little
when maurice wilkes who was the man who
designed the machine was asked about its
history he asserted everything you
needed was in the University Library it
didn't quite work out like that and so
as a project we're essentially having to
reinvent ed sack from photographs from
partial documentation from memories of
people who are involved in the machine
none of the pioneers who actually
designed and built it have survived but
some of the users are still with us and
that helps and in doing that you need to
tap into expertise in designing
computers using these things called thur
monic valves there what predated
transistors you have a look at these
catch you also go around the back of the
room Mitch there you go you could pass
those around those re-air 55s I
absolutely did common these I won't
quite throw around but the dates on the
boxes are quite interesting they'll
survive that experience they remarkably
tough actually but knowing how to design
circuits using those kind of components
is a forgotten art and so we're having
to to learn that and the aim is to have
the machine as a educational resource of
the national at the Nationals in
computing in Bletchley Park and I was
certainly commend to all of you a trip
across to Bletchley Park indeed I
commend two trips because the better
depart museum with all the stuff about
the code breaking enigma machines and so
forth it is quite interesting and you
could easily spend a day just doing that
and then the National Museum of
computing is on the same site actually
in the world's first purpose-built
computer room h-block it was built for
the crosses code-breaking machines and
they have now quite a large collection
of working computers and the ethos
national team of computing is British
stuff in the main and keep it working or
make it work if it wasn't working and
indeed while looking out the red sac it
seems I've picked up through through
other computers that I have to look
after now as well because I use them as
a student so I'm also fixing various
transistor machines so why is ed sack
important why should we build a rep
cravats at rather than spyler machine
our claim is that it's the first
practical general-purpose electronic
stored program computer the fact I've
strung so many adjectives together is a
hint that lots of people claim to have
the first computer and indeed a lot was
going on in the late 1930s early 1940s
well it's actually impossible to kind of
put your finger on one thing and say
that was precisely the first the key
point about Ed sack was it was the first
machine that was built to be a computer
to provide a service to an organization
it was built in what was called the
mathematical laboratory of the
University of Cambridge that was an
organization set up just before the
Second World War to contain at the
outset mechanical calculating machines
to help scientists engineers
mathematicians in the university use
those machines to do their sons if you
go back to the the period before we had
computers in the early 1940s you either
have to do your mathematics on paper and
you were very reliant on books of tables
all you use various kinds of mechanical
hand calculators and there are various
larger scale machines and that could be
used to solve certain times of equations
you essentially built mechanical and
love models of things that was your only
a way of doing large-scale computation
so the university had a mathematical
laboratory to house those things will to
design and built the edge sack was am
hired as a demonstrator before the war
when he came back off his war service he
became the director and he decided
Cambridge needed a computer that people
could use to do their sons so it's the
first machine that was built not as an
experiment on electronics and that could
be used by others in its time it was the
biggest sleeping computing power that a
user community ever had we're used to
Moore's law and our computers yet double
in power every 18 months or sudden we've
had that until fairly recently if you
look at the speed that Ed sack could do
calculations compared to the previous
set of hand driven machines in the
mathematical laboratory it was 1500
times faster which is just a startling
increase in what could be done and
indeed it led to three nil world prizes
in fairly quick succession because it
let people work on
large amounts of data and do more
complex calculations than were possible
by hand the other aspect our veg sack
which given are inside Microsoft is
afford to bring up is actually it was
the first machine on which serious
thought was given to software help
people program it how you organize
programs how you make it easier for
people to write correct and well-formed
programs in fact in EDD sac you didn't
actually have to know the binary machine
code which is quite unusual you could
fit your programs are read in they are
in a symbolic textual notation very
simple our most other machines that
period you had to patch up wires or put
your programs in by waggling hankies up
and down right at that level the machine
itself and very quickly an extensive
library of subroutines provided that did
all the typical mathematical
calculations that people needed and so
the early users could solve their
problems by gluing together a set of
these subroutines a little bit of code
that passed the data through in the
right sequence and get the answers they
want exactly that's what these symbolic
programs yeah i'll talk about
programming hold on it's not functional
unfortunately but I can't give you
simple i can give you symbolic
addressing which which the pier was was
quite impressive so they contributed to
a number of advances Paul Kendra max
Peretz used it for analyzing x-ray
crystallography data and reducing that
data down to work out the structure of
molecules that's essentially a classic
data reduction task we have just found
in the body and library in Kendra's
papers all his head sack programs what
we haven't found is the data what we've
got we've got the programs we may be
able to synthesize the data by talking
to a modern x-ray crystallographer
Xavier analyzing it this way what did
the original data look like baby project
Martin royal the astronomer worked on
something called aperture synthesis in
radio astronomy if you've ever driven
out of Cambridge on the road that heads
out to all biggleswade and Sandy you've
probably seen those fields full of radio
telescopes
the cambridge approached a radio
astronomy started by royal was to have
lots of small telescopes spaced out in a
regular grid and then computationally
join their data together which simulates
having a huge radio radio dish if you
like and at the time that was being done
in the early 1950s the size of dish that
people could build was really quite
small in fact the UK it was dogger Bank
of Manchester which is a recycled piece
of German radar kit actually and then
one of the huts Liz I forget which i
think it was Andrew was also doing work
on modeling how information flows in the
human nervous system so it's a very
significant scientific breakthroughs
were enabled and each of those page of
those Nobel Prize winners in their
acceptance speech acknowledged Ed's sack
as if it was another scientist in the
team it's really rather nice so this
attack is mentioned as the player the
first book on programming was written
about the edge sack written by wilts his
student David wheeler and Stanley Gill
called the preparation of programs for
electronic digital computer and it
basically after an introduction waffling
on about what computers are died
straight into his how you program and
operate the EDD sack and like many
people who write books on programming
for the source of examples it includes
listings of the initial orders which
sams already called my in the game away
was essentially an assembler I the
compiler and the library subroutines and
that's kind of become the house style
for programming books you get something
general then you get specifics of the
language and then people give you a
listing of the compiler in its libraries
and after that you're suppose to be a
programmer the other aspect of Ed sack
which in terms of the wider use of
computing is very significant is the
world's first business computer was
called Leo it was built by a company
called Lyons who were a catering company
and they wanted to use computers to do
things like inventory control order
management and so forth and they
literally built a copy of aid sack fact
the story is really rather amusing
they'd heard about computers they had a
discussion at head office and said we
want a computer we better go to America
and they went to spoke to various
Americans who
you better go back home speak to this
guy Wilkes in Cambridge his further
ahead of us they put some money into the
project they signed an engineer to work
on Ed sack and a Zed sack was got
working they essentially copied
everything made a few refinements what
they wanted and produce the leo machine
very early on and that's very fortunate
because their record keeping is much
better than Cambridge is record keeping
and so leo is much better documented no
it's not ed sack we can read the Leo
documents and where they say we fix the
blah blah blah problem with the XYZ we
now know one we're designing EDD sack we
had to put a blah blah blah problem in
the XY is it and then we'll have a dead
sack rather than a Leo so this
definition thing is a little tricky what
actually counts as the first computer
and so I've pulled out a couple of
examples just to kind of illustrate some
of the points so many people the first
mechanical automatic computer is
Babbage's Difference Engine baybridge
was alive in the mid 1800s he designed
his difference engine he never actually
succeeded in building it he had trouble
getting it made he had trouble with
fundraising however Nathan Myhrvold
who's known to some of us he was
involved in and the early days of
microsoft research funded one funded one
to be built in the science museum built
two one for themselves one for him so
you go to the science museum and see it
or you can go to the Computer History
Museum in San Jose and see it and
there's a working difference engine made
to Babbage's drawings and it basically
would you cranked it by hand but all the
operator was doing was putting energy
into the system it printed out tables
and the calculation of the tables once
the thing was was program was all done
automatically so that's arguably an
automatic computer because the operator
isn't putting any intelligence as it
were into the system sounds like some
modern programmers in the late 1930s
there was a lot of work on
electromechanical computers one at
harvard university as torah reminder
because he made the introduction in
germany Conrad zuza was building
electromechanical machines using relays
the pond electromechanical machines is
they really work
it's slow by driving relays clicking
backwards and forwards am very very
large the components were quite big and
so they had their limitations and indeed
some of the wartime code-breaking
machines of Bletchley Park the bombs
that were used to break the Enigma codes
are essentially of that kind Metro
mechanical machinery lots of rotating
parts the large oil sump underneath in
terms of ektron its computers and his
way you start getting even more sort of
picky with the definitions we claim the
first digital machine was the Colossus
machines at Bletchley Park these were
used for essentially analyzing
teleprinter messages that the Germans
were sending by radio network to extract
the key the machine didn't break the
code it essentially did statistical
analysis so machine learning on the
messages to look for patterns that were
suggestive of what the keys might be and
that combined with other intelligence
could be used to break the key monk she
broke the key you could decode all the
messages from that day and so what's
going on there rolls of paper tape with
the messages on them and all the various
switches and buttons or where you
patched in your guesses as to what the
and the keys might be and also what you
thought the structure of the machine was
it's a fascinating story well worth
reading the chap who essentially if you
like broke the system built up never saw
the German coding machine did it all
entirely from the messages and started
off from just one message that got
transmitted twice with some minor
differences an operator sent it his mate
said didn't get that send it again his
mate says oh bugger you and abbreviated
a few things two messages with small
differences it's fantastic for starting
to get the key information out from that
he completely reverse engineered the
logic of the machine he never saw the
mechanics until after the war and
essentially what Colossus is doing is
running lots of parallel coding machines
against assumptions about what the keys
might be it takes it was only in the
1980s late nineteen eighty
is when an intel pentium processor could
do the classes computations faster than
classes itself could do them but it can
only do the key extraction you can't
program it to other things so it's not
really general-purpose the Americans had
a machine called ENIAC in 1944 this was
used for doing calculations for
ballistics where artillery shells might
fall and so forth that had to be wired
up by patching so it could do different
calculations but you spent a day wiring
it all up and then you ran calculations
through it so it didn't really have a
stored-program in the sense that we're
used to in the memory of the machine but
it certainly was digital electronics and
working very quickly the first proper
computer in the sense that we understand
it's day is the Manchester small-scale
experimental machine also known as baby
and indeed you can see a replica of this
in the museum of science and industry up
in Manchester a working replica the the
baby was a full function computer but
essentially it was built as a test bed
for a storage technology based on using
cathode ray tubes and the persistence of
the dots on the screen as a way of
storing ones and zeros and it was used a
little bit for calculation but not very
much and fairly quickly replaced with a
later machine and became a service
machine so baby beets ed sack to being
the first operational digital computer
of the kind where we require and that's
why that were practical appears in while
weaving aid sack is important and it's
nice that there's a baby up in
Manchester you can go and see the first
computer and then head sack is kind of
the first practical one very similar
technologies both machines built by
people with a background in wartime
radar and if you think about radar radar
is about transmitting and receiving
pulses counting them so you can work out
how long the delay is between a signal
being bounced back and then doing
calculations based on that to work out
the position of objects you're trying to
hunt down so people who'd worked on
radar were already sort of moving into
digital age away from the analog world
of radio communications and both the
team at Manchester and the team we were
to Ned sack had that radio background in
fact they knew
each other quite well and indeed you may
have noticed in the front of my talk I
knowledge someone called chris burton
chris is the chief designer from
electronics point of view he in fact did
the baby replica Rosie's as his former
project and the project manager and
mostly chief mechanical engineers when I
love all the heavy bits around so let's
talk about ed sack that's how ed sat
looked in 1949 it sat in a room in a
building that previously been the
Anatomy's school it weighed about two
and a half tons it consumed about 11
kilowatts electricity that's 11 bars
electric fire there was one small window
in the room so you could imagine it's a
bit hot and sticky in the summer people
claimed the floor Bulls would ooze
rather unpleasant substances I think
that's part of the the pot full story
all exposed lectronimo high tension
running around that mains all over the
place and all generally a nightmare so
wreck ting one of those in the
environment has to meet modern health
and safety standards as a museum exhibit
brings a few challenges so the machine
evolved by the mid-1950s it had got a
lot bigger and more complex and so one
of our challenges reading through
accounts looking at photographs is
working out when things happen and in
fact we have now got a fairly good
understanding of the history the user
interface was remarkably basic you read
programs in on paper tape five whole
tape of the claim that was used in
teleprinters for sending telegrams of
the time you can still get five whole
tape there are still a few countries
that use old-fashioned telegraph systems
so there's still people who make them so
that paper tape although the boxes
labeled Prime's 1949 which is lame of
the program the paper tape was
manufactured this morning in my home
there you go lost it so you read
programs in on paper tape through a
paper tape reader has this thing got a
little light pointer in it it must have
somewhere who knows well you can see the
box on the left with the paper tape
going through mechanical paper tape
reader output came out on a teleprinter
all that stuff was stolen from the post
office where they use these things head
for sending to
grams and so forth the thing on the
right is known as their three
oscilloscope units they connected
oscilloscope to the machines memory so
you can see the content of each word of
memory by the machine first round it had
512 words of memory why did you want
more of that it didn't run Windows I'm
sorry to put you off by the end of its
life it had a thousand and twenty four
so double upgrade in size through those
you could see the contents of memory and
the machine was actually so slow you
could see the lights twinkle and see
what's going on and we'll show you some
Latin a little bit so built by a chap
called Wilkes um who was a mathematics
graduate of Cambridge than John's
College did a physics PhD and working
with Rutherford in the Cavendish lab
mostly working on and the reflection of
radio waves through the ionosphere which
is why when the war came along he was
rapidly heave to go work on radio and
radar type technologies did all the work
on naval radar in fact when he came back
after the war the chemist who have been
the head of the mathematical barratry
got a poster Oxford so Wilkes went
straight from being the office boy to
being the director it was pretty good
and he heard of a conference on
computing that was being held at
Princeton University in 1947 there's a
British mathematics professor that this
hartree who's well connected what was
going on and hartree said you ought to
go to this wiltz went to it he arrived
late but got there in time to collect
the the papers and mud them up and if
you like one of the key papers present
at that conference was by john von
neumann draft reports on the edge vac
which was a proposal for building
machine that wasn't actually built tell
many years later but was the first
blueprint for a computer of the kind
that we would understand today with
logic unit memory and so forth Wilkes
was so taken with this he decided
Cambridge ought to have one so he
designed Cambridge is one on the journey
back on the I think it was the Queen
Mary if I'm correctly from his memoirs I
guess that was nice thing though so you
traveled with confidence on boats you
can you could write a paper in the time
it took to find your way back there's a
limit to what you can do in an
eight-hour flight back from Silicon
Valley designing a computer my
be a bit of a challenge and basically
what T design was a simplified but still
practical version of the edge vac he
accept all the architectural principles
and designed it using and British
approach electronics he assembled a team
to build it had a chief engineer Bill
Rennick who debt did actually most of
the detailed design work will its kind
of did the architecture and the project
management most of the engineers were
electrical instrument makers hiding from
local companies there was a company
called PI who made TV sets in Cambridge
and so people came from there most the
metalwork was made by a company called
morally and juke used to be a radio
repair shop in Cambridge and when I
first came as a student there kind of
yet fallen away from being a big lecture
on its company it's a little shot down
sidney sussex street they're long gone
now i think it's a handbag shop these
days this is a very posed photograph but
it's the team working on it and
importantly they had a number of young
research students and david wheeler john
bennett who contributed greatly to the
design of machine and so the usual way
it's the postdocs who do the real work
and put the smart ideas into the system
um he doesn't essentially out of
departmental funds volks refused to be
drawn what it would cost because he
never kept accounts you didn't in those
days in those days if you're if you're a
univ if you ran a university outfit as
Wilkes did at the start of the year the
university gave you a check which is
your budget for the year and you put it
in your personal bank account and you
hired your people personally and you ran
your department and Nick's year they
sent you another one that so did all the
modern ideas about transparency and
central funding and accounts departments
and lawyers all those things that make
your life here so easy oh I do not miss
legal and finance and all that he didn't
have to worry about that so essentially
he has not eat we would never be drawn
on what it costs it's very hard to
estimate he got a lot of his electronics
military surplus and there was a lot
sloshing around the end of the wall but
he certainly spent money because he had
things fabric aids yet to employ people
and so forth but we don't know so the
edge SAT architecture a very familiar
shape to anyone who uses a modern
computer
there's a store there's a control
component which fetches instructions and
execute them there's an arithmetic unit
that essentially contains an adder and
shifter and a single accumulator the
accumulative basic machine word length
short words are 17 bits long words of 35
bits the accumulator was 74 bits so if
you did a multiplication of two long
words it kept all the bits and the
instruction set was carefully arranged
you could use the accumulator to keep
running totals of things so actually it
could work to very high precision no
floating point it's all fixed point
arithmetic floating point was done later
on with software libraries and so you
scaled your problem so you could always
work with essentially fixed point
fractions and keep as many digits in the
fractions you can not something modern
programmers know how to do but those who
learnt our programming the late 1960s
was still being trained in that because
there was still lots of fixed point
machines around at that time so the
block diagram is very familiar the most
important part of that block diagram
from our point of view is the fact that
the store is indeed a separate component
store technology in the 1940s was a
nightmare they didn't have a very good
way of storing data there were three
choices you could use some sort of
rotating electromechanical device that
was slow not very large capacity
rotating drums with a standard way of
doing it Manchester had a system said
based on writing too and persistent
phosphors and then reading it back that
was a little bit flaky that truth be
told and scaling it up to large systems
was quite difficult those were called
Williams tubes after Frank Williams who
invented them and the other alternative
but is what the radar community used
were long tubes full of mercury that you
sent acoustic pulse is down and the
speed of sound through mercury is quite
slow so basically you could stuff lot of
pulses in a five-foot tube and you put
the stuff in you'd read it out of the
far end and cycle it back round again
you can get about 600 bits in a
five-foot tube and so you could build
your memory by having banks of these
tubes and recirculating the data through
the frustration with that is it's a
serial medium and if the word you want
to read is the one that's just gone into
the tube you've got a long wait till it
comes out again and so though the
interface there shows a single line
there's actually quite a complication
where the computer decides it wants to
read word n and it has to wait until the
store says yes were dead is emerging now
you can have it and so the store and the
computer independently clot and for the
hardware guys they'd have phase locked
loops in those days you just had to
design your circuit so they kind of
would follow each other if you open up
the structure and slide again it looks
and whether the data can flow again it
looks very modern um there's an input
bus so that you can gate information
coming out of the store into the
arithmetic unit you can take stuff out
arithmetic unit you can get it into the
storage units or you can put it in
something called the the transfer unit
and so that you can essentially cycle it
background and use it again multiplies
for example we're done by repeated
additions so you keep sending data into
the transfer unit rather than storing it
for each step you could take data from
the input channel the paper tape reader
you could send output to the output
channel leave the teleprinter so nice
and straight forwards and they the
storage there was these mercury tanks
all the registers inside the machine
were also mercury tanks the accumulator
they were called short tanks and indeed
the current instruction was held in a
tank called the older tank which
captured the the bits of the current
instruction to be obeyed which they
called orders in those days and the
program counter which they call the
sequence control register our sequence
control tank that was also in mercury
tank so the whole machine operates in
the serial manner when it wanted to add
two numbers in the arithmetic unit it
wasn't like a modern power ladder where
you have two words you go caching and
out comes the the result you would do it
digit by digit so you'd cycle the data
out of the accumulator through the half
adder and then route it either to the
transfer unit or the store and add it
digit by digit so if you can imagine
with the arithmetic being done Cyril II
and with having to wait for the memory
did a magnificent six hundred or so
instructions a second so not very fast
compared to our modern machines the
central clock ran at half a megahertz
which was again a bit conservative but
Wilkes his view was at that speed he
knew he could make a machine that work
robustly and he wouldn't have trouble
with glitches and so forth so what does
this machine look like for programmers
essentially there are two registers in
the machine the accumulator which is the
working register and the multiply
register should have called it the
multiple can that this area is a
multiplayer the model there are three
registers the accumulator the multiplied
multiplicand the multiplicand of the
multiplier are used to hold two numbers
when you multiply them the result gets
added to the running total in the
accumulator so you put the two knobs on
to multiply into the multiplicand
multiplier do a multiply instruction
result gets added the accumulator so a
bit like a modern sort of pocket
calculator works the memory physically
is 18 bits long but only 17 bits are
used that's because of timing challenges
so the arithmetic is 17 bit there are
spare bits sculling around never got
used for anything thousand 24 words as
the maximum capacity architectural II
the machine got that by the end of its
life you can read consecutive words that
even addresses i naught 24 as a long
word and it reads a 35 bits that's
because you can pick up the seventeenth
bit in the second word because the
timing works out and so you get a bit
more precision if you use a long word
then if you store the thing yourself as
two short words and this is kind of evil
thing that goes on but the accumulator
71 bits in total paper tape input
teleprinter output and the initial
instructions digital orders I when you
push the on button that essentially is a
very simple assembler the instruction
set is very very simple each instruction
consisted of a function which is
represented by a letter and in the
teleprinter code used to punch the paper
tapes
the bit pattern in memory would be the
bit pattern corresponding to a letter a
on the teleprinter tape so if you can
hold the tape up to the light and read
the letters off which any ads that user
can do and I'm almost there now you can
just read a program off the paper tape
and recite it so and the mnemonics would
be fairly helpful a4 add add the
contents of memory location n into the
accumulator s4 subtract H Lowell load
the modify the multiplier register from
store v multiplied the multiply register
times of store location adding the
result into the accumulator and was the
takeaway it's like M plus n minus on a
pocket calculator T was the store
instruction and usefully cleared the
accumulator so that happened in two
steps there's also a version called you
which left the number in the accumulator
see for collating I just mashing bit
patterns hardly ever used and it's most
of its acts applications where
calculations doing numerical stuff using
computers to do the logical stuff and so
forth wasn't really very important in
those days shift shift was a tricky
instruction to use because rather than
using the address as the number of
places to shift it shifted the number of
places that match the first bit that
appeared in the instruction looking from
the least significant dent so if I wrote
our one that shifted one place to the
right if I wrote our two it shifted to
places to go three places had to be our
four and if you miss the address off the
dress is zero it's actually would ever
digit the last digit of our corresponds
to and I think that was a shipwright 13
but I can't quite remember it's that
program was just kind of knew this stuff
and live with it left shift two jumps
jump if less than zero jump if grades
than or equal zero very frustrating not
to have an unconditional jump at any
point you were looping you had to know
what the sign was of the quantity in the
accumulator so the whole batch of
programming tactics so you kind of knew
what the sign of things were totally
there and though jump is there that
would be quite
42 so no thought really of logical
operations of you one being true and not
being false or whatever input from paper
tape to memory output from memory to the
teleprinter forget the eff instruction
it was abandoned and no op which is
really quite useful if you trying to
make programs work patching an X
instruction ever sudden you want to get
rid of has this aptly the effect you
want it doesn't i think just cycles a
machine the y instruction did rounding
and zed has the whandall specification
stop the machine and ring the bill
practice boobs are a cowbell with a bong
though there's no recording of it so
there you go so very simple order code
there was shit the transistor machine
that I have at home called Nellie at 903
actually has slightly fewer instructions
and EDD sacks so ed sacks instruction
sets or something like me feels like a a
very rich comprehensive set so how did
you program it you used built in osoyoos
subroutines provided as a library via
something called a wheeler jump what you
did in the wheeler jump was you loaded
the accumulator with the address you
were at so you had to know where you
were your program and fortunately all
dresses were positive so you could then
follow that by a jump if positive to the
address of the subroutine the subroutine
would then do another edition of its own
address to the number you've passed in
drop that in the last instruction of the
subroutine in the memory so and within
that little extra bit pattern so that
when you got the end of the subroutine
provide the accumulator was still 0 you
jump back to the structure nath one you
came to so there wasn't a jump
subroutine instruction you basically
constructed the jumps you need it as you
went through people weren't upset about
self-modifying programs in those days
indeed if you look at earlier sack
programs there's endless salt
modification going on to scrunch things
down sorry do recursion there are some
recursive programs but then you have to
kind of manage your own stack yourself
its various you can read Wilkes wheeler
and Gil online and there's an online
copy of it and it's actually a good
amusing bedtime read particularly some
of the library routines coded by wheeler
who is a very devious programmer press
things down to a tiny tiny amount of
code so um the instructions were written
and said a textual notation so a 55 f
stands for the add instruction on memory
load using memory location 55 and if
means load from 55 as a short integer or
a short fraction addy means loader a
double word there was nothing in that
assembler for writing beta so you had to
encode data as instructions but
fortunately the letter P is 0 in the
teleprinter code and so decimal 10 is p
5f because p is 0 so you get about it
five is five in the address field and if
you remember from the previous slide the
address field starts at the second bit
and F is fixed which corresponds to 0 so
what you've actually done is put 10 in
the in the the word in the memory and
again as Ned sack program you carried in
your head a lot of those in pseudo
instructions that correspond it use for
constants the other option is you could
read them in as numbers again because
memory was small some of the larger
programs we've encountered actually come
as a suite of three subprograms the
first one reads the data in and puts it
in memory then you then run the second
program that does a computation over
that data and leaves the results
somewhere else in memory and then the
third step prints them out in some
pretty layout because there wasn't
enough store to store the numbers to
work on and three large pieces of
software and people with all kinds of
coming things and workarounds like that
there was a number reading routine as
past nishal orders that were read
numbers in for you while it's reading in
your program and then disappear so you
could use its locations as working
storage afterwards for example lots of
things a really useful peep piece of the
initial orders was you could write and
parameterised addresses which in the
modernist
assembler you call relative addresses if
I wrote g55 theta that was a theta on
the keyboard and several other Greek
letters what that meant is location 55
relative to the start of the current
subroutine I'm loading and there were
control combinations they start of a
subroutine so i could write subroutines
whose addressing was relative and that
was the trick to making programming
convenient because as a user i'd punch
my program and indeed i could use
relative addresses too i would then join
my program take all the library tapes
into one big tape feed it into the
Machine and the initial orders would
just lay it out in memory sequentially
and do all the fixing up for me because
it knew what feet event and indeed you
could use other letters in fancy ways
there were various control combinations
that equivalence the come directives you
find in a modern assembler so if you
type pkt and in some number like 55 k
that would say lo the next instruction
location 55 and e m where m is some
address or e 55 k PF says end of tape
clear the accumulator jump to em if you
think you're a good machine level
programmer then go and read the edge sac
national orders and explain how emk PF
works and i guarantee it will keep you
quiet most of the evening finding your
output your way around wheelers code to
see how that works initial orders patch
themselves as they run and most of these
directives once you've unpick them you
realize they're patching certain things
so when you fall over them the right
thing happens at the right time is
wonderfully obscure this is how it
looked to a user you'd write your
programs on a sac programming sheet
handwritten and you write comments in
the comments column there are in fact
quite strong conventions about how you
might write a program and how you might
indicate where there are loops and jumps
how you might distinguish data from
instructions and so forth of which this
is not a very good example the chap who
wrote it is one Henry whale and using
them PhD student this turn up at his
archives and it's a bit little bit
scrappy from that point of view and the
coding sheets had numbers down the side
so you could count off which location
your program each instruction appeared
and then you gave it to a typist who
typed it on the teleprinter code and the
paper tape there what you can see is it
is just the punching of the instructions
no spaces no new lines it's just a
string of letters and numbers and in
fact the teleprinter code the letter the
numbers are all overlapped on top of
each other so its context sensitive you
have to know the first thing is to be
interpreted as a letter rather than a
digit so it's all very very primitive
and you feed that into the machine so
the way it was done obviously it's a
very error-prone program to get from
your handwritten program to the tape you
used the perforator like this and this
is Lady operator she's reading someone's
program from the programming sheet I'm
punching it onto a paper tape she has no
visible record of what she's typing
she's just punching tape so she's touch
typing with no screen anything like that
then she would puncture the game as she
punched it the second time she put the
first tape in this paper tape reader and
the two would clock through together and
if there's a disagreement the machine
would stop she would have a think look
at the paper tape decide whether she had
typed the second one wrong or type the
first one wrong flickr switch to decide
which way the thing was be corrected and
that way you get a correct tape all done
completely blind so again you had to
have this skill of reading the paper
tapes and your program output this is
the output from wales program came out
on the teleprinter and you didn't waste
machine time or memory printing out
headings or whatever you just printed
out numbers and even bother with decimal
points you didn't bother scaling things
could you doll that by hand afterwards
that's original output original paper
tape so how we building a replica well I
said we don't have a complete blueprint
and we want to be consistent with the
photographs and the records we want to
use period components and circuits if
you look at those cardboard boxes you
spotted they were those those valves are
putting those boxes in 1943 some of the
box we've opened have been wrapped in
newspaper in its period newspapers they
make an interesting read as part of it
where we can't use period components
because they're not obtainable we'll use
modern components and camouflage them
not
do very much of that we absolutely are
sticking to the edge sac architectural
principles so want to be close the
original as we can so we have some
technical description and diagrams from
the computer laboratory we have original
photographs their quality published
papers from the early days we have
recollections the pioneers so we need to
decide which edge sack we're building we
have a floor plan this is an area and
that measures about 15 feet square so
it's physically quite large three rows
of racks we know broadly watch each set
of racks does and we've got two copies
of oops sorry wrong presentation we have
another diagram for the report which
helpfully fills in what the three blank
rows sets of racks doing the back row
the things label batteries are large
wooden coffins as they were described
containing the murky damn tanks for the
memory so the physical desires actually
fairly straight forwards there are a
couple of surviving ed sanchez's these
objects all identical which is very
frustrating if there are different parts
the machine that would have given us
more data 11 in the computer lab and
others in museums so we took that to
bits and measured it in total we've got
12 racks to fill and it's actually near
140 Chace's which in those days they
call panels I was terrible nightmare
given these talks do i use the original
words modern words for these things so
we measured at the original we use
computer aided design and to do that for
us and we've had a local company in
cambridge called heavy engineering who
have done all the metal bashing for us
one of the things about Ed's sack is ed
sack was used to design its successor ed
sack to for doing simulation and
calculations and so forth we're using
modern computers did a lot of design and
simulation for ed sack and certainly
that's making our life much easier than
it was the original pioneers who didn't
have a computer to help them they did it
all by old-fashioned pencil and paper
methods and so forth when I wrote this
slide we didn't know how many types of
Chace's there were or where they were in
the racks
we're now in a much happier place not
got a picture of that also you need to
know how the machine works in detail
we've got diagrams from people's
notebooks there's evidence of lots of
change in commissioning there are whole
areas for which there's just no
information so we built ourselves a
logical simulation of EDD sac using a
program called LC it's at logic
simulator so the kind of logic diagrams
we get will be like this it breaks down
the pictures of the the machine into
some of the individual units like
particular tanks I mercury ley lines
various functional units like an
accumulator and accumulator shifting
unit sometimes that map's the individual
chassis sometimes it maps the two or
three sh asses there's no information
about that but it broadly shows you how
the control signals are flowing around
the machine and other diagrams tell you
what the timing is P eye on those
diagrams is pulse intervals and that
tells you what the delay is permitted
between the signal leaving one part of
the machine and getting to another so
some of those diagrams are really quite
helpful from that and information about
the the overall timing of the central
clock that drives a serial system we
were able to build ourselves a logic
simulation in what slides were out of
order and what our logic simulator gives
us is these kind of pictures that show
us how the machine is clocked what
signals are turning up where at what
time in the machine this simulator can
run programs so we're fairly confident
its head sack obviously it's a simulator
on the real machine pulses don't have
nice clean edges like that there are all
kinds of delays and echoes and so forth
what we've done in the last month or so
is we have a range that our simulator
can emit a description of edge sac in
something called very log which is a
hardware description language and for
the kind of fpga kits that companies
like xilinx provide they give you
translators that read in very log and
wire up the FG PA to electronic system
that has the same behavior and so we've
been able to program
sister based system to run like head
sack and that runs at about edge snack
speed which is really rather nice so we
have an assorted sack in the matchbox
the idea of that of course is then we
can plug into vidual bits of edge sack
into that FPGA is a test harness and use
it to exercise other parts of the
machine so I said everything in its sack
is serial the attraction of that is it
reduces number of components you've only
got to have a 1-bit adder for the
accumulator because you're only adding
one bit at a time all the stories in
these mercury tanks so it seems very
attractive for reducing the size of
machine that makes it less expensive and
also more reliable because there are
fewer things to go wrong but every now
and then you do have to go parallel like
when you want to address memory you
actually need the address and you want
to present a number to the store and say
when this location comes round please
match and give me the answer and so one
of the more complex bits the machine and
we're in the middle of am picking it at
the moment we have a working prototype
just about is called the coincidence
system it is well named it's both the
tech coincidence to what the computer
wants and what the memory can offer and
if it does work it is an amazing
coincidence and essentially it's doing
serial to parallel conversion through
decoders and actually it turns out to be
a big chunk of the machine about a
quarter of the machine is doing that
serial to parallel decoding just to
access the memory so not going parallel
through thematic unit it's not obviously
it was such a big saving and certainly
add sacked to and indeed most other
machines after it sat they're not all
one that's only worked on the elite 8 03
was Cyril most other machines went
parallel the saving wasn't really as
high as people thought it might be the
logic simulation electronics and that's
what we have voted information it's all
what's known as AC coupled circuits any
of you who work with modern electronics
you live in the world of DC coupled
circuits and naught is a reference
voltage one is a reference voltage
everything is smoothed out with
capacitors all your pulses nice and
square if you're working in Ed's sack
you're always thinking about waveforms
and adding and subtracting waveforms you
have to think more like a radar engineer
or
radio TV engineer and how the wave falls
behave logic is expensive and an gate
uses three of those valves in cans that
are flying around the room somewhere the
problem in Brendan's pocket by now they
are and three diodes little smaller
valves which is about one third of a
chassis for one gate so you try and
avoid using logic and where you do
things by using amplifiers and just
straight forward and circuits using
resistors and capacitors and so forth
you do so yeah the world you live in is
one where transistors are free and
they're more do you know what to do with
this is a world where resistors the
capacitors are free and transistors are
very very expensive because they're
called valles the components however are
very familiar to a modern hardware
designer flip flops inverters pulse
amplifiers and so forth typical circuit
diagram we get there's an obvious
problem with this circuit diagram there
are no component values on it it's
called a flip-flop we expect a flip-flop
to be something you pulsed ahold of one
or you pulsed ahold of zero it turns out
in a serial machine all your damn honest
tables they hold a value for a period I
as long as they're needed before that as
it were the circus has moved on and this
is actually a settable monostable and
that's what flip-flop mint in 1949 so
how do we map the logic to circuit such
asses well we can try and use the
photographs and indeed if you start
blowing up some of the photographs there
are helpful labels that appear on some
of the chassis 'he's so you get very
excited and you keep blowing them up
until you get to about there and then
you're at the grain size of the film
that would actually glass plates got the
grain size of the silver nitrate
something you can reap and at all i can
see that says coincidence unit 03
straight one but that's good i sort of
do that's what it's supposed to say
anyway where are we with the machine
these next three pictures show the racks
anything in green we've built anything
in yellow we know how to build and
someone's working on it anything in red
we've got someone designing but we
haven't built it yet anything in white
we know what it is but we haven't even
start to think about it so you can see
from these pictures we're making
actually quite good progress big chunk
the machine designed
those are what the memory look like
we're not going to use mercury delay
lines opposite risky and costly it's
about 160,000 pounds worth of mercury
which is a challenge the health and
safety things aren't really a major
issue the only issue when you're
building them because in their sealed
units they don't worry about that the
precision engineering of those tubes is
quite demanding so what we're going to
use is a later technology and called
nickel delay lines essentially the same
physical principles but using stretch
wires and the short-term we're using
semiconductors to do that so that's what
an original EDS a track look like these
are the modern reconstruction's and i
bought one here you can come and look at
I've got a team about 20 volunteers
building them for us we can still get
the valve holders we can still get the
valves and the biggest limitation is
modern resistors and capacitors are far
smaller than period ones you can get
period ones but they tend to have
drifted off value and we want our
machine to run for at least 20 years
before someone has to rebuild our
replica and so we talk decision to use
modern components what we do is buy high
wattage ones because they are bigger and
fatter so they're about half the size of
the period ones and that lots of they
look reasonably okay so that most of
parts we can get the chassis is made by
a commercial firm here in Cambridge
their workshop scotts and slightly more
substantially equipment in it than mine
those mine is certainly gaining bits and
pieces so there's me in one of our racks
in my workshop lots of things have to be
handmade there are all kinds of coils
and so forth and the along the back of
machine there are no plugs and sockets
technologies for interfacing things in
those days you use strips of paxillin
with little metal tags on them and
soldered everything together those are
all lovingly handmade by me and my
workshop but a machine to do that so we
think it's Anna Costas about a quarter
million pounds to do and we've raised
three culture of that funding so we're
in quite good shape actually the first
racks will be erected the museum in
spring next year and we're fairly
comfortable having a working machine by
about the end of 2015 if you want to
find out any more about the project
there's a website WWE dcor g and there's
lots of videos on there
of us making bits and pieces there's a
video that dates back to the 1950s of
how to program a News eight nice period
piece you can download an edge sack
simulate it's worth playing with you can
read Wilkes Keeler will it up Wilkes
wheeler and Gil of the network if you
want to build anything you can come and
play and if I do one more thing I'll
finish up and take questions and we're
going to drink some wine afterwards I'm
going ba glide if I go into windows
which I'm told is an operating system
here's a bit of edge sac this is the
edge sac simulator what you have on the
left is an edge sac program in that just
the sequence of characters notation this
is a program that prints out a table of
primes what you have on here is an image
of one of the oscilloscope tubes and the
buttons on the front of machine user
interface was very straight forwards you
could clear the memory this first days
you did that by a wet finger or the
chassis and just touch the earth line
they later refine that but it will push
button in you would push the start
button the machine would read in your
paper tape and you could see the memory
filling up if I go to other tanks there
you go so that's about the speed at
which nishal orders are loading the
program and then the program would run
if I come back to the bottom tank where
the variables are you can see doing some
this is calculating primes and as you
can see it gets slow and slugs it's
doing it by repeated divisions rather
and rather than the sieve method but
this was one of the key demonstrations
that ran at a conference in November 49
to demonstrate what was different about
a computer than a calculator because to
calculate primes the machine has to take
decisions whereas printing out tables or
squares and so forth which was what the
first program did an automatic
calculator could do that blown your
computer can do primes and again
programmers in those days there was no
test to terminate this program when you
got bored with the answers you push the
stop button if you don't push the stop
button machine keeps grinding on and the
words over you get into your overflow
and all kinds of evil things happen but
you didn't waste memory doing things
like checking for the end you just push
the stop button when you've got the
answers you wanted it was a much simpler
age so I've overrun
always do but I'll happy stop take a few
questions and then we can probably
adjourn outside thank you very much
telephone dial that's a 1940 1951
question so strictly speaking I can't
answer and what it did was um simulate
pressing the reset button which
essentially restarts the execution cycle
with the digit dial last digit dialed on
the telephone dial load edits are added
to the accumulator so if you carefully
clear the accumulator and did a stop the
user could type a number in the program
will resume with that number in the
accumulator and so it was used for
fairly simple input the idea to the
accumulator so you had to decide what to
do with the data but a number of
debugging routines that for example
would ask you what region of memory you
want to print it out and you dull a
memory location you want to print it out
on that dial and there's their various
if you've looked this simulator the
Warwick's site and their various games
like noughts and crosses that use it
there wasn't it's at notes and crosses
game we've lost the original but
someone's recreated it there's quite a
nice Mandelbrot demonstrator that uses
the oscilloscope and you dull which
quadrant want to dive in through and who
needs mice and all these things paper
tape a telephone dial the world is your
oyster house the closer you um so nickel
delay lines were widely used in machines
from the early 50s onwards and
essentially nickel delay line was the
first robust memory technology and
course dolls came I guess late fifties
early sixties Tony early six days yeah
I'm a child of the course door age
certainly a number of the large
commercial machines of the 50s like the
franti Pegasus used nickel delay lines
very robust technology lots of
information around about it but the
techniques for manufacturing have been
lost so I have a colleague Peter
lillington used to be a fresco cuida
science at Kent now also retired who
literally has gone back to the physics
and rediscover the mentality of how you
stretch it to get the right properties
how you call it so there's not a huge
long length of wire how you support the
coils how suppress the echoes and so
forth and hitting our little sub project
or his own reinventing the manufacturer
nickel delay lines he's built a working
short delay line long delay line has
proved a little bit Paul matical but
we're always join two short ones
together I guess the valves a quick
question the valves were designed
obviously regions amplifiers I guess the
number sort of hijacked and used as
switches I mean does that mean that I
mean could the check the design of the
valve have been changed to be more
optimized to be a switch that's got a
transistor well good for example can you
run them at sort of half power or
something until they don't know it's
actually reverses on that's because
you're use them digitally you want them
operating outside of their linear range
where they're good amplifiers so you're
pushing them to either extreme so in the
same way that CMOS is a night makes it
leaks current when it's switch when it's
when its operating there's a huge amount
of earth leakage and so designing the
power control system for this to meet
modern healthy social standards is quite
entertaining it's going to be a large
cupboard full of quite complex
electronics well it's the tool mean time
between failure then because the more
valence you have and they got about 35
working out computing working hours out
of the machine a week the mode was it
was looked after by engineers during
office hours who kept it going after
hours privileged users could use it if
it broke you walk away an issue were
Joyce black clutter who became mrs.
wheeler which case David a hang around
and fix it for you but and that their
biggest problem was because every
chassis was different they couldn't have
lots of spares of anything broke got to
take it off and and fix it another trial
traction of a parallel machine I EDD
sacked to particular if you build it as
bit slices if you have lots of Commons
assets and that again was a lesson they
learned but the and wartime radar
experience approve that quite calm
flex valve electronics were a lot more
reliable than people thought there's
another myth that you need to be very
gentle with the power on sequence for
vowels the experience from baby and
Manchester is people are far too fretful
about that we will sequence our power on
but we're not going to wait two hours
for the valves to warm up 30 seconds
seems to do it but this is I literally
pulled it out of a rack in my workshop
and it's been running for weeks this is
digit pulse generator admit it goes blip
on the oscilloscope once every 2
milliseconds right that's been doing it
for several weeks now so it seems to be
fine it might salt can I take it back
home cuz it's been for trip but there
you go questions actor you say some
booty was invented with many other
programming advances over the history of
EDS ACK you know we would not all in sac
yourself no I the next big advance with
index registers or B registers and I
think Manchester got there first with
that i'm pretty sure with their machine
head sac did get an in-depth original
end of its life no I once the system by
essentially by 1951 and the system was
just heavily used billed as a service
machine other innovations the whole
debugging system but again that's ready
by 51 there's a lot of post-mortem
software for dumping out memory there
was and what we would call profiling
these days that prints out an
instruction trace as your program
executed and there was new miracle trace
that printed out the content of the
accumulator essentially every time it
was stalled and so with those you could
debug programs there's a very good
account by Wilkes one of his early
programs they kind of wrote still use he
used that sack refused tables that he
publishing various journals of physics
and so forth an early one was something
called the area integral is very
straightforward integral and he gives an
account of you're walking away from the
machine for the other tenth time when
his program hasn't run realizing that
programming wasn't as easy as he thought
it was going to be and so it's very
create has a big surprise that you don't
just write correct programs from the
get-go and you need a lot of support to
do that and debugging at the level of
single stepping and watching on the
scopes you could do that but it was very
inefficient and the queue of users way
the machine got pretty angry with you so
speeding up that process and they so for
these profiling systems they had
interpreters essentially threaded
interpretation as part of the way that
word so some that some of those kind of
ideas were there from the earliest days
and they did interpretive floating point
later on and in some of the subroutine
stuff there's some interesting things
about parameterization own variables
were essentially there in modern words
but again in assembly code well these
things aren't quite as meaningful as
they are in world of high level
languages there was never a high level
language for it's like it never had a
programming language beyond the simple
assembler didn't need it thank you i
think use of time will also draw the the
formal proceedings to a close them sure
Andre will be happy to answer questions
over a glass of wine and hopefully one
day you'll come back and give us the
other tutorial on restoring old
aeroplanes which i think is what you're
doing your spare time absolutely
meanwhile let's thank Andrew for a
fascinating to live designing weakness
