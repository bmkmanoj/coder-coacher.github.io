extends mobile devices interactive
capabilities by detecting rich gestures
performed around the device direct touch
interaction is intuitive and popular
however small touchscreens and widgets
limit the richness of user interaction
with fingers often including large parts
of the displayed content our goal is to
compliment the touchscreen within our
gestures to enrich the interaction
vocabulary for example to support mode
switches application and task management
we propose a random force base gesture
recognition algorithm that runs in real
time on mobile devices we have developed
a stage classification pipeline greatly
reducing the memory footprint of the
classifiers and making random force base
classification feasible on mobile
devices the technique uses only the
devices built in RGB cameras and
robustly recognizes a wide range of
gestures the first classifier coarsely
estimates the depth of the hand and
rejects frames where the hand is either
too close or too far from the device
this greatly reduces the variation in
depth that the downstream pipeline has
to deal with the shape classification
forest classifies the images into six
gesture classes in addition one no
gesture class and a noise class are
added to deal with hand segmentation
false positives and reject non gesture
motion in front of the camera finally a
hand part classifier robustly detects
fingertips and the wrist for variety of
hand poses these can be used to
implement more fine-grained localized
in air gestures computing the ratio
between the first and second area mode
of the probability distribution allows
for the recognition and tracking of
continuous gestures for instance this
can be mapped to the size of a
magnification lens our algorithm lends
itself to a variety of novel mobile
interactions that greatly extend the
portable devices input space and
capabilities our aim is to enable low
effort gestures that compliment touch
and allow users to quickly and more
naturally perform complex tasks our
algorithm can enable division of labour
by manual input here a person reads a
book on his portable device while
performing the familiar finger scroll
gestures to navigate the text the user
can adjust the level of the document
zoom using a splayed hand gesture in
another scenario we show by manual mode
switching here a person is viewing a map
on his device while patting the map
through touch the user can adjust the
zoom level using a simple splayed hand
gesture similarly the user can
quickly switch the map type by simply
performing a gun gesture by using the
pinch gesture the user can also drag the
map around a fisheye lens is invoked
using the in air pinch gesture to
magnify parts of the map gestures around
the device can be used to streamline
interaction with more complex user
interfaces that require explicit mode
changes such as a drawing application
here the user draws with touch input
while a gesture invokes a brush selector
the menu selection can then be performed
using touch without requiring the users
finger to travel to a menu analogously
the closed pinch can invoke an in-place
color picker finally the user may drag
an object across the canvas and use
another gesture to place copies of the
object onto the canvas one final
scenario is mobile gaming here we show
our gesture recognition pipeline
interfaced with a scroll and shoot game
touch input is used to control the
character's motion whereas an in air
gesture is used to fire the gun
our implementation is efficient enough
to run in real time on very resource
constrained platforms this makes our
technique applicable in a wide range of
mobile computing scenarios including
tablets and smart watch devices in our
full paper we give phone implementation
details and pseudocode and we report on
evaluations performed on low-level
aspects of the algorithm as well as on
its integration with typical
applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
