to microsoft research for organizing
this very inspiring meeting for and for
challenging us to think about the future
of computing computing in the 21st
century now today i would like to talk
to you about how computation is
progressively becoming much more
interactive with a physical world and
also with people the next generation of
computers will be able to sense the
world they will be able to act
autonomously in the world and they will
be able to interact with people in other
words they will be robots and i know
this because the previous speaker told
me so in fact John hopcroft was my
teacher at my advisor when I was a
graduate student John thank you for
giving me the opportunity to work on
robots with you at Cornell and for
opening this great world of excitement
to me so we have come a long way since
the Czech playwright karel capek
introduced the word robot to denote hard
and repetitive labor now some of us fear
the idea of machines doing our work and
others are widely excited by it but our
dream to create machines in our own
image that are smart and obedient goes
back to antiquity the quest for smart
machines has progressed from the
technological marvels of antiquity to
the 17th century automata to science
fiction robots and to today's reality
and they are becoming increasingly more
lifelike robots today are impacting all
aspects of life from small and near for
example in medicine too large and far
for example in exploring the universe
from manufacturing to homes
robots contribute to science and
knowledge and make the world a better
place now in order to build robots we
really need a broad spectrum of
technologies we need sensing we need the
ability to interact with the world we
need decision-making we need human
machine interaction and we need the
supporting software and hardware to do
so but robots are becoming ever more
autonomous and capable and imagine in
this reality of robots I would like to
give you I would like to start with one
example so imagine all the tasks in your
home that you would like to automate
maybe you would like to have a robot to
fold your laundry maybe you want to have
a robot organize your rooms maybe you
would like to have a robot cook your
meals in the kitchen well it turns out
in a kitchen we already have some small
robots so we have a robot that washes
our dishes we have a robot that cooks
things with science but there's still a
gap between these existing robots and
and something we would like to call the
Iron Chef robot so what is that what is
the problem well if you think about all
the things you've got in our kitchen we
have cabinets that are challenging to
open inside the cabinets are a huge
variety of packages and things we have
dials in on our stove for for cooking
and we have objects in the kitchen that
are really in general very hard to model
and unpredictable so what is so how can
we how can we bridge the gap between
this complexity in the kitchen and
actually putting a robot chef that will
make food for you well one thing we can
we can do is we can bring all the
ingredients we can simplify by putting
them on the counters and this ms on plus
is in fact what the Iron Chef is faced
with on our TV shows we can use standard
tools and
but and we can model a human centric
workspace so my students in fact my
undergraduate students who are were just
like you have been taking the challenge
of making this robot chef and have been
developing a system called big bot i
would like to i would like to introduce
to you now this robot execute simple
baking recipes from these amazon plus
setups until the robot actually
generates finished products like cookies
cookies tend to be very popular in our
laboratory the robot uses a human
centric workplace but it uses standard
tools in other words the use of the
robot uses spatula to mix objects and
starting from a generic recipe given to
the robot in natural language the robot
is able to execute a sequence of
instructions that enables it to go from
basic raw ingredients to finish products
to cookies so let's watch this movie for
for a while we have created a database
of recipes supply the natural language
and on the video screen you see what
these recipes look like and we have
developed a natural language parser that
takes these recipes and breaks them down
into actions that can be executed by the
robot we have then implemented the new
control strategies that enable the
robots to do things like mixing scraping
finding objects pouring and in this
video you see big BOTS execute some of
these instructions that were
automatically generated from a recipe to
make Afghan cookies so I introduce to
you our robot man's and Manos which
means mind and machines it turns out
mixing is actually much harder than then
you'd think especially for machines but
this can be done using state-of-the-art
perception algorithms
and state-of-the-art manipulation and
planning algorithms that enable the
robot to find the next ingredient needed
in the recipe pick up the ball add
ingredient to the ball and then mix to
blend everything in so Afghan recipes
are often cookies or chocolate cookies
that have crunchy cereal in them and so
here's our robot successfully having
read the instructions and mixed the
batter now the robot is not the most
graceful executor in the kitchen but
nevertheless it's successfully it
successfully executed the mixing and it
created the batter the robot is also
very efficient because now it's noticed
that there is a little bit left on in
the bowl and it will go ahead to scrape
it so our robot chef is also able to
find the oven in the kitchen and open
the door and the robot uses wheels for
moving back and forth between different
workstations and here's the robot going
back to the mixing workstation and
bringing the cookies to the oven so
let's see the 20 minutes of baking time
is the required baking for a interval
for this recipe and after 20 minutes
here is the result and this is my
student Mario who developed this recipe
so I encourage all of you to bring
robots in your laboratories because then
you will be you will have the pleasure
of having fresh cookies baked by the
robot everyday so it turns out that
there are other tasks inside the home
and in in the world that you might want
to automate them some tasks require more
than one robot so for instance say you
are moving to a new
room or new apartment and you want to
buy new furniture and this is an example
where a group of robots are able to work
together and cooperate to assemble your
next IKEA set a furniture for your rooms
so in this case we have two robots
equipped with robot arms these are
laboratory replicas of industrial robots
and these robots have specialized
tooling that is added to their grippers
to enable operations that are actually
very complicated to execute by robots
such as screwing here you can see a
close-up of how the robot finds the
parts and and made them and the
mechanism used to to spin the part in
place and by the way this work was done
by undergraduate students in my
laboratory and it's been a very exciting
project so with these examples I would
like to show you that in fact in order
to create autonomous systems that will
do things for you it's important to
think about multiple robots working
together especially when you have a
large scale environment or a complex
environment like in the case of the
furniture assembly robot so in this
environment the robots move around to
sense the environment they compute based
on the values they send from the
environment and then they take some
action in the process of sensing each
robot will aggregate information that is
only local to the robot and this
information may be valuable to the other
members of the team so communication is
an important aspect of these kinds of
machines and because of that we have a
distributed system in which each robot
has access only to local information but
what we would like is to guarantee some
sort of global behavior for the system
in other words make sure that your team
of robot furniture assemblers
we'll assemble the correct bed or table
for you so with these examples I would
like to tell you three things so I would
like to tell you that in order to make
these are amazingly capable autonomous
systems we really need to we really need
to know mathematics we really need to
start by modeling these systems and by
building a theory on how they work the
next step you need is you need to know
how to program you need to go you need
to be able to implement these systems in
Hardware ending software and the third
thing you need is you need the courage
to follow your dreams so you really need
to be able to think about what kind of
new capabilities or activities you would
like to enable the system's you are
creating to do and just go for that go
for your dreams because it's possible to
implement them so let me say a few words
about each of these three important
things so with Syrian the algorithms I
just want to give you an example of the
flavor of the kind of thing you need to
develop that will that allows you to
model robots that think locally yet have
a global a guaranteed global behavior so
the problem i would like to use for this
is a very simple example i have an
environment i have a bunch of yellow
robots that can sense in the environment
and i want to place these robots in a
way that matches how interesting the
environment is so in other words where
it's interesting i want to collect a lot
of samples and what is less interesting
i want to have sparse or sensing and in
order to solve this problem i actually
have to think about a number of
different aspects of computer science so
i have to model the multi-agent dynamics
and this comes from a discipline called
control theory then i have to model how
the robots communicate with each other
and this can be done by using graph
theory and finally i need to think about
how the robot sense and this comes from
learning and estimation theory
by bringing these mathematical
formalisms together we can actually come
up with algorithms to solve this problem
so it turns out there is some very
specific mathematics that enables us to
formulate this problem in terms of a
strategy that involves gradient descent
in terms of a strategy that involves
computing a cost function doing some
local sensing and analysis and moving
according to how according to what this
cost function tells us to do and maybe
the the mathematics is not so important
for this talk but but the general
process is if you do not know where the
environment is interesting then you
would like to actually learn that so you
would like to learn the weighting
function that goes with the cost
function in the system you'd like to
then use it to estimate the next place
where the robots have to move and then
actually act by moving so using
mathematics we can come up with a
formalism that shows us how to drive the
robots in such a way that their motion
will optimize a cost function
representing the collective cost of this
network so an interesting technical
aspect of this is how do you learn where
it's interesting in the environment and
the way you can do that is by
approximating a function that tells us
how the environment is interesting using
something called a basis function so
basis functions can be in anything they
think can be gaussians they can be
wavelets they can be polynomials and in
general they have these unknown weights
in front of them and these unknown
weights can be learned by doing
measurements in the environment so the
idea is like this the robots have some
estimate of what the sensory function
looks like they take a measurement they
get a sense of how far off their local
estimate is from what they have just
measured and they correct the parameters
in other words what is needed for a good
solution is an algorithm that enables
the robots to moving the physical
to cover the environment while earning
the parameters of this learning of the
sensory function in a parameter space
and it turns out that if every robot
does this locally the whole system will
converge in a guaranteed way to robot
configurations that are guaranteed to
match where it's interesting in the
environment so this is pretty amazing if
you think about launching a group of
robots in a place you don't know
anything about doing very small local
operations and then ending up with
something that is absolutely guaranteed
to be the solution of this hard problem
it's very very amazing and this is what
we get from from being able to apply
mathematics to model the problem so
here's the practical control algorithm
that results from this each robot
measure some coordinates computer
geometrical object measures the sensory
function updates parameters and then
applies a control input and that's all
there is to it so here's the cues a
little simulation that shows a group of
robots and if you look carefully there
are two red crosses in this environment
and these red crosses are where it's
interesting in the environment and you
can see in the three graphs you can see
the point of view of each robot as it
runs in the world trying to estimate and
approximate the location of these
important events in the world so I
wanted to give you a sense of how
mathematics can be used to encode a very
hard problem in a practical way but what
can we do this in a really practical
situation so consider instantiated this
solution to a very simple problem now my
robots can fly and I they have
downward-pointing cameras and I would
like for my robots to spread out in the
world in such a way that their camera
covers the entire environment so that
they can perhaps do continuous
monitoring of the environment while
using the same methodology of gradient
descent
using a cost function we can instantiate
this problem by by introducing a cost
function that has a lateral component to
drive robots to move inside the region
of interest and away from neighbors in
other words to spread out and a vertical
component that allows the robots to move
down to see better while moving up to
see more so the critical thing is coming
up with a trade-off between all these
four components and it turns out that
this is sufficient to implement a very
sophisticated algorithm where we we do
not have to know ahead of time how many
robots are in the system and the robots
will adaptively collect samples in the
world figure out how to move to optimize
this cost function and place themselves
at optimal locations that will give us
the coverage of the environment
according to to the highest possible
resolution and to show you that the
system is independent on the number of
robots here is Brian the father of the
system killing one of the robots and
here the robots readjusting to make up
for the failure of of the third robot
and in fact the second robot dies next
and you will see the the remaining robot
should way up because that will enable
the camera field of view to cover more
of the of the space so okay this is a
this is a laboratory experiment that
shows you how you can take a practical
theory and implement it on real hardware
what can you do with it so one possible
application is in biology where
biologists sometimes like to find
invasive tree species so in this picture
you see some trees that are much darker
green than the others and those are
invasive trees brought on an island in
the Pacific and these trees are removing
all the nutrients for the native trees
they should be eliminated but it's
impossible to tell where these trees are
from the ground however if
bring a fleet of robots and you allow
them to hover above the tree canopy you
can create you can aggregate mosaics of
images like this one they will tell the
biologists exactly where the batteries
are and then the trees can be eliminated
the other thing you can do is you can
use these robots to get a good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
