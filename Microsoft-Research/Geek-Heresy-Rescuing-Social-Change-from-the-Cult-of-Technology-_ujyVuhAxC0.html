hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
today's my pleasure to introduce dr.
Kintaro Toyama I've had a long
association with Kintaro so I guess I
had know a few things about him I'll try
not to hell I won't spare him
embarrassment anyway why should I do
that so I know Quintana came to
Microsoft research right after grad
school and I remember that he really
didn't want to join MSR because he
wanted to go and build a start-up or
something like that he said yeah I don't
know we convinced him that he had great
research potential I think we turned out
to be right because now he is a
professor at University of Michigan
pursuing academic career my association
with kentaro was right from the
beginning but I came to know him really
when he went to India with me to
co-found the Microsoft Research India
lab and one of the reasons I asked
Kintaro was not Indian although he can
pass for somebody from SiC him or
something but you know to go to India
with me and not any of the other people
who were from India is because it was
always an out-of-the-box thinker and so
for Kintaro every time he was doing
something he for some reason became
extremely critical of how it was being
done who was doing it what was being
done and then went out and started
challenging and questioning it I said
okay this is the kind of person I need
to help me set up the lab and I'm a very
you know traditional person I think
linearly and things like that so of
course in India he had a great time I
think I'm not sure he's going to tell
you about it in India experience here
some of it is kind of comes through in
the book but one of the things you know
in working with kentaro through the
years I realized as you know and I came
to appreciate a lot is that he's
tremendously articulated his ability to
speak about anything analyze things and
deeply analytic extremely argument they
do I'm not sure I want to go to that
side too much I've had a lot of
arguments with Quindaro and can stand on
his ground and an amazingly good writer
and most of you you know if you have
already read the book you already know
that fact I think is one of the most
entertaining and crisp writers of on
pretty much any subject
and you know he did that and then
suddenly he had this disillusionment
about the work he was doing and the
mission he was on which again is
reflected in the book and came back to
the u.s. I think with the mission I
don't know whether it was the mission of
writing a book right away but that's
what it led to
he also has a blog I think it's called
something just what is my CTD gesture
you should read that it's is a bit more
you know removes is Glaus quite a bit
more on that forum and it's quite
entertaining to read if you're not sure
if you don't watch out you might cite
you or quote you on that so you don't
know if you want to know that or
something but anyway he's III think
you're in for a treat if you have read
the book you already know that but
otherwise thank you again for me being
here and Kintaro thank you on and on ya
with respect to writing you know that
one of the things that I kind of did
right before I left Microsoft was you
know kind of go through a list of all
the skills that I have and I realized
that if I while I was at Microsoft I
probably spent more hours writing emails
than anything else and so it occurred to
me that maybe I could do that part a
little bit more professionally and so
that's kind of the lead-up so on a
dimension that he and I went to India to
co-found Microsoft Research India and
you know India is a very unique place
and so the lab itself was also very
unique this is a photograph of the first
building that we were in and you know we
had regularly had our farm animals
walking in front of the building which
is probably something that you could not
say for any of the other Microsoft
research labs and while I was there I
started a research group that focused on
how to use digital technologies for
International Development so for
projects in agriculture education
healthcare governance microfinance I'm
all in a bit to try to find ways to help
alleviate poverty so just to give you a
flavour for one of those projects and
Ronnie medi her face is kind of a little
bit hidden over there but she was a
researcher in my group and one of the
things that she worked on was how to
design user interfaces so they could be
used by people who were not literate we
call this project
user interfaces and the idea was to
basically find ways to use interfaces
that have practical value for four
different communities in this case women
who lived in slums in Bangalore and to
see if we could do something to help
them use the Technic
user technology I'm not going to get too
far into the actual project itself but
one of the things that was interesting
about this project was that what we
found was even among non literate women
there was a range of kind of you know
preparation for mental preparation for
using a computer interface and all the
things that you know Indrani kept
finding was that there were some women
who despite the fact that they couldn't
read who could actually very quickly
navigate the user interfaces that we
designed you know these are interfaces
and lots of graphics video audio cues
and then there were other women that
seemed to have a lot of challenges and
she thought you know she hypothesized
that it might have to do with their
level of formal education you know maybe
with their kind of cognitive skills
overall and we did a study in which we
kind of looked for you know looked at
how quickly different people could
navigate a particular text tree user
interface based on different kinds of
menu structures so some with very deep
kind of hierarchical menus some with
more shallow ones and then one being a
very flat list and basically what we
found was exactly what she hypothesized
which was that if you had more there's a
tendency if you had more formal
education to be able to navigate these
interfaces better than people with much
less education even if none of these
people could read and the interfaces had
no text in them whatsoever over the five
plus years that I was in India I you
know I of course did oversaw lots of
different projects and also read about
other people's projects in this field of
ICT which stands for information
communication technologies and
development and in project after project
this kind of phenomenon was visible so
for example in another study that we
also did this one with people who were
semi illiterate so it turns out that you
know a lot of people have learned the
alphabet they can pronounce phonemes and
so on but they still struggle just lets
say read a newspaper so people who are
semi illiterate literate and would then
we did was we would provide little text
cues next to icons so that the hope is
that over time they would begin to
recognize the text cues and then be able
to navigate the interface more and more
quickly and we found exactly a
phenomenon but again if you started off
with more literacy the texts helped you
much more and you actually improved in
your literacy more rapidly if you
started off with no literacy of course
the text didn't help at all and then if
you had a little bit of literacy then it
helped you somewhere in the middle this
is an yet another study not in our lab
they looked at the use of mobile phones
by small mic entrepreneurs and I think
this was in Indonesia and what they
found was that the entrepreneurs who had
the greater capacity as entrepreneurs
would actually take advantage of their
mobile phones more for business and
basically expanded their businesses
whereas those who didn't have a lot of
you know capacity as entrepreneurs
didn't do so well and here's another
study this one in Tanzania with health
care workers in the rural areas and here
the idea was to see how they could kind
of monitor health care workers so that
they were actually seeing the patients
they were supposed to see do their
rounds and the interesting thing about
this study was they started off with SMS
text messages as a way to remind health
care workers to see certain patients as
well as with human supervisors who kind
of you know basically meted out either
some kind of scolding or encouragement
as the health workers did their jobs and
what you see in this first graph first
of all is that the combined system with
the supervisors and the text messages
actually does much better than a control
situation where there's no reminder
whatsoever but once you leave out the
supervisors once you leave out the human
element the text messages by themselves
eventually converge to the control
situation which is just as good as not
having the text messages and again as I
mentioned this happens over and over and
over again where you see the impact of
technology having a gradient depending
on who is involved who the users are who
what kind of organizations are using a
technology so you know I basically
thought really hard about why this
pattern repeated over and over and and I
came to this very simple conclusion
which is not new in any sense but it's
basically that technology
effectively amplifies underlying human
forces so to the extent that those human
forces are capable and directed in the
right direction you can expect
technology to augment that and to cause
positive value but where those human
forces might be corrupt or dysfunctional
the technology either does nothing or in
some cases it makes things worse and I
believe this explains why so many of us
probably in this room all have very
positive experiences with technology but
that that same positive experience does
not transfer with the transfer of
technology to other contexts necessarily
incidentally I'm going to ask this group
if anybody recognizes this quote so the
first rule of any technology used in a
business is that automation apply to an
efficient operation will magnify the
efficiency the second is that automation
applied to an inefficient operation will
magnify the inefficiency anybody
recognize who that's wrong who hasn't
read the book
anybody else well all right so if you
read the book yeah anybody remember who
this was wrong
Bill Gates yes so this is from Bill
Gates the road ahead and I believe this
is exactly the thesis that I am going to
try to argue now this idea is quite
straightforward right it's basically
just says that technology is a tool and
that it amplifies the tool user and
whatever their intentions are but it
also has lots and lots of
counterintuitive ideas that I don't
think we necessarily follow through and
these are you know these fall out like
corollary is they're very a logical
extension to the basic idea but before I
go there I want to suggest that you know
we are really living in an age in which
technology is seen as the savior to all
kinds of social problems so Arne Duncan
is the tall gentleman on the right next
to President Obama and he says
technology is a game changer in the
field of Education a game changer that
we desperately need both to improve
achievement for all and increase equity
okay and in this particular speech that
he gave it was at the South by Southwest
Conference he mentioned the word
technology 46 times in comparison he
mentioned the word teacher only about 25
times okay so for him the technology is
far more important than teachers Oh
Hillary Clinton so you know this is an
image from the Egyptian revolution
and Hillary Clinton says access to
information helps citizens hold their
governments accountable and she in 2011
she basically began a foreign policy
doctrine called Internet freedom where
the idea was that the United States
would in addition to all of the other
things it does you know champion the
idea that the Internet should be a site
for free and open expression next here's
Mark Zuckerberg so here's a quote that
he was something that he said when he
rolled out internet org which is a
project to try to get the Internet to
more users the richest 500 million
people have way more money than the next
six billion combined
you saw that by getting everyone online
okay so he's claiming that the way to
solve social economic inequality in the
world is by giving everybody the
internet now these you know statements
sound a little bit outlandish but they
come from very powerful people who hold
key positions that have a lot of
resources right so combined Arne Duncan
Hillary Clinton Mark Zuckerberg and
really this list goes on and on
most of the CEOs in Silicon Valley have
at some point made claims along these
lines increasingly people who have
nothing to do with technology you know
will make similar claims and so forth
and you know the overall impression that
you get is that if we simply invent more
technologies and spread more of them
throughout the world that the world will
naturally become a better place and what
I'm going to suggest is that that was
not our experience in part because of
this amplification phenomenon and also
for other reasons I'll get into so at
this point I'm going to ask everybody a
set of a few questions okay so the first
one I'm just gonna ask you to raise your
hand wherever you agree with the
question okay so are you as rich as you
like to be anybody okay so this is a
Microsoft crowd quite a few sell it
satisfy people very good are you as
educated as you like to be okay probably
about a third the hands earlier there
was about a third of the hands are you
as compassionate as you like to be okay
a few people did anybody raise their
hands all three times maybe okay so I
actually get a lot fewer hands in the
audience especially for the first two
questions in most audiences but this is
a very well-educated and reasonably
well-paid audience
my claim is that anybody everybody in
this room should in theory if we believe
in you know the Internet as an
incredible tool being able to say yes to
all these questions because in fact you
have access to all of the information
you need to be these things for example
if you search how to be rich you get 41
million hits how did you answer that
question and some of that information
you know a lot of it is a little bit you
know it's a bit of quackery but a lot of
it is is reasonable Marius educated well
these days there are massive online a
massive open online courses and you can
really you know get an education just
about any topic and here's the Dalai
Lama a guide to cultivating compassion
in your life so one question for all of
you you know who didn't raise your hands
it's why what are you waiting for
why isn't the information enough Kristin
okay time certainly won anybody else you
think you could always be better right
so you might have a much higher ideal
ideal then when you happen to be cool
right and there will always be that's
that's certainly to anybody else yes it
takes time to process all the
information
terrific so all of that is to definitely
time and you know based on your answers
to the first question you know this is
not necessarily a group that believes
that resources are limitation but of
course for many people in the world it's
you know their time the resources just
the sheer amount of mental energy you
have left at the end of a hard work day
all of these things are constraints so
you know the idea that the information
is the bottleneck to causing certain
kinds of social change is it's flawed at
least because it's not that you know
it's not that information is not needed
it's just that it's not really the
bottle next to the things that unlock
individual change in people and for this
reason information is an education
communication doesn't inner doors of
itself lead to peace technology doesn't
actually lead to economic growth and I
can go into each of those questions at a
different stage okay next question
in which of the following countries is
democratic free speech most available
online okay what do you think okay I'm
not suggesting that you necessarily know
about these countries but based on the
question over these four countries which
do you think has the most democratic
free speech
online okay who thinks a in North Korea
hey nobody be China anybody maybe okay
one hand see Russia a couple hands D the
United States okay so the vast majority
of you uh and why do you think that I
mean I bought censorship these other
countries believe the news reporting
that's okay so in many of these other
countries their censorship good what
else do just my education in grade
school where democratic country there
was a freedom country everything okay so
because of your education so the in fact
there's a culture of kind of free speech
in the United States that's good so all
of these things are true you know I put
these three countries here because they
actually are very different with respect
to the Internet in North Korea it turns
out they have their own internet it uses
the same IP protocols as the Internet in
the United States but it is completely
closed off and you know certain IP
addresses are basically mapped to
different machines in in North Korea and
a few you know high-level officials have
access to the larger internet outside of
that but otherwise North Koreans even if
they have access to quote-unquote the
Internet are only speaking to each other
and I'm pretty darn sure that nobody
there is criticizing the supreme leader
on social media China interestingly has
an amazing censorship force as Rick
mentioned it is something like 300 to
400 thousand person strong right so
that's both private and public sector
and it turns out that some ridiculous
percentage of social media posts
actually gets entered it's in the order
of you know 10 percent and you know and
one of the things that they found was
that it wasn't that the government was
censoring criticism of the government it
was censoring anything that could
provoke mass action physical mass action
so whether it was protests in the street
or even a lot of people getting together
for you know what we would call a flash
mob all of that is what the government
in most viewers in Russia interestingly
there is actually quite a bit of
quote-unquote free speech but there's
also an incredible campaign to spread
misinformation so Putin's government
just recently there was there are some
articles in the New York Times magazine
and other places where
you know there's a vast campaign with
spreading misinformation so that people
can't trust the things that everybody is
reading and so you can't tell you know
what's real information what's really
citizen information and what is based on
the government and of course in the
United States we generally have free
speech online and my contention here is
that we have these things because we
have free speech offline it's not that
the internet the technology that runs
the internet somehow is more
democratizing in and of itself but that
as it goes to different countries the
various you know centers of power molded
in a form that reflects what they would
like to see um so here is kim jeong-hoon
and i believe he is
I guess he's showing off the Internet to
a bunch of generals all right so a last
question imagine that you and a very
poor
I say rural farmer here but just imagine
the poorest person you can imagine who
is involuntarily poor okay the invar
involuntary part is important I'm not
expecting you to think of a you know
well-educated contented monk and that
you had exactly one week of free
unlimited access to the Internet to
raise as much money for the charity of
your choice okay so the question is who
would be able to raise more money you or
this very poor person okay who thinks
you okay most people and who thinks the
other person okay good why and why you
should so you have rich friends yes what
else Yeah right social capital good you
have a lot of connections
absolutely so you have much more
literate about the resources and you
also have the kind of education that
will allow you to write you know
persuasive emails all these things um
you know this thought experiment is
meant to illustrate that you can hold
the technology constant and the outcomes
can be dramatically different and you
know you can also flip this so imagine
that you're running the same experiment
but not with somebody who's very poor
but with either Bill Clinton or Bill
Gates okay who would be able to raise
more money well we already know well at
least with Bill Clinton that you know he
can use a technology in a way that will
out fundraise any of us and this is true
again for different tasks so if you were
trying to seek investment advice or if
you're trying to get a better
education or if you're trying to get a
better recommendation for a restaurant
all of these things so you know this is
just a show that the technology by
itself doesn't in fact make things even
although you know in some sense it
spreads the access but that the
difference outcomes also still depend on
capacities that we have the social
connections that we have and so forth so
technology in and of itself doesn't fix
dysfunctional institutions it doesn't
make things more democratic it does not
shrink inequalities and what I'm going
to do is go back through these quotes
and then reconsider them so education
there have been saw a series of very
well-run rigorous randomized control
trials showing for example that giving
kids laptops has no material impact on
anything that you would consider good
for their education whether it's their
grades their test scores their
attendance at school their tendency to
be disciplined this particular study by
two economists fairly and Robin said did
a study in cat in the state of
California where they gave half of about
a thousand children laptops and the
other half were controlled didn't get it
and that's exactly what they found a
couple of years ago I you know while I
was writing this book I need to find
different ways to make income and one of
the things I did was I taught at a
nonprofit organization in Seattle called
the technology access foundation which
was founded by Trisha Zico who used to
be a Microsoft employee and this this
was a class afternoon class for third
through fifth graders and our goal was
to help teach them computer programming
robotics you know writing podcasts and
so forth and my greatest battle in
teaching them computer literacy was the
computer itself so as soon as my back
was turned on any one child they would
all go and find whatever games they
could online and play them so this is a
shot of one student over the shoulder
and ultimately what I found was that you
know this was it was up to me as a
teacher to really make sure that the
students were focused and I you know
talked to all of the other teachers to
see what kind of rules they had and it
was only through kind of a very
difficult process of imposing that
discipline that the children ended up
being able to focus on programming so
you know even in a class about computers
it's
that you want to maximize screen time
you just want to make sure that the tool
is being used for learning Oh finally
this is lakeside school so another thing
that I did was to work at this school
for a couple of months and you know
lakeside school is that school that Bill
Gates went to it has a lot of Technology
the kids are all required to carry
laptops they also have smartphones they
tweet their you know sports results they
communicate by email with all their
teachers and you know many of the
children are you know probably children
of your colleagues they're executives at
you know Google Amazon Microsoft and the
student-teacher ratio there's amazing
it's like nine to one right so this is
an amazing school it's got all the
resources it wants its got has all the
technology wants so what do the parents
pay for when they want an extra boost
for their kids well I was there as a
substitute tutor for a friend so
basically they were the parents were
paying me to provide more adult guidance
for the students who were having
challenges and what's interesting is my
guess is for all of you who are parents
you probably have some kind of
guidelines about how you want your kids
to use technology either at home or at
school is that the case kind of I see a
bunch people nodding and so there's some
you we have some intuition wise parents
have some intuition that the technology
in and of itself is not necessarily a
net positive and you have to be very
careful about how children access it I
think of it as you know it has its the
equivalent of of automobiles except in
the cognitive domain right so we don't
happily give the right to drive to our
children because we know that as
powerful and amazing a technology as a
car is that they can get into a lot of
trouble with it and I believe wise
parents have that same intuition with
digital technologies but it's not
something that we are yet you know we
have yet shared with the rest of the
world in fact you know there's a lot of
kind of push from the technology firm
side to get more and more technology
into schools okay with respect to
democratize ation so I'm gonna talk a
little bit about revolution so this was
again Egypt and you know it was often
called the Facebook revolution well so
was it a Facebook revolution well
interestingly enough in Libya in Syria
the dictators in those countries soon
after they started getting protests they
shut down the Internet
those countries okay in Libya as you
know Gadhafi was eventually hunted down
in streets and executed by these
militias in Syria the civil war is
ongoing the rebels have not given up
despite the fact that they have no
social media to organize these
rebellions so what how are they
communicating well we of course know
that previous generations have had
revolutions very successfully without
you know without any communication
technologies without even electricity
you know I think if we're gonna call the
Arab Spring a facebook revolution we
have to call the American Revolution a
lantern revolution because of Paul
Revere and one if by land two if by sea
you know basically the lesson is that
you know revolutionaries will use
whatever communication tools at their
disposal but just because they use those
tools doesn't mean that the tools are
the cause of the revolution finally this
is China China is amazing because this
is a country of 1.3 billion people and
some over a billion of them now have
mobile phone accounts and about 750
million of them are on the internet in
one way or another so this is a country
that has an abundance of digital tools
and at least as far as we can tell there
is no you know mass uprising to
overthrow the government just because
the tools are there so all of this is to
say that digital technology is not
either necessary or sufficient to have a
democratic revolution and so this idea
that that Facebook was a critical part
of the Egyptian revolution I think is
flawed it was certainly it played a role
they probably accelerated some of the
protests and so forth but I don't think
it was the main the main event Oh
finally what's the story with respect to
inequality so one of the interesting
things about massive open online courses
they were initially billed as a free way
for everybody to get an education right
so anybody in the United States could
certainly walk to the library and take
some of these courses recent studies
have shown basically that the people who
complete MOOCs are basically a college
educated professionals who already have
jobs so they are not you know jobless
high school dropouts so any idea that
providing the content for education free
to everybody immediately levels of
educational playing field is is
broken somewhere what about other uses
of the internet so I don't know if you
remember but zach braff the actor
director ran a Kickstarter campaign to
find one of his movies and there was a
bit of an outcry because he raised over
three million dollars and people are
like well you know this is a successful
actor you know why can use his own money
instead of asking the public for it but
despite that you know that backlash he
was still able to raise three million
dollars the average Kickstarter campaign
raises $6,000 so what that tells you is
that you know your popularity your
celebrity status is still the thing that
matters in a world in which everybody is
able to raise money online and finally
I'm going to show this graph so this is
a graph from the United States Census
Bureau and basically this green line at
the bottom is the rate of poverty in the
United States it declined from about
1940 through 1970 and then since 1970
has been both basically flat this graph
doesn't show it but after this has gone
up because the recession okay since 1970
we've also had this explosion of digital
technologies in fact all of the
technologies that all of us use and work
on are inventions since roughly about
the 1970s right so I'm not saying that
the technology has caused this
flatlining but if you believe that the
invention of novel technologies and
their penetration in a population in and
of itself causes beneficial social
change in terms of poverty alleviation
or eliminating inequality then basically
the juxtaposition of these two very
obvious facts suggests that there's
something you know something not quite
right with that story and so you know
basically what I think is that in the in
America we are politically not yet
committed to eliminating poverty and so
even though we have amazing tools that
could help us and that fight you know
the human forces are not there to to be
amplified by the technology okay so you
know a lot of times at this point
especially if it's a technology a heavy
audience you know I feel like there's a
general subduing of the mood but but
there is a lot of bright side ok so
amplification is not all bad in fact
it's a potentially very powerful thing
so what I'm going to suggest is you know
how can we use technology in a positive
way and are there
other things that we need to do as
technologists to help the world become a
better place so you know the main lesson
of amplification is that for technology
to have positive impact we have to
ensure that the right human forces are
in place first so in a project that we
did in India that we started in India
this is a project called digital green
we use digital video in a particular way
to basically feature local farmers in
how-to videos and then use those videos
as teaching aids for other farmers to
learn about better agricultural
practices and this system is now it's
been turned we spun it off as a
nonprofit it's been funded by the Gates
Foundation by US aid by DFID which is
the UK's aid organization and it's
impacting something like 5,000 rural
villages mostly in India also parts of
Africa as well but the critical thing
about digital green is that even though
it uses a lot of Technology it always
needs to piggyback on an existing
organization that has good trust and
rapport with farmers and as long as
those organizations are focused on
helping farmers learn better agriculture
then this methodology which involves
technology can basically help them do it
better it amplifies the positive effect
of an organization that's already doing
good work one of the you know the
caution there is that it's not that you
can if you spread more of these videos
that farmers become better farmers in
fact in countries like India there's
already a lot of television shows which
most farmers do have access to in which
they're constantly streaming you know
agricultural videos and so on but those
don't seem to have the impact simply
because you know they the farmers don't
have any reason to trust that this
information is relevant for them you
know they're it's often out of context
they don't know that people who produce
the video whereas as long as we work
with local organizations that have
rapport with farmers that Trust is there
another thing that I think we can do as
a technology industry is actually help
other people become productive in our
own industry so you know one of the
great I think mistakes that people
generally make is to believe that
somehow technology is you know
successful and it's a source of economic
development because that's that appears
to be what happens at companies like
Microsoft and companies in Silicon
Valley
and therefore we should give other
people a technology but the reality is
you know all of you you asked for you
know many of you answered that you were
as rich as you wanted to be to the
previous question and you can answer
that not because you own fancy devices
but because you have the education and
the entrepreneurial capacity to actually
earn a living that allows you to
purchase those devices right so for
example if I buy you know laptop with
Microsoft software I'm not really
getting that much richer but Microsoft
shareholders and employees are
benefiting from that so the best way to
help people through technology if that's
really what we want to do is actually to
help them become producers of the
technology so this is Patrick a we are
he used to be a Microsoft program
manager and he launched a university in
Ghana called HSE university because he
believed that the opportunities that he
had educational opportunities he had in
the United States were ultimately the
underlying cause for his success and I
think that was it was a very no true
insight he didn't decide after we trying
from Microsoft he was gonna start a
business that was gonna generate gadgets
for people who were poor he said we are
what we really need is for people to
become better educated this university
is one of the most successful private
liberal arts schools in Africa now it's
widely recognized and he's basically you
know at this point I think missing his
12th year and there's now a generation
of students who are kind of falling
following into in his footsteps so many
of them have gone through you know
they've basically gone through a
reasonably successful career often in
software engineering sometimes in
business and they've now kind of quit
those because they wanted to do
something that gives back to society ok
finally I'm gonna talk about two
different potential science-fiction
outcomes so you know one of the things I
think is really interesting is ever
since I left Microsoft I used to do work
in computer vision and one of the things
that I thought you know back when I did
was actually doing research in this area
was that it would still be a few decades
before we have image processing to the
point that you could give a computer an
image and it would output a text
description but a year or two ago
researchers in computer vision have
basically shown that that's actually
doable because we now have
enough annotated imagery we have the
computing power and we become a little
bit smarter about how to apply the
learning algorithms that we've been
learning on we've been working on so you
know I actually think we are potentially
very close to what Ray Kurzweil has
dubbed the singularity
you know the moment when some of our
machines become smarter than human
beings and I think that moment is both
amazingly interesting but also
terrifying because I don't think we can
predict at all how that technology will
be used and so forth and I think it's
really up to us in the technology
industry to potentially decide that
since it will come out of our labs so
there are two possible you know outcomes
for this one is the matrix okay so I'm
sure most of you have seen this movie in
it there is a advanced you know AI that
harvests human energy to feed machine
masters while offering the illusion with
a pleasant life right I want to suggest
that we already have companies that do
this and because this is a Microsoft
audience I want to suggest that this is
true of Facebook it is fundamentally not
that different right it basically
Facebook is harvesting your attention
you're on my attention to sell to
advertisers and they benefit the more
time we spend on Facebook now you know I
think Facebook on the whole is
relatively innocuous but I could easily
imagine that if Facebook the company
ends up with you know with a machine
that is not only smarter than us but
able to become smarter and smarter and
smarter the way that the singularity
supposed to work that you know one day
we will all be zombies online unable to
take our eyes off of Facebook basically
because you know it is such a compelling
it provides such a compelling experience
that was machine generated you know I
don't think we want that world and it
requires those of us who are closest to
this technology including many of you to
actually decide before we hit this you
know what I think of as a nuclear bomb
in the IT world of incredible machine
intelligence to kind of decide what
rules this technology should have so I
don't know if how many of you have read
Isaac Asimov but in many of his robot
stories he has something called the
three laws of
robotics and every robot after some
point in his book chronology basically
is you know endowed with these laws and
they're unable they're basically unable
to break the laws without some immense
you know suffering for on their part the
first the first law is that no robot
should allow a human to come to harm or
through neglect allow him to come to
harm and you know we don't we haven't
even begun to discuss you know this kind
of idea but I think it's essential that
we do and I think that you know all of
you in this room as well as many of the
people at Microsoft are exactly the you
know the people to think about this and
I think we you know there's an
opportunity to be the first to stake you
know to make a stake in the ground with
respect to how we should respect this
technology in a way that it does serve
positive ends and not just those of
shareholders well you know that would be
true if Facebook would be happy to to be
used just by wealthy people but but it's
actually hungry for more users and then
of course there's the Star Trek future
in which you know this is John Luke
Picard in one of the movies the
acquisition of wealth is no longer the
driving force in our lives and he's
talking about human lives we work to
better ourselves in the rest of humanity
so you know one of the conceits in Star
Trek is that this happened because of
Technology you know we eventually got to
a point where food became you know as
easy as ordering it in one or what's it
called the matter replicators and I
actually think you know what is unsaid
here is that somewhere in the
intervening years between now and the
Star Trek future there were other social
cultural political battles that were
fought such that the immense you know
resource abundance that they eventually
have in the future was actually
relatively evenly distributed so in our
world today there's already enough food
to feed the entire population such that
there is no malnutrition but for
whatever reason the balance of food
distribution is such that there are you
know over 800 million people in the
world who still go to bed hungry every
day and so that suggests that it's not
enough to have the technology to
generate plenty there's something else
which I believe is again social cultural
economic and political and
those forces need to be addressed as
much as the technology and so you know
especially for those of us in the
technology industry I think we want to
make sure that the technology helps us
not you know exacerbates a situation
that's already harmful and today you
know I do believe that again many of you
in this room have the potential to
affect how technology gets used in the
future so I'm going to end there and
thank you okay great so the question was
what about Sugata Mitra who was the
founder of a project called
hole-in-the-wall which some of you may
have heard Mitra won the I think the TED
Prize and I think it was 2013 and he
believes in something called minimally
invasive education and that project was
begun in India it was begun in Delhi and
we actually invited him to give a talk
in the early days when he was working on
it and basically the idea is to provide
a rugged PC freely available to
neighborhoods that are relatively poor
so that kids can come and play on them
and his claim was that within days the
kids would learn how to use a computer
they would learn how to use Google and
then in some of his later studies the
claim was that these kids would then
teach themselves English as well as I
think it was what was it biomechanics
right so they are supposedly learning
these very complex subjects on their own
with no adult supervision whatsoever if
you look through the papers that
basically cite these crazy ideas about
what these kids accomplished on their
own it turns out that they're mostly
written either by Sugata Mitra himself
or by teams that worked very closely
with him other researchers who have gone
and looked at the hole-in-the-wall
projects in different places have found
that you know within months they're
often in a state of disarray they're not
and when you actually ask the adults in
the neighborhood what they remember many
of them say well there were you know
older teenagers coming here to play
video games and that's not really a
surprise um you know if you look over
the shoulder of any child with a
smartphone they are not solving math
problems they are not learning
biophysics they are playing Angry Birds
and you know that tells you that you
know again it's this idea that the
technology is sufficiently powerful that
on the one hand children have an immense
you know desire to learn they're
naturally curious on the other hand they
have a tremendous potential to be
endlessly distracted and when you give
them a tool that can do both you know
most children tend to choose a
distraction because this easier requires
less mental effort um so yes we gotta
mitra unfortunately i think is you know
despite what he says it's not it's not
the real thing the technology is really
not teaching children yes is it telling
you especially well is it ton that I
think most people in crowd we're
thinking reaches far as money and
they're especially using technology I
guess my question is do you feel as more
people were focused on technologies a
way to how to become rich rather than
how do I use technology to help others
um yeah so the question was are more
people thinking of the technology as how
do I become rich as opposed to how do I
help others um that's a good question I
mean I frankly do not know but I do
think that on average more people are
you know concerned about how to make
their own lives
better than necessarily how to improve
other people's and that's you know true
even for me I mean as much as I you know
I am focused in my professional career
on trying to find you know do research
that helps with International
Development the fact is if you add up
all the hours in my day most of my days
spent on you know selfish personal
interests and so you know I think on the
whole we are as a society tending
towards a little bit more about you know
what we need and that makes sense I mean
you have to take care of yourself you're
taking of your family but you know what
I think we want to move towards as a
society which more and more of the
percentage of our time and effort and
resources are spent on trying to help
others also attain a similar quality of
life
oh yes I'm back curious how I hope that
one day you'll have a conversation with
Mark Zuckerberg but I'm curious how you
really have that conversation so he used
to stand and now for the true technology
believer right yes how are you that's a
good question so you know at some level
if I had to pinpoint one person who is
the core audience where this book is
actually Bill Gates you know I think he
made an incredible transition in his own
life you know similar to Patrick's in
which he decided he was going to quit
focusing on you know Microsoft and more
on his foundation and he has definitely
done that at the same time I think he
has a tendency to want to solve the
world's problems through engineering
rather than through causing you know
deep changes in human beings and you
know I think Mark is you know
potentially come from a similar cloth
it's interesting in his private giving
he actually gives to educational
projects in the United States you know
he's given something over 200 million
dollars to school systems in the country
but with respect to internet org you
know the interesting thing about that
project is is that it is actually
apparently under what's called the
growth division at Facebook which tells
you that the intention of that project
is not necessarily to help you know
people do interesting things on the
internet but rather to expand Facebook's
Empire so you know I mean the first
thing I would ask him is you know are
you really serious when you say that you
think that you know spreading the
Internet in the way that you're doing is
really helping people and and if he's
actually serious I would say the next
thing I would want to do is you know
take him to a trip to a very poor
village in which they happen to have the
internet and there are more and more of
these and showing that not much happens
you know as a result of the technology
I believe the barriers to access to the
laptop and internet is four times and
what it is now a next generation has
access to the mobile phones with
internet connection
yesterday I think the scenario would be
little different than what you might
have observed when you talk about access
you mean kind of like accessing the
market in terms of being able to buy
these technologies at a lower cost yeah
yeah it's certainly I mean all around
the world is getting easier and easier
to get access to lower and lower cost
codes in fact this year marks the year
when very likely the number of mobile
phone a can
in the world will exceed the human
population that doesn't mean that
everybody will have a mobile phone
because many people have multiple phones
but it's an interesting barrier and
basically what that means is that the
technology is spreading so you know if
you believe that you know for example
the fact that you own the internet
somehow dramatically improves your life
then you know we're on a path to
eliminating poverty for good right
I suspect that ten years from now we'll
be having similar conversations but not
with mobile technology it will be with
tablets or you know or maybe with drones
it will be with another technology and I
don't think that aspect is going to
change in fact you know in a previous
generation thought very similar things
about television they thought you know
with television we know we can
democratize education we no longer have
to send kids to schools and pay for
expensive teachers now you have audio
and video being you know streamed right
into everybody's living rooms why don't
we just have kids sit there and watch TV
and they'll become educated and I my
guess is in 15 years or less we'll look
back and say why did we think of these
crazy things about the Internet yeah so
this kid goes back to the same question
that the effect the effectiveness of
teachers so my experience certainly you
know person as a teacher is much more
effective than a program and it's echoed
in these stories of Udacity in Seoul are
not really having the full potential you
think there's some fundamental law at
work or have you just not found the
right program that you know instead of
providing the distraction of a video
game it provides a draw of a video game
but at the same time educates people
that is a great question so I have two
responses to that one is you know I
think the fundamental flaw in a lot of
this is to believe that education is
about the material content of what you
are learning right so there are these
tendencies to take the textbook and say
what textbooks are boring so we need to
amp them up and everything that we have
that's digital is really you know a
flashy blingy sound effect you know
immersed version of these textbooks and
the content is still the content right
the real problem with education I think
is is the motivation of the student to
do the hard internal work to learn right
and that motivation it can
conceivably generated through some
amount of technology but really the best
you know the best solution for general
motivation is other people or even the
internal motivation that you know
students themselves have right and and
really at this point we have no
substitute for that other than other
human beings and human beings are good
at scolding kids encouraging kids
inspiring kids and you know I think
there's arguments to be made that all of
those things need to be used in a very
smart you know way in order to help a
child develop the intrinsic motivation
so that they learn the other thing is
with respect to gamification right so
there's a lot of talk about gamification
and how you can use games to help
motivate students to learn and I think
that's probably true you know I think a
lot of the research is you know going in
the direction where certain things can
be gamified but you know imagine a world
in which everybody's K through 12
education is all game applied okay and
possibly through video games well at the
end of that if a student goes through
that kind of education maybe they will
have learned the science and history and
the math and the writing that you want
them to learn but they will become human
beings who cannot learn unless it is in
the form of a video game and to me that
would be doing a much greater to service
to real education then then having you
know in you know in sort of the content
into their brains yeah they're now
embarking a common pitch shifting over
to the Common Core which is a
pedagogical approach them Assizes
communication collaboration skills
critical thinking problem based or a
project-based learning and I think it's
gonna be a challenge I'm told teachers
really understand that and maybe parents
but I see that as being matched for the
technology that used to just be door
stops if you randomly handed it to kids
but I think there's pedagogically what
you need is a pedagogy that goes along
with it which is in line with what
you're saying but I actually way more
optimistic about the you know five-year
time frame for education because I'm
really impressed with what they're
trying to do yeah thanks Jonathan so you
know I believe that what you're saying
is absolutely true for good schools and
for schools we can attract strong
teachers who know how to incorporate
technology and do really interesting
things with this but you know most of
the educational problems that we
talk about in this country or not we are
not worried about the kids who are going
to private school who have wealthy
parents we can find a way to pay for
tutoring and all of this we are worried
about the kids where the teachers are
unfortunately not the best teachers you
know there in school districts which
don't raise enough budget to be able to
afford even the basic things that you
you know you and I would expect in a
regular education and to me you know if
we were suggesting that pushing more
technology into those schools it's going
to help them it doesn't work for exactly
the opposite reason of why our schools
work with technology which is again
amplification right so if you're in an
environment that is unable to help kids
learn what they should be learning even
without the technology then the
technology is not going to help them
learn more I think that's consistent
with what you're saying yes so the first
one I was wondering if you could just
start spitballs and thoughts about the
idea that Silicon Valley is a
meritocracy the second one was so as
we're like progressing and moving
towards the more digital marketplace for
cheap labor I want to know your thoughts
on like actionable steps that we could
take sort of help mitigate that okay two
big questions so the first one was
that's right the first one was you know
whether Silicon Valley is a meritocracy
or not you know I think it's a
reasonable meritocracy but it's
obviously clear that it is not a pure
meritocracy in the sense that there are
plenty of people who have you know
tremendous amounts of skills and talent
but who are excluded for reasons other
than their capacity at the same time I
think that even thinking of meritocracy
as the end-all and Beall has a problem
in that you know if you have a mayor
talk meritocracy all that it does is
then create a new new form of separating
people in which those who somehow have
managed to gain the mysterious thing
called merit end up getting all the
advantages of our society but we're not
focused on helping everybody else get
that married as well and so you know I
think meritocracy is a better
alternative to you know many of the
systems that depend on nepotism and
seniority and things
that but it's still not the final thing
I mean we have to go beyond meritocracy
to your second point it's a second
question which was again remind me what
are the steps that we can do we can take
to sort of help mitigate this like you
know exploiting right you know so one of
the greatest challenges I think is that
as the technology is becomes more and
more capable it means that a though all
of the jobs that depend on those
capabilities basically become less and
less productive in terms of economic
income right and you know basically you
can't get you can't make money doing
those jobs because there's a cheaper way
to do it through machines and what that
means generally is that you have to
ensure that more people are educated or
have the skills to the point that it
exceeds whatever machines are capable of
doing
you know if machine learning for example
keeps improving you know it might be
that a good percentage of the people in
this room eventually will have to fight
for their jobs because we don't have the
capacity to compete with those machines
I think the only answer to these things
is political which is to say it is this
is not a technology problem it is a
problem of our larger society and how we
decide to allocate the resources that
the society produces and and I do think
that all of us who are in the technology
industry actually can do an immense
service to the politics of this country
but basically coming out and saying look
we are working on these amazing
technologies but they are not going to
solve these you know deep social
problems for you we have to as a country
address them from a political angle and
I don't think that's going to go away in
fact you know one of the conclusions of
my book I didn't go too much into this
is that exactly in a world where there's
tremendous amount of Technology if you
believe in amplification we should be
working on the other side which is the
human human side yes I'm back ok one
last question I have duck tails really
nicely with her questions Isis great
would you view your reading of
technology and its purpose as deeply
egalitarian or do you have kind of
another interpretation of the purpose of
technology that is viewing technology to
instruct
serve the public good and that if it
doesn't if it deviates give a problem oh
well you know I mean I think the whole
point of amplification is to say that
the technology will amplify whatever we
think it should be doing and so you know
to the extent that we as a civilization
believe that it should be you know
helping humanity in some sense mature
and become more enlightened I think the
technology will help us do that but you
know if it all ends up being about
maximizing shareholder value and making
you know turning us into a world in
which you know competition for resources
is the primary objective then the
technology will amplify that in some
sense turn us into a caricature of
ourselves yeah thank you all right thank
