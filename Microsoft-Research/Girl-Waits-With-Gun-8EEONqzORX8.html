thank you so much for coming my name is
Amy Draves and I'm so pleased to welcome
amy stewart to the microsoft research
visiting speaker series amy is the
award-winning author of six books
including the drunken botanist and wit
wicked plants and she has taken her
first foray into fictionalized history
with her book girl waits with a gun girl
waits with gun I added an a there sorry
in which she explores a true story of
one of our nation's first female deputy
sheriffs she's also the subject of our
first foray into book clubs so if you
haven't signed up but would like to join
us we'll be meeting next door following
this meeting and we'll spend time
chatting with Amy as well as
appreciating her culinary skills as we
serve the signature drink for this book
the New Jersey automobile please join me
in giving a me a very warm welcome thank
you hey guys thank you so much for
having me in case you're tempted by the
promise or the threat of a cocktail in
the middle of the day let me tell you
what it is and how it came to be my last
book the drunken botanist was a book
about all the plants that we turn into
alcohol so at pretty much every book to
our event we'd serve cocktails it made
total sense right and i found out that
when you serve drinks people totally
show up to your events and I thought
this is brilliant I'm just going to do
this for every book from now on it
doesn't matter what the book is about
we're just going to do this so for this
book there's not an obvious drink that's
a part of the book but I wanted to find
something that was from the 1910s that
maybe if I got lucky had a name that
connected to the themes in the book
definitely had to be made from
ingredients that were available in the
nineteen tens of nothing else and I also
wanted to make it something that's easy
to mix up in the stock room of a
bookstore so you know half a bottle of
this half a bottle of that stirred no
flaming orange peels no muddled cucumber
you know nothing too messy or
complicated so I found this drink in a
1910 Zarah cocktail guide called the
automobile which I thought was perfect
because this book begins with a car
crash the automobile is equal parts gin
sweet vermouth and scotch it's horrible
don't don't ever do that but I thought I
think I can improve this so what I did
is I replaced the Scotch with Applejack
which is a new jersey spirit very tasty
and i added a spoonful of jam jam and
cocktails is very trendy right now they
weren't putting jam and cocktails 100
years ago but they had jam 100 years ago
so i think it counts and then topped off
with champagne because everything's
better with some champagne so that's why
it's the new jersey automobile and
that's what we're going to be drinking
if you're interested and if you can't
make it it's on my website it's actually
a pretty good drink to make for a crowd
because you can actually batch it ahead
of time pretty easily so let me tell you
a little bit about how this book came
into being I was just finishing up the
drunken botanist and I was doing
research into a gin smuggler named Henry
Kaufman and I just wanted to find out if
Henry Kaufman had done anything else
interesting before I put him in the book
so i went to the new york times archives
and i found this article oh wait oh this
is actually I this is actually not a
picture of Henry Kaufman but it is a
picture of a bootlegger and I put it in
here because as someone who has
employees myself I own a bookstore it
cracked me up that someone needed to
make a diagram of how bootlegging works
like do I got it write it down for you
look it comes in off the boat we're
gonna put it in the car you're gonna
drive that car anyway so that and that's
that that's Henry Kaufman and that's
bootlegging but the story that i found
was in the new york times in 1915 so
exactly a hundred years ago about
somebody named Henry Kaufman I never
could figure
if it was the same guy but this Henry
Kaufman ran his car into a horse and
buggy being driven by these three
sisters named Constance Norma and
fleuret cop they got into a dispute over
the damages the cops sisters just wanted
payment for the damages to their buggy
he refused the conflict escalated until
pretty soon Henry Kaufman was harassing
them threatening them firing shots at
their house sending kidnapping threats
and they were basically just under siege
in their little farmhouse in the New
Jersey countryside for almost a year
because of this guy so it's just one
article I didn't even know if it was the
same Henry Kaufman who was the gin
smuggler I was trying to put in the
drunken botanist but the story was
really interesting and for the rest of
the afternoon rather than do my work
that I was supposed to get done I got
sucked into looking for more and more
about about this case and I found the
original article about the accident
itself and a little civil penalty that
was imposed on him Henry Kaufman owned a
silk factory in Paterson New Jersey
which meant that he was really one of
the powerful elite of the town this came
out of an episode that happened a few
months later where they went to the
sheriff for help in dealing with this
guy who was harassing them and the
sheriff actually issued revolvers to the
three sisters can you imagine today you
go to the police and ask for help and
and they say okay well here's what we're
going to do I'm going to show you how to
shoot and and if these guys come back
this is what this is this is what you're
going to do and that's actually what
happened you know law enforcement at
this time was very ad hoc most police
officers and and and sheriff's deputies
were volunteers they didn't have
uniforms they didn't have a lot of rules
to follow they had no training it was
very common for the sheriff in those
days to literally round up a posse if he
needed help catching a crook like he'd
go around and knock on doors and find
able-bodied men and say get your Lantern
and your gun and we're going to go after
this guy and off they go so it's amazing
that that was
100 years ago that a thing like this
could happen the newspapers had a field
day with this story they thought it was
kind of hilarious that these three women
were standing up for themselves and did
all these silly newspaper headlines
about the case which went all over the
country there were articles about them
out here on the west coast at that time
this is the title of the book girl waits
with gun I love this I love this
headline I love the part about Miss cop
annoyed for months like you don't want
to annoy miss cop because look what can
happen this article refers to an
incident where Constance participated in
a sting operation with the sheriff
they'd received a threatening letter
that basically said pay us a thousand
dollars or we're going to kidnap your
youngest sister and burn down your house
so she went and stood on a street corner
in the middle of the night to make the
money drop hoping to catch the guy and
there were a lot of reporters who
covered the story so it was an it was
yet another moment when they were really
in the news a lot so this all happened
in one day this was just like one day's
worth of research where I got
sidetracked from what I was supposed to
be doing and this happens to writers all
the time you stumble across something
when you meant to be looking for
something else and you find it's sort of
intriguing so you go oh that's
interesting i'm just gonna I'm just
going to throw this in a folder and hang
on to it but in this case I was already
kind of falling in love with these three
women just in the course of the
afternoon and seeing what an interesting
book it could make my husband came home
we own a bookstore he runs the store he
came home from the store and you know
choose your habit to sit down and have a
drink and talk about what our day was
like this is exactly what we look like
every night at home we dress the dress
for cocktail hour and he said you know
we have an ancestry.com account at the
bookstore and we can look them up and
find them in the census records and find
birth certificates and things like that
so that's exactly what we did all
evening and I was able to really start
putting a fan
only tree together for them figure out
in the census where they were living and
when and they really started to become
you know real living people to me and
not just names in a newspaper article
now I had to get back to my work I had
to finish up drunken botanist but when I
had time I would spend a few hours here
and there searching for more information
and it really did take on the feeling of
a little treasure hunt and like all good
treasure hunts and even had a map I
found this old this is an old land map
and here they are this is the plot of
land they owned when you read the book
you'll see that there's a creek that
runs behind their house and that flora
got shot at when she went down to the
creek so I was very excited to see the
creek on the map and then when I found a
modern-day map and was able to overlay
it and figure out where this was I saw
that the creek was still there on modern
maps so as soon as I could I got on a
plane and I went out to patterson and
hackensack and i stood in the creek and
it was such an amazing feeling i have to
tell you by this time this was already
starting to sort of live in my
imagination as a possible novel and I
was starting to write some scenes and to
imagine how this might work as a book
and how it might come together as a
story so to actually be able to
physically go and stand in the places
where the story that previously only
lived inside my head it was such an
incredible feeling I went to the street
corner where the girl waited with the
gun and this building might have been
there in the 1910s it looks maybe just
old enough and I found myself kind of
walking around the building and sort of
touching the bricks with my hands and
thinking Constance could have touched
these bricks
you know like no one has ever been so
excited to go to Hackensack New Jersey
as I was it was just amazing to be able
to follow in their footsteps and go to
all the places where these events took
place my dug around the courthouse and i
found the indictment against Henry
Kaufman which means that I got the text
of the threatening letters that he sent
to the women so when you read the book
you'll see that those letters many of
them are word for word what he actually
sent them and this is something that was
not really printed in the newspaper or
otherwise available but they still had
it on microfilm thank goodness Henry
Kaufman's factory I mentioned that he
owned a silk factory Patterson at that
time was a city of silk industry very
industrial city he owned a silk dying
factory I went to the address of his
factory it's actually right next door to
this building and it's a vacant lot but
this is a silk dying plant and it was
right next door so addresses can
sometimes change it's possible that this
was his at the very least it's very much
like where he worked so the scenes where
Constance goes to the factory to
confront Henry Kaufman and try to get
payment those scenes were all based on
being able to go and kind of poke around
in the weeds of this old abandoned
building and get a sense of what it
would have been like when this was a
very busy industrial part of the city I
also went to the jail where sheriff
Heath who's sort of the good guy of this
story where he lived and worked now
sheriff Heath he's right here he's
behind the wheel right here he lived in
an apartment the sheriff at that time
was expected with his family to move
into the jail and so he lived kind of
right in here the jail was brand new at
the time he took it over in 1912 and you
can see that it looks like a medieval
dungeon they had this idea at the time
that if a jail looked terrifying enough
people wouldn't commit crime so that
they wouldn't have to go there you can
see how well that worked out but I
showed up at the jail I'd announced it's
no longer being used to house inmates
it's under historic preservation it
looks pretty much like this right now
and the insides are exactly the way they
were in 1915 and I showed up with no
appointment and tried to talk my way in
explain what I was doing finally they
sent out the like public relations
officer who deals with the public and he
was very suspicious of me until I
mentioned Robert Heath the sheriff and
he said Heath I know that name Robert
Heath and I said yeah yeah since c'mere
c'mere c'mere come o come to me and he
had all these photographs many of which
sheriff Heath took himself or were of
Sheriff Heath I know this because I have
newspaper clippings of Heath going
around giving slideshows to try to win
public support for his very progressive
ideas about how a prison ought to be run
they were probably like those glass
lantern slides at the time and they had
scanned all of these pictures so I was
amazing for me to get to see what the
jail looked like exactly in the day that
Constance was involved that there's a
scene where the cop sisters go inside
the jail and they're inside his
apartment and I've been in his apartment
so that was absolutely remarkable and
then of course you know I also went to
the Patterson cemetery to pay my
respects and it was just the most
amazing thing in the world to go and to
stand they don't have their own markers
but I have a little map I know where
everybody's buried right there and just
to stand you know six feet above where
my characters are buried and I have so
many questions for them I'm like could
you wake up for five minutes get up get
up get up I need to talk to you but
anyway there they are it's weird that i
can actually go visit them in real life
anytime I want to so one of the coolest
things about this project of course was
getting to see these people in real life
and getting to know them so let me
introduce you to them this is Constance
cop she was the oldest sister she was 35
at the time this story began six feet
tall weighed 180 pounds she would have
towered over most men at that time and
she was unmarried still living at home
she wanted a career but
didn't really have a way of getting one
her mother it sort of prevented her from
getting any kind of useful education and
and there weren't a lot of jobs for
women you know I've read the newspapers
of the day and there's on this side of
the page as jobs for men and over here
is a little column of jobs for women and
you could be a housekeeper you could be
a stenographer like a secretary or you
could do factory work no is it so she
was kind of stuck there it's not clear
to me what would have happened to her if
Henry Kaufman hadn't come into her life
this is the youngest sister floret who's
16 when the story begins she in real
life was a very accomplished seamstress
she sewed all our own clothes she
probably made all of constants as close
to given that Constance was six feet
tall pi couldn't find anything that fit
her and she was very theatrical I have
newspaper clippings of her entering
singing competitions in paterson so she
really was the sort of dramatic
theatrical fashionable creature that I
how I have her in the book now the
middle sister Norma I've never been able
to find a picture of and it drives me
crazy every day that I don't know what
Norma cop looks like someone has a
photograph of this woman in their
basement or in their attic somewhere and
they need to give it to me it's mine and
I don't know why I don't have it if I
ever turn up her picture y'all are all
going to know about it because I'm going
to scream so loud that everybody's going
to hear at once what I did know about
Norma though because I was able to track
down some family members is I know that
she was an extremely difficult person to
get along with she was very hard she was
judgmental she was harsh on people she
held grudges she was a very blunt talker
she said whatever was on her mind and
and never apologized for any of it and
when I heard that I thought you know
what I know women like that right like
there's women like that in my in my
family we all have that aunt you know
who shows up like shows up at the
hospital when you have your baby and and
tells you that she doesn't like what you
named her baby but she's there she's
always there
always shows up and so that's the kind
of woman Norma was disliked just about
everybody she ever met and I thought you
know the thing about women like that is
that they may not like people but very
often they like animals you know like
they've got a little dog or something
like that and I didn't want to give
Norma a little dog but I wanted to give
her something to humanize her so a
fictional piece of this is that norm is
very interested in carrier pigeons
technology of the future the thing about
carrier pigeons at this time and this is
enormous position but it was the
position of many people in real life is
the telephone is infeasible as a form of
communication because we can't possibly
string wires all the way across the
country and the operator is always
listening in so you can't have a private
conversation Telegraph same problem
there's two operators one on either end
who are reading every word you write so
the only secure reliable form of
communication is messenger pigeon
obviously weirdly this may still be the
case today we don't know so she was very
interested in this idea and she had
carrier pigeons and it becomes a big
part of the book and will become an even
bigger part of her life down the road
you can see here this is Constance and
fleuret together so you can see the
constants really was a very substantial
woman at floret was about 52 in heels
always petite and adorable one of the
coolest things that happened was when I
was able to connect with some family
members I got a letter that Constance
wrote to one of the deputies during the
events of this book where she's thanking
them for their help so I was able to see
it how she what her own words sounded
like and how she signed her name which I
love I think when you can see someone's
handwriting you sort of get to know them
a little better so I actually my head up
made into a rubber stamp so if you want
constants can sign your book today as
well as me yeah pretty cool this is
sheriff Heath again he's just a doll he
was a very reform-oriented very
progressive minded guy he advocated for
inmates to have medical care he was the
first person to offer church services in
the prison there he wanted them to get
an education he wanted to get at the
root causes of poverty and crime he was
very progressive and saw something in
constants that no one else saw and was
willing to take a chance on her and
really get her involved in this
investigation they even some of the
minor characters I feel like I know
better because I have pictures them John
quarter is the county prosecutor who
first refused to help them and I turned
up a picture of him on microfilm funny
thing is I was in New Jersey about a
week ago and talking about this book and
I showed this picture and a woman came
up to me afterwards and said you know my
husband's name is John quarter and he's
named after his grandfather or
great-grandfather I wonder if it's the
same guy and I said okay well let's swap
email addresses and i'll tell you
everything I know and let's figure out
if your guys the same as my guy I said
but I have to apologize in advance
because he's the villain in this he's
the guy who only cares about himself and
isn't about to be bothered to get up off
his lazy butt and go help these three
women and he's pretty corrupt and pretty
horrible and she said no that sounds
about like my husband's family I think I
think he's ours I think he's one of ours
so John Ward is an attorney who shows up
kind of late in the book in real life
John Ward and sheriff Heath had a lot of
dealings and he there's a lot more to
come between John Ward and the cop
sisters so I gave him a fictional cameo
in this book just to get to know him
early and when I got these pictures from
his family I just loved them from his
face I just thought I know what kind of
guy this is that by the ways is his
soon-to-be ex-wife flora he had a lot of
ex-wives now he had a law partner named
Peter McGinnis and even though Peter
McGinnis is a very small part in the
book are one of this duo to kind of make
sense and I knew that McGinnis had been
a judge and a senator later in life and
I had a very serious somber picture of
him
as an old man in his disturbs but I
couldn't get a handle on him as a young
person so I went to ancestry and look to
see if his family have posted any
pictures of him when he was younger and
I couldn't find one but I turned up this
picture of another guy named Peter
McGinnis and I just fell in love with
him look at that face do you not love
that face I just want to squeeze those
cheeks he's so adorable so this became
my Peter McGinest in the book I know
that someday I'm going to be showing
these pictures and somebody's going to
say that's my great-grandfather you
hijacked for your novel but I love him
so that the pictures really meant a lot
to me in terms of understanding the
characters even the the cop sisters have
an older brother Francis who's always
urging them to move in with him because
can't very well have unmarried female
relations just out living by themselves
wasn't done in 1915 and Francis had a
wife named Bessie Bessie is very young
in the book but the family gave me this
picture of her when she was much older
and I just loved it she reminds me of my
own grandmother a little bit and I got
it I even got a better sense of what
kind of woman she was just from being
able to look at one picture of her I
thought she I thought this was kind of a
great great image I never did get to see
a picture of Henry Kaufman but even this
even this directory listing gave me an
idea I knew he was in business with his
brother but I didn't see another Kaufman
on here and I thought maybe was his
brother-in-law maybe it's his sister in
his sister's husband so in the book
you'll read about Marion garfinkel who's
his sister who's fed up with him he's a
drunk he's a bad seed he's always been
trouble from the day he was born he's
just spinning his dad's money making a
mess of the factory making a mess of his
life riding around in his fast car with
his group of thuggish friends he's he's
just nothing but trouble and she's had
it with him so that all came out of that
now let me just kind of wrap up by
saying a little bit about the history of
the place because I've written six books
of nonfiction
I'm a crazy researcher and I can spend
months researching something that's only
barely going to make it into a book but
in this case I knew that the history of
Patterson at the time would really
inform the story so here's what it
looked like total factory town very kind
of dirty and polluted and also somewhat
corrupt the police the judges the courts
everybody was in the pockets of this
what they called the soap man the silica
the soap factory owners this is what a
silk die shop would have looked like so
I don't know if this is Henry Kaufman
shop but the scenes that I wrote inside
the factory were based entirely off of
this photograph in 1913 right before my
book begins the Patterson silk strikes
erupted because factory owners demanded
that workers work longer hours for the
same pay and that they operate for looms
at a time rather than two and the
workers were no idiots they realized
that their employers were going to be
much wealthier much more profitable but
they weren't going to get to share in
the profits I realize that this has no
resonance today and probably can't
connect with anything happening in the
news right now but that is how it was
100 years ago tens of thousands of
workers went out on strike and this was
a huge moment in the history of the
American labor movement so a lot of
famous people were there Elizabeth
Gurley Flynn early suffragist and labor
activist was there organizing Margaret
Sanger another suffragist and an early
advocate for birth control and a labor
organizer she was there and Jack Reed so
if you saw the movie Reds you remember
Warren Beatty's character Jack Reed he
spent most of the time in jail but he
wrote some amazing dispatches from the
Patterson jail that talked about what
the strikes were like now one thing that
happened during these strikes that went
on for six months the workers couldn't
afford to feed their children and the
Union set up relief tents so the workers
could come give food every day but the
tents were always running out of food so
the
we're starving so the Union organized
for the children to be sent into New
York City to live with families who were
sympathetic to the cause and willing to
take in some kids for a few months so
here they are with little notes pinned
onto their coats with their names going
off to just live with complete strangers
can you imagine having to do this today
to send your kids off to live with total
strangers because you can't afford to
feed them so that's what happened here
they are being rounded up in a truck
that looks like it's meant to haul
horses around going off to New York and
one little just sort of footnote to the
story is that some of these kids didn't
come back and you can see how this could
happen in those days you know a kid who
was 10 or 12 years old was able to go
get a job go work in new york city and
people moved around a lot it was very
common for kids to sort of just get
dropped off somewhere so some of those
kids for whatever reason never came back
and that gave me an idea to create a
fictional character named Lucy Blake who
works in Henry Kaufman's factory gets
caught up in the events of the Patterson
children's evacuation and Constance runs
literally runs into her in the factory
and and they end up getting caught up in
each other's situation so that's sort of
where that came from yeah Alou and Alou
means I'm the star i dub you w is the
Industrial Workers of the world at the
time they were called the Wobblies and
they were a bunch of Bolsheviks that
this was very much you know these were
Radical labor organizers and with World
War one coming there was a lot of fear
and mistrust of these communists
socialists Bolshevik whatever you want
to call them union organizers the IWW
had the idea that there should only be
one union all over the world and that
all workers should belong to it so if
the plumbers went out on strike the
electrician's would go out with them as
would the writers as would the waiters
everybody ya know fascinating really a
fascinating time for American politics
now
so I had this big story I had this crime
and in some ways it's a novel about a
crime but for me it was really a novel
about this family you know these three
women three sisters living by themselves
and I just wondered you know what has
kept them together all these years what
might ultimately tear them apart how are
they going to make their way in the
world as women who aren't interested in
marriage but really have very few
avenues open to them and this car
accident literally changed the course of
their lives and sent them off in an
entirely new direction I got so sucked
into their story and so attached to them
I've never been able to stop the
research I have thousands and thousands
of new not thousands hundreds and
hundreds of newspaper articles about
them and thousands of other little bits
of related information I have this giant
Evernote you know collection of stuff
about them and with any luck I'll get to
write several more books and tell their
story because it's a fascinating story
most of it's true and what happens next
for them is kind of even more amazing
than what happened in in this book so
the next books just about finished it'll
be out a year from now it'll be out in
September of next year and you know the
thing for me is oh and and the pigeons
sorry i forgot about pigeons um the
thing for me is you know at when I
stumbled into this story I at the time I
had a pretty successful career writing
nonfiction and I was really enjoying
myself I'd always wanted to write
fiction and there are several failed
novels and drawers that you know nobody
will ever read but um I these women
started mean so much to me they started
to see him like my my own
great-grandmother you know someone who I
didn't personally know but who I thought
about and wondered about a lot and what
I realized is that they'd been
completely forgotten about no one's
written a thing about them there's no
book there's not a pamphlet at the
Historical Society there's not a
Wikipedia page there's nothing about
them anywhere and i thought you know I'm
the one who found
them like anybody could have found them
but I'm the one who did and I I thought
a lot of the books I've written even the
drunken botanist which is a totally fun
book that I loved working on but you
know it's a book about the plants that
get turned into booze someone was going
to write that book that's that's that's
a cool idea that's out there in the
culture nobody else is going to do this
I don't know that anyone else could have
dug up exactly the things I dug up and
connected with the same people and made
the same discoveries so I really felt
called in a very big way to do it and I
was 45 when I started working on it or
about 45 and and and and I think that's
the age where you start looking around
and going you know if there's something
really important you want to do in your
life now would be a great time to get
started I've got lots of energy I've got
you know lots of ideas don't put it off
another 10 years so I'm glad that I
stuck it out their story continues to
mean a lot to me it's been great fun
being on tour getting to connect with
people who have something to contribute
usually when I finish writing a book
it's over and done with so if someone
raises their hand and has an idea i'm
like well thanks a lot where were you
two years ago right i can do nothing
with that now you that does not help me
but because this is an ongoing project
for me it's been great fun a few nights
ago I was in Brooklyn and talking
someone had a question about sheriff
Heath I've never been able to track down
his family so I said you know one thing
I hope is with all the media attention
with this book maybe some family members
will start to come out of the woodwork
and I can finally track down the people
i couldn't find and that night I got
home and I had an email from somebody
who met sheriff Heath when he was young
and his best friends with his two
grandsons and put me right in touch with
his great-grandsons so suddenly I have
someone I can talk to about one of my
characters who's going to be a very big
deal in the next book so it's been just
an amazing thing to keep opening up this
story and to have it keep growing and
then for me to be able to go home and do
something with all of that rather than
wish I'd known about it two years ago
that's been terrific um well thank you
all so much for
for letting me come I want to tell you
we'll take questions in a minute but in
case I forget I want to mention I
brought you something I have temporary
tattoos if you want one um these have
been super fun I before I left on tour I
I gave one I put him on my my parents
I've got one right there so I I put him
right there on their arms my folks are
kind of in their early 70s and and
they've never put on a temporary tattoo
before so i thought they're like wow it
looks so cool oh it looks with they were
so into it and then and then my dad said
he said okay you're gonna need to leave
a couple more of these for me because
i'm gonna put these on a part of your
mother's body that you don't want to
know about and I'm like oh okay I'm good
I'm out goodbye thank you for that image
so if you can manage to put them on a
part of your body that's photograph a
bowl there's like a little hashtag
contest thing on the back you could do
if you want to you could win a book you
don't have to um I know can you believe
that does anybody have a question or a
comment oh wow around the time a lot of
famous people in that area are you going
to today ever like I don't know in the
future might you have them come across
whether it's on William Carlos Williams
or Albert Einstein I mean yeah so um I
don't know if I'm gonna be able to
sustain this but for the first and
second book there are these Easter Egg
characters you know my thought about it
was that although they're famous now
they weren't famous in the same way when
they were just living their lives being
who they were want to you mr. doctor
yeah you know right yeah so for instance
Elizabeth Carly Flynn and Margaret
Sanger are very briefly name checked in
in girl waits with gun but not in a way
that if you're not like into them it
might get right past you and there is
something similar to that in in book 2
that you can watch out for so yeah if I
can keep it up i'm going to i like the
way i like the idea of dropping them in
in a really casual way and see
who picks up on it yes they kind of had
a question about threat I was like oh
and let me say real quick though I'm
going to stop you right there because I
just remembered and I've learned that I
need to make an announcement before i
start questions which is there's a
family secret at the heart of the book
and not everyone's read the book and so
I have to warn people not to ask
questions that might be a spoiler I
found this out the hard way in Boston I
almost got eggs thrown at me people want
to know how I found out the family
secret and I can tell you that but we
have to do it not in front of people who
already haven't read the book anyway I'm
sorry I didn't mean interrupt you it was
like that was just in my head go ahead
okay then I'm glad I did that you can
ask me later what else yeah oh go ahead
yeah so did any family members then get
interested in their own genealogy after
you started yes so what happened is I
down uh the cop sisters had an older
brother Francis Francis had kids I
tracked down Francis's grandson through
ancestry because he had started a family
tree but hadn't gotten very far so I was
able to give them their complete
genealogy because I thrown some
resources at it I not only geeked out on
ancestry and got that piece done but
then I hired a genealogist to go get all
the things that you had to go someplace
physically to get so I had not just the
names but the marriage licenses of like
they're great great grandparents and
traced them all the way back to Austria
and all of that stuff so that was cool I
mean it was cool for them to get all
that stuff and it was incredibly cool
for me to hear just the family stories
that got passed down and then I also met
florets son so Fleurette being the
youngest and she had kids a little later
in life her son is now in his 80s and
living in New Jersey it took a long time
to find him but I finally did and he not
only had amazing stories to tell about
his mother but he also remembers his
aunt Norma from when he was a little boy
and she was in
an old woman and she lived with them for
a little while so everything I know
about Norma's personality comes from him
and again it's the weirdest thing in the
world to know that there is a human
being right now alive on the planet who
can answer questions about my characters
it's such a bizarre thing and there's
only one I don't think there's anyone
else who knew them like like he knows
them and so I've been to see him you
know a few times and and we talked and
stay in touch and I send him stuff any
time I turn anything up with his
mother's name in it or pictures or
whatever I of course send him right off
to him yeah you know this spoiler um
there is yes so it's hard for me yeah
well we'll talk about it later sure yes
yeah so now everyone's lives are sort of
documented whether it's photorec you
know in social media whatever all this
stuff would be trivial to find is this
sort of the last group you know of
people where it takes such effort to get
the information and find it I mean isn't
that going to change things or I
actually questioned how easy it will be
to do this a hundred years ago I mean a
hundred years from now about you and I I
question whether you know something like
Facebook is going to be so carefully
archived that what I post today is going
to be findable 100 years from now does
that exist it just seems like it could
be it could be what's interesting is
that paper is remarkably durable and for
instance I as an author's I'm married to
a rare book dealer and he brokers famous
people's papers to University Archives
sometimes I don't have a single piece of
paper correspondence with any publisher
I've ever worked with I got email and I
I did go to the trouble and it was kind
of ocean I shouldn't say how hard this
was to do i'm at microsoft right now
anyway i I did I did try to get all of
my emails as PDFs so that I could save
them when i migrated from one type of
email to another and it was surprisingly
hard to do it took a long time
I'm not everyone's going to do it so
those that correspondence if it's
interesting to somebody 100 years from
now is only going to exist if I hold on
to that PDF and either manage to print
it or someone after my death thinks to
get into my mozi account and get my
stuff out of there I think it's actually
easier for stuff to get lost I think
having my newspapers are surprisingly
durable microfilm gets kept I i really i
really wonder about that and letters i
think the fact that we're not writing
letters is very interesting i'm going to
be writing about world war one pretty
soon with these women and a lot of what
we know from world war one is because
they wrote letters home and today are
our servicemen and women overseas are
skyping and text messaging and emailing
with their families and i don't know if
we're going to have that same real-time
living document of what life is like in
war that we had when people were writing
letters and those letters were saved and
cherished and treasured i don't know
it's an interesting question y'all fix
this solve work that out yes just your
knowledge that she was one of the first
deputy sheriff's that was female do you
have any information about others oh yes
I've gotten way off into the history of
women in law enforcement so here's the
here's the test the test is did she have
a badge a gun handcuffs and arrest
Authority in other words was she able to
chase a man down the street and put
handcuffs on him and place him under
arrest because there were a lot of women
working in law enforcement at the time
who were kind of like social workers
they were there to deal with the women
and children who came into the law
enforcement system which was very
necessary and very important and
sometimes dangerous work but their job
duties were not the equivalent of a male
constants which you'll see in the next
book it's only hinted at here but it's
coming soon did have the equivalent job
duties of a man which is very unusual so
there are a few women who lay claim to
being America's first police woman when
you look at it you realize they were
really a police matron which meant more
like social worker or even a
stenographer and office person something
else so I'm gathering up new
paper clippings of other women who were
deputy sheriff's or police officers at
the time to see did they have arrested
ority very rarely do you see anything in
1915 about a woman arresting a man
that's not an event that happens very
much so she was pretty remarkable but I
will not say that she was absolutely the
first even going back into the late
1800s when a lot of cities didn't really
even have such a thing as a police force
or sheriff only barely was sort of just
barely even existed you'll see women
sometimes they were the widow of the
sheriff or the widow of the police chief
they get involved somehow but our roles
were not yet solidified and and and as
you probably know even as late as the
60s and 70s women police officers didn't
have full parity in terms of their
duties yeah yes it's about the character
of mrs. Heath hmm um in reading the book
it seemed like of all the characters who
were so well developed and you have an
opinion and you understand the context
which represented the story that as a
reader I found her to be a little bit
mysterious like as somebody who's
reading this I had just draw my own
inferences as to why she reacted the way
she did in certain scenes I was just
wondering if you had any anything to
fill out about her and your vision of
what role she played in the book yeah
what do you think well I thanks of
course to remember you know I mean I was
guessing that probably it was trying to
explain you know how in some when you
have a couple and one person is really
involved in social justice issues and
takes time away from the relationship
for the household that it was sort of
like that maybe she was just tired that
her husband was working so hard all the
time and she had to live in this stupid
jail it right yeah see I thought she was
jealous that he was spending so much
time with constant and I was gonna raise
my hand and ask a question of did you
think there was a potential budding
romance there and if so are you are you
nervous about writing about that for
fear of offending the children if it's
not an actual fact of what happened yeah
oh I love oh yeah Wow
okay no this is all these are very
interesting questions in real life on
Constance's side of the family there's
debate over whether she and Heath ever
had a thing some people say yes some
people say no to my surprise a lot of
the reader response I've gotten has been
I'm so glad there's not a romance in
this like screw romance why can't they
why can't they do something other than
get boyfriends like you know like this
passes the Bechdel test and I'm like yay
so I kind of love it that people have
that response um and Cordelia Heath the
wife isn't is an interesting character
to me and I deliberately gave her a very
small role I mean she does have a very
small role in the first book we only
barely see her like once or twice um I
think my thinking on it is that first of
all what is sucked to live at the jail I
mean you saw that picture right there's
no playground for the kids there it was
bleak it was bleak and awful it was in
an industrial corner of town it would
have just been a crappy crappy life hard
to raise kids there she did not have the
option of getting a job and going and
doing something interesting she had to
be a wife and a mother and not that that
isn't interesting but she didn't have a
choice it wasn't a choice it was a thing
that she had to do and heath as much as
he's this great progressive guy he that
does not really extend to the role of
his wife he expects the sheriff's wife
to kind of toe the line and I think that
would have been very true of progressive
men of that time and it's still somewhat
true of progressive men today I mean we
still have a situation where as much lip
service as we pay to equal everything at
home women end up doing more than men do
so you know I think they have a
difficult marriage I think that Cordelia
is worried about a lot of what's going
on it think it's tough to be a cop's
wife there's no reason for her to like
constants why would she so part of it
too is there's this there's so many
women in this book and and I really sort
of had to go through and count and go
are there are there even enough men like
doing anything and and and do I have
enough men who are good characters like
they all seem to be kind of bad it's all
like good women and bad
man that's kind of so I thought well it
would be nice to have a woman who
doesn't like constants you know would be
nice to have at least one woman who
isn't like go get him girl so she's kind
of that person but she does have a much
bigger role in book two and so it's been
very interesting to hear what readers
think because I've got three weeks at
home where I can still tinker with this
before it's out of my hands and somebody
the other night said you know she's an
unhappy wife and unhappy wives are very
complicated and he was speaking from
experience and I thought how that's
interesting yet unhappy wife that is a
hard person to write so yeah I'm working
on Cordelia what else anything else yeah
is there evidence from your research
that led you to believe that they
weren't interested in marriage or was it
just simply the fact that they weren't
married oh there's plenty of evidence
constants the wonderful thing about
doing this research is that sometimes
I'd be wondering about something and I'd
go home in that night I would turn up a
newspaper interview with Constance where
she answers that very question so she
said out loud in her own words that she
doesn't want to she doesn't want to be
married and have kids and in those days
there was only one kind of getting
married for women there was the kind
where you quit your job and if you had
one and and you stayed home and did the
did the domestic thing so she's
definitely set out loud that she didn't
want to when I asked Fleurette son why
Norma never got married he just laughed
he just said no one would marry Norma no
one could hardly anyone could stand to
be in the same room with Norma that was
out of the question so yeah that's the
deal with them I mean Fleurette you know
she's kind of she's the young pretty one
she wants to go out and do different
things with her life and she's keenly
interested in boys she just doesn't have
much access to him yet so more more to
come there did you have a curious about
the you know fictionalization of it and
in terms of when you've now been
learning things as you go along and
especially maybe after you leave
the book there was anything you sort of
look back thing I didn't really get that
right oh well the fictionalization my
goal was there's a lot of gaps in the
historical record there's months the
past where I don't know what happened I
don't know why people did what they did
necessarily I don't know what they
talked about at home so I everything
that really happened is in the book and
I filled in the gaps with fiction so
that's how I did it and as for anything
I got wrong there are a few things that
I more or less got deliberately wrong in
that it was making me crazy trying to
make the story conform to a few things
so geography is a little weird if you
live there you're going to be a little
puzzled by how they kind of get from
point A to point B sometimes I was
living in Austin when the movie slacker
came out and it cracked me up to watch
people walk out of a movie theater I
knew right where that movie theater was
and in the film they'd walk out and
they'd go around the corner and they'd
be halfway across town and I was like oh
of course movies must do that all the
time it's just I know this town really
well so there are some things like that
transportation I pretty much decided
that I mean I understand how
transportation more or less worked there
were a lot of streetcars there were a
lot of trolleys I new horses and buggies
automobiles I knew what the roads were
made of and how the cars were tearing up
the roads I mean you want to talk about
disruptive technology like they had to
find a completely new way to build roads
and they weren't sure like as this car
thing even going to stick around because
we're gonna have to rebuild all our
roads I knew all of that but when
Constance needed to get on a train there
was just a train I didn't get so sucked
in 20 on Sunday the train timetables
didn't blah blah blah I didn't do that
the other place where I was deliberately
kind of sloppy was a courtroom procedure
there's very little that happens in a
courtroom it's not a courtroom drama if
anything the courtroom stuff is almost
for comic effect or for some other
purpose other than the outcome and I
just decided to write those scenes the
way they came to me at one of my events
in new jersey at bergen county judge
came to the event and he was keenly
interested in the inner workings of all
these real people who were his
predecessors there in bergen county and
and he bought a big stack for all the
judge
and prosecutors and I said all right
listen I got to tell you something I
thought on what you think I don't know
better I do know better I just decided I
was going to write these scenes the way
I wanted to write him and not worry too
much about procedure but you know judges
I mean look at law and order they're so
used to being misrepresented on screen
that it was nothing to him he's like
that I don't even worry about it it's
fine but those make it he wants to he
wants to swap Bergen County history with
me so those buzz made change in future
books yeah kind of building up the
baby's question there was an article
that had the girls swimming and fainting
and as they read it with you know kind
of curled lip is that was that your
character take on them or is that
something that you found out was
actually true about them oh that had
them fainting yeah right there's um one
of the one of the newspaper articles
about one of the nights when they were
under attack had I think constants
feigning and that's a real newspaper
article and I just thought it was absurd
I thought she's not gonna faint look at
her what I just seemed like the
stupidest thing I've ever read and by
then I'd already figured out that
newspapers of that era were highly
inaccurate they made up so much stuff
they made up quotes wholesale and the
reason I know that is that i can compare
ten different articles about the same
event and put that together with what
else I knew and I can see the lies and
distortions so yeah newspapers back then
had a lot of fun but no fainting please
right well it is true now but the
interesting thing back then is that the
media was very overtly and deliberately
partisan so the Hackensack Republican
was the Republican newspaper and they
were completely one hundred percent
partisan from page one to you know page
36 which was hilarious and so much fun
to read yeah it was great they hated
share a few anything else oh yeah Martha
Jones the sisters relationship with
their mother and her
mr. trustfulness or did you event that
or did was there evidence yeah well the
sisters relationship with their mothers
so in real life the mother was actually
still alive she didn't die until for
another four or five years I killed her
off early because for women under one
roof just seemed like too much for me to
handle I was like I'm sorry mrs. Cobb
but we're just going to put you in an
early grave and move on so we only know
about her in flashbacks she really was
from Austria she really did come to this
country after the revolutions of 1848
that swept across Europe you know when
you think about revolutions you think
about the victors but there's always
winners and losers and in this case the
Jews got to move out of the ghettos and
live wherever they wanted to live a lot
of people who had been sort of kept down
suddenly had a place in the world and
there were a lot of middle and upper
class people who didn't like that and
wanted to get out and so Constance asst
family her ancestors came as part of
this wave of educated middle-class
people who didn't like the new changes
in Europe and ended up in Brooklyn as so
many people did they were anti-semitic I
know this in real life and mrs. cops
mistrust of strangers and just generally
wanting to keep her daughter's kind of
hidden is fiction but you know she came
to this country when she was 16 and
Brooklyn must have just looked like a
very strange place to a teenage girl who
was used to living sort of a privileged
life in Austria and suddenly they're
immigrants and this happens to so many
you know immigrants moving to this
country right at home you were an
engineer or a doctor or whatever and
then and you find yourself running a
restaurant or driving a taxicab here and
it's very strange so I was also drawing
on my own German grandmother who was
very mistrustful of strangers and
suspicious of everyone so she was sort
of a composite of a few people I knew in
real life and some just guesses i made
about what somebody in that situation
might have been like all right well
thank you all so much
is fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
